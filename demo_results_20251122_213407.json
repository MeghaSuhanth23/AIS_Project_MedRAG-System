        "abstract": "Accumulating data suggest that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in younger people (aged <40 years), referred to as young-onset T2DM, has a more rapid deterioration of \u03b2-cell function than is seen in later-onset T2DM. Furthermore, individuals with young-onset T2DM seem to have a higher risk of complications than those with type 1 diabetes mellitus. As the number of younger adults with T2DM increases, young-onset T2DM is predicted to become a more frequent feature of the broader diabetes mellitus population in both developing and developed nations, particularly in certain ethnicities. However, the magnitude of excess risk of premature death and incident complications remains incompletely understood; likewise, the potential reasons for this excess risk are unclear. Here, we review the evidence pertaining to young-onset T2DM and its current and future burden of disease in terms of incidence and prevalence in both developed and developing nations. In addition, we highlight the associations of young-onset T2DM with premature mortality and morbidity.",

Improvements in the average life expectancy of people with T1DM have also contributed to the growing number of older people living with this disease. We summarize the evidence regarding the epidemiology (incidence, prevalence and excess mortality) of T1DM in older adults (ages \u226560 years) as well as the genetics, immunology and diagnostic challenges. Several studies report an incidence peak of T1DM in older adults of a similar size to or exceeding that in children, and population prevalence generally increases with increasing age. Glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody positivity is frequently observed in adult-onset T1DM. Guidelines for differentiating T1DM from type 2 diabetes mellitus in older adults recommend measuring levels of C-peptide and autoantibodies, including glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies. However, there is no gold standard for differentiating T1DM from type 2 diabetes mellitus in people aged 60 years and over. As such, the global variation observed in T1DM epidemiology might be in part explained by misclassification, which increases with increasing age of diabetes mellitus onset. With a growing global population of older adults with T1DM, improved genetic and immunological evidence is needed to differentiate diabetes mellitus type at older ages so that a clear epidemiological picture can emerge.",

Since its discovery, insulin (a molecule of only 51 amino acids) has been the subject of pharmaceutical research and development that has paved the way for other protein-based therapies. From purified animal-extracted insulin and human insulin produced by genetically modified organisms to a spectrum of insulin analogues, pharmaceutical laboratories have strived to tailor the preparations to the needs of patients. Nonetheless, overall glycaemic control often remains poor as exogenous insulin is still not able to mimic the physiological insulin profile. Circumventing subcutaneous administration and the design of analogues with profiles that mimic that of physiological insulin are ongoing areas of research. Novel concepts, such as once-weekly insulins or glucose-dependent and oral insulins, are on the horizon but their real-world effectiveness still needs to be proven. Until a true cure for type 1 diabetes mellitus is found and the therapeutic arsenal for other forms of diabetes mellitus is expanded, insulin will remain central in the treatment of many people living with diabetes mellitus.",

Macrovascular complications of T2DM include coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias and sudden death, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral artery disease. Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death in diabetic patients. Many clinical studies have shown a connection between T2DM and vascular disease, but almost always other risk factors are present in diabetic patients, such as hypertension, obesity and dyslipidaemia.

        "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is globally considered one of the most common chronic diseases, management of which is critically asscociated with an adequate dietary approach. With overweight and obesity being a global epidemic, choosing the appropriate weight loss plan for patients with diabetes seems to be of particular concern for healthcare professionals. Since diabetes and cardiovascular diseases frequently coexist, modern pharmacological therapeutic models aim at addressing both. Therapeutic targets in diabetic population that address glycemic control, adequate lipid and blood pressure control proves to limit the incidence of cardiovascular events, reduce the risk of chronic complications and improve patients quality of life. Similarly, dietary managment in this population should also concentrate on the reduction of reversible cardiovascular risk factors. Nutritional recommendations for diabetic patients should be individualized to meet their expectations and lifestyle in order to ensure compliance and long-term effects. As diabetic population is more vulnerable to further health risks associated with diet induced metabolic changes, inadequate intake of dietary components and increased cardiovascular risk, nutrition plans should be addressed more carefully in this group.",

Despite being acknowledged in a few cardiology guidelines, these imaging methods are still underestimated by practitioners. Nevertheless, noninvasive diagnostic tools are of increasing potential and should be implemented whenever possible. We discuss the usefulness of particular techniques in the management of patients with obstructive and nonobstructive coronary artery disease, including assessment of myocardial perfusion, contractility, viability, and detection of unstable atherosclerotic plaques. Radioisotope imaging can also be valuable in the diagnostic workup of infective endocarditis, as well as cardiac sarcoidosis and amyloidosis.

Although the evidence-based recommendations and statements are quite similar, there are some important differences between the ESC and CCS guidelines for AF. Herein, we compared the current recommendations and highlighted the differences from the most recent guidelines for AF. Key Messages: Specifically, key differences can be observed in methods evaluating the recommendations; classifications and the definitions; the symptom score used to guide management decisions, longitudinal patient assessment, and structured characterization; the stroke risk stratification algorithm used to determine indications for oral anticoagulation therapy; the role of acetylsalicylic acid in stroke prevention in AF; the antithrombotic regimens that are employed in the setting of chronic coronary syndromes, acute coronary syndromes, and percutaneous coronary intervention; the target heart rate for rate control; and the algorithms for integrated or holistic management of AF. Differences are observed, particularly when the quality of evidence is moderate or low. More research and randomized controlled studies on major gaps identified in current guidelines will further clarify and modify our future management strategies in AF.",

The presentation of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) can vary especially in patients with T2DM where concomitant presence of other glomerular/tubular pathologies and severe peripheral vascular disease can become important confounders. All-cause mortality in individuals with DKD is approximately 30 times higher than that in diabetic patients without nephropathy and a great majority of patients with DKD will die from cardiovascular disease before they reach ESRD.

Atorvastatin has a pleiotropic effect as anti-inflammatory through one of the target levels of High Mobility Group Box-1 (HMGB-1). This prospective observational study aimed to analyze the effect of atorvastatin on serum HMGB-1 levels in CAD. Samples were collected from prospective observation pre-post study in May-July 2018 with consecutive sampling method. Serum HMGB-1 levels were measured in patients with CAD who were given atorvastatin for CAD with type-2 diabetes mellitus compared without type-2 diabetes mellitus in a patient ward. Blood was collected on admission day and before the patient left the hospital. After centrifugation, serum samples were stored at\u00a0-80\u00a0\u00b0C before measurement. We used an ELISA kit (IBL International) to determine HMGB-1 concentrations. This research protocol has been approved by the Ethical Committee of Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, Surabaya. We enrolled 38 patients and divided them into two groups which 19 patients on CAD with type-2 diabetes mellitus and 19 patients without diabetes mellitus. Serum HMGB-1 levels in CAD with type-2 diabetes mellitus were increased significantly (p = 0.049) and not significantly decreased in CAD without type-2 diabetes mellitus (p = 0.480). The HMGB-1 level was not significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.210). HMGB-1 levels after providing atorvastatin in CAD with type-2 diabetes mellitus increased significantly, meanwhile, in CAD without type-2 diabetes mellitus did not decrease significantly. The HMGB-1 level was not significantly different between the two groups. Longer time and more point for the collected sample needed for further research.",

Herein, we have reviewed the two-way interactions between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus. We have performed an extensive literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till April 25, 2020, with the following keywords: \"COVID-19\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"diabetes\", \"diabetes mellitus\", \"SARS\", \"infection\" and \"management of diabetes mellitus\" with interposition of the Boolean operator \"AND\". Compromised innate immunity, pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu, reduced expression of ACE2 and use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists in people with diabetes mellitus contribute to poor prognosis in COVID-19. On the contrary, direct \u03b2-cell damage, cytokine-induced insulin resistance, hypokalemia and drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 (like corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir) can contribute to worsening of glucose control in people with diabetes mellitus. The two-way interaction between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus sets up a vicious cycle wherein COVID-19 leads to worsening of dysglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in turn, exacerbates the severity of COVID-19. Thus, it is imperative that people with diabetes mellitus take all necessary precautions and ensure good glycemic control amid the ongoing pandemic.",

        "abstract": "The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an airborne infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 relies on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor for cellular entry and the abundance of this receptor in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may help explain the GI manifestations, including dysgeusia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, present in over 40% of infected patients. GI tract involvement also raises the concern for oral-fecal transmission which is poorly understood. Outcome studies in COVID-19 patients with preexisting liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease show predominantly mild transaminase elevations and no increased risk from the use of biological agents in inflammatory bowel disease patients. High-dose corticosteroids, however, should be avoided. As endoscopic procedures are aerosol-generating, modifications to clinical practice is necessary to minimize the spread of COVID-19.

Symptoms such as a cough, dyspnea, and fever are common to a large number of inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic it is essential to limit the use of hospital services and inappropriate diagnostic techniques. A particular radiological pattern can orient the clinical and laboratory scenario and guide the diagnostic workup. A 58-year-old woman was admitted to our COVID-19 unit for suspected coronavirus infection. She was complaining of worsening dyspnea, tachycardia, and low grade fever. A chest X-ray showed diffuse, alveolar, and interstitial lung involvement with micronodules tending to coalescence. This radiographic pattern known as \"galaxy sign\", consistent with diffuse, coalescing nodular miliary pulmonary involvement, simulating a non-specific alveolar opacification of the lungs is typical of a few pneumological differential diagnoses, represented by sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis, and metastatic lesions, and virtually excludes an interstitial viral pneumonitis.

Among viral pathogens, coronaviruses have been described to play a role. This study aims to investigate the role of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination on exacerbation reduction in patients with COPD. Patients diagnosed with COPD prior to the study date were considered the study population. Exacerbations of COPD before and after the COVID-19 vaccination were recorded. Patients with influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccination were excluded from the study due to their known role in reducing exacerbations of COPD. The study included 152 patients with a mean age of 67.5 \u00b1 9.7 years. Most patients were classified under Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages 2 and 3. In fully vaccinated patients, COPD exacerbation was observed to be higher than in those without full vaccination (70.5% vs. 55.3%, respectively). Total risk status and vaccination status, however, were seen to be in a positive correlation, with higher risk and complete vaccination status presenting with a higher count of COPD exacerbation. Although it is known that the administration of COVID-19 vaccines in patients in risk groups reduces the risk of disease, there is no study showing a positive effect on COPD exacerbations alone. In our study, it was observed that only the COVID-19 vaccine was ineffective in attacks without influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.",

Antibiotics are commonly used in the management of respiratory disorders. With excellent tissue penetration, prolonged tissue persistence, and favorable side effect profile, macrolides are one of the best treatment options being recommended for respiratory, urogenital, dermal, and other bacterial infections. Still, there is a lack of clinical trial data on the use of macrolides in the management of respiratory chronic disease, and hence, there is a need for clinical guidance on their use in Indian setting. A systematic review of the literature was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar. Existing guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs, landmark studies, and key-cited articles were selected. Recommendations were based on available evidence and expert panel's logical empiricism and consensus.

For directly transmitted infections, pathogen transmission relies on human-to-human contact, with kinship, household, and societal structures shaping contact patterns that in turn determine epidemic dynamics. Social, economic, and cultural forces also shape patterns of exposure, health-seeking behaviour, infection outcomes, the likelihood of diagnosis and reporting of cases, and the uptake of interventions. Although these social aspects of epidemiology are hard to quantify and have limited the generalizability of modelling frameworks in a policy context, new sources of data on relevant aspects of human behaviour are increasingly available. Researchers have begun to embrace data from mobile devices and other technologies as useful proxies for behavioural drivers of disease transmission, but there is much work to be done to measure and validate these approaches, particularly for policy-making. Here we discuss how integrating local knowledge in the design of model frameworks and the interpretation of new data streams offers the possibility of policy-relevant models for public health decision-making as well as the development of robust, generalizable theories about human behaviour in relation to infectious diseases.",

They can cause amyloid deposits in the lungs. In rare cases, lung nodules can be the first sign of this disorder. We present the case of an 89-year-old woman with stable shortness of breath and lung nodules on imaging. A positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan showed the most intense hypermetabolic nodule in the patient's lung, which was 1.5 \u00d7 1.4 cm. A biopsy of this nodule showed amyloid material with trapped plasma cell infiltrate on microscopy. Congo red stain under polarizing microscopy showed apple-green birefringence, which is diagnostic for amyloidosis. Immunohistochemistry showed a mixture of kappa-positive and lambda-positive cells. B-cell gene rearrangement-clonal gene rearrangements were detected in the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene and the kappa light chain (IGK). These findings suggest a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, such as a plasmacytoma or a marginal cell lymphoma with plasma cell differentiation. The patient was diagnosed with a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder and pulmonary amyloidosis. Isolated amyloidosis in the lungs usually has a good prognosis, but it can be a sign of autoimmune diseases or B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, as in this case.

The hallmark basal ganglia abnormalities appear as hyperdensities in CT brain and hyperintensities in MRI brain, which could mislead the clinician towards an erroneous diagnosis of cerebral haemorrhage. It is classically described in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and its occurrence in type 1 diabetes is extremely rare. This case report entails the clinical details of a young man in his 20s with type 1 diabetes mellitus who had uncontrolled blood glucose levels and presented with a recent onset of abnormal movements in his left upper and lower limbs. The semiology, biochemistry and radiological investigation findings and treatment are detailed. A clear understanding of the condition could lead to an early diagnosis, spare the patient unnecessary investigations and improve treatment outcomes.",

We found that 38.3% of DM patients had dry eyes, a prevalence that was higher than controls (p = 0.02). At univariate analysis, they were found to be more common in older individuals (p = 0.001) with type 2 diabetes (p = 0.001) and in those using metformin (p = 0.001). A multivariate linear regression showed that metformin use was the only independent variable associated with dry eyes.

Although many of the positions taken remain valid, there have been significant changes in the management and treatment of MS, both due to the approval of new drugs with different action mechanisms and due to the evolution of previously fixed concepts. This has enabled new approaches to specific situations such as pregnancy and vaccination, and the inclusion of new variables in clinical decision-making, such as the early use of high-efficacy disease-modifying therapies (DMT), consideration of the patient's perspective, and the use of such novel technologies as remote monitoring. In the light of these changes, this updated consensus statement, developed according to the Delphi method, seeks to reflect the new paradigm in the management of patients with MS, based on the available scientific evidence and the clinical expertise of the participants. The most significant recommendations are that immunomodulatory DMT be started in patients with radiologically isolated syndrome with persistent radiological activity, that patient perspectives be considered, and that the term \"lines of therapy\" no longer be used in the classification of DMTs (> 90% consensus). Following diagnosis of MS, the first DMT should be selected according to the presence/absence of factors of poor prognosis (whether epidemiological, clinical, radiological, or biomarkers) for the occurrence of new relapses or progression of disability; high-efficacy DMTs may be considered from disease onset.",

The statements and recommendations are based on both the results of randomized controlled trials and data from cross-sectional and prospective real-life studies to ensure they are as close as possible to the context of daily clinical practice and the current health care system of the Czech Republic. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable heterogeneous syndrome with a number of pulmonary and extrapulmonary clinical features and concomitant chronic diseases. The disease is associated with significant mortality, morbidity and reduced quality of life. The main characteristics include persistent respiratory symptoms and only partially reversible airflow obstruction developing due to an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles and gases. Oxidative stress, protease-antiprotease imbalance and increased numbers of pro-inflammatory cells (mainly neutrophils) are the main drivers of primarily non-infectious inflammation in COPD. Besides smoking, household air pollution, occupational exposure, low birth weight, frequent respiratory infections during childhood and also genetic factors are important risk factors of COPD development. Progressive airflow limitation and airway remodelling leads to air trapping, static and dynamic hyperinflation, gas exchange abnormalities and decreased exercise capacity. Various features of the disease are expressed unequally in individual patients, resulting in various types of disease presentation, emerging as the \"clinical phenotypes\" (for specific clinical characteristics) and \"treatable traits\" (for treatable characteristics) concept. The estimated prevalence of COPD in Czechia is around 6.7% with 3,200-3,500 deaths reported annually. The elementary requirements for diagnosis of COPD are spirometric confirmation of post-bronchodilator airflow obstruction (post-BD FEV<sub>1</sub>/VCmax <70%) and respiratory symptoms assessement (dyspnoea, exercise limitation, cough and/or sputum production. In order to establish definite COPD diagnosis, a five-step evaluation should be performed, including: 1/ inhalation risk assessment, 2/ symptoms evaluation, 3/ lung function tests, 4/ laboratory tests and 5/ imaging. At the same time, all alternative diagnoses should be excluded. For disease classification, this position paper uses both GOLD stages (1 to 4), GOLD groups (A to D) and evaluation of clinical phenotype(s). Prognosis assessment should be done in each patient. For this purpose, we recommend the use of the BODE or the CADOT index. Six elementary clinical phenotypes are recognized, including chronic bronchitis, frequent exacerbator, emphysematous, asthma/COPD overlap (ACO), bronchiectases with COPD overlap (BCO) and pulmonary cachexia. In our concept, all of these clinical phenotypes are also considered independent treatable traits. For each treatable trait, specific pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies are defined in this document. The coincidence of two or more clinical phenotypes (i.e., treatable traits) may occur in a single individual, giving the opportunity of fully individualized, phenotype-specific treatment. Treatment of COPD should reflect the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease and be tailored to individual patients. Major goals of COPD treatment are symptom reduction and decreased exacerbation risk. Treatment strategy is divided into five strata: risk elimination, basic treatment, phenotype-specific treatment, treatment of respiratory failure and palliative care, and treatment of comorbidities. Risk elimination includes interventions against tobacco smoking and environmental/occupational exposures. Basic treatment is based on bronchodilator therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, vaccination, care for appropriate nutrition, inhalation training, education and psychosocial support. Adequate phenotype-specific treatment varies phenotype by phenotype, including more than ten different pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies. If more than one clinical phenotype is present, treatment strategy should follow the expression of each phenotypic label separately. In such patients, multicomponental therapeutic regimens are needed, resulting in fully individualized care. In the future, stronger measures against smoking, improvements in occupational and environmental health, early diagnosis strategies, as well as biomarker identification for patients responsive to specific treatments are warranted. New classes of treatment (inhaled PDE3/4 inhibitors, single molecule dual bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory drugs, gene editing molecules or new bronchoscopic procedures) are expected to enter the clinical practice in a very few years.",

The study included 100 patients who had been diagnosed with AECOPD. Pearson's coefficient correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship between various parameters. The vast majority of patients belonged to group 3 (diagnosed at the time of admission as having type 2 diabetes). Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) had a significant positive correlation with body mass index, cholesterol, and total leukocyte count but a negative correlation with oxygen saturation.

In this digest version, we provide a general overview of these two symptoms and discuss the management of acute (up to three weeks) and prolonged/chronic cough (longer than three weeks). Flowcharts are provided, along with a step-by-step explanation of their diagnosis and management. Most cases of acute cough are due to an infection. In chronic respiratory illness, a cough could be a symptom of a respiratory infection such as pulmonary tuberculosis, malignancy such as a pulmonary tumor, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, drug-induced lung injury, heart failure, nasal sinus disease, sinobronchial syndrome, eosinophilic sinusitis, cough variant asthma (CVA), atopic cough, chronic laryngeal allergy, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and post-infectious cough. Antibiotics should not be prescribed for over-peak cough but can be considered for atypical infections. The exploration of a single/major cause is recommended for persistent/chronic cough. When sputum is present, a sputum smear/culture (general bacteria, mycobacteria), cytology, cell differentiation, chest computed tomography (CT), and sinus X-ray or CT should be performed. There are two types of rhinosinusitis. Conventional sinusitis and eosinophilic rhinosinusitis present primarily with neutrophilic inflammation and eosinophilic inflammation, respectively. The most common causes of dry cough include CVA, atopic cough/laryngeal allergy (chronic), GER, and post-infectious cough. In the last chapter, future challenges and perspectives are discussed. We hope that the clarification of the pathology of cough hypersensitivity syndrome will lead to further development of \"pathology-specific non-specific therapeutic drugs\" and provide benefits to patients with chronic refractory cough.",

        "abstract": "Childhood asthma is a complex heterogenous inflammatory disease that can pose a large burden on patients and their caregivers. There is a strong need to adapt asthma treatment to the individual patient taking into account underlying inflammatory profiles, moving from a 'one size fits all' approach toward a much-needed personalized approach. This review article aims to provide an overview of recent advances in the management and treatment of pediatric asthma, including novel insights on the molecular heterogeneity of childhood asthma, the emergence of biologicals to treat severe asthma, and innovative e-health and home monitoring techniques to make asthma management more convenient and accessible. Molecular technologies have provided new treatment leads. E-health and home monitoring technologies have helped to gain more insights into disease dynamics and improve adherence to treatment while bringing health care to the patient. However, uncontrolled childhood asthma is still a major unmet clinical need and precision-medicine approaches are still scarce in clinical practice. Advanced omics methods may help researchers or clinicians to more accurately phenotype and treat subtypes of childhood asthma and gain more insight into the complexity of the disease.",

It is linked to a worsening cough, dyspnea, and a worse quality of life. Around 3 million persons worldwide suffer from IPF, and the prevalence rises sharply with advancing age. The detection of the UIP pattern, generally using high-resolution CT; lung biopsy may be necessary in certain individuals; the diagnostic approach also includes the elimination of other interstitial lung illnesses or overlapping problems. The UIP pattern is mostly bilateral, peripheral, and basal, with clusters of subpleural cystic airspaces and reticular alterations linked to traction bronchiectasis. Although there are still many uncertainties about how to define susceptibility, it is believed that the molecular mechanisms causing IPF reflect an abnormal reparative response to repeated alveolar epithelial damage in an aging genetically sensitive individual. With the availability of two pharmacotherapeutic drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, that slow physiological advancement and potentially increase progression-free survival, significant progress has been made in our knowledge of the clinical treatment of IPF. The goal of current research is to develop early biomarkers for IPF that may include circulating variables, demographic information, and imaging data.",

Progression of IPF is reflected by a decline in lung function, worsening of dyspnea and exercise capacity, and deterioration in health-related quality of life. In the short term, the course of disease for an individual patient is impossible to predict. A period of relative stability in forced vital capacity (FVC) does not mean that FVC will remain stable in the near future. Frequent monitoring using multiple assessments, not limited to pulmonary function tests, is important to evaluate disease progression in individual patients and ensure that patients are offered appropriate care. Optimal management of IPF requires a multidimensional approach, including both pharmacological therapy to slow decline in lung function and supportive care to preserve patients' quality of life.",

Spirometric tests, respiratory muscle strength (MIP and MEP), and the 6-Minute Walk Test (6-MWT) were assessed. The III National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to evaluate respiratory symptoms in patients with SUD and cigarette smokers. 86.3% of the SUD patients included in the study were using heroin, 9.2% were cannabis, and 5.5% were spice.

However, the precise mechanisms of smoking susceptibility associated with hyperhomocysteinemia has not been fully elucidated. This study included 7- to 9-week-old C57BL6 male mice induced with hyperhomocysteinemia and were exposed to cigarette smoke (CS). A549 cells (human alveolar epithelial cell line) were cultured with homocysteine and were exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) to observe cell viability and expression of proteins related to the ER stress. After 6\u00a0months of CS exposure, pulmonary emphysema was more severely induced in the group under the condition of hyperhomocysteinemia compared to that in the control group. The apoptotic A549 cells increased as homocysteine concentration increased and that was enhanced by CSE. Protein expression levels of ER stress markers were significantly increased after simultaneous stimulation. Notably, vitamin B12 and folate supplementation improved ER stress after simultaneous stimulation of A549 cells. In this study, we showed that hyperhomocysteinemia exacerbates CS exposure-induced emphysema in mice, suggesting that hyperhomocysteinemia and CS stimulation enhance ER stress and subsequent induced apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells. It was suggested that there is a synergistic effect between homocysteine and CS.",

        "abstract": "Age-related lung function decline is associated with small airway closure and gas trapping. The mechanisms which cause these changes are not fully understood. It has been suggested that COPD is caused by accelerated ageing. We have investigated pathological changes in the small airways during ageing, and evaluated whether the same or different processes exist in COPD. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry were used to examine small airway remodelling in healthy ageing, and then compare to age matched COPD patients. Ageing was associated with reduced alveolar attachment numbers (rho= -0.4 p\u2009=\u20090.049), increased epithelial area (rho\u2009=\u20090.5 p\u2009=\u20090.01), greater luminal narrowing due to epithelial expansion (rho\u2009=\u20090.5 p\u2009=\u20090.04) and increased alveolar septal neutrophils (rho\u2009=\u20090.6 p\u2009=\u20090.005). Compared to age matched controls, COPD small airways had 31% less alveolar attachments per airway (p\u2009=\u20090.02) and significantly more alveoalr septal neutrophils (p\u2009=\u20090.0007). Increased airway wall thickness was a feature of COPD but was not related to ageing in non-smokers. Alveolar attachment loss, accompanied by alveolar septum neutrophilic inflammation, and increased luminal narrowing due to epithelial expansion are major features of small airway remodelling during ageing. These features can explain the increased small airway narrowing and closure during ageing. Alveolar attachment loss is accelerated in COPD, likely due to increased neutrophilic inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Onco-cardiology is an emerging field linking cancer with cardiovascular injury. Understanding the mechanism of cardiac injury helps improve the quality of life of cancer survivors. A series of studies on adverse reactions to cancer or oncological treatments has indicated that adverse cardiovascular events related to cancer treatments may occur over a longer period of survival, and even years after therapy has concluded. Current cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, have been found to have latent cardiovascular toxicity. These toxic effects are often progressive and irreversible and ultimately lead to cardiovascular events such as heart failure, hypertension, coronary heart diseases, arrhythmia, and thromboembolism. Therefore, more emphasis should be placed on revealing the mechanism of cancer treatment-related cardiovascular toxicity. This would help to guide prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of CVDs in cancer survivors.",

        "abstract": "Progress in the treatment of cancer has significantly improved survival of oncologic patients in recent decades. However, anticancer therapies, particularly some new, more potent and targeted agents, are potentially cardiotoxic. As a consequence, cardiovascular complications, including heart failure, arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, venous thromboembolism, peripheral vascular disease, arrhythmias, pericardial disease, and pulmonary hypertension, as related to cancer itself or to anticancer treatments, are increasingly observed and may adversely affect prognosis in oncologic patients. Cardiovascular oncology is an emerging field in cardiology and internal medicine, which is rapidly growing, dealing with the prevention, the early detection, and the management of cardiovascular disease, in all stages of anticancer therapy and during the survivorship period, now crucial for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. In this narrative review, the existing literature regarding the epidemiology of cardiovascular oncology, the mechanisms of cardiovascular complications in cancer, and the pathophysiology of cardiotoxicity related to chemotherapeutic agents, targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and radiotherapy will be analyzed and summarized.",

Population-based nationwide screening programs are of significant help in increasing the early detection and survival rates of NSCLC in China. The understanding of molecular carcinogenesis and the identification of oncogenic drivers dramatically facilitate the development of targeted therapy for NSCLC, thus prolonging survival in patients with positive drivers. In the exploration of immune escape mechanisms, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor monotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy have become a standard of care for advanced NSCLC in China.

Adjuvant immunotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy will be approved for resectable NSCLC.

A nationally representative sample of 45- to 85-year-old cancer survivors (<i>n</i> = 6288) in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging were compared with individuals without cancer (<i>n</i> = 44,051). The most prevalent risk factors in cancer survivors were all self-reported or easily measured in clinic: overweight or obesity (68.0%), former smoking (62.9%), fewer than 5 daily servings of fruits and vegetables (59.8%), hypertension (43.7%), and high waist circumference (47.0%). After adjustment for sex and education, the odds ratios of several cv risk factors varied by age in cancer survivors and the non-cancer controls. At ages 50 and 60, cancer survivors have increased odds of overweight or obesity, former smoking, hypertension, high waist circumference and truncal fat, diabetes, lung disease, and heart rate greater than 80 bpm compared with non-cancer controls. At age 70, odds did not differ for many risk factors; at age 80, no differences were evident. Without modification by age, low physical activity was more prevalent in cancer survivors (odds ratio: 1.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.17 to 1.39). There were no differences in the odds of cv risk factors measured by specialized equipment, including electrocardiography, carotid ultrasonography, spirometry, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The odds of several easy-to-assess cv disease risk factors are higher among middle-aged, but not older, cancer survivors relative to the general Canadian population.

Except for COPD, chronic bronchitis and infectious pneumonia, the number of publications in the last 5 years for the other diseases is limited. For traditional occupational lung diseases such as silicosis and asbestosis, there are old as well as novel sources of exposure and their burden continues to be relevant, especially in developing countries. Occupational exposure remains an important risk factor for airways and interstitial lung diseases, causing occupational lung diseases and contributing substantially in the aetiology of common respiratory diseases.

The objective of the study was to assess the impact of the American Society of Clinical Oncology Choosing Wisely guidelines on inappropriate staging imaging among early-stage breast cancers. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program-Medicare data set was used to identify 50,004 women age 66 years and older with new incident diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer (stage 0 through stage 2a; T < 4, N = 0, and M = 0). The primary outcome was the incidence of patients with inappropriate imaging following an early-stage breast cancer diagnosis. The primary outcome was identified within 6 months of the first diagnosis. An interrupted time series analysis using negative binomial regression was performed for outpatient claims for these diagnostic studies versus the two interruptions of guidelines release and guidelines reinforcement. Mean images per patient, percent change for the study period, and rate of change per year were calculated. Imaging rates fell by a modest 2.32% following guidelines release in April 2012 (point estimate = -2.32%; 95% CI, -6.34% to 1.88%). By contrast, imaging rates fell by a four-fold larger amount (point estimate = -9.36%; 95% CI, -13.20% to -5.35%) following guidelines published reminders in journals (or reinforcement) in October 2013. Mean imaging studies per patient (95% CI) declined from 1.80 (1.76 to 1.84) in January 2012 to 1.50 (1.48 to 1.53) by January 2015, representing a 16% decline in imaging overuse in 2015 compared with 3 years earlier. The rate of change (95% CI) in images per patient was initially small at -0.47% (-4.27% to 3.33%) per year between April 2012 and October 2013, but almost eight times faster at -3.70% (-5.81% to -1.60%) per year after October 2013. This analysis demonstrates a substantial decrease in the prevalence of imaging overuse in early-stage breast cancers correlating with the 2013 reinforcement of American Society of Clinical Oncology's 2012 Choosing Wisely guidelines.

Mitigation of this risk can be achieved via surveillance or prophylactic mastectomy with or without breast reconstruction. Those that choose surgery expect to reduce their chance of developing cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of patients developing breast cancer prior to surgery and to identify modifiable contributing factors within the patient journey. This is a historical cohort study of all BRCA mutation carriers identified through the British Columbia Cancer Hereditary Cancer Program between 2000 and 2012. Patients were divided into two groups: surveillance (S) and prophylactic mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction (PM/IBR). The incidence of cancer, time to PM/IBR and patient journeys were analyzed. A total of 333 women were identified. The time to surgery from mutation disclosure was a median of 31 (5.3, 75.7) months. During this period, 6% of patients developed breast cancer compared with a 14% incidence of breast cancer in patients choosing surveillance. The majority of time to surgery was attributed to the period between mutation disclosure and the decision to proceed with surgery. Strategies to facilitate decision-making as well as wait list prioritization and dedicated operative time should be targeted to this population to decrease the number of women developing an interval cancer prior to surgery.",

While CKD encompasses a broad spectrum of pathological processes and diverse etiologies, the classification of kidney disease is currently based on clinical findings or histopathological categorizations. This descriptive classification is agnostic towards the underlying disease mechanisms and has limited progress towards the ability to predict disease prognosis and treatment responses. To gain better insight into the complex and heterogeneous disease pathophysiology of CKD, a systems biology approach can be transformative. Rather than examining one factor or pathway at a time, as in the reductionist approach, with this strategy a broad spectrum of information is integrated, including comprehensive multi-omics data, clinical phenotypic information, and clinicopathological parameters. In recent years, rapid advances in mathematical, statistical, computational, and artificial intelligence methods enable the mapping of diverse big data sets. This holistic approach aims to identify the molecular basis of CKD subtypes as well as individual determinants of disease manifestation in a given patient.

The subspecialty of transplant nephrology, however, faces structural challenges related to its workforce, reporting structures, compensation, research and innovation, and health care information technology. The position of transplant nephrology at the academic and operational intersection of medicine and surgery may limit its access to critical resources, hinder academic promotion, and contribute to physician burnout.

Despite the introduction of novel treatments that allow us to reduce the risk of future outcomes, a striking residual cardiorenal risk has been reported. This risk is explained by both the heterogeneity of DKD and the individual variability in response to nephroprotective treatments. Strategies that have been proposed to improve DKD patient care are to develop novel biomarkers that classify with greater accuracy patients with respect to their future risk (prognostic) and biomarkers that are able to predict the response to nephroprotective treatment (predictive). In this review, we summarize the principal prognostic biomarkers of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and the novel markers that help clinicians to individualize treatments and the basis of the characteristics that predict an optimal response.",

The diagnosis of IBD was made based on clinical, laboratory, endoscopic, and histological data obtained. Eight patients presented with features consistent with IBD. Six had ulcerative colitis while 2 had Crohn's disease. Seven patients had moderate disease with the main clinical features being recurrent mucoid bloody diarrhoea. All the patients had treatments with either sulphasalazine or mesalazine as well as azathioprine, steroids and antibiotics with variable response. One patient had strictures requiring a colostomy, while another developed colorectal cancer as complications of IBD. Although IBD is uncommon in Nigeria, a high index of suspicion is important, especially in patients presenting with the recurrent passage of mucoid bloody stools.

        "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) related symptoms are a major cause of parental concern and referrals at all ages. These guidelines have been framed to inform pediatricians regarding current diagnosis and management of gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). A group of experts from the pediatric gastroenterology sub-specialty chapter of Indian Academy of Pediatrics (ISPGHAN) discussed various issues relating to the subject online on 25 October, 2020. A consensus was reached on most aspects and a writing committee was constituted. This committee had three meetings for a detailed discussion. The statement was sent to the entire group and their approval obtained. To formulate a consensus statement to enable proper diagnosis and management of GERD in children. GER is physiological in most infants and it improves as age advances. The pathological form, called GERD causes distressing symptoms that affect daily activities and may result in complications. The presentation would vary from regurgitation to severe symptoms due to esophageal or respiratory tract disease. In older children, esophagitis is the commonest manifestation of GERD. A careful history and clinical examination are adequate to make a diagnosis in most patients, but judicious investigations are necessary in a few. Upper gastro intestinal tract endoscopy may be required in those with esophageal manifestations, dysphagia and hematemesis. In children with extra-esophageal symptoms, MII-pH monitoring and scintigraphy are necessary. Empirical treatment with a Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has not been proven useful in infants, but a four-week trial is recommended in older children without complications. While positioning and feed thickening have limited benefit in infants, life-style modifications are important in older children.",

In spite of the lack of understanding of the specific cause-effect relationship between COPD and GERD, GERD has been shown to be a significant predictor of acute exacerbations of COPD. In this study, we examined the evolution of the relationship between COPD and GERD over the past decades and provided valuable insights into this topic. The Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) was searched since its inception until 19 August 2022 to obtain publications related to COPD and GERD. The data was analyzed in Microsoft Excel (version 2021), HisCite (version 2.1), Scimago Graphica (version 1.0.23), VOSviewer (1.6.17), and CiteSpace (version 5.8.R3). We extracted 545 documents from the WoSCC database. Since 2002, there have been rapid increases in publications. Among countries and institutions, the United States and the University of Manchester were most prolific. The most cited journal was Chest, while Respiratory Medicine had the most publications. Among 2870 related authors, Hasenfuss, Gerd, Lange, Peter, and Martinez, Gerd were the top 3 contributing authors in this field. Aside from \"gastroesophageal reflux disease\" and \"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\", the terms \"quality of life\", \"cough\", and \"inflammation\" were frequently occurred in the title and abstract of articles. Keywords co-occurrence overlay visualization indicated that \"refractory chronic cough\" was hot topics in recent years. Research on COPD and GERD has flourished, and its content topics have become more in-depth over time. In the future, this hot topic deserves more attention.",

The World Health Organisation named the disease caused by the virus 'coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)'. It was declared a pandemic in early 2020, after the disease rapidly spread across the world. COVID-19 has not only resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality but also significantly impacted healthcare service provision and training across all medical specialties with gastroenterology and Hepatology services being no exception. Internationally, most, if not all 'non-urgent' services have been placed on hold during surges of infections. As a result there have been delayed diagnoses, procedures, and surgeries which will undoubtedly result in increased morbidity and mortality. Outpatient services have been converted to remote consultations where possible in many countries. Trainees have been redeployed to help care for COVID-19 patients in other settings, resulting in disruption to their training - particularly endoscopy and outpatient clinics. This has led to significant anxiety amongst trainees, and risks prolongation of training. It is of the utmost importance to develop strategies that continue to support COVID-19-related service provision, whilst also supporting existing and future gastroenterology and Hepatology services and training. Changes to healthcare provision during the pandemic have generated new and improved frameworks of service and training delivery, which can be adopted in the post-COVID-19 world, leading to enhanced patient care.",

Gastroenterologists commonly care for patients with this disease. The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide practical and evidence-based advice for management of diverticulitis. We reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies to develop 14 best practices. In brief, computed tomography is often necessary to make a diagnosis. Rarely, a colon malignancy is misdiagnosed as diverticulitis. Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course. In patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy. Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively rather than routinely in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Antibiotic treatment is strongly advised in immunocompromised patients. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients should consume a high-quality diet, have a normal body mass index, be physically active, not smoke, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use except aspirin prescribed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. At the same time, patients should understand that genetic factors also contribute to diverticulitis risk. Patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest with the first presentation. An elective segmental resection should not be advised based on the number of episodes. Instead, a discussion of elective segmental resection should be personalized to consider severity of disease, patient preferences and values, as well as risks and benefits.",

        "abstract": "The incidence and prevalence of Crohn's disease (CD) is rising globally. Patients with moderate to severe CD are at high risk for needing surgery and hospitalization and for developing disease-related complications, corticosteroid dependence, and serious infections. Optimal management of outpatients with moderate to severe luminal and/or fistulizing (including perianal) CD often requires the use of immunomodulator (thiopurines, methotrexate) and/or biologic therapies, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 antagonists, vedolizumab, or ustekinumab, either as monotherapy or in combination (with immunomodulators) to mitigate these risks. Decisions about optimal drug therapy in moderate to severe CD are complex, with limited guidance on comparative efficacy and safety of different treatments, leading to considerable practice variability. Since the last iteration of these guidelines published in 2013, significant advances have been made in the field, including the regulatory approval of 2 new biologic agents, vedolizumab and ustekinumab. Therefore, the American Gastroenterological Association prioritized updating clinical guidelines on this topic. To inform the clinical guidelines, this technical review was completed in accordance with the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. The review addressed the following focused questions (in adult outpatients with moderate to severe luminal CD): overall and comparative efficacy of different medications for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with or without prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 antagonists, comparative efficacy and safety of biologic monotherapy vs combination therapy with immunomodulators, comparative efficacy of a top-down (upfront use of biologics and/or immunomodulator therapy) vs step-up treatment strategy (acceleration to biologic and/or immunomodulator therapy only after failure of mesalamine), and the role of corticosteroids and mesalamine for induction and/or maintenance of remission. Finally, in adult outpatients with moderate to severe fistulizing CD, this review addressed the efficacy of pharmacologic interventions for achieving fistula and the role of adjunctive antibiotics without clear evidence of active infection.",
