        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the practicing gastroenterologist in several ways. Although majority of COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms are also seen. COVID-19 has also disrupted gastrointestinal endoscopy services in numerous ways. There are also concerns regarding the impact of these changes on gastrointestinal cancer screening and management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the implications of COVID-19 for the practicing gastroenterologist. COVID-19 patients can have gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain and anorexia. Separate from the management of COVID-19 patients, there has been a reduction in endoscopy volume worldwide. This has also resulted in reduction/cessation of in-person clinic visits and an increasing use of telemedicine services. In addition, patients with certain chronic diseases like chronic liver disease or inflammatory bowel disease may have worse outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gastroenterologists need to rapidly adapt to the challenges being faced and need to make both systems and practice-based changes to the endoscopy unit and outpatient clinic practices. Gastroenterologists should stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving literature regarding gastrointestinal symptoms in COVID-19 patients as well as its impact on chronic gastrointestinal illnesses.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus is complicated and bidirectional. On the one hand, diabetes mellitus is considered one of the most important risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19. Several factors that are often present in diabetes mellitus are likely to contribute to this risk, such as older age, a proinflammatory and hypercoagulable state, hyperglycemia and underlying comorbidities (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and obesity). On the other hand, a severe COVID-19 infection, and its treatment with steroids, can have a specific negative impact on diabetes itself, leading to worsening of hyperglycemia through increased insulin resistance and reduced \u03b2-cell secretory function. Worsening hyperglycemia can, in turn, adversely affect the course of COVID-19. Although more knowledge gradually surfaces as the pandemic progresses, challenges in understanding the interrelationship between COVID-19 and diabetes remain.",

GI tract involvement also raises the concern for oral-fecal transmission which is poorly understood. Outcome studies in COVID-19 patients with preexisting liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease show predominantly mild transaminase elevations and no increased risk from the use of biological agents in inflammatory bowel disease patients. High-dose corticosteroids, however, should be avoided. As endoscopic procedures are aerosol-generating, modifications to clinical practice is necessary to minimize the spread of COVID-19.

        "abstract": "To update the recommendations of the Spanish Society of Neurology on primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with arterial hypertension. We proposed several questions to identify practical issues for the management of blood pressure (BP) in stroke prevention, analysing the objectives of blood pressure control, which drugs are most appropriate in primary prevention, when antihypertensive treatment should be started after a stroke, what levels we should aim to achieve, and which drugs are most appropriate in secondary stroke prevention. We conducted a systematic review of the PubMed database and analysed the main clinical trials to address these questions and establish a series of recommendations. In primary stroke prevention, antihypertensive treatment should be started in patients with BP levels\u202f>\u202f 140/90\u202fmmHg, with a target BP of < 130/80\u202fmmHg. In secondary stroke prevention, we recommend starting antihypertensive treatment after the acute phase (first 24\u202fhours), with a target BP of < 130/80\u202fmmHg. The use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists or diuretics alone or in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is preferable.",

To date, there are over 15,000 registered website users from over 140 countries on Heart University, with over 2,000 training modules and/or recorded educational videos. Heart University has developed an \"asynchronous\" educational lecture series entitled \"Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Care in Resource-Limited Settings.\" This recorded lecture series is specifically focused on topics relevant to practicing paediatric and/or congenital cardiac care in low-resource settings.A relatively new initiative, \"Cardiology Across Continents,\" supplements the existing educational resources for providers of paediatric and/or congenital cardiac care in low-income countries and lower-middle-income countries by providing an additional live, interactive, case-based forum. Sessions occur every 1-2 months and focus on challenging cases from diagnostic or management perspective with a view to promote collaboration between partnered institutions. \"Cardiology Across Continents\" is an expanding initiative that facilitates learning and collaboration between clinicians across varied practice settings via interactive case discussions. We welcome trainees and providers of paediatric and congenital cardiac care to join the sessions and invite any insight that can enhance learning for clinicians around the world. This manuscript describes \"Cardiology Across Continents\" and discusses the development, history, current status, and future plans of Heart University.",

The reference list of each article was searched to look for additional articles, and all relevant articles were included in the article. Newer technologies are now available such navigation platforms to diagnose and possibly treat peripheral pulmonary nodules, endobronchial ultrasound in diagnosis of mediastinal and hilar adenopathy as well as cryobiopsy in the diagnosis of diffuse lung diseases. In addition, flexible and rigid bronchoscopy continues to provide new and expanding ability to manage patients with benign and malignant central airway obstruction. Interventions are also available for diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and emphysema that were traditionally treated with medical management alone.

Multivariate analysis after psm revealed that the independent prognostic factors for gasc were TNM stage [hazard ratio (hr): 1.512; <i>p</i> = 0.021] and regional nodes examined (hr: 0.588; <i>p</i> = 0.02). In patients with advanced disease, no significant difference in survival between gasc and gac was observed (<i>p</i> = 0.212), although survival was significantly poorer for gasc after psm (<i>p</i> = 0.019).

A target BP of <140/90 mm Hg is recommended for patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and BP should be controlled to <130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes mellitus who have high-risk clinical features. We hope that this review will be helpful to clinicians and patients by promoting the understanding and appropriate application of BP control in the comprehensive management of patients with diabetes mellitus.",

        "abstract": "To update the recommendations of the Spanish Society of Neurology on primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with arterial hypertension. We proposed several questions to identify practical issues for the management of blood pressure (BP) in stroke prevention, analysing the objectives of blood pressure control, which drugs are most appropriate in primary prevention, when antihypertensive treatment should be started after a stroke, what levels we should aim to achieve, and which drugs are most appropriate in secondary stroke prevention. We conducted a systematic review of the PubMed database and analysed the main clinical trials to address these questions and establish a series of recommendations. In primary stroke prevention, antihypertensive treatment should be started in patients with BP levels\u202f>\u202f 140/90\u202fmmHg, with a target BP of < 130/80\u202fmmHg. In secondary stroke prevention, we recommend starting antihypertensive treatment after the acute phase (first 24\u202fhours), with a target BP of < 130/80\u202fmmHg. The use of angiotensin-II receptor antagonists or diuretics alone or in combination with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is preferable.",

        "abstract": "Herein, we provide a review of the recent literature on the epidemiological and pathophysiological relationship between hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus, along with prognostic implications and current treatment concepts. Diabetes mellitus affects \u223c10% of US adults. The prevalence of HTN in adults with diabetes mellitus was 76.3% or 66.0% based on the definitions used by guidelines. There exist differences among major society guidelines regarding the definition of HTN and target blood pressure (BP) levels. Recent basic and clinical research studies have shed light on pathophysiologic and genetic links between HTN and diabetes mellitus. Randomized controlled trials over the past 5 years have confirmed the favorable BP and cardiovascular risk reduction by antidiabetic agents. HTN and diabetes mellitus are 'silent killers' with rising global prevalence. The development of HTN and diabetes mellitus tracks each other over time. The coexistence of both clinical entities synergistically contributes to micro- and macro-vasculopathy along with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Various shared mechanisms underlie the pathophysiological relationship between HTN and diabetes mellitus. Moreover, BP reduction with lifestyle interventions and antihypertensive agents is a primary target for reducing cardiovascular risk among patients with HTN and diabetes mellitus.",

A review of literature was performed using PubMed database to identify all articles published up till October 2020 relevant to the field of interventional pulmonology and bronchoscopy. The reference list of each article was searched to look for additional articles, and all relevant articles were included in the article. Newer technologies are now available such navigation platforms to diagnose and possibly treat peripheral pulmonary nodules, endobronchial ultrasound in diagnosis of mediastinal and hilar adenopathy as well as cryobiopsy in the diagnosis of diffuse lung diseases. In addition, flexible and rigid bronchoscopy continues to provide new and expanding ability to manage patients with benign and malignant central airway obstruction. Interventions are also available for diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and emphysema that were traditionally treated with medical management alone. With continued high quality research and an increasing body of evidence, interventional bronchoscopy has enormous potential to provide both safe and effective options for patients with a variety of lung diseases.",

        "abstract": "The prevalence of diabetes mellitus continues to increase worldwide, and it is a well-established cardiovascular risk factor. Hypertension is also an important cardiovascular risk factor to be controlled and is common among patients with diabetes mellitus. Optimal blood pressure (BP) goals have been the subject of great debate in the management of hypertension among patients with diabetes mellitus. This review provides detailed results from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of clinical outcomes according to the target BP in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, the target BP in patients with diabetes mellitus recommended by different guidelines was summarized and presented. A target BP of <140/90 mm Hg is recommended for patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and BP should be controlled to <130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes mellitus who have high-risk clinical features. We hope that this review will be helpful to clinicians and patients by promoting the understanding and appropriate application of BP control in the comprehensive management of patients with diabetes mellitus.",

Diabetes mellitus affects \u223c10% of US adults. The prevalence of HTN in adults with diabetes mellitus was 76.3% or 66.0% based on the definitions used by guidelines. There exist differences among major society guidelines regarding the definition of HTN and target blood pressure (BP) levels. Recent basic and clinical research studies have shed light on pathophysiologic and genetic links between HTN and diabetes mellitus. Randomized controlled trials over the past 5 years have confirmed the favorable BP and cardiovascular risk reduction by antidiabetic agents. HTN and diabetes mellitus are 'silent killers' with rising global prevalence. The development of HTN and diabetes mellitus tracks each other over time. The coexistence of both clinical entities synergistically contributes to micro- and macro-vasculopathy along with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Various shared mechanisms underlie the pathophysiological relationship between HTN and diabetes mellitus. Moreover, BP reduction with lifestyle interventions and antihypertensive agents is a primary target for reducing cardiovascular risk among patients with HTN and diabetes mellitus.",

The adverse effect profile of tacrolimus is yet to be completely understood. The relationship between the blood level of tacrolimus and development of posttransplant diabetes mellitus has not been clearly elucidated in Indian populations. We conducted this study to investigate the frequency of posttransplant diabetes mellitus and other adverse effects of tacrolimus, to enumerate the risk factors associated with posttransplant diabetes mellitus development, and to correlate the blood levels of tacrolimus with its occurrence. This prospective observational study included 77 renal transplant patients receiving tacrolimus. The blood sugar levels (fasting and postprandial) were monitored, and patients were asked regularly about the adverse effects of tacrolimus experienced by them for 6 months posttransplant. Trough levels of tacrolimus in blood were correlated with occurrence of posttransplant diabetes mellitus. Posttransplant diabetes mellitus developed in 62.3% (48/77) of renal transplant recipients on a tacrolimus-based regimen. Other adverse effects observed included tremors, diarrhea, alopecia, cyto- megalovirus infection, headache, biopsy-proven calci- neurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and BK virus infection. Higher tacrolimus trough level at month 1 posttransplant was significantly associated with the development of posttransplant diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio = 1.379; 95% CI, 1.02-1.86). The best cutoff of tacrolimus trough level at month 1 posttransplant to reduce the risk of posttransplant diabetes mellitus was 8.1 ng/mL. There was a 5 times increased risk of developing posttransplant diabetes mellitus when tacrolimus trough level at month 1 posttransplant was >8.1 ng/mL (adjusted odds ratio = 5.4; 95% CI, 1.4-19.9). Posttransplant diabetes mellitus is a common adverse effect of tacrolimus among renal transplant recipients. A trough level >8.1 ng/mL at month 1 posttransplant was an important predictor for posttransplant diabetes mellitus.",

Dyslipidaemia is common in patients with CKD and it is characterized by a highly atherogenic profile with relatively low levels of HDL-cholesterol and high levels of triglyceride and oxidized LDL-cholesterol. Overall, current literature indicates that lowering LDL-cholesterol is beneficial for preventing major atherosclerotic events in patients with CKD and in kidney transplant recipients while the evidence is less clear in patients on dialysis. Lipid lowering treatment is recommended in all patients with stage 3 CKD or worse, independently of baseline LDL-cholesterol levels.
