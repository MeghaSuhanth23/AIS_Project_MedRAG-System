37827183,Pragmatic solutions to reduce the global burden of stroke: a World Stroke Organization-Lancet Neurology Commission.,"Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide. The burden of disability after a stroke is also large, and is increasing at a faster pace in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Alarmingly, the incidence of stroke is increasing in young and middle-aged people (ie, age <55 years) globally. Should these trends continue, Sustainable Development Goal 3.4 (reducing the burden of stroke as part of the general target to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases by a third by 2030) will not be met. In this Commission, we forecast the burden of stroke from 2020 to 2050. We project that stroke mortality will increase by 50%—from 6·6 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 6·0 million–7·1 million) in 2020, to 9·7 million (8·0 million–11·6 million) in 2050—with <b>disability-adjusted life-years</b> (DALYs) growing over the same period from 144·8 million (133·9 million–156·9 million) in 2020, to 189·3 million (161·8 million–224·9 million) in 2050. These projections prompted us to do a situational analysis across the four pillars of the stroke quadrangle: surveillance, prevention, acute care, and rehabilitation. We have also identified the barriers to, and facilitators for, the achievement of these four pillars. DISABILITY-ADJUSTED LIFE-YEARS (DALYS): The sum of the years of life lost as a result of premature mortality from a disease and the years lived with a disability associated with prevalent cases of the disease in a population. One DALY represents the loss of the equivalent of one year of full health On the basis of our assessment, we have identified and prioritised several recommendations. For each of the four pillars (surveillance, prevention, acute care, and rehabilitation), we propose pragmatic solutions for the implementation of evidence-based interventions to reduce the global burden of stroke. The estimated direct (ie, treatment and rehabilitation) and indirect (considering productivity loss) costs of stroke globally are in excess of US$891 billion annually. The pragmatic solutions we put forwards for urgent implementation should help to mitigate these losses, reduce the global burden of stroke, and contribute to achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3.4, the WHO Intersectoral Global Action Plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders (2022–2031), and the WHO Global Action Plan for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. Reduction of the global burden of stroke, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, by implementing primary and secondary stroke prevention strategies and evidence-based acute care and rehabilitation services is urgently required. Measures to facilitate this goal include: the establishment of a framework to monitor and assess the burden of stroke (and its risk factors) and stroke services at a national level; the implementation of integrated population-level and individual-level prevention strategies for people at any increased risk of cerebrovascular disease, with emphasis on early detection and control of hypertension; planning and delivery of acute stroke care services, including the establishment of stroke units with access to reperfusion therapies for ischaemic stroke and workforce training and capacity building (and monitoring of quality indicators for these services nationally, regionally, and globally); the promotion of interdisciplinary stroke care services, training for caregivers, and capacity building for community health workers and other health-care providers working in stroke rehabilitation; and the creation of a stroke advocacy and implementation ecosystem that includes all relevant communities, organisations, and stakeholders.",The Lancet.

34524968,Ethical Considerations in Dementia Diagnosis and Care: AAN Position Statement.,"Alzheimer disease and other dementias present unique practical challenges for patients, their families, clinicians, and health systems. These challenges reflect not only the growing public health effect of dementia in an aging global population, but also more specific ethical complexities including early loss of patients' capacity to make decisions regarding their own care, the stigma often associated with a dementia diagnosis, the difficulty of balancing concern for patients' welfare with respect for patients' remaining independence, and the effect on the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of family caregivers. Caring for patients with dementia requires respecting patient autonomy while acknowledging progressively diminishing decisional capacity and continuing to provide care in accordance with other core ethical principles (beneficence, justice, and nonmaleficence). Whereas these ethical principles remain unchanged, neurologists must reconsider how to apply them given changes across multiple domains including our understanding of disease, clinical and legal tools for addressing manifestations of illness, our expanding awareness of the crucial role of family caregivers in providing care and maintaining patient quality of life, and societal conceptions of dementia and individuals' personal expectations for aging. This revision to the American Academy of Neurology's 1996 position statement summarizes ethical considerations that often arise in caring for patients with dementia; although it addresses how such considerations influence patient management, it is not a clinical practice guideline.",Neurology,2021-Jul,"Chiong W, Tsou AY, Simmons Z, Bonnie RJ, Russell JA",5,1628,neurology,2025-11-22
33856477,Bibliometric Analysis of Neurology Articles Published in General Medicine Journals.,"A significant portion of neurology literature is published in general medicine journals. Despite this, a detailed examination of publication patterns of neurology articles in these journals has not yet been carried out. To examine the publication patterns of neurology articles in general medicine journals during a 10-year period using a bibliometric approach. This cross-sectional bibliometric analysis identified the top 5 general medicine journals using the 2017 Journal Citations Report. Four other medical subspecialties (ie, immunology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, and pulmonology) were selected for comparison of publication patterns with neurology. Using MEDLINE, the 5 journals were searched for articles published between 2009 and 2018 that were indexed with the following MeSH terms: nervous system diseases, immune system diseases, endocrine system diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, and respiratory tract diseases. Data analysis was conducted from February 2019 to December 2020. Publications were characterized by journal, specialty, and study design. These variables were used for comparison of publication numbers. The general medicine journals with the 5 highest journal impact factors (JIF) were New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM; JIF 79.3), Lancet (JIF 53.3), JAMA (JIF 47.7), BMJ (JIF 23.6), and PLOS Medicine (JIF 11.7). Our bibliometric search yielded 3719 publications, of which 1098 (29.5%) were in neurology. Of these 1098 neurology publications, 317 (28.9%) were published in NEJM, 205 (18.7%) in Lancet, 284 (25.9%) in JAMA, 214 (19.5%) in BMJ, and 78 (7.1%) in PLOS Medicine. Randomized clinical trials were the most frequent neurology study type in general medicine journals (519 [47.3%]). The number of publications in each of the other specialties were as follows: immunology, 817; endocrinology, 633; gastroenterology, 353; and pulmonology, 818. The results of this study provide some guidance to authors regarding where they may wish to consider submitting their neurology research. Compared with other specialties, neurology-based articles are published more frequently in general medicine journals.",JAMA network open,2021-Apr,"Wilson M, Sampson M, Barrowman N, Doja A",4,2145,neurology,2025-11-22

39657848,Precision neurology.,"Over the past several decades, high-resolution brain imaging, blood and cerebrospinal fluid analyses, and other advanced technologies have changed diagnosis from an exercise depending primarily on the history and physical examination to a computer- and online resource-aided process that relies on larger and larger quantities of data. In addition, randomized controlled trials (RCT) at a population level have led to many new drugs and devices to treat neurological disease, including disease-modifying therapies. We are now at a crossroads. Combinatorially profound increases in data about individuals has led to an alternative to population-based RCTs. Genotyping and comprehensive ""deep"" phenotyping can sort individuals into smaller groups, enabling precise medical decisions at a personal level. In neurology, precision medicine that includes prediction, prevention and personalization requires that genomic and phenomic information further incorporate imaging and behavioral data. In this article, we review the genomic, phenomic, and computational aspects of precision medicine for neurology. After defining biological markers, we discuss some applications of these ""-omic"" and neuroimaging measures, and then outline the role of computation and ultimately brain simulation. We conclude the article with a discussion of the relation between precision medicine and value-based care.",Ageing research reviews,2025-Feb,Small SL,1,1389,neurology,2025-11-22

36456201,"Academic Neurology and the COVID-19 Pandemic: Resilience, Hope, and Solutions.","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) viral pandemic dramatically affected human health, health care delivery, health care workers, and health care research worldwide. The field of academic neurology was no exception. In this 2022 Presidential Plenary, we discuss the challenges faced by neurologists and neuroscientists professionally and personally. We review the threats posed by the pandemic to neuroscience research activities, materials, productivity, and funding. We then discuss the impact of the pandemic on clinical trials for neurologic diseases. Restrictions to patient enrolment due to limited in-person access to laboratory testing, imaging, and study visits led to delay in both clinical trial enrolment and study completion but also to innovative new means to engage clinical trial participants remotely and to strategies to critically appraise the frequency and design of trial-related patient evaluations. Clinical care was also challenged by initial pandemic prioritization of urgent visit and inpatient care and the rapid pivot to telehealth for most other neurology care encounters. Front-line neurology care teams faced their fears of infection, with the first few months of the pandemic being characterized by uncertainty, inconsistent national health care strategies, limited personal protective equipment, and an alarming rate of human illness and death caused by COVID-19. The personal and societal toll of the pandemic is incalculable. Across research and clinical neurology providers, women and particularly those with young families juggled the impossible balance of career and family care as schools closed and children required home-based education. Shining through this dark time are lessons that should shape a brighter future for our field. We are resilient, and the advances in neuroscience and neurology care continue to advance improved neurologic outcomes. The National Institutes of Health devised multiple support strategies for researchers to help bridge the pandemic. Telehealth, clinical trial designs that are more participant-centric with remote monitoring, and flexible work schedules are strategies to rebalance overworked lives and improve our engagement with our patients.

32878965,Improving liaison neurology services.,"Liaison neurology (consulting with inpatient ward referrals) is the main way that most patients admitted with neurological disease will access neurology services. Most liaison neurology services are responsive, seeing referrals on request, but they also can be proactive, with a regular neurology presence in the acute medical unit. Fewer than half of hospitals in England have electronic systems, yet these can facilitate the process-allowing electronic responses to advise on investigations before seeing the patient, and arranging follow-up after-as well as prioritising referrals and documenting the process. In this time of COVID-19, there are additional benefits in providing prompt remote advice. Improving the way liaison neurology is delivered can improve patient outcomes and save money by shortening admissions.

Department chairs often resort to a piecemeal approach, cobbling together funding for educators from various sources, but frequently falling short. Here, we review the various sources available to fund the educational mission in neurology, understanding that not every department will have access to every source. We describe the multiple different teaching models and formats used by the modern student and educator and their associated costs, some of which are exorbitant. We discuss possible nonfinancial incentives, including pathways to promotion, educational research, and other awards and recognition.

38237804,Consensus statement of the Spanish Society of Neurology on the treatment of multiple sclerosis and holistic patient management in 2023.,"The last consensus statement of the Spanish Society of Neurology's Demyelinating Diseases Study Group on the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) was issued in 2016. Although many of the positions taken remain valid, there have been significant changes in the management and treatment of MS, both due to the approval of new drugs with different action mechanisms and due to the evolution of previously fixed concepts. This has enabled new approaches to specific situations such as pregnancy and vaccination, and the inclusion of new variables in clinical decision-making, such as the early use of high-efficacy disease-modifying therapies (DMT), consideration of the patient's perspective, and the use of such novel technologies as remote monitoring. In the light of these changes, this updated consensus statement, developed according to the Delphi method, seeks to reflect the new paradigm in the management of patients with MS, based on the available scientific evidence and the clinical expertise of the participants. The most significant recommendations are that immunomodulatory DMT be started in patients with radiologically isolated syndrome with persistent radiological activity, that patient perspectives be considered, and that the term ""lines of therapy"" no longer be used in the classification of DMTs (> 90% consensus). Following diagnosis of MS, the first DMT should be selected according to the presence/absence of factors of poor prognosis (whether epidemiological, clinical, radiological, or biomarkers) for the occurrence of new relapses or progression of disability; high-efficacy DMTs may be considered from disease onset.",Neurologia,2024-Mar,"Meca-Lallana JE, Martínez Yélamos S, Eichau S, Llaneza MÁ, Martín Martínez J, Peña Martínez J, Meca Lallana V, Alonso Torres AM, Moral Torres E, Río J, Calles C, Ares Luque A, Ramió-Torrentà L, Marzo Sola ME, Prieto JM, Martínez Ginés ML, Arroyo R, Otano Martínez MÁ, Brieva Ruiz L, Gómez Gutiérrez M, Rodríguez-Antigüedad Zarranz A, Sánchez-Seco VG, Costa-Frossard L, Hernández Pérez MÁ, Landete Pascual L, González Platas M, Oreja-Guevara C",27,1643,neurology,2025-11-22

First, environmental factors are examined according to their nature (physical, chemical and biological) and in relation to human activity and behavior. Some factors are specific to the tropics (climate and infections), while others are non-specific (chemicals, human communities and their way of life). Second, we examine the major role of human adaptation to the success of Homo sapiens, with emphasis on the linkage between thermoregulation and sleep-wake regulation. Third, we examine the performance of environmental neurology as a clinical discipline in tropical climates, with focus on the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges posed by human African trypanosomiasis. Finally, the prevention, early detection and monitoring of environmental neurological diseases is examined, as well as links with political and economic factors. In conclusion, practitioners of environmental neurology seek a global, multidisciplinary and holistic approach to understanding, preventing and treating neurological disorders within their purview. Environmental neurology integrates an expanded One Health concept by linking health and wellness to the interaction of plants, animals, humans and the ecosystem.

Many patients with neurological disorders are well suited to evaluations through video. The department of neurology at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn Neurology), with the support of the health system, rapidly expanded telemedicine services to meet the needs of our patient population. This accomplishment required the complex coordination of multiple disciplines and roles within the department and the health care system, including faculty, residents, administrative staff, research and technical staff, information services, and the connected health team. Procedures for provider and patient education were established. Surveys of the provider and patient experience were developed and deployed. The process has demonstrated the vital role telemedicine in neurology (teleneurology) should play in the care of neurological patients beyond the pandemic.

Although interventional neurology techniques have existed for decades, recent landmark trials in stroke thrombectomy have catalyzed dramatic changes to the interventional neurology field, and there is rising neurology interest and representation. Unlike other neurology subspecialties, however, interventional neurology training and fellowship applications are not standardized. Thus, it can be difficult for neurology trainees to navigate this rapidly changing and multidisciplinary field. This article seeks to provide neurology residents and residency program directors with a brief overview of the modern interventional neurology field, the current fellowship application process, and tips on how neurologists can best prepare for a career in interventional neurology. To this end, we conducted a nationwide survey of interventional neurology fellowship program directors regarding training neurologists.

One potential approach is early exposure to neurology research and clinical care to pique interest and promote the specialty as a career choice. This study details the rewarding experience of working with undergraduate students, both in clinical research and clinical care. The logistics, benefits to students, and positive aspects for neurologists are outlined. Examples provided by undergraduate students who have participated in neurology research and clinical care are presented. The ultimate goals of this work are to encourage and inspire academic neurologists to involve undergraduate students in research and clinical care, to facilitate this process by outlining the steps needed to make this pairing successful, and to ultimately promote a pathway to build the neurology pipeline.",Neurology,2021-Mar,"Minen MT, Szperka CL, Cartwright MS, Wells RE",4,941,neurology,2025-11-22

38833660,Forensic Neurology: Practice Considerations and Training Opportunities.,"Neurologic evidence, including MRI, PET, and EEG, has been introduced in more than 2,800 criminal cases in the past decade, including 12% of all murder trials and 25% of death penalty trials, to argue whether neurologic diseases are present, contribute to criminal behavior, and ultimately whether the defendant is less criminally responsible, competent to stand trial, or should receive a reduced punishment for his or her crime. Unfortunately, neurologists are often not involved in these criminal cases despite being the medical specialty with the most relevant training and expertise to address these issues for the court. Reasons for the absence of neurologists in criminal cases include a lack of awareness from lawyers, judges, and other expert witnesses on the value of including neurologists in forensic evaluations, and the lack of experience, training, and willingness of neurologists to work as expert witnesses in criminal cases. Here, we discuss forensic neurology, a field bridging the gap between neurology, neuroscience, and the law. We discuss the process of performing forensic evaluations, including answering 3 fundamental questions: the neurologic diagnostic question, the behavioral neurology/neuropsychiatry question, and the forensic neurology question. We discuss practical aspects of performing forensic expert witness work and important ethical differences between the neurologist's role in treatment vs forensic settings. Finally, we discuss the currently available pathways for interested neurologists to receive additional training in forensic assessments.",Neurology,2024-Jul,"Zheng D, Considine CM, Weinstock R, Darby WC, Darby RR",5,1587,neurology,2025-11-22
34215383,Novel Treatments and Clinical Research in Child Neurology.,The molecular understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms responsible for neurologic diseases of children has led to a remarkable period of research that addresses the root causes of diseases. The promise of this research has been realized with cures and treatments that correct underlying deficiencies. The breakneck rate at which new research is being proposed promises to usher in a transformation of child neurology from a diagnostic and supportive field into an interventional one. Training child neurology residents in clinical research and therapeutic intervention is increasingly important to assure the ongoing ability to support research discoveries and treatment.,Neurologic clinics,2021-Aug,"Clark GD, Lotze TE",2,673,neurology,2025-11-22
33452146,Gender and racial trends among neurology residents: an overview.,"Diversification of academic medicine improves healthcare standards and patient outcomes. Gender and racial inequalities are major challenges faced by the healthcare system. This article reviews the trends of gender and racial disparity among residents of neurology. This retrospective analysis of the annual Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Data Resource Books encompassed all residents at US neurology residency training programmes from the year 2007 to 2018. The representation of women steadily increased, with an absolute increase of 3% from the year 2007 to 2018. Although the absolute change (%) increased for the White race, Asian/Pacific Islander, Black/African Americans, there was a decrease seen in the Hispanic representation in neurology residents from the year 2011 to 2018. There was no change seen for the Native Americans/Alaskans. Our study concluded that gender and racial disparity persists in the recruitment of residents in neurology. This study highlights the need for targeted interventions to address gender and racial disparity among residents of neurology. Further studies are needed to explore etiological factors to address gender and racial disparity.",Postgraduate medical journal,2022-Aug,"Maqsood H, Naveed S, Mohyud Din Chaudhary A, Khan MT, Khosa F",5,1201,neurology,2025-11-22
37727060,Dual Residency Training in Neurology and Psychiatry: History and Current Practice.,"In the early 20th century, neurology training included more experience in psychiatry, and psychiatry training included more training in neurology than what is currently required. After World War I, the increased need for differential diagnosis of what might now be called functional neurological disorders resulted in the military encouraging combined residency training in neurology and psychiatry and the promulgation of the term ""neuropsychiatry"" for this specialty. Thirty-six percent of physicians certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology in its first decade (1935-1945) held certification in both neurology and psychiatry. However, the term neuropsychiatry gradually became used interchangeably with general psychiatry-to distinguish it from psychoanalysis-and lost its specificity. It is widely held that the popularity of psychoanalysis resulted in psychiatrists perceiving less need for neurological knowledge, and inclusion of neurology content in psychiatry training decreased. Dual residency training programs in neurology and psychiatry began to increase in popularity again in the 1980s as advances in neuroscience, neuroimaging, and pharmacology, paired with the growth of behavioral neurology, laid the foundation for meaningful practice of neuropsychiatry. The author surveyed 207 physicians who graduated from both a neurology and psychiatry residency and 18 current trainees in combined neuropsychiatry residency programs to collect information on their current practice, academic activity, and opinions about their training. The response rate was 64%. Respondents' attitudes toward the value of their dual neurology and psychiatry training were overwhelmingly positive. Reasons for the lack of growth of combined residency programs in neurology and psychiatry are examined.",The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences,2024-,Benjamin S,1,1812,neurology,2025-11-22

39074673,"On the common of descent of neurology, psychiatry and anthropology.","It is little appreciated not only how closely linked are the disciplines of neurology, psychiatry, and anthropology but even more so the degree to which they share a ""common ancestry"". This paper briefly reviews the definition and historical origins of each area of study to then begin to illustrate how their ""genealogies"" overlap. This illustration is by way of a sampling of the many key figures who contributed to the rise of not just neurology, psychiatry or anthropology but of all three disciplines. That is, a selective review is undertaken of paragons whose careers bridged medicine, neuropsychiatry, and anthropology. A sampling from among the dozens who have made major contributions to spanning these disciplines illuminates the significant extent of their co-mingled intellectual ancestry. This series is akin to a data table of necessarily concise biographical vignettes - past scholars with some or full medical training who also advanced both anthropology and neuropsychiatry as these disciplines grew into intellectual maturity. Each is, in a sense, a data point that bolsters the overarching thesis that the intellectual history of these disciplines have shared ancestry. Thus, even this preliminary and topical survey of a few past ""exemplars"" underscores the importance of this unique intellectual siblingship. Moreover, there is now a profusion of living scholars who add fulsomely to what might be deemed this 'trilateral marriage' of anthropology, psychiatry, and neurology. A compilation of more contemporary contributors is well worthy of a future review that expands from this first consideration. This initial work is meant to engender more robust scholarship that better elucidates and, thereby, enriches and enlivens further work while also uncovering new avenues of deeper insight, notably as to the ""conceptual and heuristic progression"" of evolutionary neurosciences with respect to the normative and pathologic.",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,2024-Nov,Wilson DR,1,1944,neurology,2025-11-22

This review aims to analyze the characteristics of the retracted papers in the field of neurology and the reasons for the retraction to better understand the trends in this area and to assist to avoid retraction incidents. A total of 79 papers were included, which pertained to 22 countries and 64 journals. The marking methods for retracting original papers included watermarks (89.04%), retracted signs in the text (5.48%) and no prompt (5.48%). The median M (interquartile range [IQR]) of citations in retractions in neurology was 7 (41). Studies continued to be cited after retraction with an M (IQR) of 3 (16). The journal impact factor was between 0 and 157.335, with an M (IQR) of 5.127 (3.668). 45.21% and 31.51% papers were mainly published in the first and second quartile journals, respectively. The M (IQR) time elapsed between publication and retraction was 32 (44) months. The reasons for retraction included two major categories, academic misconduct (79.75%) and academic unintentional mistakes (20.25%). The number of retractions in neurology has been on the rise over the past decade, with fabricated academic misconduct being the main cause of the retractions. Due to the long time lag between publication and retraction, a number of unreliable findings continue to be cited following retraction. In addition to the requisite standards of academic ethics, augmenting research training and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration are crucial in enhancing research integrity.",European journal of neurology,2023-Dec,"Wang X, Gao N, Chen H, Wang W",4,1612,neurology,2025-11-22
38769014,How to use podcasts in neurology.,"Virtual learning resources such as podcasts and social media are increasingly used in medical education. Podcasts are one example of virtual learning, where prerecorded audio files are available to stream or download from the internet, usually without a fee and at any time. This gives listeners flexibility in when and where they engage with the educational material, enabling learning to be better tailored to individual needs. Podcasts are often enjoyed for their relaxed and conversational style. However, listeners must be aware of the lack of external peer review and incomplete coverage of information. There are also risks inherent to distant learning, including depersonalisation of medical education. We describe the roles that podcasts now play in neurological education, exploring some of the ways that they can be used to enhance neurological training both as a learner and educator and giving our top tips, based on our own experiences, for anyone keen to add to the expanding field of available podcasts.",Practical neurology,2024-Sep,"Mason F, Mayer J, O'Toole B, Williamson J, Ross Russell A",5,1019,neurology,2025-11-22

36564205,Neurology Education in 2035: The Neurology Future Forecasting Series.,"In the past decade, there have been dramatic changes in all aspects of neurologic care, and along with this, neurology education has transformed. These changes have affected all aspects of education across the educational continuum, including learners, teachers, educators, content, delivery methods, assessments, and outcomes. Health systems science, health humanities, diversity, equity, and inclusion and health disparities are becoming core components of neurology curricula, and, in the future, will be integrated into every aspect of our educational mission. The ways in which material is taught and learned have been influenced by technologic innovations and a growing understanding of the science of learning. We forecast that this trend will continue, with learners choosing from an array of electronic resources to engage with fundamental topics, allowing front-line clinical teachers to spend more time supporting critical reasoning and teaching students how to learn. There has been a growing differentiation of educational roles (i.e., teachers, educators, and scholars). We forecast that these roles will become more distinct, each with an individualized pattern of support and expectations. Assessment has become more aligned with the work of the learners, and there are growing calls to focus more on the impact of educational programs on patient care. We forecast that there will be an increased emphasis on educational outcomes and public accountability for training programs.

The European Paediatric Neurology Society first designed and published the European PN training programme in the European Paediatric Neurology Syllabus in 2002. This was important in gaining recognition for the sub-specialty from the European Academy of Paediatrics and the European Academy of Neurology and in 2003 PN was recognized as a sub-specialty of paediatrics and neurology by the Board of the European Union of Medical Specialties. In 2004, the EPNS founded the Committee of National Advisors (CNA) that comprised representatives from national Paediatric Neurology societies, in order to further enhance Europe wide standards in training and practice., The EPNS Training Advisory Board (TAB) offers nation specific advice/support to PN societies on developing training and care systems. In 2019, the 2nd revision of the Paediatric Neurology Syllabus was approved by the EPNS Board and CNA. We aim to give an overview of the training of Paediatric Neurology (PN) specialists (i.e. Paediatric Neurologists), the relevant professional bodies and the current practice of Paediatric Neurology in Europe, as defined geographically by the World Health Organization. A structured online data collection form was completed by CNA representatives from European countries. The data included training routes and structure of training, epidemiological data, nature of professional societies, organization of Paediatric Neurology care, research, academic life and recognition of the specialty. Data was collected from 43 European countries of which 38 have a national PN Society. In 10 (6 European Union (EU) and 4 non-EU countries) PN is recognized as a core specialty. In 26 countries PN is recognized as a sub-specialty of Paediatrics, Neurology or both (15 EU-11 non-EU). PN is not recognized as a core or sub-specialty in 7 countries (4 EU and 3 non-EU). In 35 countries paediatric neurologists begin their training from Paediatrics, but in 19 countries PN training from Neurology is also possible or the preferred route. Training in PN differs, but in over 50% of countries the three main training modules named in the 2019 2nd revision of the European PN Syllabus (PN, Paediatrics and adult Neurology) are included. Many countries have already adapted their curriculum to the suggestions in the European PN syllabus. There is diversity among European countries in terms of professional organization and PN training. The European PN syllabus has had impact on the development of PN training throughout Europe, independent of duration of training or route from paediatrics or neurology. The syllabus provides a basis for the future development of PN training, the recognition of PN as a (sub) specialty in individual countries and for improving the care of children with neurological disorders in Europe.",European journal of paediatric neurology : EJPN : official journal of the European Paediatric Neurology Society,2020-Sep,"Craiu D, Haataja L, Hollody K, Kršek P, Lagae L, Mall V, Parker AP, Steinlin M, Yalnizoglu D, Catsman-Berrevoets C",10,3011,neurology,2025-11-22

37279616,Pediatric Resident Confidence in Assessing Neurological Cases: A Nationwide Survey.,"A relative shortage of pediatric neurologists in proportion to estimated neurological disorders often results in general pediatricians evaluating and treating children with complex neurological conditions. Dedicated rotations in pediatric neurology are not mandated during medical school or pediatric residency. We evaluated the perceptions of a large cohort of pediatric residents and program directors (PDs) regarding child neurology training. Using an online tool, surveys were sent to pediatric residents and pediatric and pediatric neurology PDs. Response rates were 41% from pediatric residency programs, yielding 538 resident responses; 31% from pediatric PDs; and 62% from pediatric neurology PDs. Only 27% of the surveyed residents reported completing a neurology rotation during residency, 89% of whom expressed a subjective improvement in confidence with neurological assessments. Factors affecting comfort with eliciting a neurological history included exposure to a neurology rotation during residency, year of training, duration of neurology rotation in medical school, and inpatient exposure to neurological patients, whereas those associated with examination additionally included program size and postresidency plans. Overall, 80% of surveyed residents, 78% of pediatric PDs, and 96% of pediatric neurology PDs acknowledged the potential value of a mandatory pediatric neurology rotation during residency. We suggest that a mandatory pediatric neurology rotation will boost the confidence of current and future pediatric trainees in assessing common neurological conditions of childhood.",Pediatric neurology,2023-Aug,"Govil-Dalela T, Thomas R, Weber A, Kamat D, Williams MT, Przyklenk K, Sivaswamy L",7,1604,neurology,2025-11-22

Although a period of scientific stagnation ensued between the 12th and 20th centuries ce, Indian medical neurosciences once again flourished after India's independence from British rule in 1947. The pioneers of modern Indian neurosurgery, neurology, and their ancillary fields made numerous scientific and clinical discoveries, advancements, and innovations that proved influential on a global scale. Most importantly, the efforts of Indian neurosurgeons and neurologists were unified at the national level through the Neurological Society of India, which was established in 1951 and enabled an unprecedented degree of collaboration within the aforementioned medical specialties. The growth and success of the Indian model bears several lessons that can be applied to other nations in order to garner better collaboration among neurosurgeons, neurologists, and physicians in related fields. Here, the authors elaborate on the origins, growth, and development of neurosurgery and neurology in India and discuss their current state in order to glean valuable lessons on interdisciplinary collaboration, which forms the basis of the authors' proposal for the continued growth of societies dedicated to medical neurosciences across the world.",Journal of neurosurgery,2023-May,"Modak A, Raju B, Jumah F, Pain M, Gupta G, Nanda A",6,1443,neurology,2025-11-22

33296855,Preventive neurology concepts for training the next-generation and closing gaps in real-world Multiple Sclerosis Care.,"The field of Multiple sclerosis (MS) has entered an area of growth in the understanding of the MS immune dysregulation that has led to an impressive therapeutics expansion. However, results of surveys and proceedings of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) support the notion that US neurology residents have fragmented exposure to MS training during residency, resulting in learning gaps in diagnosis, management and follow up of patients with MS. There are annual educational offerings by MS academic societies but limited and tailored to trainees interested in MS/neuroimmunology subespecialization. Therefore, the acquisition of MS clinical skills by all neurology residents is essential for the practice of unsupervised neurology after board certification. Here, we review the current elements and goals of care that are critical for the learning of trainees. We present these elements in a framework focused on current unmet needs to avoid progression in MS in a real-world setting, tailored to preventive and personalized care: The ""Multiple Sclerosis 4-square Educational Matrix"". This approach could help training neurologist and patients through the essential steps of care. The trainee side emphasizes a goal-oriented approach to satisfy the educational and management components of MS in four areas: burden of symptoms, burden of disease activity, personalized risk factors and personalized patient education. The patient side is similar but simplified for their benefit. This structured approach is based on the principles of personalized preventive neurology and could be useful to solidify trainees and patient education, promoting proactive participation of patients in vital areas of their care, in an anticipatory, and goal-oriented manner. We aim to improve the unmet needs at an individual level and the value of care of populations at risk for progression and disability in MS.",Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,2021-Jan,"Coban H, Siddiqui A, Creed MA, Rai W, Imitola J",5,1901,neurology,2025-11-22
36150939,Voices from the past: The pioneering use of the phonograph in neurology.,"Since its discovery by the American inventor and industrialist Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931) in 1877, the phonograph attracted much interest in the field of medicine. This article describes the earliest pioneering examples of the use of the phonograph in neurology. In France, the use of the phonograph for obtaining audio recordings of delusions and speech or language disturbances was first proposed by Victor Maurice Dupont (1857-1910) in 1889 and in Italy by the physician Gaetano Rummo (1853-1917), who had studied at La Salpêtrière under Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893). The applicability of the phonograph to the record of speech disturbances was illustrated in England by John Hughlings Jackson (1835-1911) and William Halse Rivers (1864-1922), and by William Hale White (1857-1949) and Cuthbert Hilton Golding-Bird (1848-1939) in 1891. Since then, audio recordings have been used rarely in neurology, a branch of medicine where the visual aspects dominate, to the extent that inspection can be enough to reach a definite clinical diagnosis. In the mid-20th century, the advent of audio and video recordings supplanted audio recordings alone, relegating them to a very marginal role.",Revue neurologique,2023-Mar,"Brigo F, Lorusso L, Walusinski O, Drouin E",4,1192,neurology,2025-11-22

In this study, we aimed to reveal the gender inequality in the top journals' editorial boards and national societies' leadership positions in the field of neurology and neurosurgery. This is a cross-sectional study that uses public information accessed through the internet via journals' and academic societies' public websites. The medical journals are selected and included according to their h5-index in the field of neurology and neurosurgery. We evaluated the gender composition of the editorial boards and academic societies' leadership positions. The female editorial board member ratio was 44.0% in the top 10 neurology journals. However, this ratio was significantly decreased to 29.7% in the other journals(P < 0.001). The top 10 neurosurgery journals had a female editorial board member ratio of 13.7%. This ratio was significantly decreased to 5.3% in the other 10 journals with lower h5-index(P < 0.001). A significantly lower number of female individuals are present in the editorial boards of the neurosurgery journals than in neurology(P < 0.001). The female president or delegate ratio was 19.3% in the World Federation of Neurology-affiliated countries, and it was 4% in the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies-affiliated countries. In conclusion, there is a significant gender inequality among editorial board members. The position of neurosurgical societies and journals is far different than the field of neurology. Furthermore, these findings should be evaluated as a continuum of the gender inequality in the professional societies' executive boards and delegates representing the national academical community.",World neurosurgery,2024-Mar,"Apaydin AS, Emekli I",2,1767,neurology,2025-11-22
35444052,The Neurology Fellowship Application Conundrum: Finding Common Ground.,"For many neurologic subspecialties, the fellowship application process begins early in the first half of the second year of neurology-specific training (PGY3 for adult neurology residents and PGY4 for child neurology residents). In 2019, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) published a position statement recommending communication between fellowship candidates and training programs begin no sooner than March 1 of the penultimate year of training and that programs offer fellowship positions no sooner than August 1 of the final year of training. A few pilot subspecialties adopted this timeline for 2021 recruitment for positions beginning in 2022. All United States-based AAN-affiliated neurology and child neurology residents who recently completed the fellowship application process received a survey about their fellowship application experience. Of the 291 residents who responded to the survey, 96% agree that applications should not be submitted before March 1 of the penultimate year of training and 72% believe that August 1 of the final year is a reasonable time to begin offering positions. Nearly half (49%) of residents believe that there is too little time for subspecialty/clinical exposure before applying for fellowship and 88% feel the current process and timeline are stressful. Residents who applied to programs in pilot subspecialties report more time to choose, less stress, and a lower number of time-pressured offers. A large majority of residents (89%) prefer to submit a single application through a centralized system. The survey results suggest that residents who just completed the fellowship application process agree with the AAN recommended timeline for all subspecialties and that all neurology subspecialties should consider adopting a fellowship match. Programs can help facilitate a better fellowship application experience by providing earlier exposure to a broad range of neurologic subspecialties and ensure that residents are given opportunities to attend national meetings and participate in appropriately scoped scholarly endeavors.",Neurology,2022-May,"London ZN, Mahajan A, Cahill C, Khan J, Schuyler EA, Price RS",6,2081,neurology,2025-11-22

It describes how our discipline organized itself during the latter part of the 20th century in Europe. In some ways, the creation and the evolution of the journal parallel the process of unification of Europe in its current form in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It started as a new journal with no impact factor and no indexation. It grew progressively thanks to the support of the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) and from the European scientific community The progressive merging of EFNS with the European Society of Neurology and the creation of the European Academy of Neurology were essential for reaching the current prominence of EJN within neurological publishing and for making it the widely heard official voice of European neurology.",European journal of neurology,2024-Nov,"Boller F, Petrov A, Sørensen PS",3,887,neurology,2025-11-22

37437392,Creation of an advancing adult and pediatric neurology resident EEG curriculum.,"The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) milestones state that neurology residents should be able to ""interpret common EEG abnormalities, recognize normal EEG variants, and create a report."" Yet, recent studies have shown that only 43% of neurology residents express confidence in interpreting EEG without supervision and can recognize less than half of normal and abnormal EEG patterns. Our objective was to create a curriculum to improve both confidence and competence in reading EEGs. At Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), adult and pediatric neurology residents have required EEG rotations in their first and second years of neurology residency and can choose an EEG elective in their third year. A curriculum consisting of specific learning objectives, self-directed modules, EEG lectures, epilepsy-related conferences, supplemental educational material, and tests was created for each of the three years of training. Since the implementation of an EEG curriculum at VUMC from September 2019 until November 2022, 12 adult and 21 pediatric neurology residents completed pre- and post-rotation tests. Among the 33 residents, there was a statistically significant improvement in post-rotation test scores, with a mean score improvement of 17% (60.0 ± 12.9 to 77.9 ± 11.8, n = 33, p < 0.0001). When differentiated by training, the mean improvement of 18.8% in the adult cohort was slightly higher than in the pediatric cohort, 17.3%, though it was not significantly different. Overall improvement was significantly increased in the junior resident cohort with a 22.6% improvement in contrast to 11.5% in the senior resident cohort (p = 0.0097 by Student's t-test, n = 14 junior residents and 15 senior residents). With the creation of an EEG curriculum specific to each year of neurology residency, adult and pediatric neurology residents demonstrated a statistically significant mean improvement between pre- and post-rotation test scores. The improvement was significantly higher in junior residents in contrast to senior residents. Our structured and comprehensive EEG curriculum objectively improved EEG knowledge in all neurology residents at our institution. The findings may suggest a model which other neurology training programs may consider for the implementation of a similar curriculum to both standardize and address gaps in resident EEG education.",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2023-Aug,"Passiak BS, Carozza RB, Carson RP, Reddy SB",4,2396,neurology,2025-11-22
35093723,Neurophobia in Africa: Survey responses from fifteen African countries.,"To assess the prevalence of ""neurophobia,"" or fear of the neurosciences and neurology, and perceptions of neurology education among medical trainees in African countries. Perceptions of neurology and characterization of neurophobia have been studied among medical trainees around the world. However, few studies on neurophobia have been conducted in African countries despite having a disproportionately high burden of neurological disease and fewer neurologists per capita than all other world regions. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of medical students and post-graduate trainees in internal medicine and pediatrics across Africa. A 23-item online survey containing multiple-choice, Likert-scale, and free-response questions was adapted from prior literature, translated into English and French, and distributed through listservs and social media. 294 surveys were completed by 197 medical students and 97 post-graduate trainees from 15 countries, with the greatest representation from Zambia (n = 110), Nigeria (n = 54) and Kenya (n = 35). One-fifth of respondents endorsed interest in a future career in neurology while 36% reported discomfort with neurology and almost one-third endorsed neurophobia. Participants rated neurology as the most difficult compared to six other medical subspecialties (p < 0.001) and rated their confidence managing patients with neurological complaints lower than other medical subspecialties except rheumatology (p < 0.005). Medical trainees in multiple African countries endorse fear and discomfort with the subject of neurology.

This article discusses the value of involving experts trained in behavioral neurology in such cases. First, we describe the field of behavioral neurology and neuropsychiatry, the subspecialty available to both neurologists and psychiatrists focused on the behavioral, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric manifestations of neurological diseases. Next, we discuss the added value of behavioral neurologists in forensic cases, including assisting in the diagnostic evaluation for complex neuropsychiatric diseases, using expertise in localization to provide a strong scientific basis for linking neurodiagnostic testing to relevant neuropsychiatric symptoms, and assisting in relating these symptoms to the relevant legal question in cases where such symptoms may be less familiar to forensic psychiatrists, such as frontal lobe syndromes. We discuss approaches to integrating behavioral neurology with forensic psychiatry, highlighting the need for collaboration and mentorship between disciplines. Finally, we discuss several forensic cases highlighting the additional value of experts trained in behavioral neurology. We conclude that forensic psychiatrists should involve behavioral neurology experts when encountering neurological evidence that falls outside their scope of expertise, and the need for further cross-disciplinary collaboration and training.",The journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,2024-Jun,"Darby WC, Considine CM, Darby RR",3,1487,neurology,2025-11-22

This was deemed a necessity by our membership, as our colleagues expressed discouragement and burnout by the increase in workload without additional resources; reliance on work relative value units (wRVUs) as the sole basis of compensation; a push by administrators for providers to see more patients with less allotted time; and lack of administrative, educational, and research support. The CNS Task Force designed and distributed a survey to multiple academic divisions of various sizes, as well as to private practices. Our findings were strikingly similar across different practices, demonstrating high workloads, lack of resources, poor electronic medical record support, and high provider symptoms of fatigue and burnout. From the results, the CNS Task Force has concluded that wRVUs cannot be the sole basis of compensation for child neurology. We have also made several specific recommendations for alleviating the current situation, including innovative ways to fund child neurology as well as ways to enhance job satisfaction.",Neurology,2020-Jan,"Zupanc ML, Cohen BH, Kang PB, Mandelbaum DE, Mink J, Mintz M, Tilton A, Trescher W",8,1184,neurology,2025-11-22

35618436,Adult Neurology Rotations for Child Neurology Residents: A Survey of Program Directors.,"We aimed to identify how child neurology and neurodevelopmental disabilities residency program directors (PDs) implemented revised Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements for adult neurology training for child neurology residents. Before 2014, the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology certification for child neurology required an adult year, with no specified rotation requirements. At that point, programs scheduled a median of 10 months of adult neurology rotations during the third postgraduate year (PGY-3). In 2014, the adult neurology requirements were modified to include 6 months of hospital-based, 3 months of outpatient, and 3 months of other elective (may include neurophysiology, neuropathology, and/or neuroradiology) rotations. However, the effects of these changes on child neurology residency training nationally have not been characterized. A 16-item online survey was emailed to 79 PDs in the United States in September 2020. Survey responses were collected from September to October 2020. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and associations with departmental affiliation (pediatrics/neurology), graduate medical education (GME) funding source, and program size were compared using nonparametric tests. The response rate was 72% (53 pediatric neurology, 3 neurodevelopmental disabilities). The median adult months per year of training were as follows: 9 PGY-3, 2 PGY-4, and 1 PGY-5. Nearly all had both hospital inpatient and consult rotations with night and/or weekend shifts; 57% included neurocritical care and 36% epilepsy monitoring units. 48% of programs scheduled night and weekend shifts (including 25% that scheduled 24-hour calls) for residents on outpatient and elective rotations. Few programs required adult neurophysiology (20%), neuropathology (32%), or neuroradiology (25%). Programs with children's hospital GME funding (for either 2 or 3 years) tended to be larger (<i>p</i> = 0.008). Otherwise, departmental affiliation, funding source, and program size were not associated with rotation timing. Most child neurology residency programs still consolidate adult training in the PGY-3 year and often schedule additional hospital shifts during outpatient and elective months. However, there is a small shift toward adult neurology rotations occurring in the PGY-4 and PGY-5. Departmental affiliation, funding source, and program size do not consistently affect training practices. Few programs mandate adult neurophysiology, neuropathology, or neuroradiology rotations.",Neurology,2022-Aug,"Marshall CS, Deng S, Jackson HS, Horn PS, Wolf DS, Thompson-Stone R, Gilbert DL",7,2540,neurology,2025-11-22
34111766,SUDEP education among U.S. and international neurology trainees.,"We evaluated baseline sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) knowledge and counseling practices among national and international adult neurology trainees with a 12-question online survey. The survey was emailed to all 169 U.S. neurology residency program directors and select international neurology/epilepsy program leaders. Program leaders were asked to distribute the survey link to adult neurology trainees. There were 161 respondents in the U.S. and 171 respondents outside the U.S. The latter were from 25 Latin American, European, Asian, and African countries. More than 90% of all trainees reported familiarity with SUDEP definition. Familiarity with SUDEP risk factors and mitigation measures ranged from 56% to 67% across these groups, with international trainees slightly more familiar with risk factors (67% vs. 61% in U.S.) but less familiar with mitigation measures (56% vs. 63% in U.S.). Approximately half of national (49%) and international (54%) trainees rarely or never counseled patients on SUDEP. Less than half of national (44%) and international (41%) trainees were educated about SUDEP. Many U.S. and adult neurology trainees remain unfamiliar with SUDEP risk factors and mitigation measures. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy counseling falls below recommended standards. We suggest that worldwide neurology training programs' leaderships consider improving SUDEP education targeted at adult neurology trainees.",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2021-Aug,"Nascimento FA, Laze J, Friedman D, Lam A, Devinsky O",5,1443,neurology,2025-11-22
37491325,Access to Pediatric Neurology Training and Services Worldwide: A Survey by the International Child Neurology Association.,"Pediatric neurology is the medical subspecialty responsible for diagnosing and managing diseases and disorders of the nervous system in childhood and adolescence. In many, but not all, regions of the world, the discipline of pediatric neurology is recognized as a specialty or subspecialty of either neurology or pediatrics. Significant knowledge and competencies in this area are necessary to be effective in clinical practice. The need for this is driven by the high burden of disease from neurologic conditions in children and the effect on their families. As the first part of a multistaged project under the auspices of the International Child Neurology Association, in collaboration with key stakeholders, a survey was undertaken to establish which countries have practicing child neurologists. For those countries that have child neurologists, the survey established the number of practitioners and which countries have access to in-country child neurology training. Responses were obtained from 177 countries. Worldwide, there is a median of 0.07 and mean of 0.39 child neurologists per 100,000 population. The greatest deficits in child neurology specialists and access to training were evident in countries which fell under the World Bank rating of low-income country status (range of 0-0.008 child neurologists per 100,000 population). Seventy-three percent of low-income countries lack access to child neurologists: The majority are in the African and South-East Asia regions. For the population of 1.37 billion in the continent of Africa, there were 324 child neurologists, equating to a median of 0.01 per 100,000 population in comparison with a median of 0.59 child neurologists per 100,000 across high-income countries. Ninety-four countries had capacity to support in-country pediatric neurology training.

34628144,Gene-Targeted Therapies in Pediatric Neurology: Challenges and Opportunities in Diagnosis and Delivery.,"Gene-targeted therapies are becoming a reality for infants and children with diseases of the nervous system. Rapid scientific advances have led to disease-modifying or even curative treatments. However, delays and gaps in diagnosis, inequitable delivery, and the need for long-term surveillance pose unresolved challenges. The goal of the Child Neurology Society Research Committee was to evaluate and provide guidance on the obstacles, opportunities, and uncertainties in gene-targeted therapies for pediatric neurological disease. The Child Neurology Society Research Committee engaged in collaborative, iterative literature review and committee deliberations to prepare this consensus statement. We identified important challenges for gene-targeted therapies that require resource investments, infrastructure development, and strategic planning. Barriers include inequities in diagnosis and delivery of therapies, high costs, and a need for long-term surveillance of efficacy and safety, including systematic tracking of unanticipated effects. Key uncertainties regarding technical aspects and usage of gene-targeted therapies should be addressed, and characterization of new natural histories of diseases will be needed. Counterbalanced with these obstacles and uncertainties is the tremendous potential being demonstrated in treatments and clinical trials of gene-targeted therapies. Given that gene-targeted therapies for neurological diseases are in their earliest phase, the pediatric neurology community can play a vital role in their guidance and implementation. This role includes facilitating development of infrastructure and guidelines; ensuring efficient, equitable, and ethical implementation of treatments; and advocating for affordable and broad access for all children.",Pediatric neurology,2021-Dec,"Shellhaas RA, deVeber G, Bonkowsky JL",3,1788,neurology,2025-11-22

In this Perspective, we advocate for the development of 'forensic neurology', a subspecialty of neurology focused on using neurological clinical and scientific expertise to address legal questions for the criminal justice system. We review literature suggesting that the incidence of criminal behaviour is higher in people with certain neurological disorders than the general public and that undiagnosed neurological abnormalities are common in people who commit crimes. We discuss the need for forensic neurologists in criminal cases to provide an opinion on what neurological diagnoses are present, the resulting symptoms and ultimately whether the symptoms affect legal determinations such as criminal responsibility or competency.",Nature reviews.

The disagreements Adams and Foley had with Baker concerned two issues: (1) the neurologic and neuropathological manifestations of liver failure with hepatic encephalopathy as expounded from the late 1940s to the early 1960s, and (2) the founding of the American Academy of Neurology in 1948 as an inclusive medical society under the principal leadership of Baker. The conflicts are examined from transcribed meeting debates (1949-1963), salient original publications (1949-1963), public addresses of protagonists touching on these issues (1971, 1984), and oral histories and less formal interviews of the protagonists and their associates (1979-2014). Contributing to these conflicts were contrasting personalities and outlooks on American neurology in the mid-twentieth century. Adams and Foley prevailed with their characterization of the neurologic and neuropathologic features of liver failure, whereas Baker triumphed with the need for and importance of an inclusive neurological society that would develop continuing medical education for neurologists at a national level, garner federal financial support for neurology training programs, and facilitate the development of neurology as a strong, independent medical discipline in the United States.",Journal of the history of the neurosciences,2024-,Lanska DJ,1,1398,neurology,2025-11-22

This quick mental process was previously referred to as 'Augenblickdiagnose' ('diagnosis in the blink of an eye') in a seminal paper by Dr. William Campbell in 1998. We aimed to revisit this concept by providing additional clinical vignettes. The authors wrote clinical vignettes using examples from their own clinical practice and performed a non-systematic review of influential neurology textbooks using the words 'pathognomonic' and 'highly suggestive'. Twenty examples from various fields of neurology are presented in a table, stratified by major fields of neurology. A short educational reflection is provided for each diagnosis considered. 'Augenblickdiagnose' is an engaging teaching resource that also contributes to 'neurophilia', that is, a fascination for neurology, perhaps increasingly in today's modern neurology practice.

Students were from a broad spectrum of undergraduate institutions (public research university [40.8%], liberal arts college [29.7%], and private research university [29.0%]). Most students (89.9%) were looking to pursue graduate studies; 56.9% reported wanting to be a physician, and 17.8% expressed interest in obtaining an MD/PhD. Of importance, students reported first exposure to neuroscience at age 16 years but felt that they could be exposed to neuroscience as early as 13 years. Half (50.5%) decided to major in neuroscience before college, and a quarter (25.6%) decided to major in their first year of college. Despite high interest in clinical neurology exposure, less than one-third of students had spoken with or shadowed a neurologist, and only 13.6% had interacted with clinical neurology populations. Only 20.8% of students felt volunteer and internship opportunities were sufficiently available. Qualitative results include student perspectives from those who did and did not work with a neurologist, describing how they were or were not able to obtain such opportunities. We discuss translating the survey findings into actionable results with opportunities to target the undergraduate neuroscience interest to improve the neurology pipeline. We describe existing programs that could be integrated into everyday neurology practices and new approaches to learning and training to help leverage the significant undergraduate neuroscience interest. We also raise questions for further research, including exploring (1) how students learn of neurologic conditions/expand their knowledge about additional neurologic conditions, (2) whether qualitative investigation of the experiences of neuroscience undergraduates at specific institutions might provide an additional insight, and (3) systems to maintain interest in neuroscience/neurology as students enter medical school.",Neurology,2022-Feb,"Minen MT, Kaplan K, Akter S, Khanns D, Ostendorf T, Rheaume CE, Friedman S, Wells RE",8,2558,neurology,2025-11-22
38060223,Performance of Large Language Models on a Neurology Board-Style Examination.,"Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in a wide array of applications, including health care. While LLMs showed heterogeneous results across specialized medical board examinations, the performance of these models in neurology board examinations remains unexplored. To assess the performance of LLMs on neurology board-style examinations. This cross-sectional study was conducted between May 17 and May 31, 2023. The evaluation utilized a question bank approved by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and was validated with a small question cohort by the European Board for Neurology. All questions were categorized into lower-order (recall, understanding) and higher-order (apply, analyze, synthesize) questions based on the Bloom taxonomy for learning and assessment. Performance by LLM ChatGPT versions 3.5 (LLM 1) and 4 (LLM 2) was assessed in relation to overall scores, question type, and topics, along with the confidence level and reproducibility of answers. Overall percentage scores of 2 LLMs. LLM 2 significantly outperformed LLM 1 by correctly answering 1662 of 1956 questions (85.0%) vs 1306 questions (66.8%) for LLM 1. Notably, LLM 2's performance was greater than the mean human score of 73.8%, effectively achieving near-passing and passing grades in the neurology board examination. LLM 2 outperformed human users in behavioral, cognitive, and psychological-related questions and demonstrated superior performance to LLM 1 in 6 categories. Both LLMs performed better on lower-order than higher-order questions, with LLM 2 excelling in both lower-order and higher-order questions. Both models consistently used confident language, even when providing incorrect answers. Reproducible answers of both LLMs were associated with a higher percentage of correct answers than inconsistent answers. Despite the absence of neurology-specific training, LLM 2 demonstrated commendable performance, whereas LLM 1 performed slightly below the human average. While higher-order cognitive tasks were more challenging for both models, LLM 2's results were equivalent to passing grades in specialized neurology examinations. These findings suggest that LLMs could have significant applications in clinical neurology and health care with further refinements.",JAMA network open,2023-Dec,"Schubert MC, Wick W, Venkataramani V",3,2302,neurology,2025-11-22
36227386,The future of neurology after the COVID-19 pandemic according to neurology residents.,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant changes in the delivery of neurological disease care and in neurology training in academic departments. We aimed to investigate how neurology residents viewed the future of neurology after the COVID-19 pandemic with regard to three main aspects: (i) organization of neurological activity, (ii) patient care, and (iii) funding availability for neurological diseases. We surveyed Italian neurology residents in order to investigate how they viewed the future of neurology after the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses were collected from 254 residents who reported: a high risk of reduction of hospital neurological beds, of worsening of the quality of neurological patient management, and of lack of funding for neurological care and research. The survey results demonstrate the views of future neurologists regarding the direction of neurology after the COVID-19 emergency. It is important to focus on these aspects in order to adapt neurology training to the societal changes introduced by the pandemic, and to safeguard the essential role of neurology in the management and prevention of chronic degenerative illnesses and emergencies.",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2023-Jan,"Ercoli T, Barbato F, Cuffaro L, Iodice F, Romoli M, Tedeschi G, Berardelli A, Di Lorenzo F, Bombaci A",9,1188,neurology,2025-11-22

Our first article focused on British and French physicians, places and events. In this second part of our review we have examined the interactions between British and French Neurological Societies and Journals, including: (1) The Neurological Society of London founded in 1886, which became the Section of Neurology of the Royal Society of Medicine; (2) The Société de Neurologie de Paris founded in 1899, later renamed as The Société Française de Neurologie; (3) The journal Brain and its precursors and successors; (4) The journal Revue Neurologique and its precursors. We illustrate the constructive influence of Anglo-French interactions on the early development of neurology by the distinguished physicians who were corresponding members respectively of the British and French Neurological Societies and the scientific articles published by French authors in Brain and by British scientists in Nouvelle Iconographie de la Salpêtrière, Archives de Neurologie and Revue Neurologique.",Revue neurologique,2022-Apr,"Reynolds EH, Broussolle E",2,1195,neurology,2025-11-22

A 34-question survey was distributed to 4,644 US-based American Academy of Neurology members who self-identified as researchers in 2020 addressing the following domains: research and funding, scholarly activities, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) effect, and local institutional climate. A total of 700 (15%) individuals completed the survey (women, n = 231; men, n = 426), with 71% White and >80% conducting research. Women respondents were significantly younger than men, more likely to be assistant professors (32% vs 21%), and less likely to be full professors (18% vs 39%). Compared with men, women received equivalent grants and research support and had comparable or additional formal research training and mentorship. Women had less middle author publications (mean 5.8 [SD 9.2] vs mean 8.2 [SD 11.8], <i>p</i> = 0.03) compared with men but similar first or last author publications (mean 4.3[5.4] vs 6.1 [9.8], <i>p</i> = 0.05). A lower proportion of women presented research at grand rounds or at a national/international conference compared with men (58% vs 69%, <i>p</i> = 0.01). Women spent more time in nonprofessional responsibilities, were less satisfied with their work-life balance, and were less likely to agree with statements addressing equity/diversity and institutional climate. Respondents shared their concerns regarding how the pandemic was affecting neurology research careers, with a higher proportion of women reporting that family responsibilities affected research activities and lead to delayed submission of non-COVID-19-related manuscripts. Our survey of US-based neurology researchers demonstrated continued gender-based disparities in academic rank, manuscript authorship, and invited speaking engagements, although funding opportunities and access to additional training were equivalent. Women were less likely than men to agree that neurology departments support diversity and equity and that the institutional climate was inclusive and transparent. The pandemic had affected both genders in research, but areas were different for women related to family responsibilities. This article also highlights additional areas of research and areas for intervention to improve and reduce gender disparities among neurology researchers.",Neurology,2023-Jan,"Hall DA, Cahill C, Meyer AL, Peltier A, Dy-Hollins M, Goldman M",6,2351,neurology,2025-11-22

Balancing the safety of our residents as well as the anticipated inpatient service demands, we have, and continue to, make changes to meet the needs of our community. Education certainly has been affected but we have made great effort to maintain normalcy. We are leveraging web-based technologies to continue formal didactics. The American Academy of Neurology has provided program directors with various tools to share to provide high-yield academic education. AAN Synapse, distance learning modules, and podcasts are a few examples. Each residency training program will likely face different challenges depending on location and community structure. We have an obligation to help all of our colleagues in the hospital in providing quality and compassionate care during this time of need.

This new domain recognizes that both health and disease are directly affected by hormonal and reproductive changes throughout the life span. This field includes neurologic diseases with a higher prevalence in women and diseases that require specialized management during pregnancy, postpartum period, lactation, and menopause. A survey was sent to US neurology residency program directors to understand the state of training in the area. Their responses highlighted an urgent need for additional education in this field for neurology residents. In this study, we discuss the educational gaps in this area, the clinical benefits of a women's neurology discipline, and the instructional gaps in this area and provide practical recommendations for training programs in women's neurology using 2 innovative fellowship programs.",Neurology,2023-Jan,"LaHue SC, Paolini S, Waters JFR, O'Neal MA",4,933,neurology,2025-11-22
39369698,Neurology of Aging: Adapting Neurology Provision for an Aging Population.,"Over the past few decades, advances in the neurology of aging have been considerable and have led to a better understanding of the science of age-related neurological disorders. Likewise, it changed the perception of classical neurology practice, research, and the way of looking at age-related conditions. Neurological disorders are the most frequent cause of major disability in the elderly and account for almost half of the incapacitation occurring beyond age 65 and more than 90% of serious dependency. However, a number of neurological changes occur also in the absence of a specific disease, making the assessment and management of neurological complaints and findings a specific expertise. Maximizing success in clinical care of the elderly requires expertise in geriatric neurology, which includes an understanding of current research regarding aging and age-related neurological dysfunctions, and the ability to work with other geriatric healthcare providers. Although current therapies for neurodegenerative diseases mainly offer symptomatic relief without slowing progression, the landscape is evolving. Biomarkers of pathology and neuroimaging have continued to develop, with a significant impact on diagnosis and treatment. These advances have not only helped to improve our knowledge of disease pathophysiology but also disease stages, guiding symptomatic monitoring, and possible therapeutic options at a pre-symptomatic stage. Neurological disorders are a leading cause of major disability and dependency in the elderly, underscoring the need for expertise in geriatric neurology for effective clinical care of this population. Although current therapies for neurodegenerative diseases primarily provide symptomatic relief without slowing disease progression, advancements in biomarkers and neuroimaging are significantly evolving. These advancements enhance our understanding of disease pathophysiology and stages, guiding symptomatic monitoring and potential therapeutic options at a pre-symptomatic stage. As knowledge about age-associated conditions is steadily rising and geriatric medicine gains further recognition, this article argues for a new focus on the role of neurologists in geriatric medicine, emphasizing the importance of integrating current research and collaborative care approaches in the management of elderly patients.",Neuro-degenerative diseases,2025-,"Stancu P, Hentsch L, Seeck M, Zekry D, Graf C, Fleury V, Assal F",7,2358,neurology,2025-11-22
34129702,Subspecialty training of neurology residents and junior neurologists in the Baltic States.,"Neurology is a field of increasing subspecialization. There is no published data regarding the proportion of neurology subspecialists in the Baltic States. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify factors associated with neurology subspecialty choice, to examine possible differences between neurology residents' and junior neurologists' view of subspecialty, and to assess perceived subspecialty acquisition opportunities and subspecialty attractiveness. The research was conducted as an anonymous online survey between December 28, 2020, and January 24, 2021 of neurology residents and neurologists who completed their residency during the last 5 years in the Baltic States. In total, 72 residents and 65 neurologists participated. ""Cerebrovascular diseases"" and ""multiple sclerosis and autoimmune diseases of the nervous system"" were rated as the two most attractive subspecialties by residents, whereas ""headache"" and ""clinical neurophysiology"" were the most attractive among junior neurologists. ""Vertigo and dizziness"" and ""dementia"" were ranked the least attractive among both groups. ""Cerebrovascular diseases"" were perceived as having the most acquisition opportunities. The two most common determinants of subspecialty choice were ""medical content of the subspecialty"" and ""influence of mentor during undergraduate studies or residency"". Two-thirds of junior neurologists subspecialize in at least one subspecialty, and one-third of residents are already determined to pursue subspecialty training. Junior neurologists rated most outpatient-related subspecialties as more attractive than neurology residents. Between the Baltic States' universities, there was a significant difference in the number of residents who were determined to pursue subspecialty training.",European journal of neurology,2021-Nov,"Jokubaitis M, Kõrv J, Karelis G, Jatužis D, Vaitkus A, Ryliškienė K",6,1787,neurology,2025-11-22

Even within academia there remains a persistent lack of representation of women and racial minorities, but with the recent spotlight on discrimination it is more necessary than ever that prevailing disparities are acknowledged by medical journals and reflected in their publication priorities. This bibliometric study assesses whether social justice trends have influenced the number of articles published that discuss gender and racial disparity in the past 5 years within the top three leading neurological journals. Our assumption is that any trend towards more publications related to gender and racial disparities are reflective of the publication priorities of, and thus the perceived relevance to, the editorial boards of the chosen journals. Using key word search of ""gender,"" ""race,"" and ""disparity"" in the title or context of published papers, the archives of Lancet Neurology, Nature Reviews Neurology, and Alzheimer's &amp; Dementia were reviewed. The results indicated that although there was a slight overall increase in coverage of the aforementioned topics, it was negligible compared to the broad impact of current social justice movements.

Classroom teaching had to be converted almost entirely to digital formats within a short period of time. The present study provides an overview of the respective changes and associated complications as well as opportunities in teaching Neurology. <b>Methodology:</b> Lecturers in Neurology at all University hospitals in Germany were asked about their approach and the individual changes in their curriculum. Of a total of 39 locations, 23 answered the online questionnaire (see attachment 1). <b>Results:</b> While frontal teaching and lectures could be carried out digitally without any problems, difficulties arose especially in learning physical examination and bedside teaching. Most of the participants stated that they had not found satisfactory e-learning formats to replace teaching at the patients bed. <b>Conclusion:</b> The ad hoc changes in teaching Neurology resulted in significant additional effort for the part of lecturers, but were generally well accepted by students.

34748973,Feasibility and effectiveness appraisal of a neurology residency health equities curriculum.,"Despite increasing awareness of inequities in healthcare in neurology, health equity is not a core competency of neurology training. To meet this need, we implemented a health equities curriculum for neurology residents at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. A seven-lecture health equities curriculum was implemented during the 2019-2020 academic year. Surveys were distributed pre-and post-curriculum to assess resident demographics, previous training in health equities, curriculum effectiveness addressing health equities topics, and resident appraisal of the curriculum. On average, residents attended 2-3 lectures. Most of the residents who participated were White-Non Latinx women. Residents who did not participate in the curriculum listed clinical responsibilities as the main reason for absenteeism. Residents who participated felt the curriculum was at least somewhat effective in addressing health disparities, cultural competency, and implicit bias. 64% of the residents felt the curriculum was effective in improving their preparedness in caring for underserved patients. Implementing a health equities curriculum in neurology residency programs is feasible and well-received by residents. Given inconsistent attendance and a small sample size, we are unable to assess its true effectiveness. Nonetheless, residents felt it prepared them in addressing disparities in neurological care. A longer curriculum will help in assessing the effectiveness of this curriculum intervention. A standard health equities curriculum should be implemented across neurology residency programs, and health equities should be considered a core competency topic for the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) certification.",Journal of the neurological sciences,2021-Dec,"Mendizabal A, Fan JH, Price RS, Hamilton RH",4,1740,neurology,2025-11-22

In 2017, 27 medical students and 15 residents participated in 5 focus groups, and 33 fourth-year medical students participated in semistructured individual interviews. Participants were asked predefined open-ended questions about specialty choice, experiences in their basic neuroscience course and neurology clerkship, and perceptions about the field. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. We used a flexible coding methodology to generate themes across groups and interviews. Four main analytical themes emerged: (1) early and broad clinical exposure allows students to ""try on"" neurology and experience the variety of career options; (2) preclerkship experiences and a strong neuroscience curriculum lay the foundation for interest in the field; (3) personal interactions with neurology providers may attract or deter students from considering the specialty; and (4) persistent stereotypes about neurologists, neurology patients, and treatment options harm student perceptions of neurology. Efforts to draw more students to neurology may benefit from focusing on clinical correlations during preclerkship neuroscience courses and offering earlier and more diverse clinical experiences, including hands-on responsibilities whenever possible. Finally, optimizing student interactions with faculty and residents and reinforcing the many positive aspects of neurology are likely to favorably affect student perceptions.",Neurology,2020-Aug,"Jordan JT, Cahill C, Ostendorf T, Gutmann L, Navarro A, Gamaldo CE, Santini VE, Ali I, Soni M, Wilson RB, Said RR, Czeisler BM, Rock M, Smith AG",14,1649,neurology,2025-11-22

We aimed to evaluate how breaking bad news training was implemented in neurology residency programs in Brazil and to assess the perception and preparedness of trainees and program directors. We performed a cross-sectional descriptive study. Neurology trainees and program directors were recruited from the Brazilian Academy of Neurology registry through convenience sampling. Participants answered a survey evaluating the breaking bad news training at their institution and their preparedness and perception towards the topic. We collected 172 responses from 47 neurology institutions from all five socio-demographic regions of Brazil. More than 77% of trainees were dissatisfied with their breaking bad news training, and around 92% of program directors believed their programs required substantial improvement. Approximately 31% of neurology trainees reported never having a lecture about communicating bad news, 66% reported never having a simulated training, and nearly 61% never received feedback regarding their communication abilities. Moreover, 59% of program directors acknowledged that feedback was not a standard practice and nearly 32% reported the absence of any specific training. This study suggested that the breaking bad news training in neurology residencies across Brazil is deficient and highlighted challenges to achieve this core competency. Program directors and trainees recognized the importance of the topic, and program directors acknowledged that many factors hinder the ability to implement formal training. Given the relevance of such a skill to patient care, every effort should be made to provide structured training opportunities during residency.","Einstein (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",2023-,"Lima TAC, Bruno FP, Gushken F, Degani-Costa LH, Novaes NP",5,2095,neurology,2025-11-22
39018988,Global impact of a virtual neurology morning report.,"The global shortage and inequitable distribution of neurologists has led to significant gaps not only in neurology care, but also in neurology education. In order to increase access to neurology education, we developed neurology virtual morning report (NVMR), a virtual, open-access, case-based clinical reasoning conference available to learners worldwide. To evaluate NVMR's impact on participants' perception of, interest in, and confidence in neurology, we conducted a survey. Respondents represented 25 different countries of various income levels. The majority of respondents reported that NVMR decreased their perception of difficulty in understanding neurology and increased confidence in various clinical reasoning domains in neurology. Additionally, the majority of medical student participants showed an increased interest in pursuing neurology as a future specialty after participating in NVMR. NVMR represents a potential model for virtual educational conferences and highlights the opportunities digital education has to improve equitable access to neurology education.",Journal of the neurological sciences,2024-Aug,"Alemán MJ, Roldan V, Pucci GF, Penner JC, Nematollahi S, Berkowitz AL",6,1083,neurology,2025-11-22
33883241,Robert Wartenberg and the American Academy of Neurology.,"Robert Wartenberg (1887-1956) was born in Grodno (in present-day Belarus) and received his medical degree in Germany in 1919. He enjoyed a productive career at the University of Freiburg until 1935, when he fled Nazi Germany for the United States. Bernard Sachs, with whom he had worked during a Rockefeller fellowship in 1926, helped him secure a position at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco in 1936. He was popular with students there as his sizeable personality translated into an engaging classroom style, but that same personality could create friction with colleagues. Following World War II, neurology as a specialty was growing and establishing its place in the medical landscape. With this goal in mind, A.B. Baker and other young neurologic leaders formed the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) in 1948 as an inclusive professional society. Baker recruited Wartenberg to join, he agreed, and immediately provided his own critiques on the organization. Wartenberg's standing in the academic community combined with his strong personality would serve Baker well as Wartenberg shielded the young AAN leadership from potential retribution. He was especially invested in ensuring the Academy had a journal as a means of development, and the journal <i>Neurology®</i> was born. Wartenberg died on November 16, 1956, and was honored for his service to the Academy with the Robert Wartenberg Memorial Lecture, which stands today as one of the principal events at the Annual Meeting.",Neurology,2021-Aug,"Burkholder DB, Boes CJ",2,1513,neurology,2025-11-22

36266043,Emerging Subspecialties in Neurology: Cortical Careers in Neuropalliative Care.,"Serious neurologic illnesses are associated with significant palliative care (PC) needs, including symptom management, complex decision-making, support for caregivers, and end-of-life care. While all neurologists are responsible for the provision of primary PC, there is an increasing need for trained neurologists with expertise in palliative medicine to manage refractory symptoms, mitigate conflict around goals of care, and provide specialized end-of-life care. This has led to the emergence of neuropalliative care (NPC) as a subspecialty. There are different ways to acquire PC skills, incorporate them into one's neurology practice, and develop a neuropalliative carer. We interviewed 3 leaders in the field of NPC, Dr. Robert Holloway, Dr. Jessica McFarlin, and Dr. Janis Miyasaki, who are all neurologists with different subspecialties and training pathways working in academic centers. They share their career paths, their advice for neurology trainees interested in pursuing a career in NPC, and their thoughts on the future of the field.",Neurology,2023-Jan,"Ng M, McFarlin J, Holloway RG, Miyasaki J, Kramer NM",5,1049,neurology,2025-11-22

In order to establish recommendations on this matter, the Spanish Society of Neurology's Headache Study Group (GECSEN) has decided to issue a series of agreed recommendations constituting a referral protocol for patients with headache and/or craniofacial neuralgias. Young neurologists with an interest and experience in headache were invited to draft a series of practical guidelines in collaboration with GECSEN's Executive Committee. For practical reasons, the document was divided into 2 articles: the first focuses on primary headaches and craniofacial neuralgias and this second article on secondary headaches and other craniofacial pain. In order for the recommendations to be helpful for daily practice, they follow a practical approach, with tables summarising referral criteria, examinations to be performed, and referral to other specialists. We hope to offer a guide and tools to improve decision-making regarding patients with headache, identifying complementary tests to prioritise and referral pathways to be followed, in order to avoid duplicated consultations and delayed diagnosis and treatment.",Neurologia,2020-Jun,"Gago-Veiga AB, Díaz de Terán J, González-García N, González-Oria C, González-Quintanilla V, Minguez-Olaondo A, Santos-Lasaosa S, Viguera Romero J, Pozo-Rosich P",9,1391,neurology,2025-11-22
29279256,The popularity of neurology in Spain: An analysis of specialty selection.,"Neurology is one of the medical specialties offered each year to residency training candidates. This project analyses the data associated with candidates choosing neurology residency programmes in recent years. Data related to specialty selection were obtained from official reports by the Spanish Ministry of Health, Social Services, and Equality. Information was collected on several characteristics of teaching centres: availability of stroke units, endovascular intervention, national reference clinics for neurology, specific on-call shifts for neurology residents, and links with medical schools or national research networks. The median selection list position of candidates selecting neurology training has been higher year on year; neurology was among the 4 most popular residency programmes in 2016. Potential residents were mainly female, Spanish, and had good academic results. The median number of hospitals with higher numbers of beds, endovascular intervention, stroke units, and national reference clinics for neurology is significantly lower. This is also true when centers are analysed by presence of specific on-call shifts for neurology residents and association with medical schools or national research networks. The centres selected by candidates with the highest median selection list position in 2012-2016 were the Clínico San Carlos, 12 de Octubre, and Vall d'Hebron university hospitals. Neurology has gradually improved in residency selection choices and is now one of the 4 most popular options.

36528784,"Attitudes of physiotherapy students toward neurology: does ""neurophobia"" exist among physiotherapy students?","Evidence is accumulating that medical students and practitioners have particular difficulty in neurology and have neurophobia. However, little is known about attitudes toward neurology in physiotherapy students. This study aimed to assess the attitudes of physiotherapy students toward neurology and compare it with other core specialties, identify contributors to difficulties of neurology, and obtain feedback for improving the quality of neurology and neurological rehabilitation education. A structured survey was distributed to final-year physiotherapy students in different universities across Turkey. Perceived level of knowledge, confidence, interest, difficulty, and desire to pursue a career in four main physiotherapy specialty areas (neurology, musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, and pediatric) were assessed. Reasons for perceived difficulty and ways to improve neurological physiotherapy education were asked by Likert-type and open-ended questions. Three hundred ninety-one students participated from 12 universities. Neurology was perceived as the most challenging discipline (p < .001), but a lack of knowledge, interest, and confidence were not reported. The reasons for perceived difficulties with neurology were the need-to-know basic neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, difficulty integrating information into the clinic, and the complexity of the subject. To improve learning, most students recommended increasing clinical teaching, including bedside tutorials, exposure to more patients, and case discussions. Physiotherapy students considered neurology as the most challenging discipline. Improving the integration of basic neurosciences into the clinic may improve neurology learning along with increased clinical teaching.",Physiotherapy theory and practice,2024-Apr,"Abasıyanık Z, Emük Y, Kahraman T",3,1745,neurology,2025-11-22

A prospective qualitative study using pre- and post-elective written questionnaires. Analysis concentrated on three main themes: What did students learn about the specialty of Neurology? What would they change about their experience? Did their opinions change? Major findings were (i) pre- and post-elective the most frequent response for ""what is the best thing about Neurology?"" was the ""process of localization"" and (ii) post-elective students were less likely to cite the challenge or problem-solving aspect of Neurology as the best thing while more emphasized the importance of the physical exam and the variety of cases. (iii) Students were most surprised by the scope of neurological practice. (iv) They would diversify the setting of their elective to include less time spent in the emergency room and more time in clinic. (v) The perception of Neurology as a specialty in which patients have a poor prognosis was the opinion that changed the most. Showcasing the diversity of cases and careers in Neurology may be a useful strategy to increase interest in the specialty and reduce neurophobia. Lectures or small groups early in medical school should concentrate on clear examples of common neurological conditions and emphasize the role of general neurologists and subspecialists involved in patient care. Whenever possible students should rotate through different clinics and not concentrate exclusively on emergency room and in-patient cases.",The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

39355905,Telestroke Training: Considerations for Expansion of Vascular Neurology Program Requirements.,"Telemedicine for stroke (Telestroke) has been a key component to efficient, widespread acute stroke care for many years. The expansion of reimbursement through the Furthering Access to Stroke Telemedicine Act and rapid deployment of telemedicine resources during the COVID-19 public health emergency have further expanded remote care, with practitioners of varying educational backgrounds, and experience providing acute stroke care via telemedicine (Telestroke). Some Telestroke practitioners have not had fellowship-level vascular neurology training and many are without training specific to virtual modalities. While many vascular neurology fellowship programs incorporate Telestroke training into the curriculum, components of this curriculum are not consistent, extent of involvement is variable, and not all fellows receive hands-on training in remote care. Furthermore, the extent of training and evaluation of Telestroke in American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology training requirements and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education assessments for vascular neurology fellowship are not standardized. We suggest that Telestroke be formally incorporated into vascular neurology fellowship curricula and provide considerations for key components of this training and metrics for evaluation.",Stroke,2025-Jan,"Guzik AK, Jagolino-Cole AL, Mijalski Sells C, Southerland AM, Dumitrascu OM, Sreekrishnan A, Martini SR, Meyer BC",8,1309,neurology,2025-11-22
35753147,Adult Neurology Rotations for Child Neurology Residents: Exploring the Resident Perspective.,"In 2014 the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education modified adult training requirements for child neurology certification to reduce the number of hospital-based rotations and require inclusion of outpatient clinic and electives. We aimed to identify how these training requirements are being met and explored its impact on residents. A REDCap questionnaire surveying resident opinion on impact of adult training on resident education, professional development, and wellness was e-mailed to 79 program directors in the United States for distribution in 2020. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and t test calculations. Qualitative analysis of narrative responses involved theme identification. A total of 116 child neurology residents participated (30.2% PGY-3, 37.9% PGY-4, and 31.9% PGY-5 residents); 20.9% had all adult rotations during the PGY-3 year, and 79.1% had adult rotations spread throughout residency. Adult training had a small positive impact on resident autonomy and a negative impact on resident wellness regardless of training structure. However, residents with 12 months of adult training during PGY-3 year scored worse on burnout, mood changes, work-life balance, and social well-being (P < 0.05). Some themes identified included residents feeling unsafe due to lack of supervision, that education was not prioritized, and that adult patient care lacked relevance to long-term career goals. Adult neurology training was found to negatively affect child neurology resident wellness, with a larger negative impact when adult training was completed in 12 months during PGY-3 year. Other identified areas where change could be implemented include improving feelings of resident safety and prioritizing quality and relevance of education.",Pediatric neurology,2022-Aug,"Deng S, Marshall CS, Gilbert DL, Jackson HS, Wolf DS, Thompson-Stone R",6,1782,neurology,2025-11-22
39236270,Common Critiques and Recommendations for Studies in Neurology Using Machine Learning Methods.,"Machine learning (ML) methods are becoming more prevalent in the neurology literature as alternatives to traditional statistical methods to address challenges in the analysis of modern data sets. Despite the increase in the popularity of ML methods in neurology studies, some authors do not fully address all items recommended in reporting guidelines. The authors of this Research Methods article are members of the <i>Neurology</i>® editorial board and have reviewed many studies using ML methods. In their review reports, several critiques often appear, which could be avoided if guidance were available. In this article, we detail common critiques found in ML research studies and make recommendations for how to avoid them. The first critique involves misalignment of the study goals and the analysis conducted. The second critique focuses on ML terminology being appropriately used. Critiques 3-6 are related to the study design: justifying sample sizes and the suitability of the data set for the study goals, describing the ML analysis pipeline sufficiently, quantifying the amount of missing data and providing information about missing data handling, and including uncertainty estimates for key metrics. The seventh critique focuses on fairly describing both strengths and limitations of the ML study, including the analysis methodology and results. We provide examples in neurology for each critique and guidance on how to avoid the critique. Overall, we recommend that authors use ML-specific checklists developed by research consortia for designing and reporting studies using ML. We also recommend that authors involve both a statistician and an ML expert in work that uses ML. Although our list of critiques is not exhaustive, our recommendations should help improve the quality and rigor of ML studies. ML has great potential to revolutionize neurology, but investigators need to conduct and report the results in a way that allows readers to fully evaluate the benefits and limitations of ML approaches.",Neurology,2024-Oct,"Speiser JL, Kerr WT, Ziegler A",3,2019,neurology,2025-11-22
33931541,"Training in Neurology: Implementation and Evaluation of an Objective Structured Clinical-Examination Tool for Neurology Postgraduate Trainees in Lusaka, Zambia.","We established Zambia's first neurology residency program at the University of Zambia School of Medicine and the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a modified objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) to assess clinical skills. The neurology training program's 3 participants completed the OSCE exercise in February 2019. We used smartphones to videotape trainees performing a physical examination and oral presentation in the neurology clinic. Trainees and faculty reviewed the videos independently using a standardized rubric and then met for in-person feedback. Three trainees completed pre- and post-OSCE surveys rating their confidence in elements of the history and examination. Trainees' average self-confidence scores improved from the pre- to post-OSCE survey in every category (pre-OSCE: mean score 6.84, range 4.8-7.8, SD 0.92; post-OSCE: mean score 7.9, range 5.67-9.33, SD 0.86). Qualitative feedback showed trainees found the OSCE helpful, routinely applied feedback, and would appreciate repeating OSCEs. OSCEs improve trainees' self-confidence and can be modified and successfully implemented in a resource-limited neurology postgraduate training program. Important OSCE modifications involved using smartphones for videotaping and a real patient encounter rather than a standardized patient. Embedding the experience within a busy clinic day was practical, applicable, and efficient. Future work should expand use of OSCEs both within the Zambian neurology residency program and non-neurology training programs. Including additional video reviewers could add to the validity of clinical skills assessment. Videos could also be used for remote mentorship and teaching purposes.",Neurology,2021-Aug,"DiBiase RM, Salas RME, Gamaldo CE, Nutakki A, Elicer I, Attarian HP, Kapembwa KC, Strowd RE, Tackett S, Saylor DR",10,1754,neurology,2025-11-22
31896619,Eponyms are here to stay: Usage in the literature and among current neurology trainees.,"To assess the historical trends of medical eponym use in neurology literature and knowledge and attitudes among current trainees related to eponyms. A comprehensive list of medical eponyms compiled from multiple online and print sources was queried against the titles and abstracts of PubMed articles authored by neurologists to assess historical prevalence in the literature from 1988 to 2013. We also surveyed current neurology trainees and trainees who have matched for residency in neurology, but not yet started neurology training, on their familiarity and attitudes toward eponyms. The yearly prevalence of eponyms among neurologist-authored publications ranged from 15% and 25%, with a mean of 21%. The total number of unique eponyms appearing in titles and abstracts increased from 693 in 1988 to 1,076 in 2013, representing 1.8% average annual growth. Our survey showed that residents with at least 1 year of neurology training reported familiarity with significantly more eponyms than those before neurology training (<i>p</i> < 0.001). For familiar eponyms, most residents were either unaware of an alternative descriptor or preferred using the eponym. Despite recognizing both the benefits and drawbacks of eponyms, the vast majority of trainees stated that historical precedent, pervasiveness, and ease of use would drive the continued use of eponyms in neurology. Eponyms will remain a cornerstone in medical education and communication moving forward. Educators in neurology should consider how best to integrate useful eponyms and alternative descriptors into residency training to enhance knowledge acquisition and retention.",Neurology,2020-Feb,"Zheng J, Gold CA",2,1642,neurology,2025-11-22
35842132,Impact of new technologies on neurology in Spain. Review by the New Technologies Ad-Hoc Committee of the Spanish Society of Neurology.,"New technologies are increasingly widespread in biomedicine. Using the consensus definition of new technologies established by the New Technologies Ad-Hoc Committee of the Spanish Society of Neurology (SEN), we evaluated the impact of these technologies on Spanish neurology, based on communications presented at Annual Meetings of the SEN. We defined the concept of new technology in neurology as a novel technology or novel application of an existing technology, characterised by a certain degree of coherence persisting over time, with the potential to have an impact on the present and/or future of neurology. We conducted a descriptive study of scientific communications presented at the SEN's annual meetings from 2012 to 2018, analysing the type of technology, the field of neurology, and the geographical provenance of the studies. We identified 299 communications related with new technologies from a total of 8139 (3.7%), including 120 posters and 179 oral communications, ranging from 1.6% of all communications in 2012 to 6.8% in 2018. The technologies most commonly addressed were advanced neuroimaging (24.7%), biosensors (17.1%), electrophysiology and neurostimulation (14.7%), and telemedicine (13.7%). The neurological fields where new technologies were most widely employed were movement disorders (18.4%), cerebrovascular diseases (15.7%), and dementia (13.4%). Madrid was the region presenting the highest number of communications related to new technologies (32.8%), followed by Catalonia (26.8%) and Andalusia (9.0%).

The Resident and Research Fellow Section (RRFS) of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) has decided to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on neurology training. All EAN RRFS members were invited to fill out an online questionnaire of 40 items concerning their clinical involvement during the COVID-19 emergency, and the impact of the pandemic on their training (Appendix S1). Of the 227 RRFS members who completed the questionnaire, 222 were from Europe, and of those 111 were from Portugal, Italy or France. Responders highlighted that severe restrictions have been imposed to face this pandemic, including reduction of inpatient beds, prohibition of in-person visits and limitation to hospital access for patients' relatives. This was accompanied by an increase in email correspondence and phone calls with 50% of countries allowing telemedicine to reach outpatients. Seventy-nine per cent of the respondents felt that the pandemic will probably have a serious impact on their training and career.

34846584,Burnout among neurology residents during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national cross-sectional study.,"Neurology residents are particularly vulnerable to burnout because of the novel logistical and clinical challenges brought about by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite its implications, knowledge on burnout and its predictors among neurology residents is lacking. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of burnout among neurology residents during the pandemic, to compare burnout subscale scores and sociodemographic and work characteristics, and to explore residents' perceptions on how to address burnout. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among all 120 residents from the nine institutions in the Philippines offering neurology residency programs from March to August 2020. We obtained sociodemographic and work characteristics using questionnaire. We measured burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. We performed an inductive thematic analysis to analyze perceptions on how to reduce burnout. The response rate was 71.67% (86/120). The mean age was 30.1 ± 3.1 years. Using predefined subscale critical boundaries, the prevalence of burnout was 94% (95% CI 89, 99). The lack of compensation and number of on-duty days influenced emotional exhaustion scores. The number of on-duty days influenced depersonalization scores. Thematic analysis revealed five themes: increasing manpower; self-care; reducing clerical tasks; improving work environment; and adequate compensation.

37487753,Examining the National Representativeness of the Axon Registry: A Neurology-Specific Patient Registry.,"The objective of this study was to determine the external validity of the Axon Registry by comparing the 2019 calendar year data with 2 nationally representative, publicly available data sources, specifically the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). The Axon Registry is the American Academy of Neurology's neurology-focused qualified clinical data registry that reports and analyzes electronic health record data from participating US neurology providers. Its key function is to support quality improvement within ambulatory neurology practices while also promoting high-quality evidence-based care in clinical neurology. We compared demographics of patients who had an outpatient or office visit with a neurologist along with prevalence of selected neurologic conditions and neurologic procedures across the 3 data sets. We performed a cross-sectional, retrospective comparison of 3 data sets: NAMCS (2012-2016), MEPS (2013-2017, 2019), and Axon Registry (2019). We obtained patient demographics (age, birth sex, race, ethnicity), patient neurologic conditions (headache, epilepsy, cerebrovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, parkinsonism, dementia, spinal pain, and polyneuropathy), provider location, and neurologic procedures (neurology visits, MR/CT neuroimaging studies and EEG/EMG neurophysiologic studies). Parameter estimates from the pooled 5-year samples of the 2 public data sets, calculated at the visit level, were compared descriptively with those of the Axon Registry. We calculated Cohen <i>h</i> and performed Wald tests (α = 0.05) to conduct person-level statistical comparisons between MEPS 2019 and Axon Registry 2019 data. The Axon Registry recorded 1.3 M annual neurology visits (NAMCS, 11 M; MEPS, 22 M) and 645 K people with neurologic conditions (MEPS, 10 M). Compared with the pooled national surveys, the Axon Registry has similar patient demographics, neurologic condition prevalence, neuroimaging and neurophysiologic utilization, and provider location. In direct comparison with MEPS 2019, the Axon Registry 2019 had fewer children (2% vs 7%), more elderly persons (21% vs 16%), fewer non-Black and non-White race persons (5% vs 8%), less number of patients with epilepsy (10% vs 13%), more patients with dementia (8% vs 6%), more patients with cerebrovascular disease (11% vs 8%), and a greater predominance of neurology providers in the Midwest (25% vs 20%). The only difference with a non-negligible effect size was the proportion of people younger than 15 years (Cohen <i>h</i> = 0.25). The Axon Registry demonstrates high concordance with 2 nationally representative surveys.

39237894,Evaluating guideline and registration policies among neurology journals: a cross-sectional analysis.,"Neurological disorders have had a substantial rise the last three decades, imposing substantial burdens on both patients and healthcare costs. Consequently, the demand for high-quality research has become crucial for exploring effective treatment options. However, current neurology research has some limitations in terms of transparency, reproducibility, and reporting bias. The adoption of reporting guidelines (RGs) and trial registration policies has been proven to address these issues and improve research quality in other medical disciplines. It is unclear the extent to which these policies are being endorsed by neurology journals. Therefore, our study aims to evaluate the publishing policies of top neurology journals regarding RGs and trial registration. For this cross-sectional study, neurology journals were identified using the 2021 Scopus CiteScore Tool. The top 100 journals were listed and screened for eligibility for our study. In a masked, duplicate fashion, investigators extracted data on journal characteristics, policies on RGs, and policies on trial registration using information from each journal's Instruction for Authors webpage. Additionally, investigators contacted journal editors to ensure information was current and accurate. No human participants were involved in this study. Our data collection and analyses were performed from December 14, 2022, to January 9, 2023. Of the 356 neurology journals identified, the top 100 were included into our sample. The five-year impact of these journals ranged from 50.844 to 2.226 (mean [SD], 7.82 [7.01]). Twenty-five (25.0%) journals did not require or recommend a single RG within their Instructions for Authors webpage, and a third (33.0%) did not require or recommend clinical trial registration. The most frequently mentioned RGs were CONSORT (64.6%), PRISMA (52.5%), and ARRIVE (53.1%). The least mentioned RG was QUOROM (1.0%), followed by MOOSE (9.0%), and SQUIRE (17.9%). While many top neurology journals endorse the use of RGs and trial registries, there are still areas where their adoption can be improved. Addressing these shortcomings leads to further advancements in the field of neurology, resulting in higher-quality research and better outcomes for patients.",BMC neurology,2024-Sep,"Tran AV, Stadler JK, Ernst Z, Smith CA, Nees D, Hughes GK, Vassar M",7,2255,neurology,2025-11-22
32913017,Training in Neurology: Feedback from Graduates About the Psychiatry Component of Residency Training.,"To obtain feedback from early career adult and pediatric neurologists about the psychiatry component of residency training. A survey was developed and administered electronically to 4 cohorts of recently certified American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology diplomates. The response rate was 16% (431/2,677) and included 330 adult neurologists and 101 pediatric neurologists. Fewer than half of the respondents described themselves as extremely or quite satisfied with their psychiatry training whereas 26% of the adult neurologists and 33% of the pediatric neurologists felt slightly or not at all prepared for this component of practice. Four themes were identified in the respondents' suggestions for improving psychiatry training: provide more outpatient experience; provide more time/teaching in psychiatry; provide more experience with both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic psychiatric treatments; and provide more exposure to patients with conditions likely to be encountered in neurology/child neurology practice. These recent graduates of adult and pediatric neurology residency programs felt underprepared for the psychiatric issues they encountered in their patients. They suggested a number of strategies for better alignment of psychiatry training with the likely demands of practice. A model curriculum recently developed by the American Academy of Neurology's Consortium of Neurology Program Directors and the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training also provides guidance for both neurology and psychiatry program directors.",Neurology,2021-Feb,"Juul D, Gutmann L, Adams HP, O'Shea SA, Faulkner LR",5,1569,neurology,2025-11-22

Information about training programs and certification was obtained from the records of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, and diplomates were surveyed about their CNP practice activities and attitudes toward certification/recertification. In the years since the first examination was administered, a robust number of CNP training programs developed, but recently, there has been a decrease in the number of programs and fellows, although the number of programs and fellows in the subspecialties of epilepsy, neuromuscular medicine, and sleep medicine has increased. A diplomate survey indicated that most respondents devoted significant practice time to CNP procedures, especially to EEGs and EMGs. Although more diplomates performed EEGs than EMGs, a substantial portion performed both. Most diplomates were planning to or had maintained certification in CNP. Over 3,000 neurologists, child neurologists, and psychiatrists have obtained certification in CNP, and the majority are participating in recertification. Although the newer and overlapping subspecialties of epilepsy, neuromuscular medicine, and sleep medicine may be having a negative impact on CNP, it continues to have a relatively large number of programs and attracts a relatively large number of fellows.",Neurology,2020-Oct,"Juul D, Levin KH, Gutmann L, Faulkner LR",4,1636,neurology,2025-11-22
38499194,Neurological Care within the Indian Health Service.,"American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) are the Indigenous peoples of the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 9.7 million people self-identified as AI/AN (alone or in combination with other races), representing 2.9% of the total U.S. population. These people represent diverse groups of discrete Tribes, each with their language, culture, and geographic home. As part of the conquest and settlement of North America, some Indigenous peoples signed treaties with the U.S. government, surrendering their lands in return for various government commitments, including health care. The Indian Health Service (IHS) was born out of these agreements. The IHS is an agency in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the U.S. Public Health Service. The IHS provides a comprehensive health service delivery system for approximately 2.7 million AI/AN who belong to 574 federally recognized Tribes/nations in 37 states. The aim of this paper is to make recommendations regarding the initiation of sustainable neurology care in marginalized or underserved populations by reviewing 40 years of neurology care provision within the IHS. We will discuss (1) the IHS, (2) neurological care provided within the IHS, including midlevel provider extension of neurology care and traditional medical care, and (3) select neurological diagnoses within AI/AN populations. Marginalized populations, including those in the United States that are rural, remote, or low socioeconomic status, lack access to specialty neurology care. This includes many AI/AN. The IHS has developed novel solutions to promote specialty care, including neurology. Notably, initial IHS investments in full-time neurology providers have led to more robust neurology care, often receiving attention from university programs. This suggests that an initial investment in stable on-site full-time neurology services provides a path to potential sustainable care for marginalized populations.",Seminars in neurology,2024-Apr,"Parko K, Stitzer M, Trimble B, Christensen L",4,1985,neurology,2025-11-22

To describe the development of a DEI committee within a neurology department and training program. The need to prioritize DEI as a critical focus within our neurology department led to the appointment of an initial task force who identified strategic priorities and stakeholders to establish a committee. DEI committee members included faculty, trainees, and staff, and this phase of the initiative took place from May 2019 through January 2021. The DEI committee was established and has met monthly for over one year. Initial meetings formulated goals of the initiative. Specific objectives were developed in the domains of recruitment, education, engagement, training, conflict resolution, and recognition. Early outcomes included augmented resident recruitment efforts of UiM students, curriculum changes including frequent representation of DEI topics in Grand Rounds, and measures to reduce unconscious bias. The creation of a DEI Committee within a specialty department such as neurology is feasible and can result in immediate and long-term actions related to recruitment and education in particular.

36187408,Components of Mid-clerkship Feedback in a Neurology Clerkship and their Impact on Subsequent Student Performance.,"Feedback during clinical rotations can be valuable in improving medical student education, but it is unclear what effect such feedback has on subsequent clinical performance and also which feedback topics are the most important in student growth and education. We compared medical student clinical performance before and after mid-clerkship feedback in a Neurology clerkship, with evaluators at the mid-clerkship and at the end blinded to the others' comments. We found that the most important areas holding back student clinical performance were communication, interpersonal interactions, and work ethic rather than textbook knowledge, or the ability to take a history, and do a physical and neurologic examination. Further, students who had concerning comments at the mid-clerkship feedback session usually continued to have the same problems after the feedback (in an admittedly short clerkship). The results suggest that more attention should be given to communication and other interpersonal skills and involvement in the clinical service during feedback sessions and that feedback continue over a much longer period than during a relatively brief Neurology clerkship alone.",The Yale journal of biology and medicine,2022-Sep,"Tarulli AW, Drislane FW",2,1179,neurology,2025-11-22

As with other media, podcast audio has been adapted for use within medical and specifically neurology education in the form of the Neurology Podcast since 2007. As podcasts were an initial step in the field of on-demand media, further technological evolution has resulted in increasing customization of a listener's audio experience. We believe a historical inflection point has been reached with the increasingly mainstream adoption of virtual assistant technology which allows for consumption of brief on-demand self-curated audio productions. As editors of the Neurology Podcast, we have introduced a new audio product to this technological landscape, the Neurology Minute. In doing so, we hope that curated on-demand educational audio will become a part of the daily routine of many practicing neurologists as we move into this new technological age.",Neurology,2020-Apr,"Ratliff J, Crowell J, Clardy SL, Burns T",4,987,neurology,2025-11-22
37926834,Discovering patterns in outpatient neurology appointments using state sequence analysis.,"Outpatient services in the UK, and in particular outpatient neurology services, are under considerable pressure with an ever-increasing gap between capacity and demand. To improve services, we first need to understand the current situation. This study aims to explore the patterns of appointment type seen in outpatient neurology, in order to identify potential opportunities for change. We use State Sequence Analysis (SSA) on routinely collected data from a single neurology outpatient clinic. SSA is an exploratory methodology which allows patterns within sequences of appointments to be discovered. We analyse sequences of appointments for the 18 months following a new appointment. Using SSA we create groups of similar appointment sequence patterns, and then analyse these clusters to determine if there are particular sequences common to different diagnostic categories. Of 1315 patients 887 patients had only one appointment. Among the 428 patients who had more than one appointment a 6 monthly cycle of appointments was apparent. SSA revealed that there were 11 distinct clusters of appointment sequence patterns. Further analysis showed that there are 3 diagnosis categories which have significant influence over which cluster a patient falls into: seizure/epilepsy, movement disorders, and headache. Neurology outpatient appointment sequences show great diversity, but there are some patterns which are common to specific diagnostic categories. Information about these common patterns could be used to inform the structure of future outpatient appointments.",BMC health services research,2023-Nov,"Biggin F, Ashcroft Q, Howcroft T, Knight J, Emsley H",5,1568,neurology,2025-11-22

Pediatric neurology may be perceived as less amenable to e-consults compared to other specialties. We performed a retrospective analysis of e-consults performed by pediatric neurologists at the University of Virginia. We reviewed the electronic medical records and analyzed the content of e-consults, recommendations from specialists, and subsequent actions by PCPs. Between April 2019 and April 2021, 58 e-consults were performed by pediatric neurologists. Most common indications included spells, headache, and tremor. In 56.9% of cases, the answer was provided without recommending a face-to-face (FTF) visit. For patients seen in clinic, e-consults reduced wait time and facilitated the clinic visit. E-consults are a suitable option for pediatric neurology, and they help with the workflow.

Hammond served as the 11th Surgeon General of the United States Army, acting during the Civil War. Throughout his time as Surgeon General, with influence from Florence Nightingale, Hammond enforced strict hygienic measures and called for the construction of pavilion style hospitals in order to decrease non-wound mortalities. He implemented further reformation of the American Medical Service that would improve efficiency and decrease general mortality for years to come. After his dismissal from the military service, Hammond continued to make meaningful achievements, spearheading the specialization of Neurology.

33990947,"Grand rounds education in neurology, with a focus on headache medicine.","To quantify the proportion of headache-related grand rounds in academic neurology programs and to compare this with adult neurology residency director views on the need for an increase in headache-related grand rounds. Although headache are among the most prevalent and most burdensome neurologic conditions, headache medicine is often considered underrepresented in neurology departments. Additionally, prior studies have shown that many neurology residency directors feel that training programs do not include an adequate amount of exposure to headache clinics or headache-related didactics. One important aspect of didactic education in neurology departments is adult neurology grand rounds. Previous publications have evaluated neither the proportion of headache-related grand rounds in academic neurology departments nor the residency program directors' views on appropriate amount of headache-related grand rounds. Our study has attempted to quantify this information to elucidate opportunities to improve practice educational gaps. In this cross-sectional study, we surveyed adult neurology residency directors (from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education [ACGME] listing of academic adult neurology residency programs) between October 2018 and September 2019. In addition, we used two methods to obtain the proportion of headache-related grand rounds in neurology: (1) emailing residency directors a questionnaire asking for a list of prior grand rounds topics and (2) an online search for each academic neurology program. First, for our grand rounds analysis, headache medicine consisted of 3.7% of the lectures in 2017-2018 and 6.3% of the lectures in 2018-2019 (average of each institution; 17 institutions and 411 total lectures in 2017-2018, 21 institutions and 463 total lectures in 2018-2019). The most common number of lectures on headache medicine for each grand rounds series was zero (for 7 of 17 grand rounds series in 2017-2018 and 7 of 21 in 2018-2019), followed closely by one lecture (for 6 of 17 grand rounds series in 2017-2018 and 6 of 21 in 2018-2019). Second, for our survey, the response rate was 19.3% (29/150). No residency director thought their institution had too many grand rounds dedicated to headache medicine, and 62.1% (18/29) thought they had an adequate amount of headache grand rounds. Within the survey responders, 75.9% (22/29) of adult neurology residency programs have a board-certified headache specialist at their institution. Although most adult neurology residency directors believe that headache is adequately represented in adult neurology grand rounds, headache medicine makes up 4%-6% of all neurology grand rounds. Compared with other neurology subspecialties and the other core ACGME milestones, headache makes up the fewest grand rounds lectures that were assessed in this study.",Headache,2021-Jul,"Burish MJ, Ahmed ZA, Rosen NL, Halker Singh RB",4,2855,neurology,2025-11-22

There is scant literature regarding the impact of headache on healthcare services in Ireland. We aimed to investigate headache burden across the emergency department, inpatient stays, and neurology outpatient department referrals in an Irish University teaching hospital. We prospectively collected data regarding emergency department presentations, inpatient neurology consultations, and neurology outpatient referrals for patients with headache between 13th January and 8th March 2020. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. There were 180 emergency department attendances, 50 inpatient consultations, and 76 outpatient referrals with headache. Neurological examinations were often incomplete; neuroimaging was commonly employed. Migraine was the most frequent headache diagnosis at discharge in the emergency department and among inpatients after neurology review. Diagnostic uncertainty was identified-33% of patients left the emergency department with no diagnosis, and ""unknown/unspecified headache"" was recorded on 49% of outpatient referrals and 30% of inpatient consult requests. Medication overuse headache coexisted with migraine in nine patients in the inpatient group. Prophylaxis had been trialed in 56% of patients with migraine referred to outpatients. Primary headache disorders have a large impact on hospital services. Diagnostic uncertainty is common; neuroimaging is relied upon.

35101910,Thriving in Neurology Residency: An Appreciative Inquiry Approach.,"Enhancing resident well-being has become a top priority for medical educators as awareness of physician burnout continues to grow. Although substantial effort has been made to understand contributors to resident burnout and develop effective interventions, relatively little is known about what characterizes the opposite of burnout-that is, thriving in medical training. This phenomenologic qualitative study applies appreciative inquiry as an interview technique with the aim of characterizing self-identified experiences of thriving among residents in the Yale Neurology program. Eight residents across all years of training in a single neurology residency participated in semi-structured appreciative interviews to identify experiences of thriving during neurology training. These interviews were transcribed and qualitatively analyzed with a phenomenologic perspective for common themes. Numerous themes emerged spanning personal, interpersonal, and organizational domains. Whereas some of these themes were congruent with established foundations of well-being and adult learning theory, others revealed the crucial contributions of stress and challenge to thriving. One of the strongest emergent themes was the tendency of residents to thrive during autonomous, high-challenge, high-stress situations, provided that adequate support was present and psychological safety was ensured. These findings resonate with phenomena studied in positive psychology that are not being widely applied in medical education. To the degree that conclusions are transferable to other training contexts, this study suggests an opportunity for medical educators to harness the positive aspects of stress and challenge in a supportive way that facilitates trainee well-being through experiences of thriving.",Neurology,2022-Mar,"Dewey J, Encandela J, Moeller J",3,1792,neurology,2025-11-22

We identified proceduralist specialty by linking the National Provider Identifier provided by Medicare to the specialty listed in the National Provider Identifier database, grouping into radiology, neurology, neurosurgery, other surgical, and internal medicine. We calculated the number of proceduralists and hospitals who performed ET, ET team specialty composition by hospital, and number of proceduralists who performed ET at multiple hospitals. Forty-two percent (n=5612) of ET were performed by radiology-background proceduralists, with unclear knowledge of how many were cerebrovascular specialists. Neurosurgery- and neurology-background interventionalists performed fewer but substantial numbers of cases, accounting for 24% (n=3217) and 23% (n=3124) of total cases, respectively. ET teams included a neurology- or neurosurgery-background proceduralist at 65% (n=407) of hospitals that performed ET and included both in 26% (n=160) of teams. Almost two-thirds of ET teams nationwide include a neurology- or neurosurgery-background proceduralist and higher volume centers in urban areas were more likely to have neurology- or neurosurgery-background proceduralists with cerebrovascular expertise on their team. It is unclear how many radiology-background interventionalists are cerebrovascular specialists versus generalists.

Applicants to neurology residencies submit personal statements describing themselves and their motivations. Textual analysis of personal statements has been performed in internal medicine and general surgery, but never before in neurology. We hypothesized that specific words and themes would be mentioned in residency personal statements with high frequencies indicating students' motivations. We used computational linguistics software to assess key words and thereby study motivations, expectations, and themes present among neurology applicants. A total of 2,405 personal statements submitted over 5 years to our institution were de-identified and compiled into a database for evaluation through 3 computational linguistics software programs. We performed calculations of term frequencies (TF) and TF-inverse document frequencies and performed K-means clustering to identify unique words and common themes. Specific disease states were discussed. For example, stroke (TF 2,178), epilepsy (TF 970), and dementia (TF 944) were referenced more often than amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (TF 220) and carpal tunnel (TF 10). The most common proper names cited were Oliver Sacks (TF 94) and Sherlock Holmes (TF 41). Common themes included fascination with the brain, interest in research, desire to help patients, early interests in neurology, continued pursuit of learning, appreciation for time with patients, family history with neurologic illness, and intellectual curiosity.

33579757,Education Research: Challenges Faced by Neurology Trainees in a Neuro-Intervention Career Track.,"The widespread adoption of endovascular therapy (EVT) for emergent large vessel occlusion has led to increased nationwide demand for neurointerventionalists, heightened interest among neurology residents to pursue neurointervention as a career, and increased importance of neurointervention exposure for all neurologists who care for patients with acute ischemic stroke. Exposure to neurointervention and its career path are not well-defined for neurology trainees. The Society for Vascular and Interventional Neurology (SVIN) Education Committee conducted a multicenter electronic survey directed towards neurology residents and vascular neurology (VN), neurocritical care (NCC), and neurointervention fellows in June 2018.

Respondents self-identified as 22% postgraduate year (PGY)2, 40% PGY3/4, 30% VN fellows, and 8% neurointervention or NCC fellows. Eighty-seven percent of trainees had more than 2 months exposure to VN during residency, 41% to NCC, and only 3% to neurointervention. Sixty-eight percent of respondents had no exposure to neurointervention during residency. Whereas 72% believed that a background in neurology was good preparation for neurointervention, only 41% agreed that fellowship training pathway in neurointervention is well-structured for neurology residents when compared to other subspecialties. In this survey, respondents identified lack of exposure to neurointervention and a well-defined training pathway as obstacles towards pursuing neurointervention as a career.

In 2019, participants self-identifying as researchers, preregistered for the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting, ≥7 years out of residency, and authors of ≥1 AAN meeting abstract submission (2006-2009) were selected to participate in the qualitative study (purposeful sampling strategy). To increase diversity, 15 participants were invited by members involved in the AAN until interviews were complete. The AAN at the time of the study asked gender using sex-based terms. Participants were asked predetermined and open-ended questions. Themes were generated using a flexible coding methodology. Sixty neurologists (31 women, 29 men) participated in the focus groups and individual interviews. Six predetermined domains relevant to a successful neurology research career were explored: success definitions, facilitators, barriers, biases and harassment, mitigation strategies, and participant recommendations. Gender-based differences were noted during discussions focused on barriers and biases and harassment. Lack of women mentors, under-representation of women in senior faculty positions, and competing responsibilities when children are young were identified as barriers to women's success. Participants acknowledged that known gender disparities in compensation, academic promotion, and publications disproportionately affect women. Women shared more experiences of bias and harassment. Some men felt that gender-based biases were minimal to nonexistent. Participants shared their recommendations on ways to mitigate gender disparities and pursue a neurology research career. Leadership involvement locally and nationally in advocating and implementing change outside academic institutions was also mentioned as being valuable. Our findings may not be generalizable to academic neurologists outside the United States. Women academic neurology researchers experienced disparities across several domains affecting success: lower compensation, fewer women mentors, bias, and harassment. Women are less likely to be promoted, have less research success, and job satisfaction. Shared experiences of bias and harassment among women neurology researchers indicate continuing opportunity for education among departments and colleagues for preventive measures.

However, despite the immense burden of neurological diseases, like headache and neurodegenerative disorders, recruitment into these subspecialties remains insufficient in the United States. In this manuscript, a group of educators from the American Academy of Neurology's A.B. Baker Section on Neurological Education sought to review and discuss the current landscape of neurology fellowships in the United States, the factors driving fellowship recruitment and the educational barriers.

37328733,Perception of neurology among undergraduate medical students - what can be done to counter neurophobia during clinical studies?,"With a global increase in the burden of neurological diseases, the aversion towards neurology (neurophobia) may challenge the sufficient provision of new specialists in this field. We investigated the possible determinants of neurophobia among medical students and its influence on the intent to pursue neurology residency. From September 2021 to March 2022, an online questionnaire was distributed to medical students in Lithuania. It included questions about knowledge, confidence, interest, and teaching quality of various medical specialties (including neurology), as well as the willingness to choose neurology for residency. Eight hundred fifty-two students responded to the survey (77.2% female) - they rated neurology as significantly more difficult than other medical areas and lacked confidence in assessing patients with neurological problems (p < 0.001). However, neurology was selected as one of the most interesting subjects and was reportedly well-taught. The prevalence of neurophobia among respondents was 58.9%. Most of them (207, 87.7%) indicated that neurology professors positively affected their outlook towards this medical specialty - such experience was associated with lower odds of neurophobia (odds ratio (OR) = 0.383, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.223 to 0.658). Being less neurophobic (OR = 1.785, 95% CI = 1.152 to 2.767) and having conducted neurology research (OR = 2.072, 95% CI = 1.145 to 3.747) increased the odds of a student being willing to pursue a career in neurology. Neurophobia was frequent among students in Lithuania and was inversely related to the positive influence by neurology professors. Together with previous research experience in the field, low levels of neurophobia were associated with the inclination to enter neurology residency.",BMC medical education,2023-Jun,"Jukna Š, Puteikis K, Mameniškienė R",3,1792,neurology,2025-11-22

We aimed to characterize neurology clinical trials registered between October 2007 and April 2018 and identify features associated with early discontinuation and results reporting. We compared 16,994 neurology (9.4%) and 163,714 non-neurology comparison trials registered to ClinicalTrials.gov. Trials therapeutic focus within neurology was assigned via combination programmatic and manual review. We performed descriptive analyses of trial characteristics, cox regression of early discontinuation, and multivariable logistic regression for results reporting within 3 years of completion. Most neurology trials were academic-funded (58.5%) followed by industry (31.9%) and US-government (9.6%). Neurology trials focused more on treatment than prevention compared to non-neurology studies. Of neurology trials, 11.3% discontinued early, and 32.2% of completed trials reported results by April 30, 2018. In multivariable analysis accounting for time-to-event, neurology trials were at lower risk of discontinuation than non-neurology trials (adjusted hazard 0.83, p < 0.0001). Both academic and government-funded trials had greater risk of discontinuation than industry (adjusted hazard 0.57 and 0.46, respectively). Among completed trials, government-funded studies (adjusted odds ratio 2.12, p < 0.0001) had highest odds of results reporting while academic trials reported less (adjusted odds ratio 0.51, p < 0.0001).

For 6 academic years, details of all morning report cases assessed and presented by junior neurology residents were logged, including the resident's independent initial diagnostic impression. Cases were later revisited at subsequent morning reports to ""close the loop"" on a final diagnosis. We conducted retrospective review to quantify case demographics and to determine resident diagnostic accuracy based on prespecified localization pathways. Demographic analysis included 1,472 cases; of these, 1,301 qualified for accuracy analysis due to diagnostic uncertainty at time of morning report. Non-neurologic etiologies represented 26.0% of cases. CNS etiologies were the majority (86.0%) of neurologic cases. The most frequent diagnoses were ischemic stroke and seizure. Overall resident diagnostic accuracy was 64.0%. Accuracy was similar between central and peripheral etiologies. Of 1,301 cases, 15.3% were overcalled as neurologic, while neurologic disease was rarely mistaken as non-neurologic (5.1%). Most diagnostic errors (49.1%) occurred when determining whether a case was neurologic. Where in the localization pathway errors occurred varied between etiologies. Overall diagnostic accuracy for neurology junior residents in our cohort was similar to prior work conducted in smaller samples. Analysis of errors, particularly at the critical ""neurologic or non-neurologic"" decision point, warrants further investigation.

Grace Elizabeth Betty Clements (1918-1965) was the first woman trainee at the Mayo Clinic to practice neurology and later became a founder of the Barrow Neurological Institute. Before paving the way for future women trainees in neurology, she served as a Women Airforce Service Pilot including flying atomic bomb planning missions during World War II. Following the war, her path to medicine included volunteering in the American Red Cross in the Philippines where she treated patients with Hansen disease (leprosy). Clements returned to her home state to complete medical school at the University of Nebraska before seeking neurologic training at the Mayo Clinic in 1954. Following additional training at Queen Square, she became a founder of the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona.

The first European Training Requirements in Neurology (ETRN) were published in 2005 and first updated in 2016. This paper reports the most recent revisions of the ETRN. Members of the EAN board performed an in depth revision of the ETNR 2016-version, which was reviewed by members of the European Board and Section of Neurology of the UEMS, the Education and Scientific Panels, the Resident and Research Fellow Section and the Board of the EAN, as well as the presidents of the 47 European National Societies. The new (2022) ETRN suggest a 5-year training subdivided in three phases: a first phase (2 years) of general neurology training, a second phase (2 years) of training in neurophysiology/neurological subspecialties and a third phase (1 year) to expand clinical training (e.g., in other neurodisciplines) or for research (path for clinical neuroscientist). The necessary theoretical and clinical competences as well as learning objectives in diagnostic tests have been updated, are newly organized in four levels and include 19 neurological subspecialties. Finally, the new ETRN require, in addition to a programme director, a team of clinician-educators who regularly review the resident's progress. The 2022 update of the ETRN reflects emerging requirements for the practice of neurology and contributes to the international standardization of training necessary for the increasing needs of residents and specialists across Europe.",European journal of neurology,2024-Mar,"Bassetti CLA, Soffietti R, Vodušek DB, Schoser B, Kuks JBM, Rakusa M, Cras P, Boon PAJM",8,1602,neurology,2025-11-22

A list of adult neurology residency programs in the United States was compiled using information on the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) and Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA) websites. A total of 24 website criteria covering educational, recruitment, and compensation content were assessed for comprehensiveness. Programs' website comprehensiveness was compared based on geographic location, program affiliation (community and/or academic), program size, and program/hospital Doximity and U.S. News & World Report rankings. A total of 153 US adult neurology residency program websites were evaluated. Fewer than one-half of program websites were accessible with a direct link from either FREIDA or ERAS. The number of residency program websites reporting each content criterion varied greatly. Mean percentage of overall website comprehensiveness among neurology residency programs was 65.9%. Northeast location, academic affiliation, larger programs, and top-ranked programs on Doximity were associated with greater program website comprehensiveness.

This study is a post hoc analysis of a qualitative investigation performed at a single Canadian academic center with active clinical services in palliative medicine, neurology, and neurosurgery. Grounded theory methodology was used to explore trainees' perspectives when learning neuropalliative care. This study used focus groups, using open-ended questions, to elicit participants' experiences providing neuropalliative care as well as to explore the challenges in neuropalliative care. Qualitative analysis identified multiple sources of distress for trainees in neuropalliative care and broad themes emerged: 1) a <i>lack of experience and knowledge</i>, 2) the <i>emotional toll</i> of learning neuropalliative care, and 3) <i>prognostic uncertainty</i> in neuropalliative care. Our results suggest that palliative neurology curricula should focus not only on symptom management but also on strategies for improving communication about prognosis and managing clinical uncertainty. Improving trainee comfort and confidence in neuropalliative care throughout the illness trajectory may alleviate sources of distress during training and increase quality of care.",The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

Medical practices are responding by developing, disseminating, and implementing unprecedented changes in health care delivery. Telemedicine has rapidly moved to the frontline of clinical practice due to the need for prevention and mitigation strategies; these have been encouraged, facilitated, and enabled by changes in government rules and regulations and payer-driven reimbursement policies. We describe our neurology department's situational transformation from in-person outpatient visits to a largely virtual neurology practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two key factors enabled our rapid deployment of virtual encounters in neurology and its subspecialties. The first was a well-established robust information technology infrastructure supporting virtual urgent care services at our institution; this connected physicians directly to patients using both the physician's and the patient's own mobile devices. The second is the concept of one patient, one chart, facilitated by a suite of interconnected electronic medical record (EMR) applications on several different device types. We present our experience with conducting general teleneurology encounters using secure synchronous audio and video connections integrated with an EMR. This report also details how we perform virtual neurologic examinations that are clinically meaningful and how we document, code, and bill for these virtual services. Many of these processes can be used by other neurology providers, regardless of their specific practice model.

Therefore, updating residency training programmes is crucial for the future of neurology. Several countries are currently discussing and/or modifying the structure of their neurology residency training programme. A detailed and up-to-date overview of the available European residency training programmes will aid this process. A questionnaire addressing numerous aspects of residency training programmes in neurology was distributed among 38 national representatives of the Resident and Research Fellow Section of the European Academy of Neurology. We obtained data from 32 European countries (response rate 84%). The median (range) duration of the residency training programmes was 60 (12-72) months. In the majority of countries, rotations to other medical disciplines were mandatory, mostly psychiatry (69%), internal medicine (66%) and neurosurgery (59%). However, the choice of medical fields and the duration of rotations varied substantially between countries. In 50% of countries, there were formal regulations regarding training in evidence-based medicine, teaching skills and/or leadership qualities. In many countries (75%), residents had to take an examination. We found substantial variation among European countries in the duration of residency training programmes, and especially in the choice of obligatory rotations to external medical disciplines. Despite a presumably similar spectrum of patients, neurology residency training programmes across Europe are not harmonized.

35213279,Neurology's vital role in preventing unnecessary and potentially harmful pediatric studies.,"Regulatory authorities recognize two human populations: adults and children defined as <18 years. For drug approval, they demand separate studies. But humans mature slowly during puberty. The 18<sup>th</sup> birthday is an administrative limit that does not correspond to a physiological change.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has backed away from this concept for antiepileptic drugs, but sticks to it in other areas. In contrast, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is continuously expanding its demand for 'pediatric' studies. Parents hesitate increasingly to let their children participate in questionable studies. Neurologists challenge the children-are-therapeutic-orphans mantra. Young patients do not need separate proof of efficacy & safety, but appropriate dosing recommendations. Minors should be treated as human beings, instead of being abused in questionable studies. Young patients with multiple sclerosis and other neurological diseases deserve studies with therapeutic intentions. 'Pediatric' careers have emerged in academia, regulatory authorities, and pharmaceutical companies.

After completing the online course, the final scores and evaluation results were compared among different groups of interns, and their preference to distinct contents of the course was analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS program (version 22.0).<b>Results</b>: Our online course received consistent positive recognition from the interns. Ninety-nine percent of the interns recommended incorporating the online course into the conventional offline training program after the pandemic. There was no significant difference between interns from different programs concerning the final scores and course evaluation. A smaller learning group size (<15 students) could achieve a better teaching effect than a larger group size (p < 0.05). The interns preferred interactive discussions, and course contents that they can get practice and feedback from, rather than video watching and didactic lectures.<b>Conclusions</b>: The online neurology intern training course based on SPOC and blending learning mode is worthy of popularization in a large student base.

32299428,The role of residents in medical students' neurology education: current status and future perspectives.,"Neurophobia, a well-described fear of neurology, affects medical students worldwide and may be one of the factors contributing to a shortage of neurologists in the United States. Residents spend a considerable amount of time with medical students; therefore, we sought to understand better the impact neurology residents have on medical students during their neurology clerkship and their subsequent interest in neurology. We aimed to identify and implement strategies to decrease neurophobia and increase the number of students pursuing neurology as a career. Third-year medical students (n = 234) of UTHealth's McGovern Medical School rotating through their neurology core clerkship completed two surveys regarding their rotation experiences. Surveys were completed anonymously before and after the clerkship to measure their interest and confidence in neurology and the impact of their interactions with the neurology residents during the clerkship. In parallel, residents participated in a teaching workshop focused on small group teaching to improve their teaching effectiveness. Non-parametrical comparison and ordinal regression analyses were utilized for data analyses. Medical students reported a statistically significant increase in their confidence in managing neurological conditions and interest in pursuing a neurology residency after their clerkship. There was a significant association between the medical students' overall rotation experience and the residents' teaching effectiveness. The overall clerkship experience correlated with the medical students' interest and confidence in neurology. There was a trend towards an increase in residents' teaching effectiveness and students' rotation experience after a resident teaching workshop. Additionally, of note, students who rotated on both and outpatient and inpatient sites during their clerkship reported an increased interest in neurology. Our study supports that resident-led teaching efforts are important in improving medical students' neurologic education and their interest in neurology. Our data also supports that the interest in neurology increased for medical students after their neurology clerkship. We examined future strategies to implement ""near-peer"" teaching activities to enhance the medical students' neurologic educational experience. These strategies could potentially mitigate neurophobia and ultimately lead to a much-needed increase in future neurologists.",BMC medical education,2020-Apr,"Keser Z, Rodriguez YA, Tremont J, Hsieh PH, McCullough LD, Sandrone S, Stimming EF",7,2452,neurology,2025-11-22

34315783,Opinion & Special Article: Preventive Neurology: An Emerging Field Toward Brain Health.,"With the rapid aging of populations, neurologic disorders have become among the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide. Most neurologic conditions have a prolonged prodromal phase-even if they tend to manifest with an acute syndrome such as stroke-and can lead to a relentless, often deleterious course creating a major burden on patients, caregivers, and society. This unique nature of neurologic diseases signifies the strong need for equally effective primary and secondary prevention strategies and focus on brain health before brain diseases ensue. The field of preventive neurology applies both universal and selective primary prevention strategies to promote brain health both at the public and personal levels. The preventive neurology approach aims to identify and target high-risk individuals and protect them from reaching a critical point where overt clinical symptoms are present and disease progression is irreversible. Universal and selective prevention training, along with dovetailed clinical and public health research, are 3 essential pillars of preventive neurology. The burgeoning field of preventive neurology aims to assess neurologic care needs in a society, promote the participation of neurologists in restructuring of the health care policies to promote brain health, and identify medium- and high-risk individuals to prevent or delay future neurologic events.",Neurology,2021-Nov,"Sabayan B, Isaacson R, Rost N",3,1401,neurology,2025-11-22

We conducted a multiple method needs assessment to determine the feasibility of a novel neurology flipped classroom (FC) curriculum for internal medicine residents. Our primary findings include participants: (1) finding neurology a useful rotation; (2) feeling uncomfortable with the neurological examination; and (3) endorsing flipped classroom as a potential alternative but with significant barriers. Our findings elucidate upon the various extrinsic/intrinsic motivators for resident education and illustrate the need to re-examine the way in which neurology is being taught to off-service residents.",The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

35593069,Predicting Patient No-Shows in an Academic Pediatric Neurology Clinic.,"<b>Background:</b> No-shows can negatively affect patient care. Efforts to predict high-risk patients are needed. Previously, our epilepsy clinic identified patients with 2 or more no-shows or late cancelations in the past 18 months as being at high risk for no-shows. Our objective was to develop a model to accurately predict the risk of no-shows among patients with epilepsy seen at our neurology clinic. <b>Methods:</b> Using electronic health record data, we developed a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-regularized logistic regression model to predict no-shows and compared its performance with our neurology clinic's above-mentioned ad hoc rule. <b>Results:</b> The ad hoc rule identified 13% of patients seen at our neurology clinic as high-risk patients for no-shows and resulted in a positive predictive value of 38%. In comparison, our LASSO model resulted in a positive predictive value of 48%. Our LASSO model identified that lack of private insurance, inactive Epic MyChart, greater past no-show rates, fewer appointment changes before the appointment date, and follow-up appointments were more likely to result in no-shows. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our LASSO model outperformed the ad hoc rule used by our neurology clinic in predicting patients at high risk for no-shows. Social workers can use the no-show risk scores generated by our LASSO model to prioritize high-risk patients for targeted intervention to reduce no-shows at our neurology clinic.",Journal of child neurology,2022-Jun,"Peng J, Patel AD, Burch M, Rossiter S, Parker W, Rust S",6,1484,neurology,2025-11-22
33768152,Improving Child Neurology Residents' Communication Skills Through Objective Structured Clinical Exams.,"Child neurology has unique challenges in communication due to complex disorders with a wide array of prognoses and treatments. Effective communication is teachable through deliberate practice and coaching. Objective structured clinical exams (OSCEs) are one method of providing practice while assessing communication skills. Yet OSCEs have not been reported for child neurology residents. We developed simulated clinical cases centering on communication skills for child neurology residents, all with challenging clinical scenarios (e.g., disclosure of a medical error, psychogenic nonepileptic events). Standardized patients (SPs) portrayed the parents of pediatric patients and, in some scenarios, an adolescent patient. We used a modified Gap-Kalamazoo Communication Skills Assessment Form to assess communication skills. The assessment was completed by faculty, SPs, and the resident, and we measured agreement among raters. Residents were surveyed afterward regarding their experience. Nine cases were developed and piloted. A total of 27 unique resident-case encounters with 16 individual trainees occurred over three annual implementations. Scores on the 360-degree assessment of communication skills showed that residents overwhelmingly underassessed their skills compared to other rater groups. Among 18 responses on the post-OSCE survey, the majority (77%) found the experience useful to their education and felt that the feedback from the SPs was helpful (61%) and the case portrayals were realistic (89%). We implemented simulated cases for assessment and formative feedback on communication skills for child neurology residents.

33212334,Child Neurology Applicants Place Increasing Emphasis on Quality of Life Factors.,"Medical education, residency training, and the structure of child neurology residency training programs are evolving. We sought to evaluate how training program selection priorities of child neurology residency applicants have changed over time. An electronic survey was sent to child neurology residents and practicing child neurologists via the Professors of Child Neurology distribution list in the summer of 2018. It was requested that the survey be disseminated to current trainees and alumni of the programs. The survey consisted of seven questions assessing basic demographics and a list of factors applicants consider when choosing a residency. There were 284 responses with a higher representation of individuals matriculating into residency in the last decade. More recent medical school graduates had a lower probability of considering curriculum as an important factor for residency selection (odds ratio [OR], 0.746; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.568 to 0.98; P = 0.035) and higher priority placed on interaction with current residents over the course of the interview day (OR, 2.207; 95% CI, 1.486 to 3.278; P < 0.0001), sense of resident happiness and well-being (OR, 2.176; 95% CI, 1.494 to 3.169; P < 0.0001), and perception of city or geography of the residency program (OR, 1.710; 95% CI, 1.272 to 2.298; P < 0.001). Over time, child neurology residency applicants are putting more emphasis on quality of life factors over curriculum. To accommodate these changes, child neurology residency programs should prioritize interactions with residents during the interview process and resident wellness initiatives throughout residency training.",Pediatric neurology,2021-Jan,"Dixon SM, Binkley MM, Gospe SM, Guerriero RM",4,1664,neurology,2025-11-22

Aim of our investigation was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the educational activities of Italian neurology residents through an online questionnaire delivered to neurology residents. The results obtained showed that almost 30% of the respondents were redistributed to COVID-19 units. Neurology departments underwent substantial modifications of their organization influencing clinical educational activities; lessons and seminars were rescheduled online and research protocols were stopped and transferred to remote working, when feasible. There was a relevant use of telemedicine approach even if most of the respondents had never been trained before. Some of the changes had a North-South gradient, following the epidemiology of the pandemic.

35189987,Resident Match During the COVID Pandemic: How Have Neurology Programs Adapted? - A Survey.,"We aimed to evaluate the perceived effectiveness of interventions implemented by Canadian neurology residency programs for the 2020-2021 iteration of the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS). A cross-sectional survey was distributed to Canadian neurology residency programs and final-year Canadian medical students who applied to at least one neurology program during the 2020-2021 match cycle. The surveys evaluated pre-interview and interview period interventions implemented by Canadian neurology residency programs and accessed by medical students. Thirty-five medical students and 13 out of 15 institutions in Canada with neurology residency programs responded to the survey. Multiple adaptations were implemented, including social media advertisement, web-based platforms, pre-interview information sessions, and teaching sessions, with all surveyed programs implementing at least two virtual interventions. We found that all interventions were perceived as adequate by a majority (>60%) of medical students, with pre-interview period virtual information sessions perceived as effective by the largest proportion of respondents. All Canadian neurology residency programs held virtual interviews for the 2020-2021 cycle, and most programs utilized the same interview structure as prior years. There was discordance between residency program stakeholders and medical students on the most helpful interview period modality. Medical students found the hospital tours and information sessions most valuable, whereas program stakeholders perceived the virtual socials and interviews as most helpful. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to innovative adaptations implemented by Canadian neurology residency programs, which were seen as effective by both medical students and program stakeholders.",The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

35680419,"Gender Representation Among Physician Authors of Practice Guidelines Developed, Endorsed, or Affirmed by the American Academy of Neurology.","To assess American Academy of Neurology (AAN)-recommended Practice Guidelines (PGs) for equity in gender representation among physician authors. This cross-sectional study included AAN-recommended PG publications from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2020. Author degrees and gender were identified by 2 reviewers using the publication and/or online searches. Gender was determined from pronouns or photographs. Gender representation was compared with Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) data on academic neurologists. Data were analyzed using <i>Z</i> tests of 2 proportions and descriptive statistics. AAMC benchmarks report academic women neurologists represented 35% of the specialty in 2015, 38% in 2018, and 39% in 2020. We identified 68 unique PG publications with 709 physician authors, 31% (223) women, 68% (484) men, and 0.3% (2) gender could not be identified. Representation of women physicians was low among PG authors across all benchmarks, significantly so for 2018 and 2020 (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Among physician first authors, women were significantly underrepresented across all benchmarks (18% [12/65], <i>p</i> < 0.01). Representation of women physicians was lower when men physicians were first authors vs women physicians (31% [161/524] vs 43% [50/118], <i>p</i> = 0.02). Among subspecialties with 10+ PGs, women physician authorship was highest in child neurology (48% [57/120]) and lowest in stroke and vascular neurology (16% [18/113]). We found that women physicians were underrepresented as authors of AAN-recommended PGs. This suggests a missed opportunity for neurology because PGs that include expertise from women physicians may improve care and translation into practice. In addition, women physicians lose out on professional development from authorship.

39514828,Modified Delphi Study to Establish Consensus About Child Neurology Residency Education: Next-Gen Training.,"Rapid advances in diagnostics and treatments are shifting child neurology practice, but child neurology training requirements have been much slower to change. Previous literature confirms strong support for modernization, but no formal consensus exists regarding maintaining or changing training. We aimed to develop a holistic consensus regarding the optimal training pathway and requirements using a modified Delphi process. The authors invited 48 child neurologists as panelists, intentionally selecting to represent the diverse geography, practice type, subspecialties, and other demographics of child neurologists practicing in the United States. Panelists participated in an anonymized modified Delphi study with 4 rounds evaluating statements regarding current training requirements, core rotation durations, and mandatory subspecialty rotations with the option to agree or disagree. Statements were derived from current Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education, American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, and American Board of Pediatrics requirements for child neurology training and recent literature. Statements that did not reach a predefined level of consensus (≥75% agreement or disagreement on a 7-point Likert scale) were re-queried or modified for subsequent rounds. Panelists had access to all previous anonymized results and comments. The final modifications were presented in round 4 as a comprehensive training proposal. Twenty-seven panelists agreed to participate, with most completing all 4 rounds. In round 1, consensus was reached on 45 of 118 (38%) items; round 2, 28 of 87 (32%); round 3, 16 of 25 (64%); and round 4, 1 of 1 (100%). There was consensus regarding the age scope of practice and certain subspecialties that should be required, but no initial consensus regarding time-based requirements. By round 4, consensus emerged for the following rotations-months: neonatal and pediatric intensive care-4, adolescent medicine-0.5, emergency medicine-1.5, inpatient pediatrics-3, outpatient pediatrics-3.5, inpatient child neurology-9.5, outpatient child neurology-6, inpatient adult neurology-3, outpatient adult neurology-2, genetics-2, EEG/neurophysiology-2, neuroimaging-1, child psychiatry-1, and electives-7.5. The consensus schedule consists of 46.5 total months of requirements. This study suggests that, despite diverging views prevalent among child neurologists, a diverse panel can, through a multiround Delphi process, arrive at consensus regarding many core features of the child neurology training structure and certification requirements.",Neurology,2024-Dec,"Gottlieb-Smith R, Rogers D, Gilbert DL",3,2593,neurology,2025-11-22

33181725,Real-time Assessment of Neurology Residents' Perceptions of Inappropriate Consults.,"We sought to characterize perceptions of inappropriate neurology consults of neurology residents (NR) and requesting providers (RP) immediately following the consult interaction. Student investigators were embedded in the Mount Sinai neurology consult service for 4 weeks in May/June 2018. For each consecutive neurology consult the NR's real-time attitudes toward the consult were evaluated with a survey using Likert scales. A similar survey was immediately administered to the RP who called the consult. Response scores for each attribute were dichotomized and data were analyzed descriptively in SPSS. Data from 69 consults were collected. NRs perceived 45% of consults as inappropriate and 82% of all consults as low urgency. When NRs perceived a consult as inappropriate, they felt more resistance (r=-0.79). NRs also felt more resistant when they thought that the RP could have cared for the patient without the consult (r=0.79). NRs felt that perceived medicolegal risk highly influenced the RP's decision to call a consult in 36% of cases. Of these ""high liability"" consults, NRs considered 76% inappropriate and 100% low urgency. NRs were more likely to rate consults as inappropriate if they were also perceived as low urgency, strongly influenced by liability concerns, or unnecessary due to belief that the RP could have cared for the patient without the consult. Our findings suggest a discrepancy in how NRs and RPs perceive neurology consult appropriateness, and help to elucidate potential drivers of these perceptions that could be barriers to education and to interdisciplinary care.",The neurologist,2020-Nov,"Gentile C, Loebel E, Sanky C, Krieger S",4,1602,neurology,2025-11-22

We conducted a systematic review of the PubMed database and analysed the main clinical trials to address these questions and establish a series of recommendations. In primary stroke prevention, antihypertensive treatment should be started in patients with BP levels >  140/90 mmHg, with a target BP of < 130/80 mmHg. In secondary stroke prevention, we recommend starting antihypertensive treatment after the acute phase (first 24 hours), with a target BP of < 130/80 mmHg.

The EEG quiz was divided in two parts, composed of normal (n=27) and abnormal (n=10) EEG examples. The EEG survey focused on the importance of EEG, EEG milestones and EEG education. Twenty-one residents completed the EEG quiz; all 21 completed the normal EEG part whereas 19 of these 21 completed the abnormal EEG part. The overall score (mean±SEM) was 42±4.5% for the normal EEG part and 44±5.5% for the abnormal EEG part. The EEG survey was completed by 28 residents. Forty-three percent of the respondents reported not being able to read EEGs even with supervision. The most commonly reported education barriers were insufficient exposure, insufficient responsibility to read EEGs, and inability to link EEG learning to direct patient care. On average, adult neurology residents were able to correctly identify less than half of normal and abnormal EEG findings.

However, while clinical research in neurology has remained relatively stable over the past 10 years, there has been an interval decrease in neuroscience applicants for NIH funding, which has raised concerns about the pipeline and future of clinical research in neurology. Those interested in such a career can begin by identifying a preclinical neuroscience advance that has yet to be translated into clinical trial work or a clinical area of need based on conversations with patients and families. Once such an area of interest is identified, seeking mentors either at one's own local institution or through networking at conferences is important in developing the necessary skills pertaining to clinical trial conduct and design and in gaining access to the relevant professional networks. There is also a myriad of training opportunities, such as the NINDS Clinical Trials Methodology Course, Masters of Science in Clinical Research, and certificate programs that offer formal training. Additional considerations for advancing in this career include exploring the potential for secondary publications using data available from previous clinical trials or serving as a subinvestigator. Challenges in pursuing such a career include the relatively low rate of positive outcomes compared with other fields and consistent salary support throughout one's career. Overall, a career as a clinical trialist in neurology is rewarding because one is able to participate in advancing the field and offer potentially new treatments to their patients.",Neurology,2022-May,"Fu KA, Saver JL, Perlman S",3,1651,neurology,2025-11-22

33245699,Rapid Implementation of Video Visits in Neurology During COVID-19: Mixed Methods Evaluation.,"Telemedicine has been used for decades. Despite its many advantages, its uptake and rigorous evaluation of feasibility across neurology's ambulatory subspecialties has been sparse. However, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted health care systems worldwide to reconsider traditional health care delivery. To safeguard health care workers and patients, many health care systems quickly transitioned to telemedicine, including across neurology subspecialties, providing a new opportunity to evaluate this modality of care. To evaluate the accelerated implementation of video visits in ambulatory neurology during the COVID-19 pandemic, we used mixed methods to assess adoption, acceptability, appropriateness, and perceptions of potential sustainability. Video visits were launched rapidly in ambulatory neurology clinics of a large academic medical center. To assess adoption, we analyzed clinician-level scheduling data collected between March 22 and May 16, 2020. We assessed acceptability, appropriateness, and sustainability via a clinician survey (n=48) and semistructured interviews with providers (n=30) completed between March and May 2020. Video visits were adopted rapidly; overall, 65 (98%) clinicians integrated video visits into their workflow within the first 6 implementation weeks and 92% of all visits were conducted via video. Video visits were largely considered acceptable by clinicians, although various technological issues impacted their satisfaction. Video visits were reported to be more convenient for patients, families, and caregivers than in-person visits; however, access to technology, the patient's technological capacity, and language difficulties were considered barriers. Many clinicians expressed optimism about future utilization of video visits in neurology. They believed that video visits promote continuity of care and can be incorporated into their practice long-term, although several insisted that they can never replace the in-person examination. Video visits are an important addition to clinical care in ambulatory neurology and are anticipated to remain a permanent supplement to in-person visits, promoting patient care continuity, and flexibility for patients and clinicians alike.",Journal of medical Internet research,2020-Dec,"Saliba-Gustafsson EA, Miller-Kuhlmann R, Kling SMR, Garvert DW, Brown-Johnson CG, Lestoquoy AS, Verano MR, Yang L, Falco-Walter J, Shaw JG, Asch SM, Gold CA, Winget M",13,2224,neurology,2025-11-22
36859408,Neurologic Care of Forcibly Displaced Persons: Emerging Issues in Neurology.,"There is a growing number of forcibly displaced persons (FDPs) worldwide. With more than 100 million people forcibly displaced today, there is an urgent mandate to understand the neurologic care needs of this population and how neurologists and other health care workers can most effectively provide that care. In this Emerging Issues in Neurology article, we attempt to (1) define the scope of the problem of providing neurologic care to FDPs, (2) highlight commonly encountered clinical challenges related to neurologic care of FDPs, and (3) provide useful clinical information for neurologists and other clinicians who deliver care to FDPs with neurologic needs. We address the terminology of forcible displacement and how terms may differ across a person's migration journey. Common challenges encountered by FDPs with neurologic needs across settings include loss of support systems, loss of personal health information, language barriers and differing expression of symptoms, differing belief systems, epidemiologic patterns of disease unfamiliar to the clinician, and patients' fear and perceived risks of engaging with health systems. Practical approaches are shared for clinicians who encounter an FDP with a neurologic presentation. Finally, the article discusses many unmet neurologic needs of FDPs, which require significant investment. These include addressing lapses in neurologic care during displacement and understanding the effects of forcible displacement on people with chronic neurologic conditions. Future research and educational resources should focus on improving epidemiologic intelligence for neurologic conditions across geographies, developing curricula for optimizing the neurologic care of FDPs, and evaluating the most appropriate and effective uses of health technologies in humanitarian settings.",Neurology,2023-May,"Mateen FJ, Hanafi I, Birbeck GL, Saadi A, Schmutzhard E, Wilmshurst JM, Silsbee H, Jones LK",8,1830,neurology,2025-11-22

Four main themes emerged: 'unknown unknowns (risks/uncertainties)', 'better service', 'challenges', and 'beyond the pandemic'. Thematic saturation was achieved by interview 19. Participants highlighted a number of benefits of remote consultations but over 80% also complained of a reduction in work satisfaction. The sudden introduction of tele-neurology is unlikely to be fully reversed when pandemic-related restrictions have been lifted. However, this study confirms tele-neurology cannot completely replace face-to-face consultations. Some patient groups and consultation types require direct contact. Moreover, significant administrative and infrastructural investment will be required to develop the full potential of tele-neurology. Tele-medicine is capable of improving access and efficiency of specialist neurology services, but limited by lack of non-verbal communication and technical problems. It could enhance service provision with sufficient infrastructural and administrative investment, but may reduce neurologists' job statisfaction.",Patient education and counseling,2021-Mar,"Courtney E, Blackburn D, Reuber M",3,1500,neurology,2025-11-22
32269111,Funds flow in academic neurology: A potential path to financial success.,"Funds flow arrangements define the financial relationships between departments, medical centers, and university entities within a coordinated academic health system. Although these funds flow frameworks differ, common themes emerge including those that are unique in their influence on academic departments of neurology. Here, we review various funds flow models and their application. Four typical models are described, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each for neurology, keeping in mind that most academic health systems use a hybrid model. Several considerations are important when neurology departmental leadership participates in crafting or revising of these funds flow agreements, including choice of benchmarking targets, planning and funding for future growth, demonstrating value, and supporting nonclinical missions including education and research. The American Academy of Neurology Academic Initiative aims to continue to help academic departments nationally understand these issues and define funds flow arrangements that incorporate the unique characteristics of our specialty and allow us to provide outstanding care for patients while supporting the broad missions of neurology departments.",Neurology,2020-May,"Josephson SA, Sacco RL, Czech JM, Maher RN, Knutson CS, Goldstein LB",6,1224,neurology,2025-11-22

32189705,A Collaborative Tele-Neurology Outpatient Consulation Service in Karnataka: Seven Years of Experience From a Tele-Medicine Center.,"Neurology services in rural and semi-urban part of India are very limited, due to poor infrastructure, resources, and manpower. Tele-neurology consultations at a non-urban setup can be considered as an alternative and innovative approach and have been quite successful in developed countries. Therefore, an initiative to bridge this health gap through Tele-Medicine has been taken by the Government of India. To study the sociodemographic and clinical profiles of patients who have received collaborative Tele-Neurology consultations from the Tele-Medicine Centre, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru. We reviewed case files of such patients between December 2010 and March 2017. A total 189 collaborative tele-neurology outpatient consultations were provided through the Tele-Medicine Centre, located at a tertiary hospital-based research centre in southern India. The mean age of the patients was 39.6 (±19) years and 65.6% were aged between 19 to 60 years; 50.8% were male. The most common diagnosis was a seizure disorder in 17.5%, followed by cerebrovascular accident/stroke in 14.8%. Interestingly, 87.3% were found to benefit from tele-neurology consultations using interventions such as a change of medications in 30.1%, referral to a specialist for review in 15.8%, and further evaluation of illness and inpatient care for 7.93%.

34706974,Simulation-Based Assessment of Graduate Neurology Trainees' Performance Managing Acute Ischemic Stroke.,"Multidisciplinary acute stroke teams improve acute ischemic stroke management but may hinder trainees' education, which in turn may contribute to poorer outcomes in community hospitals on graduation. Our goal was to assess graduate neurology trainee performance independently of a multidisciplinary stroke team in the management of acute ischemic stroke, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-related hemorrhage, and cerebral herniation syndrome. In this prospective, observational, single-center simulation-based study, participants (subinterns to attending physicians) managed a patient with acute ischemic stroke followed by tPA-related hemorrhagic conversion leading to cerebral herniation. Critical actions were developed by a modified Delphi approach based on relevant American Heart Association guidelines and the Neurocritical Care Society's Emergency Neurologic Life Support protocols. The primary outcome measure was graduate neurology trainees' critical action item sum score. We sought validity evidence to support our findings by comparing performance across 4 levels of training. Fifty-three trainees (including 31 graduate neurology trainees) and 5 attending physicians completed the simulation. The mean sum of critical actions completed by graduate neurology trainees was 15 of 22 (68%). Ninety percent of graduate neurology trainees properly administered tPA; 84% immediately stopped tPA infusion after patient deterioration; but only 55% reversed tPA according to guidelines. There was a moderately strong effect of level of training on critical action sum score (level 1 mean [SD] score 7.2 [2.8] vs level 2 mean [SD] score 12.3 [2.6] vs level 3 mean [SD] score 13.3 [2.2] vs level 4 mean [SD] score 16.3 [2.4], <i>p</i> < 0.001, <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.54). Graduate neurology trainees reassuringly perform well in initial management of acute ischemic stroke but frequently make errors in the treatment of hemorrhagic transformation after thrombolysis, suggesting the need for more education surrounding this low-frequency, high-acuity event. High-fidelity simulation holds promise as an assessment tool for acute stroke management performance.",Neurology,2021-Dec,"Pergakis MB, Chang WW, Tabatabai A, Phipps MS, Neustein B, Podell JE, Parikh G, Badjatia N, Motta M, Lerner DP, Morris NA",11,2164,neurology,2025-11-22
38995332,Gender Disparities in the Academic Performance of Neurology Residents in Portugal.,"Implicit bias has been linked to gender disparities in medical careers, impacting not only access to leadership positions but also early career opportunities. We aimed to evaluate if there were differences in the assessment of Neurology residents according to gender. We collected publicly available grades and rankings of two major evaluations that residents are submitted to, one at the beginning and another at the end of the neurology residency program, the National Board Exam and neurology examination, respectively. The National Board Examination is a multiple-choice gender-blinded evaluation, while the neurology examination is an oral gender-unblinded evaluation. We found that 36.5% of women and 21.6% of men were in the first quartile of the National Board Examination ranking, which reflects a similar representation among top classifications when assessed through a gender-blinded examination. On the other hand, the percentage of men who were in the top classification of NE, a gender-unblinded evaluation, was more than twice as high compared to women (37.8% vs 18.3%, p < 0.05). The findings of the present study may imply that there could be a disparity in women's career progression among neurology residents in Portugal, although the recruitment seems balanced between genders.",Acta medica portuguesa,2024-Sep,"Ladeira F, Faustino P, Soares M, Carvalho V",4,1297,neurology,2025-11-22

Via a constructivist grounded theory approach, we carried out 5 focus groups in 2016-2017 with 28 medical students who completed both independent clerkships. Investigator triangulation was used with iterative interpretation comparisons, and themes were identified using constant comparative analysis. Three major themes arose: (1) combining the clerkships was not favorable as students need sufficient time to delve deeper into each discipline; (2) students did not observe an integrated clinical approach by faculty; (3) there is positive value to making links between neurology and psychiatry for effective patient care. Students emphasized the importance of making stronger links between the 2 disciplines for their learning and to improve patient care; however, they did not observe this clinical approach in the workplace. Students perceived that integration of neurology and psychiatry clerkships should occur via increased affinity of the complementary discipline by trainees and faculty in each specialty.",Neurology,2021-Jan,"Mowchun JJ, Frew JR, Shoop GH",3,1341,neurology,2025-11-22

Most important sources are memories and documents of the author, who was a moving force in developing the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS), one of the two parents of the EAN. All European national neurological societies and the World Federation of Neurology were involved in a difficult political interaction resulting in the EFNS. Organizational and administrative development was the initial task. Scientific panels led by a scientific committee, teaching courses for young neurologists, teaching courses in middle and eastern Europe and successful congresses were developed. The purchase of headquarters as well as the creation of a fully owned scientific journal (European Journal of Neurology) were important and financially beneficial. The EFNS also promoted the formation of the European Brain Council and of the patient organization European Federation of Neurological Associations. All these elements have continued after fusion with the European Neurological Society to form the EAN.

38513195,Opinion & Special Article: Community Approach Toward Inclusion of Sex and Gender Diversity in Graduate Neurology Education.,"Sex and gender diverse (SGD) neurology trainees include transgender, nonbinary, and intersex people. There has been historical exclusion of SGD trainees from participating in clinical care, medical research, and academic training programs. Therefore, neurology educators have unique opportunities to support SGD trainees and colleagues, but may lack the education to appropriately do so. Training programs and professional organizations can collaborate to create safe pathways for SGD trainees to disclose their identities in professional settings. Referral to community support and resources is important for SGD trainees considering professional disclosure. Educators should address the challenges and discrimination unique to SGD graduate trainees in neurology, such as lack of inclusion, affirming environments, supportive policies, and medical accommodations. Faculty training on sensitivity, bias, and bystander effects should be ongoing among institutions. Topics regarding sex and gender diversity are lacking in graduate medical education. Educational curricula often use outdated terminology or binary paradigms to teach about sex and gender. Health care training inequities may cause downstream harm to SGD patients; therefore, training curricula that are reflective of an accurate and affirming understanding of sex and gender may mitigate the potential for inequities. This article provides recommendations to support SGD neurology trainees and to incorporate specific training on sex and gender diversity in academic neurology curricula. Such support is critical to the career success and development of SGD neurology trainees.",Neurology,2024-Apr,"L'Erario ZP, Adams M, Makara J, Zeigler G",4,1641,neurology,2025-11-22
33314445,Undergraduate neurology teaching: Comparison of an inpatient versus outpatient clinical setting.,"Neurology is often perceived as a difficult discipline by medical students, yet it is an essential part of medical training. While the most common disorders of the nervous system can be observed in the outpatient setting, positive neurological signs are more likely to be found in neurology wards. We aimed to compare the impact of a neurology outpatient versus inpatient rotation setting on the grades obtained by medical students as a proxy measure of the learning outcomes. We compared the results obtained by fourth year medical students in practical (OSCE) and multiple choice question (MCQ) exams in neurology, between students whose main (total of 24 h contact) teaching allocation was either the outpatient or inpatient setting, controlling for students' gender, teacher, academic year and student' previous achievement (measured by their scores on practical evaluation). A total of 1127 students were included, of whom 644 (57.14%) were allocated mainly to the neurology ward and 483 (42.86%) to the outpatient clinic. Students assigned to the ward obtained significantly higher grades in the OSCE and MCQ exams than those placed in the outpatient clinic. Teaching setting was an independent predictor of both classifications after adjustment. The teaching setting had a significant impact on the learning outcomes. This may be due to a higher likelihood of observing abnormal neurological signs or to more student-centered teaching on the ward. These results highlight the importance of a balanced distribution of students by different clinical settings.",European journal of neurology,2021-Apr,"Martins IP, Fonseca AC, Pires L, Ferro JM",4,1564,neurology,2025-11-22
37505203,Functional neurological disorder: A common reason for a neurology inpatient referral.,"In 2021, the European Academy of Neurology's training requirements were updated to include functional neurological disorder (FND) as a core topic for the first time. To reinforce these changes, we aimed to understand the proportion of inpatients (in non-neurology settings) who are diagnosed with FND. We prospectively collected data on diagnoses made after inpatient ward reviews from neurology trainees at three tertiary neurology centres in Scotland from April to September 2021. We assessed healthcare utilization data for patients with a diagnosis of FND, epilepsy and epileptic seizures, or a neuroinflammatory disorder over the preceding 12 months. There were 437 inpatient reviews for 424 patients by 13 trainees. The largest single diagnosis was FND (n = 80, 18%), followed by epilepsy (n = 64, 14%), primary headache disorder (n = 40, 9%) and neuroinflammatory disorders (n = 28, 6%). There was an uncertain diagnosis for 48 reviews (11%). Compared to patients with epilepsy or neuroinflammatory disorders, patients with FND had a similar number of admissions (2 vs. 2 vs. 1) and brain/spine imaging studies (2 vs. 1 vs. 2). In Scotland, FND was the most common diagnosis made after a request for an inpatient review by a neurologist from another department in the hospital. Patients with FND have similar health resource needs to those with other common neurological disorders when they present to hospitals with tertiary neurology centres. This data supports the inclusion of FND as a core curriculum topic in neurology training.",European journal of neurology,2023-Dec,"Ramsay N, Stone J, Fadiloglu K, Baxter M, Hutchison C, Bennett K, Moullaali T, Mathur J, Bridson J, Hoeritzauer I",10,1541,neurology,2025-11-22
33242726,An Objective Structured Clinical Examination of Communication Skills for Child Neurology Residents.,"The purpose of this study was to implement an objective structured clinical examination for child neurology trainees for formative feedback regarding communication skills. Effective communication skills are essential and teachable, but tools to formally assess them are limited. An objective structured clinical examination is one such tool, but these examinations have not been developed for child neurology residents. We developed nine standardized scenarios that highlighted communication challenges commonly encountered in child neurology. Child neurology trainees participated in three objective structured clinical examination events with three scenarios each over three academic years. Standardized patients portrayed patients or their parents. Each trainee-standardized patient encounter was evaluated by an observing faculty member using a modified Gap-Kalamazoo Communication Skills Assessment Form, the standardized patient who provided direct feedback, and by the participating trainee. We refined the process of case writing, standardized patient training, and trainee evaluation throughout the three-year pilot. Results indicated rater agreement ranging from 32% to 56%. Trainees reported that the cases were challenging and reflective of real life and that the experience helped improve their communication skills. An objective structured clinical examination can provide a standardized setting for formative feedback regarding communication skills in child neurology residency programs. The communication challenges posed by common clinical scenarios involving critically ill children, children with undetermined prognosis, and the triad of parent, child, and physician can be realistically modeled in an objective structured clinical examination. We developed cases and a process that were valuable and that we plan to sustain for resident education related to communication skills.",Pediatric neurology,2021-Jan,"Albert DVF, Ream M, Verbeck N, Lash T, Weisleder P",5,1899,neurology,2025-11-22

We aimed to characterize the role of outpatient neurology social work at an urban, safety-net hospital. In December 2021, we introduced a dedicated social worker to a neurology clinic primarily caring for an underserved patient population. We logged and characterized the first 200 consecutive hours of patient encounters, classifying interventions based on a recently popularized 10-category scheme in social work literature derived from natural language processing and machine learning algorithms. We characterized 125 encounters with neurology patients referred to social work. The neurology social worker spent the greatest amount of time on care coordination (40%), followed by housing insecurity (14%) and applications and reporting (11%). Interventions that required the most time per case included housing (129 min), applications and reporting (120 min), care coordination (96 min). The majority of interventions were directly related to the patient's underlying neurologic disorder, highlighting the importance of a neurology-specific social worker.

Subsequently, we conducted systematic reviews of the PubMed database and selected those randomised clinical trials evaluating stroke as an independent variable (primary or secondary). Finally, for each of the PICO questions we developed a meta-analysis to support the final recommendations. While there is no evidence that metabolic control reduces the risk of stroke, some families of antidiabetic drugs with vascular benefits have been shown to reduce these effects when added to conventional treatments, both in the field of primary prevention in patients presenting type 2 diabetes and high vascular risk or established atherosclerosis (GLP-1 agonists) and in secondary stroke prevention in patients with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes (pioglitazone).",Neurologia,2021-May,"Fuentes B, Amaro S, Alonso de Leciñana M, Arenillas JF, Ayo-Martín O, Castellanos M, Freijo M, García-Pastor A, Gomis M, Gómez Choco M, López-Cancio E, Martínez Sánchez P, Morales A, Palacio-Portilla EJ, Rodríguez-Yáñez M, Roquer J, Segura T, Serena J, Vivancos-Mora J",19,1307,neurology,2025-11-22

34881419,A nationwide survey on clinical neurophysiology education in Italian schools of specialization in neurology.,"Clinical neurophysiology deals with nervous system functions assessed with electrophysiological and ultrasound-based imaging techniques. Even though the need for highly specialized neurophysiologists has increased, residency training rarely takes today's requirements into account. This study aimed to snapshot the neurophysiological training provided by Italian specialization schools in neurology. A single-page web-based survey comprising 13 multiple-choice categorical and interval scale questions was sent via e-mail to neurology specialization school directors. The survey addressed the programs' structural neurophysiology organization, time dedicated to each clinical neurophysiology subspecialty, and descriptors assessing the discipline's importance (e.g., residents who attempted residential courses, gained certifications, or awards gained). The most studied neurophysiological techniques were electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG). Most specialization schools devoted less than 3 months each to multimodal evoked potentials (EPs), ultrasound sonography (US), and intra-operative monitoring. Of the 35 specialization schools surveyed, 77.1% reported that four students, or fewer, participated in the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology Examination in Neurophysiology. Of the 35 specialization centers surveyed, 11.4% declared that the final evaluation required students to discuss a neurophysiological test. Our survey underlined the poorly standardized technical requirements in postgraduate neurology specialization schools, wide variability among training programs, and limited training on multi-modal evoked potentials, intraoperative monitoring, and sonography.

There were 245 respondents to the survey (160 neurology clinicians and 85 genetic clinicians). Neurology clinicians reported multiple, overlapping barriers to offering pwMND GS. Lack of time to discuss GS in clinic and lack of training in genetics were reported. Neurology clinicians scored significantly less well on self-rated genomic knowledge and genetic counselling skills than genetic clinicians. The majority of neurology clinicians reported that they do not have adequate educational or patient information resources to support GS discussions.

Students rotated from room to room, listening to patients' experiences with different neurologic diseases and eliciting pathologic neurologic examinations. Students were surveyed before and after Neuro Day. The result of the binomial test indicated that the proportion of medical students interested in neurology significantly increased from 78% to 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-0.92; <i>p</i> = 0.034) after participating in Neuro Day. The proportion of students' knowledge of clinical neurology increased from 45% to 63.1% (95% CI 0.54-0.72; <i>p</i> < 0.0001), comfort with performing a neurologic examination increased from 30% to 78.4% (95% CI 0.70-0.86; <i>p</i> < 0.0001), and fear of studying neurology decreased from 46% to 26% (95% CI 0.17-0.34; <i>p</i> < 0.0001) following Neuro Day. One hundred percent of students indicated that they would recommend Neuro Day to their peers. Neuro Day is a feasible and effective model to incorporate into medical education. There was increased interest in and decreased fear of neurology. We anticipate that this paradigm can be used in the future to encourage students to consider a career in neurology.",Neurology,2021-Mar,"Frey J, Neeley B, Umer A, Lewis JW, Lama A, Pawar G, Murray A",7,1611,neurology,2025-11-22
32862137,Video consultations in ordinary and extraordinary times.,"Tele-neurology is a neurological consultation at a distance, or not in person, using various technologies to achieve connectivity, including the telephone and the internet. The telephone is ubiquitous and is a standard part of how we manage patients. Video consulting has been used for a long time in some centres, particularly in those where the geography means that patients have to travel long distances. Various technologies can be used, and with the development of various internet-based video-calling platforms, real-time video consulting has become much more accessible. We have provided a tele-neurology service in the North East of Scotland since 2006 using video conferencing with far-end camera control. More recently, we have complemented this using an internet-based platform (NHS Near Me). Here we outline the practicalities of video consulting in 'ordinary' times and comment on its use in the 'extraordinary' times of the coronavirus pandemic.",Practical neurology,2020-Oct,"Duncan C, Macleod AD",2,959,neurology,2025-11-22

A pre-tested survey form was sent to 40 neurology tertiary care centers in all the provinces in the country in the first week of July 2020. 33 filled forms were received, out of which 18 were public (government) and 15 were private hospitals. Estimated 1300 HCW (faculty, medical officers, trainees and nurses) work at these 33 participating centers. There were 17 deaths among HCW (1.3%) at ten centers. Sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) were provided to 158 HCW (12%). 129 (10%)HCW tested positive for COVID 19 at 31 centers including trainees/medical officers (39), consultants (29) and nursing and other staff (61). Due to low neurology admissions, 23/33 hospitals (70%) posted neurology trainees in COVID 19 units to contribute to covid care. Less than 50% hospitals did covid screening PCR before admission to neurology wards. Only 10% hospitals provide training and regular update to HCW. Neurology tele-health services were started for clinically stable patients at 15 (45%) centers. Only 60% neurology training programs were able to start online training. Ongoing research studies and trials focusing neurological manifestations of COVID-19 were done at 10 (30%) centers. Modification of facilities for COVID patients showed that 24(72%) hospitals strictly reduced the number of attendants accompanying patients. Only 10 (30%) centers had neurophysiological tests being conducted on COVID-19 patients. Mental health support services to HCW were provided at 12 (36%) centers.

39504215,Investigation of Neurophobia amongst North American Veterinary Students and Development of a Veterinary Neurophobia Scoring Tool (VetNeuroQ).,"""Neurophobia"" is a phenomenon in human medical education where students develop negative attitudes towards neurology, impeding student learning and future clinical practice. While suspected to exist in veterinary medical education, it remains unstudied. The main objectives of this study were to examine North American veterinary student attitudes towards neurology and neurology education and explore elements that might contribute to neurophobia. Additional objectives were to evaluate veterinary educators' perceptions of student neurophobia and to develop and validate a scoring tool (VetNeuroQ) to quantify veterinary neurophobia. Veterinary students and faculty at North American veterinary schools were surveyed. A scoring tool was developed from a subset of questions and validated using confirmatory factor analysis. Six hundred six anonymous responses were collected from students at all stages of veterinary education. Neurology training was reported as insufficient by 35.9% and most respondents perceived neurology to not be easy to learn. Neuroanatomy/physiology and neurolocalization were considered difficult concepts. Students rated low confidence in neurology (vs. other topics), and low interest in the Neurology/Neurosurgery specialty. 61.7% of educators reported neurophobia amongst their students. The proposed VetNeuroQ scale showed high reliability (Cronbach's alpha >0.7) and validity (<i>p</i> < .05; CFI >0.9, RMSEA <0.08). VetNeuroQ scores were low but improved over the course of veterinary education. These findings demonstrate low self-efficacy, interest, and confidence, along with perceptions of difficulty, amongst veterinary students, consistent with neurophobia. Contributing elements are discussed. The VetNeuroQ scale allows quantification of veterinary student neurophobia and may be useful for screening students and assessing the impact of educational interventions.",Journal of veterinary medical education,2024-Dec,"Murthy VD, Le L, Heater HD, Guess SC, Chen AV",5,1907,neurology,2025-11-22
32887772,Training in Neurology: Rapid implementation of cross-institutional neurology resident education in the time of COVID-19.,"In-person resident didactics are traditionally limited to the faculty within a single institution. Tele-education efforts have been implemented in neurology to various degrees historically, but the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated a broad and immediate overhaul in neurology didactic training. To respond to the immediate need for resident didactics, we created a rapid onset, volunteer tele-education didactic series publicized on online forums to the American Academy of Neurology A.B. Baker Section via Synapse and the Women Neurologists Group via Facebook. We describe how, with just 1 week of lead time, we created an ongoing neurology lecture series featuring faculty from across the country lecturing on a diverse range of neurology topics. The series is ongoing and draws upwards of 120 residents per lecture.

33479919,Development of Neurological Emergency Simulations for Assessment: Content Evidence and Response Process.,"To document two sources of validity evidence for simulation-based assessment in neurological emergencies. A critical aspect of education is development of evaluation techniques that assess learner's performance in settings that reflect actual clinical practice. Simulation-based evaluation affords the opportunity to standardize evaluations but requires validation. We identified topics from the Neurocritical Care Society's Emergency Neurological Life Support (ENLS) training, cross-referenced with the American Academy of Neurology's core clerkship curriculum. We used a modified Delphi method to develop simulations for assessment in neurocritical care. We constructed checklists of action items and communication skills, merging ENLS checklists with relevant clinical guidelines. We also utilized global rating scales, rated one (novice) through five (expert) for each case. Participants included neurology sub-interns, neurology residents, neurosurgery interns, non-neurology critical care fellows, neurocritical care fellows, and neurology attending physicians. Ten evaluative simulation cases were developed. To date, 64 participants have taken part in 274 evaluative simulation scenarios. The participants were very satisfied with the cases (Likert scale 1-7, not at all satisfied-very satisfied, median 7, interquartile range (IQR) 7-7), found them to be very realistic (Likert scale 1-7, not at all realistic-very realistic, median 6, IQR 6-7), and appropriately difficult (Likert scale 1-7, much too easy-much too difficult, median 4, IQR 4-5). Interrater reliability was acceptable for both checklist action items (kappa = 0.64) and global rating scales (Pearson correlation r = .70). We demonstrated two sources of validity in ten simulation cases for assessment in neurological emergencies.",Neurocritical care,2021-Oct,"Morris NA, Chang W, Tabatabai A, Gutierrez CA, Phipps MS, Lerner DP, Bates OJ, Tisherman SA",8,1804,neurology,2025-11-22
28870393,How and when to refer patients diagnosed with primary headache and craniofacial neuralgia in the Emergency department or Primary Care: Recommendations of the Spanish Society of Neurology's Headache Study Group.,"When a patient is diagnosed with primary headache or craniofacial neuralgia in the emergency department or in primary care, and is referred to a neurologist due to the complexity of the case, it is useful to know whether additional examination should be sought and the priority (urgent, preferential or normal) with which the patient should be seen. This will avoid unnecessary delays in patients with disabling headache and where organic causes are suspected. In order to issue recommendations on this matter, the Spanish Society of Neurology's Headache Study Group has decided to create a series of agreed recommendations constituting a referral protocol for patients with headache and/or craniofacial neuralgia. Young neurologists with an interest and experience in headache were invited to draft a series of practical guidelines in collaboration with Spanish Society of Neurology's Headache Study Group Executive Committee. For practical reasons, the document was divided into 2 articles: this first article focuses on primary headaches and craniofacial neuralgias and the second on secondary headaches. In order for the recommendations to be helpful for daily practice they follow a practical approach, with tables summarising referral criteria, examinations to be performed, and referral to other specialists. We hope to offer a guide and tools to improve decision-making regarding patients with headache, identifying complementary tests to prioritise and referral pathways to be followed, in order to avoid duplicated consultations and delayed diagnosis and treatment.",Neurologia,2020-Apr,"Gago-Veiga AB, García-Azorín D, Mas-Sala N, Ordás CM, Ruiz-Piñero M, Torres-Ferrús M, Santos-Lasaosa S, Viguera Romero J, Pozo-Rosich P",9,1575,neurology,2025-11-22

Despite these, applicants for the field of neurology have traditionally been low. Following changes were introduced: an open board style SIGN chapter executive committee with greater active engagement of first and second year students. New activities included journal clubs, hands on workshops, celebration/cause events (example ALS walk). In addition, a free neurology clinic was introduced. Activities were planned in consultation with office of medical education, and were organized during 'down times'. Data on student enrollment, activities successfully carried out, students interested in neurology residency, number of neurology-related research projects with student involvement were collected prior to changes and compared to values after changes were introduced. Post intervention, student engagement in neurology activities and projects increased significantly. However, a similar increase in applications to neurology residency was not yet observed. An open chapter with early engagement and involvement of first and second year medical students, creating a variety of chapter activities with greater hands on involvement, planned in conjunction with office of medical education has reinvigorated our SIGN chapter.",BMC medical education,2021-Apr,"Gummi R, Smith R, Govindarajan R",3,1444,neurology,2025-11-22

As a concept, brain health is complex and requires a multidisciplinary collaborative approach between many professional and public organizations to bring into effect meaningful change. Neurologists are uniquely positioned to serve as specialists in brain health and to advance the newly evolving field of preventive neurology, which aims to identify individuals at high risk of brain disorders and other neurologic conditions and offer strategies to mitigate disease emergence or progression. For decades, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) has demonstrated a commitment to brain health through its public outreach and advocacy. The AAN's Brain Health Initiative launched in 2022 with a strategic plan prioritizing brain health as a key aspect of public engagement and positioning the AAN and neurologists as champions of brain health in collaboration with a broad range of other brain health providers. In this study, we present (1) the new definition of brain health developed by the AAN for neurologists, patients, partners in health care, and the public; (2) the strategic objectives of the AAN Brain Health Initiative; and (3) the AAN Brain Health Platform and Action Plan framework, including key positions on brain health, its 3 ambitious goals, and a national brain health vision. The top-line priorities of the AAN Brain Health Action Plan highlight the need for research, education, public policy, and direct-to-public messaging across the individual's life span and will serve as a catalyst for future cross-disciplinary collaborations within each epoch and longitudinally. The AAN Brain Health Platform is designed to communicate the AAN's vision for brain health and provide a blueprint toward achieving the future of optimal brain health across the life span for all. Through this position statement, we call upon neurologists and other stakeholders in brain health to join our collective efforts to accomplish the ultimate goal of transforming the current trajectory of public health of an increasing burden of neurologic disorders-from both illness and injury-to achieving optimal brain health for all.",Neurology,2023-Sep,"Rost NS, Salinas J, Jordan JT, Banwell B, Correa DJ, Said RR, Selwa LM, Song S, Evans DA",9,2283,neurology,2025-11-22
32188653,Prevalence of acute neurology: a 2-week snapshot in a district general hospital.,"Neurological illnesses are a common cause of hospital admissions, yet most patients are not primarily managed by neurologists. Acute neurology service provision varies across the UK. This study aimed to establish the number of neurological admissions during a 2-week period in a district general hospital, as well as the proportion of those patients who were seen by the hyperacute neurology team. This was done by analysing the diagnostic codes. It was established that there was a total of 2,242 admissions during the study period and, of those, 491 (22%) had neurological codes. Analysis of the 491 hospital electronic records revealed that 229 (10%) were truly neurologically relevant and, of those, 14% of patients received an opinion from the neurology team. Therefore, it can be concluded that only a small proportion of acute neurology is currently being seen by neurologists.","Clinical medicine (London, England)",2020-Mar,"Kanagaratnam M, Boodhoo A, MacDonald BK, Nitkunan A",4,884,neurology,2025-11-22
33196138,The impact of an online adult headache guideline on headache referrals to the neurology clinic.,"Headache is a common problem in primary care and one of the main reasons general practitioners (GP) consult the neurology service. We developed an online adult headache guideline (Supporting Information Appendix S1) for the greater Wellington Region as a resource for GP to guide identification of concerning headaches, initiation of prophylactic medications for migraine and management of analgesic overuse headache. To examine the effectiveness of this adult headache guideline in reducing demand on the neurology outpatient service for headache patients that could readily be managed in primary care. We reviewed electronic referrals to Wellington Hospital's neurology department before and after the implementation of the online headache guideline. The primary outcome was the proportion of referrals for headache. Secondary outcomes included proportion of referrals requiring clinic review, rate of pre-referral trial of headache prophylactic medication and medication overuse headache diagnosed at neurological consultation. Nine hundred neurology referrals before and 801 referrals after the publication of the online headache guideline were included. There was a statistically significant reduction in proportion of referrals for headache (15.4% vs 11.7%; P = 0.026). There was neither an increased rate of pre-referral adequate prophylactic medication trial (33.8% vs 27.7%; P = 0.320) nor fewer medication overuse headaches diagnosed during the neurology assessment (21.9% vs 25.0%; P = 0.674). The launch of an online headache guideline was associated with a reduction in demand on neurology service. Further education could improve the utilisation of this guideline, to avoid delays in prophylactic treatment and reduce the harm of medication overuse.",Internal medicine journal,2021-Aug,"Huang L, Bourke D, Ranta A",3,1763,neurology,2025-11-22
39740860,"Novel pathways for headache via neurology same day emergency care: admission avoidance, prevention of lumbar punctures and reduced length of stay in hospital.","There are various models for acute neurology services in the UK, with considerable variation in practice. Patients are often admitted unnecessarily for neurology review, leading to delay in diagnosis and treatment. Alternative models, such as the Neurology Same Day Emergency Care service (Neuro-SDEC) at University College London Hospital provide a pathway that can prevent admissions and streamline patient care. Headache is one of the commonest presenting symptoms in acute neurology.This study compared the impact of Neuro-SDEC on the care for patients presenting with headache against the standard pathway.A prospective audit was undertaken from November - December 2023 to evaluate all appropriate patients seen by the Neuro-SDEC service or admitted to the ward. For Neuro-SDEC patients, each case was reviewed to see whether an admission, lumbar puncture or neurology outpatient referral was avoided. For admitted patients, length of inpatient stay, time to neurology review and discharge diagnosis was recorded.Fifty-one patients were seen by Neuro-SDEC, twenty-five of whom would have been admitted to hospital on the standard pathway. Thirty general neurology outpatient clinic referrals were prevented and 5 patients avoided a lumbar puncture. In 45% of cases, the working diagnosis changed after the patient was seen by the Neuro-SDEC team. There were seven admitted patients not seen by the service with a combined length of stay of 17 bed days. The average wait time for inpatient neurology review was 42 hours. 3 admitted patients underwent a lumbar puncture. 2 patients were referred on to neuro-SDEC to enable an earlier discharge from hospital. Migraine was the most common final diagnosis in both groups.This study highlights that Neuro-SDEC is effective at reducing hospital admissions, as well as unnecessary tests and referrals to generalneurology outpatients.

Survey data was collected from attendees at a national educational conference and at a large academic medical school. Two proportion z-tests were used to assess responses among students of different racial/ethnic backgrounds. 199 students participated in the survey. Compared to their Asian and White counterparts, Black students were significantly less likely to choose or consider a career in Neurology. In addition, we found that these students relied more heavily on their pre-clinical experiences to make this determination, citing preference for another specialty, lack of exposure, a preference for a different patient population, and a lack of racial/ethnic diversity as key reasons to not choose a career in Neurology. Neurological disorders are important contributors to morbidity and mortality. It is imperative that the field attract medical students toward careers in Neurology, particularly those students from traditionally and persistently underrepresented backgrounds. Our findings suggest that Black medical students consider Neurology as a specialty choice less frequently than their counterparts do, and this decision may be made prior to training. We conclude that a multifaceted approach is best to improve the racial/ethnic diversity within the neurological workforce, which should include targeted interventions prior to and after matriculation to medical school.",Journal of the National Medical Association,2022-Jan,"Railey KM, Spector AR",2,1523,neurology,2025-11-22

Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts were identified (or noted as nonexistent) for 159 accredited neurology departments and residency programs. Google searches and social media site specific searches were performed. For existing pages, the date of creation was determined and all posts on and after March 1st, 2020, were assessed to investigate the presence of virtual open house advertisements. Each program was also assessed for virtual sub-internship and elective opportunities on the Visiting Student Application Service (VSAS). A majority of neurology residency programs (110) had a social media presence, particularly on Twitter and Instagram. Most residency program Twitter and Instagram accounts were created after March 1st, 2020, and this was not the case on Facebook. Twitter and Instagram were used most to advertise virtual opportunities. A correlation was observed between presence and number of social media accounts and program prestige. Few programs offered virtual opportunities on VSAS for the 2020-2021 year. Neurology residency programs adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic by creating residency social media accounts, primarily on Instagram and Twitter, and hosting virtual informational events. We recommend that neurology residency applicants create professional Instagram and Twitter accounts to network with programs and receive updates about virtual events. Similarly, going forward, we recommend continued social media use by neurology residency programs for applicant outreach.",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2021-Aug,"Gaini RR, Patel KM, Khan SA, Singh NP, Love MN",5,1775,neurology,2025-11-22

However, patients are not always managed by the ward team but instead are referred to a visiting vestibular neurology team or referred for outpatient follow-up. We aimed to ascertain whether training trauma ward therapists to manage a common form of post-traumatic dizziness (Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo [BPPV]) reduced referrals to a visiting vestibular neurology team. Referrals of patients with aTBI with complaints of dizziness to the visiting vestibular neurology team were audited from the Major Trauma Centre at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK. Ward therapists subsequently received training on management of BPPV. Referrals to the vestibular neurology service were re-audited. Therapist confidence in assessing and treating BPPV was also assessed pre and post-training. Pre-training, referral rate to the visiting vestibular neurology service was eight patients per month. Following training, referrals to the vestibular neurology service reduced by 35%. Therapist confidence improved significantly following training. Training trauma ward therapists to manage BPPV reduced referrals to a visiting vestibular neurology service.

37858888,Telemedicine in the management of patients with headache: current situation and recommendations of the Spanish Society of Neurology's Headache Study Group.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unexpected boost to telemedicine. We analyse the impact of the pandemic on telemedicine applied in Spanish headache consultations, review the literature, and issue recommendations for the implementation of telemedicine in consultations. The study comprised 3 phases: 1) review of the MEDLINE database since 1958 (first reported experience with telemedicine); 2) Google Forms survey sent to all members of the Spanish Society of Neurology's Headache Study Group (GECSEN); and 3) online consensus of GECSEN experts to issue recommendations for the implementation of telemedicine in Spain. COVID-19 has increased waiting times for face-to-face consultations, increasing the use of all telemedicine modalities: landline telephone (from 75% before April 2020 to 97% after), mobile telephone (from 9% to 27%), e-mail (from 30% to 36%), and video consultation (from 3% to 21%). Neurologists are aware of the need to expand the availability of video consultations, which are clearly growing, and other e-health and m-health tools. The GECSEN recommends and encourages all neurologists who assist patients with headaches to implement telemedicine resources, with the optimal objective of offering video consultation to patients under 60-65 years of age and telephone calls to older patients, although each case must be considered on an individual basis. Prior approval and advice must be sought from legal and IT services and the centre's management.

39432876,Hughlings Jackson's Second Thoughts on Mental States in Epilepsy.,"John Hughlings Jackson (1835-1911) was the pre-eminent British neurologist of the last 3 decades of the 19th century whose most seminal contributions related to the understanding of epileptic seizures. Jackson instructed that his personal papers should be destroyed at his death, and consequently, few examples of his handwriting now survive. We discovered a series of marginalia in Jackson's handwriting annotating one of his papers, ""On temporary mental disorders after epileptic paroxysms,"" first published in 1875 in the <i>West Riding Lunatic Asylum Medical Reports</i>. Two of the most extensive annotations indicate Jackson's later understanding of ""epileptic vertigo"" and of ""mental automatisms."" We contextualize the changes in Jackson's thinking suggested by these emendations. These marginalia give insights into Jackson's continuing effort to understand epilepsy and its implications for brain function, an issue that was then, as now, one of the fundamental problems in neurology.",Neurology,2024-Nov,"Larner AJ, Swash M",2,993,neurology,2025-11-22

In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the neurology department at the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris held a preeminent position as the global hub of neurology. Professor Jean-Martin Charcot, widely acclaimed as the father of modern neurology, was the most revered neurology professor of the nineteenth century. Many physicians from diverse countries across South America (notably Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, Brazil, and Colombia), the Caribbean (Cuba), and Mexico pursued specialized training in neurology under Charcot's tutelage, and even after his passing in 1893, they continued their training with his numerous disciples. As a result, nearly two centuries after the birth of Charcot, his enduring contributions to the field of neurology remain vibrantly influential, particularly in Latin America.",Journal of the history of the neurosciences,2025-,"Teive HAG, Camargo CHF",2,971,neurology,2025-11-22

Growing recommendations in the field recommend that neurologists have primary skills in palliative medicine that will allow them to manage symptoms and discuss end-of-life decisions with patients and families. Previous work has shown that formal palliative care training in neurology residencies is very limited. In this article, we briefly describe a national survey of neurology residents where we assess both the quantity and quality of the teaching they receive in end-of-life care as compared to a common and an uncommon neurologic condition.

Here, we describe how the Stanford Neurology Department (1) rapidly adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in over 1,000 video visits within 4 weeks, and (2) accelerated an existing quality improvement plan of a tiered roll out of video visits for ambulatory neurology to a full-scale roll out. Key issues we encountered and addressed were related to equipment/software, provider engagement, workflow/triage, and training. On reflection, the key drivers of our success were provider engagement and dedicated support from a physician champion, who plays a critical role understanding stakeholder needs. Before COVID-19, physician interest in telemedicine was mixed. However, in response to county and state stay-at-home orders related to COVID-19, physician engagement changed completely; all providers wanted to convert a majority of visits to video visits as quickly as possible. Rapid deployment of neurology video visits across all its subspecialties is feasible. Our experience and lessons learned can facilitate broader utilization, acceptance, and normalization of video visits for neurology patients in the present as well as the much anticipated postpandemic era.",Neurology,2020-Aug,"Yang L, Brown-Johnson CG, Miller-Kuhlmann R, Kling SMR, Saliba-Gustafsson EA, Shaw JG, Gold CA, Winget M",8,1275,neurology,2025-11-22

Over the past three decades, telemedicine use has steadily grown; however, neurologists often learn on the job, rather than as part of their medical training. The current literature regarding telestroke training during neurology training is sparse, focusing on cerebrovascular fellowship curricula. We sought to enhance telestroke training in our neurology residency by incorporating real-life application.</i><b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b><i>We implemented a formal educational model for neurology residents to use telemedicine for remote acquisition of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) for patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke (AIS) before arrival at our comprehensive stroke center. This three-phase educational model involved multidisciplinary classroom didactics, simulation exercises, and real-world experience. Training and feedback were provided by neurologists experienced in telemedicine.</i><b><i>Results:</i></b><i>All residents completed formal training in telemedicine prehospital NIHSS acquisition and had the opportunity to participate in additional simulation exercises. Currently, residents are gaining additional experience by performing prehospital NIHSS acquisition for patients in whom AIS is suspected.

39601119,Group text messaging as a residency teaching tool in outpatient neurology and headache: A mixed-methods observational study.,"To assess the feasibility and efficacy of group text messaging as a teaching tool to improve neurology resident knowledge and clinical pearl dissemination in an outpatient setting enriched with headache encounters, and to evaluate if learning points from this teaching method would influence resident care of subsequent patients. Inpatient neurology teaching during training is most often accomplished in team settings during rounds or conferences such as morning report, but outpatient teaching where headache is more likely encountered may be less consistently performed in such a setting where learning points may be shared. Few studies have evaluated whether group text messaging can be an innovative tool for teaching in residency training. Neurology residents in a continuity clinic pod at New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell were included in this cohort from December 2020 through March 2024. Group text messages deidentified of any patient information were sent to the resident pod by their preceptor after each clinic session featuring one text message regarding a takeaway learning point pertaining to each patient encounter. Residents were surveyed on their satisfaction with this teaching method and whether these text messages improved their outpatient neurology knowledge. A total of 230 text messages were sent to a cohort of 21 residents across 4 academic years. Text message topics covered a variety of neurological subspecialties, most commonly headache and facial pain (44.8%), general neurology (15.7%), and neuromuscular (14.3%). In our survey, 93% of resident respondents reported that receiving clinical pearls improved their outpatient neurology knowledge and changed how they cared for subsequent patients. Reinforcement of traditionally one-on-one learning points in a teaching outpatient setting to engage a group of residents was feasible across visit types. There was an overall very positive response to this teaching method, and residents reported improved knowledge, which influenced their care of subsequent patients.",Headache,2025-Apr,"Song A, Safdieh JE, Robbins MS",3,2050,neurology,2025-11-22
39724535,Opinion & Special Articles: Beyond Pronouns-Educating Trainees on the Impact of Language on Gender Inclusivity in Neurologic Practice.,"Language plays an important role in ensuring gender inclusivity within neurology. Despite progress in language inclusivity, such as the emergence of explicit pronouns, more remains to be done. Historically, sex and gender have been used interchangeably, but they are, in fact, distinct concepts. This is an important distinction particularly in the care of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals, whose assigned sex and gender are incongruent. In the health care setting, TGD individuals frequently report misgendering, identity invalidation, and gender pathologizing, which have led to health care avoidance and mistrust. Ultimately, to ensure effective integration of gender-affirming language into clinical care, training should be introduced early in neurology residency and fellowship education. Through 3 case studies in epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and stroke, we discuss language use in neurology and provide recommendations to support trainees in the use of gender-affirming language. We underscore the importance of gender-affirming language in health care equity and cultivating a safe, inclusive clinical environment. It is crucial for residents and fellows to not only be informed on cultural humility and gender-affirming terminology but also learn to avoid assumptions and seek clarification about gender identity when needed. Ultimately, trainees proficient in these skills cultivate trust in clinical relationships, reduce discrimination against TGD populations, and improve patient health outcomes in neurologic care.",Neurology,2025-Jan,"Tsai W, Chen J, Pikula A, Johnson EL, Rosendale N, Bove R, L'Erario ZP, Bui E",8,1546,neurology,2025-11-22

34315785,Guidelines for Conducting Ethical Artificial Intelligence Research in Neurology: A Systematic Approach for Clinicians and Researchers.,"Preemptive recognition of the ethical implications of study design and algorithm choices in artificial intelligence (AI) research is an important but challenging process. AI applications have begun to transition from a promising future to clinical reality in neurology. As the clinical management of neurology is often concerned with discrete, often unpredictable, and highly consequential events linked to multimodal data streams over long timescales, forthcoming advances in AI have great potential to transform care for patients. However, critical ethical questions have been raised with implementation of the first AI applications in clinical practice. Clearly, AI will have far-reaching potential to promote, but also to endanger, ethical clinical practice. This article employs an anticipatory ethics approach to scrutinize how researchers in neurology can methodically identify ethical ramifications of design choices early in the research and development process, with a goal of preempting unintended consequences that may violate principles of ethical clinical care. First, we discuss the use of a systematic framework for researchers to identify ethical ramifications of various study design and algorithm choices. Second, using epilepsy as a paradigmatic example, anticipatory clinical scenarios that illustrate unintended ethical consequences are discussed, and failure points in each scenario evaluated. Third, we provide practical recommendations for understanding and addressing ethical ramifications early in methods development stages. Awareness of the ethical implications of study design and algorithm choices that may unintentionally enter AI is crucial to ensuring that incorporation of AI into neurology care leads to patient benefit rather than harm.",Neurology,2021-Sep,"Chiang S, Picard RW, Chiong W, Moss R, Worrell GA, Rao VR, Goldenholz DM",7,1773,neurology,2025-11-22

The situation affected the activity of the residents in neurology, who were also offered the possibility of being formally hired before their training completion. (1) To showcase examples of clinical and research activity of residents in neurology during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and (2) to illustrate the point of view of Italian residents in neurology about the possibility of being hired before the completion of their residency program. Real-life reports from several areas in Lombardia-one of the Italian regions more affected by COVID-19-show that residents in neurology gave an outstanding demonstration of generosity, collaboration, reliability, and adaptation to the changing environment, while continuing their clinical training and research activities. A very small minority of the residents participated in the dedicated selections for being hired before completion of their training program. The large majority of them prioritized their training over the option of earlier employment. Italian residents in neurology generously contributed to the healthcare management of the COVID-19 pandemic in many ways, while remaining determined to pursue their training.

Because this would have resulted in the neurology clerkship accommodating double enrollment for an entire academic year, 4<sup>th</sup> year medical students from the prior curriculum (graduating class of 2017) were offered the option of opting-out of the required neurology clerkship if they demonstrated competency by passing the USA National Board of Medical Examiners (US-NBME) clinical neurology subject examination and completing a neurology faculty-observed history and complete neurological examination.<b>Results</b>: Fifty-seven of 133 fourth-year students (42.9%) chose to complete the required neurology clerkship with 77 (57.9%) choosing to opt-out. All opt-out students passed the neurological exam assessment and scored similarly to the students who took the clerkship (US-NBME Neurology Subject Exam mean raw score in the opt-out group 76.9 vs, 77.6; p = 0.61). Students grades did not differ. Students who opted-out tended to pursue surgical careers (e.g., general surgery -10.8% opted-out vs 0% clerkship, OB/GYN - 6.8% opted-out vs 0% clerkship, orthopedic surgery 5.4% opted-out vs 0% clerkship) where those who took the clerkship tended to choose medical residency training disciplines (family medicine -16.1% clerkship vs 10.8% opting-out; internal medicine - 32.1% clerkship vs 14.9% opting-out; psychiatry 10.7% clerkship vs 2.7% opting-out (p = 0.042)<b>Conclusion</b>: While undertaking the neurology clerkship would have been the desired approach, students appear not to have been harmed by the opt-out approach regarding performance on the US-NBME clinical neurology subject exam.

Other medical specialties, such as oncology, have developed assessment methods similar to the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) to address this issue. Here we report the implementation of an OSCE focused on the diagnosis announcement of chronic disease in neurology by residents. We aimed to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and validity in routine practice of an OSCE combined with a theoretical course focused on diagnosis announcement in neurology. Eighteen neurology residents were prospectively included between 2019 and 2022. First, they answered a questionnaire on their previous level of training in diagnosis announcement. Second, in a practical session with a simulated patient, they made a 15-min diagnosis announcement and then had 5mins of immediate feedback with an expert observer, present in the room. The OSCE consisted of 4 different stations, with standardized scenarios dedicated to the announcement of multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Third, in a theory session, expert observers covered the essential theoretical points. All residents and expert observers completed an evaluation of the ""practical session"" and the ""theory session"". Residents estimated their previous level of diagnosis announcement training at 3.1/5. The most feared announcements were AD and ALS. The ""practical session"" was rated at a mean of 4.1/5 by the residents and 4.8/5 by the expert observers, and the ""theory session"" at a mean of 4.7/5 by the residents and 5/5 by the expert observers. After the OSCEs, 11 residents felt more confident about making an announcement.

However, in 1953, ironically, he became embroiled in a controversial event regarding the German neuroscientist and Nazi collaborator Julius Hallervorden. Wartenberg attempted to convince the Dutch delegation to attend the International Neurological Congress in Lisbon from which they had withdrawn in response to Hallervorden's inclusion as a speaker. In addition, he rallied neuroscientists worldwide to help convince the Dutch, largely ignoring and burying their concerns about Hallervorden's ethical transgressions. In numerous letters, Wartenberg wanted to both ignore and exonerate Hallervorden of ethical violations in collecting 700 brains from patients murdered in the Nazi euthanasia program. Wartenberg's unexpected defense of Hallervorden, despite not knowing him professionally, purportedly was to reintegrate German neuroscience to the international community and to create Western ""unity"" against communism. However, Wartenberg's efforts and the lack of international censure against Hallervorden prevented proper attention to the victims' brains that remained in Hallervorden's collection for decades and the use of these brains in scientific publications. Those who stood against Hallervorden have been vindicated by history, but work remains to uncover all brain specimens in German collections.

In one of the most famous controversies in the history of neurology, the French neurologists Joseph Jules Dejerine (1849-1917), Augusta Dejerine-Klumpke (1859-1927), and Pierre Marie (1853-1940) faced each other during the three symposiums of the French Society of Neurology in 1908. The debate, which was later called ""the aphasia quarrel"", focused on the subject of aphasia. In an article published in January of the same year, the Italian neurologist Giovanni Mingazzini had already explicitly challenged Pierre Marie's conception of aphasia. Mingazzini's contribution to the ""aphasia debate"" deserves to be remembered for the emphasis on the role of Broca's area, and for his detailed description of a subcortical region representing ""the crossroad of the language pathways"" which, if lesioned, could cause motor aphasia.",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2020-Oct,"Brigo F, Nardone R",2,1083,neurology,2025-11-22

We created a web-based survey regarding changes in clinical, research, and educational activity of neurology trainees in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures undertaken by local institutions to reduce the risk of contagion. Seventy-nine residents working in Italy completed the survey. A total of 87.3% of trainees reported a substantial reduction in their neurologic duties since COVID-19 appeared in Italy, and 17.8% were also recruited or volunteered for COVID-19-dedicated wards. Likewise, more than 60% of trainees experienced a reduction or interruption in research activity. As regards the perceived effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on their neurologic training, almost 70% of surveyed trainees believe that the COVID-19 pandemic had or will have a negative effect on their formation as neurologists, for different reasons. Furthermore, trainees reported a consistent exposure (69.6%) to confirmed positive COVID-19 cases at work, with divergent surveillance and preventive measures taken by local institutions. Overall, the survey shows that the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy has had a subjective negative effect on neurology residents on didactics, clinical, and research training as well as training abroad. The COVID-19 outbreak poses many challenges to academic institutions and training programs, and addressing these issues promptly is crucial to ensure continued quality of trainees' neurologic education.

We identified 42 headache fellowship programs using the United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties certification database. After an initial contact via e-mail, we conducted individual telephone interviews with program directors. Qualitative data coding allowed identification of emerging themes. Quantitative data were summarized with descriptive statistics. Forty (95%) program directors (34 adult, 6 pediatric) responded. Emerging themes included the following. (1) There are benefits and disadvantages to having a match. (2) If the match were reinstated, programs would participate only if all programs participated. (3) There should be consequences for programs that do not participate. If the match were reinstated, 37.5% of program directors responded that their program would participate without conditions; 37.5% would participate only if every program were required to participate. Fifteen percent would not participate, and 10% were not sure if they would participate. Forty percent supported sanctions against programs that did not participate in the match. The fellowship match potentially makes the process more systematic for both programs and applicants; however, it does not currently appear to be a feasible option for the field of headache medicine.

38403947,Clinical observations in acute neurology: A historical explanation of the present.,"The history of the development of acute neurologic disease as a biologic mechanism is of interest. Equally important is how it translated to the bedside and how the clinical examination differentiated itself. This paper reviews primary sources pertaining to acute neurologic conditions described mostly in the 19th and 20th century. A review of monographs, treatises, textbooks, and peer-reviewed articles was conducted. The evolution of clinical signs and syndromes associated with dynamic intracranial pathologies was predicated on the idea that animal studies informed clinicians, who then linked clinical signs to these observations. A dominant theme is that innovative technologies could trace acute processes through all their various stages, affording a complete picture of the disease process. Just as clinical descriptors of central nervous system processes evolved, the presentation of acute neuromuscular respiratory failure became better defined. Once practices incorporated these acute clinical signs, textbooks cemented their ""gold standard"" status with relative impunity. The practise of acute neurology and neurocritical care must find out what, historically, others were seeking but could not find. Patterns of clinical presentation in acute neurology are sufficiently recognizable to guide practise decisions. Although, the currently well-documented clinical syndromes of acute neurologic conditions (at presentation and during deterioration) have been taught for generations, practitioners have noted that they lack consistency and predictability. History also taught us that part of this improved knowledge came with designated units-a clear example of how protean systems (not always innovative neurologists or neuroscientists or technologies) shaped the history of neurology.",European journal of neurology,2024-Nov,Wijdicks EFM,1,1797,neurology,2025-11-22
36847175,Does E-learning Facilitate Medical Education in Pediatric Neurology?,"E-learning has become commonplace in medical education. Incorporation of multimedia, clinical cases, and interactive elements has increased its attractiveness over textbooks. Although there has been an expansion of e-learning in medicine, the feasibility of e-learning in pediatric neurology is unclear. This study evaluates knowledge acquisition and satisfaction using pediatric neurology e-learning compared to conventional learning. Residents of Canadian pediatrics, neurology, and pediatric neurology programs and medical students from Queens University, Western University, and the University of Ottawa were invited to participate. Learners were randomly assigned two review papers and two ebrain modules in a four-topic crossover design. Participants completed pre-tests, experience surveys, and post-tests. We calculated the median change in score from pre-test to post-test and constructed a mixed-effects model to determine the effect of variables on post-test scores. In total, 119 individuals participated (53 medical students; 66 residents). Ebrain had a larger positive change than review papers in post-test score from pre-test score for the pediatric stroke learning topic but a smaller positive change for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, childhood absence epilepsy, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Learning topics showed statistical relationship to post-test scores (<i>p</i> = 0.04). Depending on topic, 57-92% (<i>N</i> = 59-66) of respondents favored e-learning over review article learning. Ebrain users scored higher on post-tests than review paper users. However, the effect is small and it is unclear if it is educationally meaningful. Although the difference in scores may not be substantially different, most learners preferred e-learning.

The workshop aimed to explore global issues which have impact on access to child neurology training. The major findings supported a great need for more training programs globally, that consensus is needed for the minimum standards of training, and that training programs can be strengthened via global health partnerships especially with collaborations from regions with more available resources. The group concurred that the phenomena of 'neurophobia' amongst general paediatricians and medical trainees, was a reality, and creates barriers both working with paediatric colleagues, as well as recruiting specialists to the field. Optimal teaching practices for child neurology should include the expansion of learning through global partnerships and virtual educational resources. Measures must be put into place for fledgling training programs, to support colleagues in less resourced settings and to avoid their burn-out.

We hypothesized that scores would remain stable for students in a shortened 2-week flipped classroom-based virtual rotation as compared to the traditional 4-week Neurology clerkship. There is conflicting evidence whether decreased clerkship duration is associated with reduced NBME shelf examination performance. We hypothesized that Neurology shelf exam scores would remain stable for students in a shortened 2-week flipped classroom-based virtual rotation as compared to the traditional 4-week Neurology clerkship with direct patient care supplemented by didactics. This is a retrospective observational cohort study. In April 2020, the neurology clerkship at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School switched from a traditional 4-week in-person clinical rotation supplemented by didactics to a 2-week flipped classroom-based virtual-only curriculum decoupled from a supplementary 2-week in-person clinical rotation to be completed later. Students were offered the opportunity to test after the 2-week virtual curriculum. NBME shelf scores for these ""exam before clinical rotation"" (EBC) students over the final quarter of the academic year 2019-2020 were compared to those of the ""exam after clinical"" (EAC) students undergoing the 4-week traditional rotation from July 2018 to March 2020. 321 students completed the shelf exam between July 2018 and June 2020, of which 284 students comprised the EAC cohort and 37 students, the EBC cohort. Mean scores did not differ between the EBC and EAC cohorts (81.8 ± 6.7 versus 81.8 ± 6.5, p = 0.96). Additional analyses showed no significant differences in the performance of EBC students as compared to the EAC students that tested within the same academic year 2019-2020 or within the matched quarter of the prior academic year 2018-2019, and students completing the virtual rotation who delayed testing after the clinical experience. Testing after a 2-week flipped classroom-based virtual curriculum in Neurology without additional clinical training did not negatively affect neurology NBME shelf scores. Decoupling clinical experiences from knowledge acquisition and the evaluation of that knowledge base by means of NBME shelf examination is not likely to disadvantage learners with respect to shelf examination performance.",BMC medical education,2024-Nov,"Rybinnik I, Pal G, Farrukh H, Deverett B, Przydzial P, Mani R",6,2406,neurology,2025-11-22
39716846,Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and Pediatric Neurology: Are We Missing the Connection? A Scoping Review.,"IntroductionPediatric neurology provides care for children with complex developmental disorders with environmental, genetic, metabolic, and teratogenic etiologies. Common neurodevelopmental conditions include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder. However, only minimal attention from pediatric neurology journals has been devoted to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. This is surprising because fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with a prevalence of between 1% and 5% of school-age children.MethodsThis scoping review had 2 objectives. Objective 1 was to estimate the number of articles reporting on fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in 8 well-respected pediatric neurology journals. Objective 2 was to determine how many patients from a single pediatric neurology practice referred to a clinic for diagnosis and management of neurobehavioral disorders received a diagnosis of ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.ResultsObjective 1, a survey of 8 prominent pediatric neurology journals until January 2024, found that a title and abstract search identified 1786 articles on the three topics. Papers on autism spectrum disorder (n =1043) accounted for 58.4% of the total. Papers on ADHD (n = 685) comprised 38.4% and articles on fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (n = 58) contributed just 3.3% of the total.Objective 2, a chart review of 40 patients from a single pediatric neurology clinic who were referred for developmental assessment and management, found that 40% had prenatal alcohol exposure and 20% received a diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. High rates of comorbidity between fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and ADHD of 21% and of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and autism spectrum disorder of 2.5% were found.ConclusionsBecause fetal alcohol spectrum disorder is one of the most common causes of neurodevelopmental disorders, the limited attention to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in pediatric neurology journals is concerning. This study suggests that in addition to ADHD and autism spectrum disorder, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder may also be a common diagnosis in pediatric neurology practice. Pediatric neurology journals may need to take active steps to increase content on fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. This could include editorials, invited commentaries, or topical reviews. Early recognition and diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder allows for the implementation of specific interventions, which can improve the quality of life for patients and families.",Journal of child neurology,2025-Apr,"Burd M, Miles J, Myers G, Engesether B, Johnson E",5,2604,neurology,2025-11-22
39374350,Telehealth Use and Access to Neurology Outpatient Clinical Services for Children: An Observational Cohort Study.,"Access to neurology services is important for children's well-being. We sought to evaluate the effects of telehealth on pedi-atric neurology appointment outcomes for children. Using electronic health record (EHR) data, information about children with pediatric neurology appointments in a tertiary care children's hospital in North Carolina was collected. Appointment outcomes (completion, cancellation, and no-show rates) were calculated for children who had a neurology appointment scheduled both in the pre-pandemic (March 10, 2019, to March 9, 2020) and pandemic (March 10, 2020, to March 9, 2021) periods. ""Telehealth user"" was a child who had at least one telehealth appointment scheduled between March 10, 2020, and March 9, 2021. In bivariate and multivariate analyses, we compared appointment outcomes for telehealth users and non-users. EHR data were limited to a single institution and could have missed children's clinical encounters elsewhere. Since this study used secondary data that were not collected for research purposes, it is possible that there were unmeasured confounders. Because of the observational nature of the study, the association between telehealth use and appointment outcomes does not indicate causation. A total of 2110 children had 11,194 pediatric neurology appointments scheduled. Telehealth users compared with non-users were more likely to be White, non-Hispanic, have private insurance, and live farther from the children's hospital. There was a statistically sig-nificant decrease in completion (66% versus 57%) and increase in cancellation (27% versus 33%) and no-show (7% versus 10%) rates in the pandemic when compared to the pre-pandemic period. In the pre-pandemic period, telehealth user and non-user groups had similar cancellation and no-show rates. In the pandemic period, there was a statistically significant decrease in cancellation and no-show rates in the telehealth user group when compared to the non-user group. Pediatric neurology outpatient clinic visits decreased substantially during the pandemic. Telehealth mitigated these problems. Children belonging to a minority race/ethnicity are less likely to use telehealth, increasing their risk of poor access to neurology services.",North Carolina medical journal,2023-Sep,"Nageswaran S, Grefe A, Chen SH, Kirkendall E, Ip EH",5,2240,neurology,2025-11-22

31959682,Education Research: A novel resident-driven neurology quality improvement curriculum.,"To describe and assess the effectiveness of a neurology resident quality improvement curriculum focused on development of practical skills and project experience. We designed and implemented a quality improvement curriculum composed of (1) a workshop series and (2) monthly resident-led Morbidity, Mortality, & Improvement conferences focused on case analysis and project development. Surveys were administered precurriculum and 18 months postcurriculum to assess the effect on self-assessed confidence with quality improvement skills, attitudes, and project participation. Scholarship in the form of posters, presentations, and manuscripts was tracked during the course of the study. Precurriculum, 83% of neurology residents felt that instruction in quality improvement was important, but most rated their confidence level with various skills as low. Following implementation of the curriculum, residents were significantly more confident in analyzing a patient case (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval) (2.4, 1.9-3.1), proposing system changes (3.1, 2.3-3.9), writing a problem statement (9.9, 6.2-13.5), studying a process (3.1, 2.3-3.8), identifying resources (3.1, 2.3-3.8), identifying appropriate measures (2.5, 1.9-3.0), collaborating with other providers to make improvements (4.9, 3.5-6.4), and making changes in a system (3.1, 2.3-3.8).

By virtue of the privileged relationship between personhood and the brain, and the importance of properties of the nervous system to what for most makes life worth living, conditions that affect neurologic function introduce a growing host of novel ethical and philosophical issues. Rather than serving a reactionary role, it is important for neurologists to anticipate such issues and develop familiarity with ethical analysis to inform quality medical practice and to safeguard neuroscience research. The field of neuroethics is an emerging career path devoted to identifying and evaluating such issues with the aim of informing optimal clinical practice and responsible neuroscience research.

To define Brazilian EEG practices including in-residency requirements for EEG training and competency. We assessed the perspectives of adult residents (PGY1-3) on EEG education and their level of confidence interpreting EEG with a 24-question online survey. We analyzed 102 responses from 52 Brazilian neurology residency programs distributed in 14 states. There were 18 PGY1s, 45 PGY2s, and 39 PGY3s. Ninety-six percent of participants reported that learning how to read EEG during residency was very or extremely important. The most commonly reported barriers to EEG education were insufficient EEG exposure (70%) and ineffective didactics (46%). Residents believed that standard EEG lectures were the most efficient EEG teaching method followed by interpreting EEG with attendings' supervision. Roughly half of residents (45%) reported not being able to read EEG even with supervision, and approximately 70% of all participants did not feel confident writing an EEG report independently. Despite the well-established residency EEG education requirements recommended by the Brazilian Academy of Neurology (ABN), there seems to be a significant lack of comfort interpreting EEG among Brazilian adult neurology residents. We encourage Brazilian neurology residency leadership to re-evaluate the current EEG education system in order to ensure that residency programs are following EEG education requirements and to assess whether EEG benchmarks require modifications.",Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria,2022-Jan,"Lourenço ES, Kowacs DP, Gavvala JR, Kowacs PA, Nascimento FA",5,1639,neurology,2025-11-22

35074798,Delivering an advice and guidance service in neurology.,"It is increasingly common for secondary care to provide advice to primary care without an outpatient appointment. Even before the increased telemedicine during COVID-19, many hospital services gave advice alone for some referrals, yet there are few published data about patient outcomes. Does advice and guidance alter outpatient numbers or simply mean that patients are seen later? Which neurological conditions can we manage at a distance?

39447101,Global and Community Health: Neurologic Care and a Case Study for Immigrants and Refugees in West Philadelphia.,"Philadelphia is a diverse city that has experienced an increasing immigrant and refugee population in recent decades. Although many academic medical centers also call Philadelphia their home, lack of accessibility and difficulty with insurance limit access to health care for many of its newest residents. The Social Health and Medical Services (SHAMS) Free Health Clinic was started to help address some of these disparities, especially for immigrant and refugee populations. Despite initial setbacks, the clinic has thrived and even moved locations to accommodate increasing patient demand. While many patients initially presented for primary care, there was a growing need for specialist care and coordinated multidisciplinary management. We present an example of a partnership between an academic center (Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania) and a community health center (SHAMS clinic), whereby patients have access to a dedicated neurology clinic that is run by residents and staffed by neurology attendings. This has allowed patients to have access to outpatient neurologic care, has facilitated referral to inpatient care when needed for serious conditions such as status epilepticus (as in the case study discussed), and has allowed for continuity of care between the hospital and the outpatient setting. Although this clinic is an endeavor to create an academic-community partnership, there is still much work to do to improve medical access in the immigrant and refugee communities.",Neurology,2024-Nov,"Shaik NF, Fonkeu Y, Perkins J, Rubenstein M",4,1500,neurology,2025-11-22

In 2019, two online surveys were undertaken of palliative care specialists, using specialist groups of the European Academy of Neurology, European Association of Palliative Care and the Association of Palliative Medicine for Great Britain and Ireland. The respondents were specialist palliative care professionals, predominantly senior doctors, involved in the care of people with ALS. As the numbers of respondents from many countries were in single figures the analysis was restricted to the United Kingdom, Italy and Switzerland. The time of involvement varied, with early involvement commonest in the UK. Barriers to referral included neurologists not referring and financial issues, particularly in Switzerland. The reluctance of patients and families to see palliative care services was reported as less than 20% in all countries. Respondents were often involved in the care of people receiving noninvasive ventilation (NIV), in all countries. and with tracheostomy ventilation (TV), particularly in Italy. Palliative care services are often involved in the care of people with ALS, but the extent and timing of involvement varies.

38594709,Barriers to increasing paid parental leave in U.S. neurology residencies: a survey of program directors.,"The American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) require that residency programs allow at least 6 weeks of parental leave. The American Medical Association (AMA) recommends 12 weeks of paid parental leave. Despite these recommendations, there is little information about parental leave policies across U.S. neurology residencies. The objective of our study was to assess parental leave policies in U.S. adult neurology residencies and barriers to increasing the duration of leave. We distributed an anonymous online survey to U.S. adult neurology program directors (PDs) to assess demographics, components and length of parental leave, perceived impact on residents' clinical training and academic development, and barriers to increasing the length of leave. We contacted 163 PDs and received 54 responses (response rate of 33%). 87% reported policies for both childbearing and non-childbearing residents. The average maximal length of leave allowed without extension of training was 8.5 weeks (range 0-13) for childbearing and 6.2 weeks (range 0-13) for non-childbearing residents. Most PDs felt that parental leave had a positive impact on resident wellness and neutral impact on clinical competency, academic opportunities, and career development. The most common barriers to providing a 12-week paid policy were concerns about equity in the program (82%), staffing of clinical services (80%), and impact on clinical training (78%). Although most programs in our study have parental leave policies, there is significant variability. Policies to improve parental leave should focus on addressing common barriers, such as additional solutions to staffing clinical services.",BMC medical education,2024-Apr,"Conway SE, Wang W, Prasad S",3,1748,neurology,2025-11-22

33109622,Representation of women plenary speakers at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting.,"To determine whether women have been equitably represented among plenary speakers at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting by counting and categorizing speakers and comparing outcomes to AAN membership and US neurology workforce data. Lists of plenary speakers between 1958 and 2019 (62 years) were obtained from the AAN. The primary outcome measures were numbers and proportions of men and women in aggregate and among physicians. We identified 635 plenary speakers, including 148 (23.3%) women. Specifically, women made up 14.6% (19 of 130) of presidential and 25.5% (129 of 505) of nonpresidential plenary session speakers. The inclusion of women plenary speakers was meaningfully higher (<i>h</i> = 0.33; difference 14.9%; 95% confidence interval 4.2%-26.7%) for nonphysicians (27 of 74 [36.5%]) than physicians (121 of 561 [21.6%]). Although at zero levels for Annual Meetings held between 1958 and 1990 and at mostly low but varying levels thereafter, the representation of women and women physicians has been at or above their proportions in the AAN membership and US neurology workforce since 2017. Comparison of representation by plenary session name revealed an unequal distribution of women, with women physicians concentrated in the Sidney Carter Award in Child Neurology presidential session. Historically and recently, women and women physicians were underrepresented among AAN plenary speakers. As the AAN has taken active steps to address equity, women have been included in more representative proportions overall.

36762140,A Neurology Advanced Referral Management System (NARMS) Reduces Face-to-Face Consultations By Over Sixty Percent.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has made neurology clinic waiting times longer. To prevent a build-up of patients waiting, we introduced a neurology advanced referral management system (NARMS) to deal with new referrals from GPs, using advice, investigations, or the telephone, as alternatives to face-to-face (FF) assessment. For six months, electronic referrals from GPs were triaged to the above categories. We recorded the numbers in each category, patient satisfaction, inter-consultant triage variation, re-referrals, and calculated CO2 emissions. There were 573 referrals. Triage destinations were advice 33%, investigations 27%, telephone 17%, and FF 33%. Of patients referred for MRI, 95% were happy not to be seen if their investigation was normal. Less-experienced consultants triaged 20% and 30% respectively, to advice or investigations, compared with 40% by a triage-experienced neurologist. Four percent were re-referred. Numbers on the waiting list did not increase. CO2 emissions were reduced by 50%. Two thirds of neurological referrals from GPs did not need to be seen FF and 50% were dealt with without the neurologist meeting the patient. Carbon emission was halved. This system should be employed more, with FF examination reserved for those patients who need a neurological examination for diagnosis and management.",The Ulster medical journal,2023-Jan,"McConville J, Hunter A, Fulton A, Gray O, Kerr A, Patterson V",6,1328,neurology,2025-11-22

The aim was to determine the prevalence of fundus pathology amongst neurology inpatients and the diagnostic accuracy of current fundoscopy practice compared with systematic screening with smartphone fundoscopy (SF) and portable non-mydriatic fundus photography (NMFP). This was a prospective cross-sectional surveillance and diagnostic accuracy study on adult patients admitted under neurology in an Australian hospital. Inpatients were randomized to initial NMFP (RetinaVue 100, Welch Allyn) or SF (D-EYE) followed by a crossover to the alternative modality. Images were graded by neurology doctors, using telemedicine consensus neuro-ophthalmology NMFP grading as the reference standard. Feasibility parameters included ease, comfort and speed. Of 79 enrolled patients, 14.1% had neurologically relevant pathology (seven, disc pallor; one, hypertensive retinopathy; three, disc swelling). The neurology team performed direct ophthalmoscopy in 6.6% of cases and missed all abnormalities. SF had a sensitivity of 30%-40% compared with NMFP (45.5%); however, it had a lower rate of screening failure (1% vs. 13%, p &lt; 0.001), a shorter examination time (1.10 vs. 2.25 min, p &lt; 0.001) and a slightly higher patient comfort rating (9.2 vs. 8/10, p &lt; 0.001). Our study demonstrates a clinically significant prevalence of fundus pathology amongst neurology inpatients which was missed by current fundoscopy practices. Portable NMFP screening appears more accurate than SF, whilst both are diagnostically superior to routine fundoscopic practice, feasible and well tolerated by patients.",European journal of neurology,2022-Aug,"He G, Dunn HP, Ahmad KE, Watson E, Henderson A, Tynan D, Leaney J, White AJ, Hewitt AW, Fraser CL",10,1720,neurology,2025-11-22

37041049,Sex differences in neurology: a scoping review.,"Historically, neurology research has demonstrated a sex bias with mainly male subjects included in clinical trials as well as lack of reporting of data by sex. In recent years, emphasis has been placed on increased participation of female participants and explicit declaration/evaluation of sex differences in clinical research.We aimed to review the available literature examining sex differences across four subspecialty areas in neurology (demyelination, headache, stroke, epilepsy) and whether sex and gender terms have been used appropriately. This scoping review was performed by searching Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Ovid Emcare and APA PsycINFO databases from 2014 to 2020. Four independent pairs of reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full texts. Studies whose primary objective was to assess sex or gender differences among adults with one of four neurological conditions were included. We report the scope, content and trends of previous studies that have evaluated sex differences in neurology. The search retrieved 22 745 articles. Five hundred and eighty-five studies met the inclusion criteria in the review. The majority of studies were observational, often examining similar concepts designed for a different country or regional population, with rare randomised controlled trials designed specifically to assess sex differences in neurology. There was heterogeneity observed in areas of sex-specific focus between the four subspecialty areas. Thirty-six per cent (n=212) of articles used the terms sex and gender interchangeably or incorrectly. Sex and gender are important biological and social determinants of health. However, the more explicit recognition of these factors in clinical literature has not been adequately translated to significant change in neuroscience research regarding sex differences. This study illustrates the ongoing need for more urgent informed action to recognise and act on sex differences in scientific discovery and correct the use of sex and gender terminology.

37592282,Current state of headache training within Canadian Neurology Residency program: a national survey.,"Headache disorders are the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Despite their widespread prevalence and importance, the topic of headache is inconsistently taught at both the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The goal of this study is to establish a better picture of the current state of Headache Medicine (HM) training in Neurology postgraduate programs in Canada and describe the impact of the current pandemic on training in this domain. Online surveys were sent to senior residents of adult Neurology programs in Canada. We also conducted telephone interviews with Neurology Program Directors. Descriptive statistics were analyzed, and thematic analysis was used to review free text. A total of 36 residents, and 3 Program Directors participated in the study. Most of the teaching in HM is done by headache specialists and general neurology faculty. Formal teaching is mainly given during academic half day. Most of the programs expose their residents to Onabotulinum toxin A injections and peripheral nerve blocks, but they don't offer much formal teaching regarding these procedures. Residents consider HM teaching important and they would like to have more. They don't feel comfortable performing interventional headache treatments, despite feeling this should be part of the skillset of a general neurologist. Our study is the first to establish the current state of headache teaching in post-graduate neurology programs as perceived by trainees and program directors in Canada. The current educational offerings leave residents feeling poorly prepared to manage headaches, including procedural interventions. There is a need to diversify the source of teaching, so the educational burden doesn't lie mostly upon Headache specialists who are already in short supply.

34229869,Simulation for Neurology training: Acute setting and beyond.,"Simulation-based training is adapted for teaching neurology, and it can offer multiple programs for general and specialized neurologists. Indeed, simulation training is ""learner-centered"", assuring sessions tailored to each learner level, and provides a realistic, safe, controlled and reproducible environment to improve knowledge, technical and non-technical skills, including situational awareness, communication, teamwork and leadership. Indeed, simulation tools allow multidisciplinary sessions with different team members (nurses, physician associates, specialist trainees, technicians) participating with their experiences. Multidisciplinary scenarios maximize awareness on the ""human factors"" and contribute to the safety of future patients. Simulation sessions require clear learning objectives and debriefing points tailored to the learning groups, but instructors may vary the scenarios in real time according to learners' actions. Different simulation techniques are applied according to learning objectives. The simulation session always includes a briefing, a simulation scenario and a structured debriefing, driven by the instructor, which is crucial for learning consolidation. In neurology training, simulation methods are applicable for: i) training on emergency situations, where the neurologist team has to manage in frontline a specific medical emergency (stroke, status epilepticus, coma, neuromuscular respiratory failure); ii) improving technical skills (lumbar puncture, electroencephalography (EEG), cervical ultrasound and transcranial Doppler, endovascular thrombectomy procedures, neuroradiological investigations); iii) improving procedures and patient pathways (stroke pathway, telemedicine); and iv) training non-technical skills (communication, teamwork, leadership).

33271406,Declining use of neurological eponyms in cases where a non-eponymous alternative exists.,"Eponyms are common in neurology, but their use is controversial. Recent studies have demonstrated increasing eponym use over time in the scientific literature, but it is unclear whether this is a result of authors choosing to use eponyms more frequently, or is merely a product of increasing rates of scientific publication. Our goal was to explore trends in decision-making pertaining to eponym usage. We identified cases where an eponym and a corresponding non-eponymous term existed, and assessed temporal trends in the relative usage of these terms using Google's n-gram viewer for each decade from 1900-2019. Relative to corresponding non-eponymous terms, the use of eponyms increased across the 20th century, peaking in the decade from 1980 to 1989, before sharply declining after the turn of the 21st century. This indicates that when faced with a choice between using an eponym and non-eponymous term, contemporary authors increasingly chose the non-eponymous term. This recent trend may reflect increased awareness of the limitations of eponyms, greater attention to the personal and political lives of namesakes, and a cultural shift toward viewing scientific advances as the result of collective and collaborative efforts rather than the solitary achievements of eminent individuals.",Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,2021-Jan,"Becker CJ, McDermott M, London ZN",3,1294,neurology,2025-11-22
38470305,The Daily Fact Pile: Exploring Mutual Microlearning in Neurology Resident Education.,"<b><i>Problem</i></b>: A significant proportion of learning during residency takes place through informal channels. Spontaneous collaboration among medical learners significantly contributes to this informal learning and is increasingly recognized as a component of the hidden curriculum in medical education. Yet historically, a disproportionate emphasis in medical education has been placed on didactic, structured, and faculty-initiated methods, leaving an important force in medical education understudied and underutilized. We hypothesize that there is significant educational potential in studying and deploying targeted tools to facilitate collaboration among medical learners. <b><i>Intervention</i></b>: At our institution, neurology residents implemented the ""Daily Fact Pile"" (DFP), a resident-led, email-based collaboration that served as a platform to share clinical pearls in an informal, digital way. Participation was voluntary and participants were encouraged to share facts that were new to them and thought to be clinically relevant. Motivated by the positive collective experience, we conducted a retrospective examination of this phenomenon. In this context, we developed the concept of ""mutual microlearning"" to characterize this efficient, multidirectional exchange of information. <b><i>Context</i></b>: Thirty-six residents in a single neurology residency program utilized the DFP at a large university hospital in the USA between 2018 and 2019. After 21 months of spontaneous and voluntary participation, we assessed the feasibility of the DFP, its impact on the education and morale of neurology residents, and compared its mutual microlearning approach to traditional lectures. This was done through a survey of the DFP participants with a response rate of 80.7%, and analysis of the statistics of participation and interaction with the DFP. <b><i>Impact</i></b>: Most participants felt that the DFP was beneficial to their education and thought they often or always learned something new from reading the DFP. The impact of the DFP extended beyond education by improving interest in neurology, morale, and sense of teamwork. The DFP was feasible during neurology residency and participation was high, though participants were more likely to read facts than share them. <b><i>Lessons learned</i></b>: Mutual microlearning represents an opportunity to augment residents' education, and well-designed mutual microlearning tools hold promise for complementing traditional teaching methods. We learned that efficiency, ease of use, and a supportive, non-judgmental environment are all essential to the success of such tools. Future research should delve deeper into the underlying mechanisms of mutual microlearning to establish its position within the theoretical frameworks of medical education.",Teaching and learning in medicine,2025-,"Saba K, Jiang B, Yasin R, Hoyle JC",4,2821,neurology,2025-11-22
36450111,Telemedicine Services for the Delivery of Specialty Home-Based Neurological Care.,"<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> <i>The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of telemedicine services for the delivery of outpatient neurological care. We sought to understand perceptions and the acceptance of this technology by neurology specialists during the proliferation of telemedicine services into their outpatient practices.</i> <b><i>Methods:</i></b> <i>We adapted the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire for neurological care via telemedicine. Our 29-item questionnaire evaluated the telemedicine system in three domains: quality of the telemedicine platform, ability to conduct a sufficient neurological examination, and overall system confidence. The survey was distributed to 88 clinical neurology faculty in the Johns Hopkins Health System. Responses were collapsed into</i> ""<i>Favorable</i>,"" ""<i>Neutral</i>,"" <i>and</i> ""<i>Unfavorable.</i>"" <i>Within each domain, responses to individual questions were analyzed by neurology subspecialty using descriptive statistics.</i> <b><i>Results:</i></b> <i>We received completed surveys from 46 of the 88 (52%) neurology faculty. Of those, most reported favorable comfort with the current platform (98%), ease of use (73%), and quality (80%). However, responses indicated only average ability to troubleshoot telemedicine platform issues when they occurred (55%) and to complete an entire neurological examination (52%). Subspecialty comparisons revealed differences in diagnostic confidence; 30% of neuromuscular faculty indicated that they could make accurate neurological diagnoses through a tele-examination as opposed to ≥84% for other specialties.</i> <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> <i>The use of telemedicine services for the delivery of outpatient neurological care is feasible and acceptable to most neurologists, although diagnostic confidence compared with in-person visits may be reduced and differs by subspecialty. Improvements in technological infrastructure and care models are needed to advance telemedicine neurological care delivery. Our data also suggest that a larger multicenter investigation of telemedicine use post-pandemic would be useful.</i>",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,2023-Jul,"Zeiler SR, Saylor MA, Chao A, Bahouth M",4,2126,neurology,2025-11-22

Among these gaps, improving education of the multidisciplinary NCC team, targeting individualized treatments for neurologically critically ill patients, and reducing disparities for undeserved patients as well as disadvantaged areas are priorities to advance the field. This review focuses on the current challenges neurointensivists face, including difficulties in neuroprognostication, ethical challenges in end-of-life care, and neuropalliative care. Challenges also involve providing specific NCC education for the multidisciplinary NCC team, as well as advancing research to provide treatments for critically ill neurological patients.

Both centers were strongly influenced by Leading Western European schools and specialists, through the clinical and research training regimes of both Russian universities, strongly influenced these centers of learning. In this study, we elaborate the Western European training of the first Russian specialists in the fields of neurology and neuropsychiatry from IMU and IMSA during the period from the late 1850s to 1900. Although prior studies emphasized the influence of French mentors and institutions, the Western European tours of early Russian specialists often included multiple destinations in Germany, France, and Austria. The most commonly visited cities (in descending order) were Paris, Berlin, Leipsig, and Vienna. The most commonly visited training centers (in descending order) were Hoôpital Salpêtriêre (Paris), Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität (Berlin), Charité (Berlin), Universität Leipzig, First Psychiatric Clinic (Vienna), and Hôpital Sainte-Anne (Paris). The most commonly visited mentors, in descending order, were Charcot (Paris), Flechsig (Leipzig), Westphal (Berlin), Meynert (Vienna), and Magnan (Paris).

32089798,Why Not a Podcast? Assessing Narrative Audio and Written Curricula in Obstetrical Neurology.,"Medical podcasts have the potential to educate residents and fellows in specialized or uncommon disciplines, but the acceptability and benefits of educational podcasts are unclear. We compared knowledge acquisition and engagement of audio-only (podcast) versus written curricular formats and assessed podcast feasibility and uptake for teaching obstetrical neurology to residents and fellows. Key concepts in obstetrical neurology were developed into parallel case-based modules: written reviews and podcasts interwove patient and expert voices with narration. In 2017, we tested this curriculum among 60 volunteer residents and fellows in obstetrics and gynecology, neurology, emergency medicine, internal medicine, and family medicine training programs at a single institution. Participants took content-based pretests, were randomized, and then completed written (n = 32) or podcast (n = 28) modules, and finally, completed posttests and feedback questionnaires. Among all participants, there was an increase in immediate posttest scores compared with pretest scores (46 of 60, 77% ± 17% pretest versus 56 of 60, 93% ± 10% posttest, <i>P</i> < .05), with participants in the podcast and written groups performing equally well. However, listeners rated the podcasts somewhat higher than written materials in the areas of maintaining interest, enjoyability, entertaining, and desire for wider use. Written and podcast curricula improved immediate knowledge similarly, but the narrative-style podcasts were perceived as more enjoyable by residents and fellows from several specialties, suggesting narrative podcasting can be an engaging and feasible educational alternative for trainees to acquire information.",Journal of graduate medical education,2020-Feb,"Roth J, Chang A, Ricci B, Hall M, Mehta N",5,1710,neurology,2025-11-22

We compare the characteristics of COVID-19 positive vs negative patients who received consultation by neurology and palliative care services during the 2020 COVID-19 surge in New York City to see how the groups differ in their consultation needs and to identify opportunities to improve care. This retrospective analysis was performed within a multi-center hospital system in New York City, USA over a 2-month period (15 March to 15 May, 2020) which represented the peak of the first COVID-19 wave. Hospitalized patients who received a consultation from neurology and palliative care services were included. The patients were classified according to COVID-19 status (positive or negative based on PCR testing). Data abstracted from chart review included demographic data, details of neurology and palliative care consultations, duration of admission, ICU admission, intubation, code status, and death. The study included 70 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and 39 patients who tested negative for a total of 109 patients. Compared to the patients who tested negative for COVID-19, the patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to have palliative care consultation for management of goals of care (70 [100%] vs 33 [84.6%], P = .003) and less likely for management of symptoms (2 [2.9%] vs 7 [17.9%], P = .02).

39344287,We Don't Talk About X(Twitter): A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Social Media Utilization Among Neurologists.,"Medical professionals use social media for career development, education, clinical outreach, or advocacy. Prior studies estimate that 25% to 65% of health care providers use social media professionally; however, the number of users and platforms are rapidly changing. Therefore, as part of a broader study, we set out to assess platform preferences and social media usage among neurologists. This was a multisite cross-sectional analysis consisting of a REDCap survey of clinicians, residents, and medical students. Faculty, trainees, or clinical year medical students interested in child neurology or adult neurology residency or fellowship programs within the United States were eligible to participate. Recruitment methods were broad to encompass as diverse and extensive participation as possible. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Data are presented according to the STROBE guidelines. Of the 226 neurology respondents, 55% (n = 124) were child neurology and 45% (n = 102) were adult neurology across all career stages, including students. Of the 70% who reported using social media in a professional capacity, the most commonly reported reasons were for networking and collaboration (n = 95, 60%), self-directed medical learning (n = 90, 57%), and brand building and reputation (n = 62, 39%). Twitter and Facebook were the most common and versatile platforms used by neurologists. Medical students had the highest documentation of social media scholarships on their curriculum vitae (37%, <i>P</i> = .016) and the most interest (33%, <i>P</i> = .016) in learning how to document social media scholarships if they were not already. Early faculty shared this interest more than residents, fellows, or mid-late career faculty. In all groups except for mid-late career faculty, a majority of respondents (>75%) showed interest in learning how to leverage social media for career development. Social media is used professionally by a majority of neurologists, most commonly for networking, self-directed learning, and building individual brands. Opportunities exist to better understand platform preferences and ways to optimize their use for various professional activities as well as to provide education on effective professional use of social media including documentation for promotion.",Journal of child neurology,2024-Oct,"Rosati J, Martindale JM, Xixis K, Gottlieb-Smith R, Russell G, Bass N, Goldstein J",7,2310,neurology,2025-11-22
39467945,Exploring the Impact of Mentoring on Faculty Engagement and Retention Among Behavioral Health Faculty in Departments of Psychiatry and Neurology.,"Mentoring plays an integral role in the success of faculty. This study explores faculty access to formal and informal mentorship and how mentorship impacts faculty engagement. Data are from 2020 to 2023 administrations of the StandPoint Faculty Engagement Survey. We compare clinically active faculty with a PhD or other health doctorate (OHD) in departments of psychiatry and neurology (Doctoral-PN) with both faculty with an MD or equivalent degree in those departments (Physician-PN), and with faculty with a PhD or OHD in other clinical departments (Doctoral-Other). Psychologists who are active in clinical care are represented in these departments although their representation likely varies by institution. Forty-four percent of Doctoral-PN faculty received formal mentoring and 65% received informal mentoring. Those receiving formal mentoring were more satisfied with professional development opportunities and reported increased understanding of promotion than those who were not. They were also more satisfied with their department and would recommend their medical school to others. The literature to date acknowledges the challenges to professional growth and advancement faced by Doctoral-PN faculty, including psychologists, practicing in academic health centers.

In 2019 the society defined four strategic priorities: education, science, membership, and advocacy. This paper reviews the EAN development in the last 3 years. The outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 had a profound impact on the entire world and triggered profound changes in the EAN including the implementation of new digital technologies. Education The virtual congress in 2020 was the best attended in history (43,844 registrations). The European Training Requirements for Neurology was revised. A mentorship program and a student section were created. A state-of-the-art eLearning platform will be launched in 2022. Research To assess neurological manifestations of COVID-19 an international registry (ENERGY) was created. Studies on the burden of neurological disorders and sleep disorders, respectively, were started. The first EAN science school took place in 2022. Membership The EAN includes 45,000 members and 47 national societies. New task forces were created on gender and diversity, tele- and general neurology. Advocacy In 2022 the EAN supported the adoption of the Global Action Plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders by the WHO and the neurological community in the Ukraine. The same year the EAN launched a Brain Health Strategy promoting a non-disease and -age centred, lifelong holistic approach ('one brain, one life, one approach').

The TF first identified four relevant current and future challenges related to GN: (i) definition, (ii) practice, (iii) education, and (iv) research. The TF then identified seven initiatives to further develop GN at both the academic and community level. Finally, the TF formulated 16 recommendations to promote GN in the future. GN will remain essential in the coming decades to provide rapid, accessible, and comprehensive management of patients with ND that is affordable and cost-effective.

38539205,Needs assessment for direct ophthalmoscopy training in neurology residency.,"Assessment of the ocular fundus, traditionally by direct ophthalmoscopy (DO), is essential to evaluate many neurologic diseases. However, the status of DO training in neurology residencies is unknown. We conducted a needs assessment to determine current attitudes, curricula, and gaps in DO training. A survey was developed and administered to residents and program directors (PDs) at ACGME accredited neurology residencies in the United States. The survey assessed factors such as current DO curricula, perceived importance of DO, confidence of skills, and need for improvement. Data analysis was performed using the Mann Whitney U test and Fisher Exact Test. Nineteen PDs (11.6%) and 74 (41.1%) residents responded to the survey. 97.1% of residents and 100.0% of PDs believe DO is an important skill to learn. 29.4% of PDs expected graduating residents to have completed > 10 supervised DO exams, while 0.0% of graduating fourth year residents reported doing so (p = 0.03). 35.7% of graduating residents had never correctly identified an abnormal finding on DO. The number of times residents practiced DO unsupervised correlated with increasing confidence in all components of the DO exam (p < 0.05). Residents who felt their program emphasized DO were more likely to perform DO at least once a week compared to residents who did not perceive program emphasis (61.9% vs. 35.0%, p = 0.02) and were more confident in DO (p < 0.05). 66.7% of residents and 42.1% of PDs were not satisfied with current levels of DO training. 96.7% of residents and 78.9% of PDs felt it was important to improve curriculum for DO training. Supervised practice and practice skills sessions were identified as the most helpful interventions to improve DO training. The vast majority of neurology PDs and residents believe DO is an important skill to learn, are unsatisfied with the current level of DO training, and advocate for improvement in DO curricula. Current DO curricula have limited formal didactic training and supervised practice.

36200808,The teaching of headache medicine in France: A questionnaire-based study.,"The treatment of patients with headache represents an important part of a neurologist's activity. It requires sufficient training for neurology residents. In France, residents in neurology can complete this training by attending specialized consultations or by participating in a postgraduate training program called ""Diplôme Inter-Universitaire Migraine et Céphalées"" (DIUMC). The objective of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the French residents' knowledge in headache medicine and the impact of different types of training in headache medicine that are available in France. An anonymous survey was carried out among 548 French residents in neurology. The questionnaires of 121 residents (22.1%) were analyzed. Among them, 54.5% (66/121) had no complementary training apart from the internship (Group 1), 21.5% (26/121) had attended only specialized consultations (Group 2), and 24% (29/121) had participated in the DIUMC (Group 3). There was no difference between all groups regarding the knowledge of the prevalence of primary or chronic headaches. There was almost no difference between the groups in the management of episodic migraine. In contrast, the management of tension-type headache and chronic headache was better known by residents of Group 3 than residents of Group 1. In these two diseases, residents of Group 3 offered prophylactic treatment more often. Almost 29% of the residents (35/121) had read the French guidelines for the diagnosis and management of migraine. In Group 3, residents had read them significantly more often (1.6% in Group 1, 38.5% in Group 2 and 62.1% in Group 3, p < 0.001).

39716179,Effectiveness of the application of small private online course combined with PBL model based on massive open online course in the teaching of neurology.,"Due to the complex and abstract anatomy of the nervous system, neurology has become a difficult subject for students of clinical disciplines. It is imperative to develop new teaching methods to improve students' enthusiasm for learning this course. Small private online courses (SPOC) combined with problem based learning (PBL) blended teaching models based on massive open online course (MOOC) provides a new direction for future neurology teaching reform. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of applying SPOC combined with PBL in neurology teaching. This study was conducted during the 2020 intake of undergraduate students at the Second Hospital and Clinical Medical School, Lanzhou University. A total of 48 students were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to either a Lecture-Based Learning (LBL) group or a SPOC + PBL group, with 24 participants in each group. After the classes, comparisons were made between the two groups in terms of teaching methods, increases in learning interest, level of participation in learning, satisfaction, and closed-book unit test scores. The average unit test score of the SPOC + PBL group was 84.29 ± 1.65, the average score of LBL group was 77.0 ± 1.92. The difference in average scores between the two groups was statistically significant (P < 0.01). The proportion of students with 91-100 points in SPOC + PBL group was higher than that of LBL group, and the difference was statistically significant, P < 0.01. Student satisfaction survey in the SPOC + PBL group was significantly higher than that in the LBL group, P < 0.01. The application of SPOC combined with PBL teaching based on MOOC in neurology teaching may be more effective than traditional LBL model. It is expected to help medical students overcome the ""fear"" of learning neurological diseases, improve the teaching effect of neurology courses, and meet the needs of modern medical education by employing a hybrid course structure and adopting a problem-oriented approach.",BMC medical education,2024-Dec,"Li X, Li F, Liu W, Xie Q, Yuan B, Wang L, Wang M",7,2001,neurology,2025-11-22

39383119,ChatGPT M.D.: Is there any room for generative AI in neurology?,"ChatGPT, a general artificial intelligence, has been recognized as a powerful tool in scientific writing and programming but its use as a medical tool is largely overlooked. The general accessibility, rapid response time and comprehensive training database might enable ChatGPT to serve as a diagnostic augmentation tool in certain clinical settings. The diagnostic process in neurology is often challenging and complex. In certain time-sensitive scenarios, rapid evaluation and diagnostic decisions are needed, while in other cases clinicians are faced with rare disorders and atypical disease manifestations. Due to these factors, the diagnostic accuracy in neurology is often suboptimal. Here we evaluated whether ChatGPT can be utilized as a valuable and innovative diagnostic augmentation tool in various neurological settings. We used synthetic data generated by neurological experts to represent descriptive anamneses of patients with known neurology-related diseases, then the probability for an appropriate diagnosis made by ChatGPT was measured. To give clarity to the accuracy of the AI-determined diagnosis, all cases have been cross-validated by other experts and general medical doctors as well. We found that ChatGPT-determined diagnostic accuracy (ranging from 68.5% ± 3.28% to 83.83% ± 2.73%) can reach the accuracy of other experts (81.66% ± 2.02%), furthermore, it surpasses the probability of an appropriate diagnosis if the examiner is a general medical doctor (57.15% ± 2.64%). Our results showcase the efficacy of general artificial intelligence like ChatGPT as a diagnostic augmentation tool in medicine.

35459134,Service process factors affecting patients' and clinicians' experiences on rapid teleconsultation implementation in out-patient neurology services during COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review.,"The adoption of teleconsultation for outpatient neurology services was limited until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic which forced many outpatient neurology services to rapidly switch to virtual models. However, it remains unclear how this change has impacted patients' and clinicians' perceptions of service quality. The purpose of this scoping review is to identify process factors that influence patients' and clinicians' experiences of outpatient teleconsultation services during COVID-19. Arksey and O'Malley scoping review framework was used to search PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycInfo for original peer-reviewed research studies that examined the experiences of synchronous teleconsultation between a clinician and patient in a home-setting since the World Health Organization announced the COVID-19 global pandemic. The service quality model SERVQUAL was used to conduct a deductive thematic analysis to identify the key factors that impacted the patients' and clinicians' perception of teleconsultation services. A total of nineteen studies published between January 1, 2020, and April 17, 2021, were identified. The most common service process factors affecting the patients' and clinicians' experiences of teleconsultation were technical issues, addressing logistical needs, communication, ability to perform clinical activities, appropriate triage, and administrative support. Our findings identified six key service process factors affecting the patients' and clinicians' teleconsultation experiences in outpatient neurology services. The need for improvement of triage process and standardizing administrative virtual care pathway are identified as important steps to improve patients and clinicians' teleconsultation experiences compared to pre-COVID era. More research is needed to assess outpatient neurology teleconsultation service quality from patients' and clinicians' perspectives.",BMC health services research,2022-Apr,"Meng G, McAiney C, Perlman CM, McKillop I, Tisseverasinghe T, Chen HH",6,1908,neurology,2025-11-22
34088284,Clinical Ethics Consultation in Neurology - a case series.,"The concept of clinical ethics consultation (CECs) was implemented to provide support in ethical controversies in clinical settings and are offered in at least every second hospital in Germany. Neurological disorders often require complex decision-making. The aims of this study were to determine which situations lead to CEC in neurology and to investigate the influence of the individual patient's wishes on the recommendation. Standardised CEC protocols in the years 2011 to 2017 at the University Hospitals of Goettingen and Jena were retrospectively surveyed. The contents were categorised along existing protocol templates of CEC scenarios and subsequently paraphrased and reduced to significant meanings. 27 CEC scenarios which were facilitated by various professional disciplines were reviewed. Stroke was the most frequent underlying condition. Nearly all patients were not able to consent. Mostly, the relatives acted as representatives or health advocates. In 67 % of cases, a sense of conflict triggered a CEC; in 33 % a sense of uncertainty was the reason for the CEC request. In 21 CEC scenarios, a recommendation was reached in consensus with all parties involved. In 59 % of cases, a decision was made to continue medical therapy. In seven cases, the patient's wishes led to a limitation of therapy, while in just two cases this decision was made primarily relying on the patient's best interest. In only 13 % of cases, a valid advance directive led to respective therapeutic consequences. CEC is feasible for consensus-finding not only in conflicts, but also in situations of therapeutic uncertainty in neurology. There is a special importance of the patient's wishes in decision-making in neurology. However, only in a few cases were advance directives precise and specific enough to have sufficient and decisive weight in therapeutic decision-making.",BMC neurology,2021-Jun,"Ilse B, Alt-Epping B, Günther A, Liman J, Simon A",5,1869,neurology,2025-11-22
35707916,"prepOSCE: A Virtual, Scalable Solution to Prepare Residents for Their OSCE Examination.","The Royal College Comprehensive Objective Examination in Neurology provides certification for Canadian neurologists and consists of a written examination and the Observed Structured Clinical Encounter (OSCE). The OSCE portion of the certification involves residents visiting several patient stations where they address case scenarios with an examiner. Unfortunately, residents lack exam preparation time due to demanding work hours. In response to resident needs, we created a novel, virtual preparation OSCE program - ""prepOSCE"" - and evaluated its efficacy. The prepOSCE program employed a proprietary virtual solution from CTC Communications Corp. Ten virtual sessions accommodated 70 residents totally. Seven Canadian physicians and two co-chairs created case scenarios for the stations. On session day, seven residents arrived in a virtual plenary room for briefing followed by assignment to a station by CTC. Residents then moved virtually through prepOSCE stations a different examiner and case scenario in each. Following their session, residents and evaluators were surveyed to capture experiences. The average program rating was 4.22 out of 5 (<i>n</i> = 36 residents of 70 residents who participated in the program) and 4.35 (<i>n</i> = 17 evaluators). Ninety-two percent of residents agreed or strongly agreed that they would recommend this program to their peers; they would like prepOSCE to continue next year; and the program was relevant and added value to their studies. The positive feedback received from prepOSCE participants indicates there is a need for a program like prepOSCE.

35365525,Sex differences in neurology: a scoping review protocol.,"Sex and gender are independently important in health and disease but have been incompletely explored in neurology. This is in part contributed to by the pre-existing male bias in scientific literature that results in fewer females being included in clinical research and the often interchangeable use of sex and gender in the literature. This scoping review intends to identify the advances as well as under-explored aspects of this field to provide a road map for future research. This paper outlines the methods for a scoping review of published, peer-reviewed literature on sex and gender differences in four subspecialty areas of neurology: demyelination, stroke, epilepsy and headache. A detailed search strategy will be used to search five databases pertaining only to sex differences. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria will be applied to capture relevant literature published from 2014 to 2020. Data will be collected and synthesised to provide an overview of information retrieved, a narrative synthesis of each subspecialty area and map of results. Research ethics board approval was not required for this study. This study will aid in mapping recent trends in sex differences in four major neurological conditions and will help identify areas for further research.

33295422,Telemedicine in neurology: current evidence.,"Telemedicine was first introduced in Neurology as a tool to facilitate access to acute stroke treatment. More recently, evidence has emerged of the use of telemedicine in several other areas of Neurology. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for social isolation, Brazilian authorities have expanded the regulation of the use of telemedicine, thus allowing the treatment of many patients with neurological diseases to be conducted with less risk of SARS-CoV-2 contamination. This study aimed to critically review the current evidence of the use, efficacy, safety, and usefulness of telemedicine in Neurology. A review of PubMed indexed articles was carried out by searching for the terms ""telemedicine AND"": ""headache"", ""multiple sclerosis"", ""vestibular disorders"", ""cerebrovascular diseases"", ""epilepsy"", ""neuromuscular diseases"", ""dementia"", and ""movement disorders"". The more relevant studies in each of these areas were critically analyzed. Several articles were found and analyzed in each of these areas of Neurology. The main described contributions of telemedicine in the diagnosis and treatment of such neurological conditions were presented, indicating a great potential of use of this type of assistance in all these fields.

The secondary objectives of this study were to compare the completeness of intervention reporting before and after TIDieR publication and to evaluate factors associated with intervention reporting. We conducted a cross-sectional, pilot-tested, double-blind investigation of 141 neurology RCTs to determine the completeness of intervention reporting in neurology. Overall, the average number of TIDieR checklist items that reached completion per study was 7.4 out of 12 (61.7%). We found no increase in intervention reporting following the publication of TIDieR (P = 0.35). Our generalized estimating equation analysis found that poorer TIDieR adherence was associated with trials lacking a trial registration (P = 0.03). Our findings showed that on average, authors reported only 61.7% of items on the TIDieR checklist.

The authors conducted a study to determine if a mobile application specialized in suggesting differential diagnoses from clinical scenarios can complement clinical reasoning of a neurologist in training. A cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted to compare the accuracy of neurology residents versus a mobile medical app (Neurology Dx) in drawing a comprehensive list of differential diagnoses from Neuro-ophthalmology clinical vignettes. The differentials generated by residents and the App were compared with the Gold standard differential diagnoses adjudicated by experts. The prespecified primary outcome was the proportion of correctly identified high likely gold standard differential diagnosis by residents and App. Neurology residents (n = 100) attempted 1500 Neuro-ophthalmology clinical vignettes. Frequency of correctly identified high likely differential diagnosis by residents was 19.42% versus 53.71% by the App (P < 0.0001). The first listed differential diagnosis by the residents matched with that of the first differential diagnosis adjudicated by experts (gold standard differential diagnosis) with a frequency of 26.5% versus 28.3% by the App, whereas the combined output of residents and App scored a frequency of 41.2% in identifying the first gold standard differential correctly. The residents correctly identified the first three and first five gold standard differential diagnosis with a frequency of 17.83% and 19.2%, respectively, as against 22.26% and 30.39% (P < 0.0001) by the App. A ruled based app in Neuro-ophthalmology has the potential to complement a neurology resident in drawing a comprehensive list of differential diagnoses.",Indian journal of ophthalmology,2021-Jun,"Vinny PW, Takkar A, Lal V, Padma MV, Sylaja PN, Narasimhan L, Dwivedi SN, Nair PP, Iype T, Gupta A, Vishnu VY",11,1792,neurology,2025-11-22
33243075,Giacomo Balla: A Painter in the Context of Neuroscience.,"Giacomo Balla, a famous Italian Futurist painter, was a great observer of both human motion and emotion. He showed a profound interest toward neurophysiological and neurological sciences. During his search of his personal artistic style, he attended the lessons of Cesare Lombroso, a criminal anthropologist, who at the time was also professor of neurology at the University of Turin. Some years later, he became a close friend of Doctor Francesco Ghilarducci, who had spent a few years in Paris at Jean-Martin Charcot's ""School."" Balla spent most of his career studying the dynamics of movement and speed. Some of his most famous paintings were inspired by photographic studies on the locomotor system, such as those of the French physiologist Étienne-Jules Marey. His personal painting style reveals his deep interest in neurosciences.

It was slow to develop, however, and had a number of missing elements. While some of this may have been due to a lack of funds and the absence of a dedicated neurologist, it was also the result of a failure to conceptualize a neurological unit, the slow evolution-into-existence of a nascent and fledgling medical discipline, growing pains and frictions within the leadership, a university-based rather than a hospital-based model of operation, and turf wars between neurology and allied disciplines.",Canadian bulletin of medical history = Bulletin canadien d'histoire de la medecine,2021-,Louis ED,1,1071,neurology,2025-11-22
37966554,How neurologists are viewed by their colleagues: exploring stereotypes and social representations of neurologists.,"The choice of medical specialization is influenced by various factors, including personal, educational, and interpersonal aspects. However, stereotypes and social representations (SRs) can also play a significant role in biasing the choice of a particular medical specialty. The aim of this study is to describe and understand the social representation (SR) of French Neurologist among medical peers, and factors explaining stereotypes about neurology. A nationwide web-based survey was sent to the French medical community (students, residents, and graduated physicians) to collect sociodemographic and professional data, status, experience, and acquaintance in Neurology as well as qualitative hierarchical evocation question to assess the SR of French Neurologists. Overall, 367 people participated in the survey, including 112 medical students, 170 residents, and 85 graduated physicians. Only 14.3% of students listed neurology among their top 5 specialty choices, and 63.8% disagreed with the statement ""I could have chosen (or I will choose) neurology after the validation of my 6th year of medical studies."" Qualitative analysis revealed that the most frequently occurring words used to describe neurologists were ""stroke"", ""complicated"", ""no treatment,"" ""clinical"", and ""brain"" and five themes corresponded to SRs of neurologist: his/her personal and professional traits (36.4% of the corpus), his/her daily practice (18.1%), the negative aspects of the neurological practice (15.3%), and the neurological pathology and daily skills (30.2%). The perception of neurologists by other physicians is nuanced.

We used multivariable models to compare appointment outcomes (canceled vs completed, and missed vs completed) by visit type. We then conducted similar evaluation for the subgroup of Black children. A total of 1250 children accounted for 3829 scheduled appointments. Audio users were more likely to be Black and Hispanic, and to have public health insurance than video users. Adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for appointments completed versus canceled was 10 for audio and 6 for video, compared to in-person appointments. Audio visits were twice as likely as in-person visits to be completed versus missed; video visits were not different. For the subgroup of Black children, aOR for appointments completed versus canceled for audio was 9 and video was 5, compared to in-person appointments. For Black children, audio visits were 3 times as likely as in-person visits to be completed versus missed; video visits were not different. Audio visits improved access to pediatric neurology services, especially for Black children.

39159414,Analysis of Gender Discrepancies in Leadership Roles and Recognition Awards in the Child Neurology Society.,"Gender disparities have been demonstrated across several medical specialties, including neurology. Although women have comprised most of the child neurology trainees since 2007, it is not apparent whether this demographic shift is reflected in the Child Neurology Society (CNS) awards and leadership. This study aimed to evaluate the differences in gender representation among leadership positions and award recipients within the CNS. The primary outcome measure was the total number of board of director (BOD) positions or awards given by gender each year. A retrospective review of publicly available data was conducted on CNS members, post-training award recipients, and BOD positions, including nomination records, from 1972 to 2023. Data abstracted were restricted to gender to preserve member and nominee anonymity. Gender identification and consensus were determined through a combination of strategies and study members. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> test, and the exact binomial test to compare gender proportions and the probability of being underrepresented in awards, leadership, and nominations over time. Data are presented according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. From 1972 to 2023, women represented 29% (44/152) of the BOD positions and 26% (61/236) of post-training award recipients presented by the CNS. Despite the increase in the proportion of women in child neurology, the overall gap in gender representation in leadership positions remains broadly stable. Only 13% (4/32) of CNS presidents have been women, a significant underrepresentation (95% CI 2.3%-52%, <i>p</i> < 0.004), although the representation of women in nonpresidential positions increased from 2003 to 2023. Women are also underrepresented as overall awardees (95% CI 12%-38%, <i>p</i> < 0.00001) except for the Philip R. Dodge Young Investigator Award, which is an investigator-initiated application. Women remain underrepresented at the highest levels of recognition in child neurology despite representing most of the field.

Furthermore, only 46% of respondents felt comfortable providing a clear explanation of the FND diagnosis to their patients. While the majority (64%) used the term ""Functional Neurological Disorder"" in medical documentation, only 43% used this term when communicating the diagnosis to patients, with the terminology varying widely. Clinicians emphasized that inconsistent and variable neurological examinations were key indicators raising diagnostic suspicion, which aligns with the recommended reliance on detailed clinical history and neurological examination. Lastly, 61% of physicians stated that their approach to patients with FND lacked a structured management plan.

38561168,Comprehensive portrait of stroke fellowship training in Brazil: A national survey study.,"The field of vascular neurology has undergone significant advances over the last decade, and care has become more complex. However, vascular neurology training programs remain underdeveloped in many countries, despite stroke impact on health care. There are efforts towards building a nationally regulated curricula in some countries. Still, comprehensive planning and implementation of these programs may be needed on a global scale, especially in countries where stroke treatment is not fully implemented. We aim to comprehensively analyze vascular neurology trainees' profiles in Brazil to describe training program contents from trainees and program directors' perspectives. We performed an observational, cross-sectional, web-based survey study to describe trainee and program-specific characteristics at vascular neurology fellowship training programs in Brazil. The study was conducted from June to September 2023 using a secure web-based survey sent to active fellows and program directors from all known vascular neurology fellowship programs in the country. All respondents were required to provide informed consent. We obtained a 100 % response rate of a total of 12 programs distributed in 7 federal states. Notably, 57 % of the 28 surveyed fellows were women, 60 % were aged 25-30, and 70 % self-identified as White. All fellows had prior neurology training, and 60 % engaged in the program just following residency. Exposure to various training experiences was favorable, except for simulation-based learning and telestroke training. Program directors perceived exposure to be sufficient for most components but similarly found deficiencies in telestroke and simulation-based learning. Scientific productivity was low, with about two-thirds of fellows having no publications or abstracts. Most fellows (92.6 %) reported performing non-fellowship medical activities to supplement their incomes. In conclusion, the number of vascular neurology training programs and trainees in Brazil is currently insufficient and exhibits an uneven geographic distribution. Despite this, the clinical training provided is extensive, and there is generally some funding available for fellows. These insights highlight the need for strategic improvements in Brazil's stroke education and could inform similar developments in other nations.",Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association,2024-Jun,"Mendes G, Poppe AY, Lima FO, Morais A, Pontes-Neto O, Silva GS, Martins SO, Carvalho F",8,2334,neurology,2025-11-22
35508812,A comparison of telemedicine and in-person neurology visits: what are the factors that patients consider when selecting future visit type?,"To identify factors that patients consider when choosing between future in-person, video, or telephone visits. Telemedicine has been rapidly integrated into ambulatory neurology in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ambulatory neurology patients at a single center were contacted via telephone to complete: (1) a survey quantifying likelihood of scheduling a future telemedicine visit, and (2) a semi-structured qualitative interview following their visit in March 2021. Data were processed using the principles of thematic analysis. Of 2493 visits, 39% assented to post-visit feedback; 74% were in-person visits and 13% video and telephone. Patients with in-person visits were less likely than those with video and telephone visits to ""definitely"" consider a future telemedicine visit (36 vs. 59 and 62%, respectively; p < 0.001). Patients considered five key factors when scheduling future visits: ""Pros of Visit Type,"" ""Barriers to Telemedicine,"" ""Situational Context,"" ""Inherent Beliefs,"" and ""Extrinsic Variables."" Patients with telemedicine visits considered convenience as a pro, while those with in-person visits cited improved quality of care. Accessibility and user familiarity were considered barriers to telemedicine by patients with in-person and telephone visits, whereas system limitations were prevalent among patients with video visits. Patients agreed that stable conditions can be monitored via telemedicine, whereas physical examination warrants an in-person visit. Telemedicine was inherently considered equivalent to in-person care by patients with telephone visits. Awareness of telemedicine must be improved for patients with in-person visits. Across visit types, patients agree that telemedicine is convenient and effective in many circumstances. Future care delivery models should incorporate the patient perspective to implement hybrid models where telemedicine is an adjunct to in-person visits in ambulatory neurology.",Journal of neurology,2022-Sep,"Olszewski C, Thomson S, Pring K, Cox S, Merrill R, Fishman E, Ambrosini A, Soltany KA, Bognet G, Strauss L, Graham R, Guzik A, Strowd RE",13,1947,neurology,2025-11-22

The director of the institute was Maksymilian Rose (1883-1937), a distinguished Polish neurologist and neuroanatomist, a disciple of Oskar Vogt and Korbinian Brodmann. In 1931, the Institute was moved from Warsaw to Vilnius. The Institute was well-known in Europe at the time because of the research in the fields of neuroscience, clinical neurology, and psychiatry, as well as the cytoarchitectonic analysis of social activists' brains-a fashionable, neophrenological way to link the mental functions of deceased geniuses with the cellular composition of their central nervous systems. In 1939, the work of the Institute was interrupted by World War II; some of the preparations and materials were moved from Vilnius to Warsaw, some were stored in Vilnius, and some were lost.

36461823,"A utopian idea: Cushing, Bailey, Penfield, and the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness.","Toward the end of the First World War, Harvey Cushing conceived of a National Institute of Neurology (NIN) that would integrate neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry, and allied disciplines within a single institution. It would first be established for the care of American casualties in an existing military hospital in France, and then relocate to the United States. Cushing was unsuccessful in acquiring funding for this project despite appeals to the army and to the Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations. By 1920 the idea had faded from memory. In 1933 Wilder Penfield was successful in obtaining funding from the Rockefeller Foundation for the creation of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). The MNI's faculty held full-time university appointments and they limited their practice to the institute, where their offices and clinics were housed, and to adjoining research laboratories in neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, neurophysiology, and neuropsychology, as Cushing had envisioned. In this paper the argument is made that although Cushing's plan for the NIN was premature, the success of the MNI proved its feasibility. In addition, the MNI's success in integrating clinical care and research within a single institution was a model for the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness and drove its first clinical research program.",Journal of neurosurgery,2023-Aug,Leblanc R,1,1354,neurology,2025-11-22

By 2035, advances in our understanding of neuroanatomical networks and in the mechanism of action of stimulation, coupled with developments in material science, miniaturization, energy storage, and delivery, will expand the use of neuromodulation devices. Neuromodulation approaches are flexible and modifiable. Stimulation can be targeted to a dysfunctional brain focus, region, or network, and can be delivered as a single treatment, continuously, according to a duty cycle, or in response to physiologic changes. Programming can be titrated and modified based on the clinical response or a physiologic biomarker. In addition to keeping pace with clinical and technological developments, neurologists in 2035 will need to navigate complex ethical and economic considerations to ensure access to neuromodulation technology for a rapidly expanding population of patients. This article provides an overview of systems in use today and those that are anticipated and highlights the opportunities and challenges for the future, some of which are technical, but most of which will be addressed by learning about brain networks, and from rapidly growing experience with neuromodulation devices.",Neurology,2022-Jan,"Denison T, Morrell MJ",2,1377,neurology,2025-11-22

Using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Open Payments Database (OPD), we retrieved information on payments from Industry to 2,000 authors from randomly selected 2016 articles in 5 journals. We categorized payments by type (research, general, and associated research/institutional), sponsoring entity, and year (from 2013 to 2016). Each author's self-disclosures were compared to OPD-listed Industry relationships to measure discordance. Payments were manually reviewed to identify those from manufacturers of products that were directly tested or discussed in the article. We also quantified the prevalence and value of these nondisclosed, relevant COI. Two hundred authors from 158 articles had at least 1 OPD payment. Median/mean annual payments per author were $4,229/$19,586 (general); $1,702/$5,966 (research); and $67,512/$362,102 (associated research). Most neurologists received <$1,000/y (74.6%, 93.0%, and 79.5% for general, research, and associated research, respectively), but a sizeable minority (>10% of authors) received more than $10,000 per year, and several received over $1 million. Of 3,013 payments deemed directly relevant to the article, 50.9% were not self-disclosed by the authors, totaling $5,782,197 ($1,665,603 general; $25,532 research; $4,091,062 associated research). Industry-related financial relationships are prevalent among United States-based physicians publishing in major neurology journals, and incomplete self-disclosure is common.

38506968,Leveraging the Capabilities of AI: Novice Neurology-Trained Operators Performing Cardiac POCUS in Patients with Acute Brain Injury.,"Cardiac point-of-care ultrasound (cPOCUS) can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disorders. Such disorders can arise as complications of acute brain injury, but most neurologic intensive care unit (NICU) providers do not receive formal training in cPOCUS. Caption artificial intelligence (AI) uses a novel deep learning (DL) algorithm to guide novice cPOCUS users in obtaining diagnostic-quality cardiac images. The primary objective of this study was to determine how often NICU providers with minimal cPOCUS experience capture quality images using DL-guided cPOCUS as well as the association between DL-guided cPOCUS and change in management and time to formal echocardiograms in the NICU. From September 2020 to November 2021, neurology-trained physician assistants, residents, and fellows used DL software to perform clinically indicated cPOCUS scans in an academic tertiary NICU. Certified echocardiographers evaluated each scan independently to assess the quality of images and global interpretability of left ventricular function, right ventricular function, inferior vena cava size, and presence of pericardial effusion. Descriptive statistics with exact confidence intervals were used to calculate proportions of obtained images that were of adequate quality and that changed management. Time to first adequate cardiac images (either cPOCUS or formal echocardiography) was compared using a similar population from 2018. In 153 patients, 184 scans were performed for a total of 943 image views. Three certified echocardiographers deemed 63.4% of scans as interpretable for a qualitative assessment of left ventricular size and function, 52.6% of scans as interpretable for right ventricular size and function, 34.8% of scans as interpretable for inferior vena cava size and variability, and 47.2% of scans as interpretable for the presence of pericardial effusion. Thirty-seven percent of screening scans changed management, most commonly adjusting fluid goals (81.2%). Time to first adequate cardiac images decreased significantly from 3.1 to 1.7 days (p < 0.001). With DL guidance, neurology providers with minimal to no cPOCUS training were often able to obtain diagnostic-quality cardiac images, which informed management changes and significantly decreased time to cardiac imaging.",Neurocritical care,2024-Oct,"Mears J, Kaleem S, Panchamia R, Kamel H, Tam C, Thalappillil R, Murthy S, Merkler AE, Zhang C, Ch'ang JH",10,2305,neurology,2025-11-22
38713439,Crosstalk Between Cell Death and Spinal Cord Injury: Neurology and Therapy.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) often leads to neurological dysfunction, and neuronal cell death is one of the main causes of neurological dysfunction. After SCI, in addition to necrosis, programmed cell death (PCD) occurs in nerve cells. At first, studies recognized only necrosis, apoptosis, and autophagy. In recent years, researchers have identified new forms of PCD, including pyroptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis. Related studies have confirmed that all of these cell death modes are involved in various phases of SCI and affect the direction of the disease through different mechanisms and pathways. Furthermore, regulating neuronal cell death after SCI through various means has been proven to be beneficial for the recovery of neural function. In recent years, emerging therapies for SCI have also provided new potential methods to restore neural function. Thus, the relationship between SCI and cell death plays an important role in the occurrence and development of SCI. This review summarizes and generalizes the relevant research results on neuronal necrosis, apoptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, and cuproptosis after SCI to provide a new understanding of neuronal cell death after SCI and to aid in the treatment of SCI.",Molecular neurobiology,2024-Dec,"Song Q, Cui Q, Sun S, Wang Y, Yuan Y, Zhang L",6,1268,neurology,2025-11-22

There is a gap in EEG education for residents in Canadian neurology programs as EEG is only listed in the training requirements as a procedural skill. There is currently no standardized EEG curriculum among Canadian epilepsy fellowship programs. We conducted two iterations of a structured virtual EEG course from June to October 2021, and from March to June 2022. Trainees were recruited via Canadian neurology residency and epilepsy fellowship programs and were required to join the Canadian League Against Epilepsy (CLAE) as junior members. We obtained trainee demographic information before and after each course as well as analytical data on the video recordings posted on the CLAE website. A total of 77 trainees registered for the two courses; majority of trainees were adult neurology residents (34%) and adult epilepsy fellows (32%). Prior theoretical EEG teaching was reported as limited by more than half (53%) of participants. The average number of unique viewers per recorded video in 2021 was 29.7 interquartile range (16-35.5), while in 2022, the average was 22.5, interquartile range (16-28). Post-course questionnaire data revealed that 82% of participants strongly agreed that the course enhanced their knowledge. All participants were either likely (27%) or very likely (73%) to recommend the course to their peers. National virtual EEG education is both feasible and accessible; therefore, this is a promising modality of teaching to meet the significant demand for high-quality EEG education among neurology trainees.",Epileptic disorders : international epilepsy journal with videotape,2024-Jun,"Shock M, Cerga K, RamachandranNair R, Reid A, Bui E, Kobayashi E, Jones K",7,1634,neurology,2025-11-22

During the period of May 1-4, 2020, we administered an anonymous electronic survey to all neurology faculty and housestaff to assess the potential psychosocial impacts of COVID-19. The survey also addressed how our institution and department are responding to these challenges. This report outlines the psychosocial concerns of neurology faculty and housestaff and the multifaceted support services that our department and institution are offering in response. Faculty and housestaff cohorts were compared with regard to frequencies of binary responses (yes/ no) using the Fisher's exact test. Among 130 total survey respondents (91/191 faculty [48%] and 37/62 housestaff [60%]), substantial proportions of both groups self-reported having increased fear (79%), anxiety (83%) and depression (38%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These proportions were not significantly different between the faculty and housestaff groups. Most respondents reported that the institution had provided adequate counseling and support services (91%) and that the department had rendered adequate emotional support (92%). Participants offered helpful suggestions regarding additional resources that would be helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has affected the lives and minds of faculty and housestaff in our neurology department at the epicenter of the pandemic.

The name La Salpêtrière is inherited from the initial purpose of the buildings designed to produce saltpeter for gun powder. But the place was soon transformed into an asylum to shelter the poor and the insane. From the care of this underprivileged population, alienists such as Pinel have paved the way for modern medicine for the mentally ill at the time of the French Revolution. In the second half of the 19th century, Jean-Martin Charcot and his students laid the foundations of modern neurology from the observation of the large population hosted in La Salpêtrière, mostly women with severe chronic diseases. Charcot led clinicopathological studies in almost all the fields of nervous system disorders. His successors (including Raymond, Dejerine, Pierre Marie) maintained the same close relationship between clinical neurology and neuropathology. In parallel with the development of neurosurgery at Pitié hospital, neuropathology first spread through small laboratories attached to clinical departments. The merger of the two hospitals in the early '60s coincided with the creation of a large university hospital in which the care and study of diseases of the nervous system were preponderant. An independent laboratory of neuropathology was created, led by Raymond Escourolle. This period was on the eve of important developments in neuroscience around the world.

The number of such studies is growing alongside the expansion of data collection. We aim to gain a broad picture of the scope of how routine healthcare data have been utilised. This study follows a systematic mapping review approach which does not make a judgement on the quality of the papers included in the review, thereby enabling a complete overview of the field. Of 4481 publications retrieved, 386 met the eligibility criteria for this study. These publications covered a wide range of conditions, but the majority were based on one or only a small number of neurological conditions. In particular, publications concerned with three discrete areas of neurological practice - multiple sclerosis (MS), epilepsy/seizure and Parkinson's disease - accounted for 60% of the total. MS was the focus of the highest proportion of eligible studies (35%), yet in the recent Global Burden of Neurological Disease study it ranks only 14th out of 15 neurological disorders for DALY rates. In contrast, migraine is the neurological disorder with the highest ranking of DALYs globally (after stroke) and yet it was represented by only 4% of eligible studies. This review shows that there is a disproportionately large body of literature pertaining to relatively rare disorders, and a correspondingly small body of literature describing more common conditions.

In the years that followed, the ACGME received and reviewed feedback about the milestones and set out to revise them. A committee was assembled to review the original milestones and develop a new set of milestones. The group was also encouraged to not only consider the child neurology residency graduate of today but also the graduate of tomorrow, taking into account growing fields such as genetics and technology. A diverse group of 12 individuals, including 10 child neurologists (all of whom were current or previous program directors or associate program directors), one child neurology resident, and one non-physician program coordinator, were recruited from programs of varying size across the country. The committee developed a revision to the child neurology milestones. All changes made were with a focus on how the milestones can be useful to trainees, program directors, and clinical competency committee members.

39427660,"Hemorrhagic Stroke as Inspiration for Poetry: The Case of Alfred Tennyson, Arthur Henry Hallam, and In Memoriam A.H.H.","Neurology and literature have a complex interface; one of the facets is that of works inspired by grief on the passing of a beloved one due to a neurological disease. In Memoriam A.H.H., written by Alfred Tennyson and published in 1850 in response to the untimely death of Arthur Henry Hallam, is one such elegy, which had a profound impact in Tennyson's body of work and on the history of Victorian poetry in general. In this review, the author delineates biographical notes of both men before analyzing the disease and death of Arthur Hallam due to hemorrhagic stroke. By evaluating Hallam's autopsy report and contemplating the different hypotheses on the etiology of his stroke, as well as how his death due to catastrophic neurological disease was memorialized in verse, neurologists may gain better insight on the interface between neurology and literature inspired by grief.",European neurology,2024-,Pedro M,1,881,neurology,2025-11-22

Collaboration between voluntary patient organizations (the Migraine Association of Ireland or MAI), primary care services, and hospital/community shared healthcare professionals (most notably the headache specialist nurse), is highlighted as one of the key features of this management strategy in an underfunded and under-resourced public healthcare system. The migraine/headache community in Ireland is small, but they have been dedicated in their commitment to improving care for their patients for more than 2 decades. As a result, they have been successful in recent years, both nationally and internationally, in terms of financial funding and support for their multidisciplinary and collaborative approach.",Headache,2020-Nov,"Tomkins E, Craven A, Ruttledge M",3,848,neurology,2025-11-22
33323116,Shaping a data-driven era in dementia care pathway through computational neurology approaches.,"Dementia is caused by a variety of neurodegenerative diseases and is associated with a decline in memory and other cognitive abilities, while inflicting an enormous socioeconomic burden. The complexity of dementia and its associated comorbidities presents immense challenges for dementia research and care, particularly in clinical decision-making. Despite the lack of disease-modifying therapies, there is an increasing and urgent need to make timely and accurate clinical decisions in dementia diagnosis and prognosis to allow appropriate care and treatment. However, the dementia care pathway is currently suboptimal. We propose that through computational approaches, understanding of dementia aetiology could be improved, and dementia assessments could be more standardised, objective and efficient. In particular, we suggest that these will involve appropriate data infrastructure, the use of data-driven computational neurology approaches and the development of practical clinical decision support systems. We also discuss the technical, structural, economic, political and policy-making challenges that accompany such implementations. The data-driven era for dementia research has arrived with the potential to transform the healthcare system, creating a more efficient, transparent and personalised service for dementia.",BMC medicine,2020-Dec,"Wong-Lin K, McClean PL, McCombe N, Kaur D, Sanchez-Bornot JM, Gillespie P, Todd S, Finn DP, Joshi A, Kane J, McGuinness B",11,1328,neurology,2025-11-22
38581138,Effects of explainable artificial intelligence in neurology decision support.,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based decision support systems (DSS) are utilized in medicine but underlying decision-making processes are usually unknown. Explainable AI (xAI) techniques provide insight into DSS, but little is known on how to design xAI for clinicians. Here we investigate the impact of various xAI techniques on a clinician's interaction with an AI-based DSS in decision-making tasks as compared to a general population. We conducted a randomized, blinded study in which members of the Child Neurology Society and American Academy of Neurology were compared to a general population. Participants received recommendations from a DSS via a random assignment of an xAI intervention (decision tree, crowd sourced agreement, case-based reasoning, probability scores, counterfactual reasoning, feature importance, templated language, and no explanations). Primary outcomes included test performance and perceived explainability, trust, and social competence of the DSS. Secondary outcomes included compliance, understandability, and agreement per question. We had 81 neurology participants with 284 in the general population. Decision trees were perceived as the more explainable by the medical versus general population (P < 0.01) and as more explainable than probability scores within the medical population (P < 0.001). Increasing neurology experience and perceived explainability degraded performance (P = 0.0214). Performance was not predicted by xAI method but by perceived explainability. xAI methods have different impacts on a medical versus general population; thus, xAI is not uniformly beneficial, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Further user-centered xAI research targeting clinicians and to develop personalized DSS for clinicians is needed.",Annals of clinical and translational neurology,2024-May,"Gombolay GY, Silva A, Schrum M, Gopalan N, Hallman-Cooper J, Dutt M, Gombolay M",7,1777,neurology,2025-11-22
38063214,Sleeping with one cerebrum open: patient and staff perceptions of sleep quality and quantity on an inpatient neurology unit.,"This study sought to investigate perceptions of sleep disruptions among patients and staff in the inpatient neurology setting. The objectives were to explore the differences between these groups regarding factors that impact sleep, identify the most significant sleep disruptions, and examine the barriers and opportunities suggested to improve inpatient sleep. A survey-based observational study was conducted on a 25-bed inpatient neurology unit at an academic medical center. Staff and patients completed the Potential Hospital Sleep Disruptions and Noises Questionnaire, and focus groups were held to gather qualitative data. Patient-reported sleep measures were collected for additional assessment. Responses were dichotomized for comparison. Regression models were used to assess associations between disruptors and patient-reported sleep measures. Qualitative thematic analyses were performed. Forty-nine inpatient staff and 247 patients completed sleep surveys. Top primary patient diagnoses included stroke, epilepsy, autoimmune diseases, and psychogenic nonepileptic attacks. Medical interventions, environmental factors, patient-related factors, and unit workflows emerged as key themes related to sleep disruptions. Patient-reported sleep efficiency was significantly reduced when pain, anxiety, stress, temperature, and medication administration disrupted sleep. Staff perspectives highlighted medical interventions as most disruptive to sleep, while patients did not find them as disruptive as expected. Differing perspectives on sleep disruption exist between staff and patients in the inpatient neurology setting. Medical interventions may be overstated in staff perceptions and inpatient sleep research, as pain, anxiety, and stress had the most significant impact on patient-reported sleep efficiency.

32993634,Needs assessment for a curriculum for difficult conversations -a survey from 5 Chinese accredited neurology residency training programs.,"Communication skill is a core competency in neurology residency training. Specific training in this area at the residency level is often lacking, especially regarding difficult conversations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the current state in teaching residents about difficult conversations in 5 Chinese accredited neurology residency training programs and determine whether there is a perceived need for a formalized curriculum in this field. An anonymous, 27-question, cross-sectional online survey addressing difficult conversations for neurological residents were distributed to five grade-A, class-3 hospitals selected from the affiliated teaching hospitals of medical schools qualified to provide neurology residency training in China. A total of 182 residents responded to the survey, and the response rate was 67.16% (182/271). Of the participants, 84.6% were female and the average age was 26.8 years. The majority of respondent residents (n = 168; 92.31%) reported being exposed to at least one difficult conversation in their medical careers. Only 43 (23.63%) participants reported having previously received formal communication skills training. In comparison with residents without previous training, those with previous training indicated significantly more confidence (P = 0.003) and were under lower pressure (P = 0.037) in managing difficult conversations. Only 97 (53.3%) residents indicated interest in receiving formal training. Time, lack of enthusiasm, lack of educational materials and faculty expertise were commonly cited barriers to formalized training. This survey provides a preliminary assessment of the current status of education on the topic of difficult conversations in five accredited Chinese neurology residency training programs. Our results suggest that there is an unmet need to further develop and implement educational activities by teaching residents to lead difficult conversations. Future efforts should be made to establish and promote a standard and targeted communication curriculum in difficult conversation for Chinese neurological residents.",BMC medical education,2020-Sep,"Zhou L, Wu B, Wu L, Cheng X, Hu B, Yao M, Zhu Y, Peng B, Cui L, Ni J",10,2099,neurology,2025-11-22

33475954,Reducing Events of Noncompliance in Neurology Human Subjects Research: the Effect of Human Subjects Research Protection Training and Site Initiation Visits.,"In an effort to minimize protocol noncompliance in neurological research studies that can potentially compromise patient safety, delay completion of the study, and result in premature termination and added costs, we determined the effect of investigator trainings and site initiation visits (SIVs) on the occurrence of noncompliance events. Results of protocol audits conducted at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke from 2003 to 2019 on 97 research protocols were retrospectively analyzed. Based on the depth of auditing and provision of investigator research training, audit data were separated into four arms: 1) Early Period, 2003 to 2012; 2) Middle Period, 2013 to 2016; and Late Period, 2017 to 2019, further divided into 3) Late Period without SIVs; and 4) Late Period with SIVs. Events of noncompliance were classified by the type of protocol deviation, the category, and the cause. In total, 952 events occurred across 1080 participants. Protocols audited during the Middle Period, compared to the Early Period, showed a decrease in the percentage of protocols with at least 1 noncompliance event. Protocols with SIVs had a further decrease in major, minor, procedural, eligibility, and policy events. Additionally, protocols audited during the Early Period had on average 0.46 major deviations per participant, compared to 0.26 events in protocols audited during the Middle Period, and 0.08 events in protocols audited during the Late Period with SIVs. Protocol deviations and noncompliance events in neurological clinical trials can be reduced by targeted investigator trainings and SIVs. These measures have major impacts on the integrity, safety, and effectiveness of human subjects research in neurology.",Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics,2021-Apr,"Gooden MJ, Norato G, Martin SB, Nath A, Reoma L",5,1742,neurology,2025-11-22

Hrayr Terzian (Addis Abeba 1925-Verona 1988). In 1966, Terzian was appointed professor of the clinic of nervous and mental diseases in Cagliari, and in 1970 moved to Verona, where until his death he led the Neurology Clinic serving as the first rector of the local university. As a close friend of the psychiatrist Franco Basaglia (1924-1980), Terzian contributed to the reform of the Italian mental health system. His interests and scientific contributions were extremely broad. He was the first to describe the electroencephalographic changes induced by the antipsychotic chlorpromazine and, together with Henri Gastaut (1915-1995) and his wife Yvette, to describe the rolandic arched (""mu"") rhythm. He contributed to elucidate the inhibitory mechanisms of the cerebellum on the antigravity postural tone and provided the first description of Klüver-Bucy syndrome in humans. Always attentive to the social and political aspects of medical practice, prof. Terzian achieved outstanding results both in experimental neurophysiology and in clinical neurology. Besides offering a tribute to Hrayr Terzian, this article provides a brief historical overview of the different clinical pictures caused by bilateral temporal lesions: from the first animal observations by Sanger Brown (1852-1928) and sir Edward Albert Sharpey-Schäfer (1850-1935), later confirmed and expanded upon by Heinrich Klüver (1897-1979) and Paul C. Bucy (1904-1992), to the first cases of bitemporal lesions in humans, including that of the famous patient H.M. (Henry Gustav Molaison, 1926-2008).",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2021-Sep,Brigo F,1,1631,neurology,2025-11-22
32603805,Use of a simulation-based mastery learning curriculum for neurology residents to improve the identification and management of status epilepticus.,"Appropriate and timely treatment of status epilepticus (SE) decreases morbidity and mortality. Therefore, skill-based training in the identification and management of SE is crucial for clinicians. The objective of the study was to develop and evaluate the impact of a simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) curriculum to train neurology residents on the identification and management of SE. We used pretest-posttest design with a retention test on SE skills for this study. Neurology residents in the second postgraduate year (PGY-2) were eligible to participate in the SE SBML curriculum. Learners completed a baseline-simulated SE skills assessment (pretest) using a 26-item dichotomous skills checklist. Next, they participated in a didactic session about the identification and management of SE, followed by deliberate skills practice. Subsequently, participants completed another skills assessment (posttest) using the same 26-item checklist. All participants were required to meet or exceed a minimum passing standard (MPS) determined by a panel of 14 SE experts using the Mastery Angoff standard setting method. After meeting the MPS at posttest, participants were reassessed during an unannounced in situ simulation session on the medical wards. We compared pretest with posttest simulated SE skills performance and posttest with reassessment in situ performance. The MPS was set at 88% (23/26) checklist items correct. Sixteen neurology residents participated in the intervention. Participant performance improved from a median of 44.23% (Interquartile range (IQR): 34.62-55.77) at pretest to 94.23% (IQR: 92.13-100) at the posttest after SBML (p < .001). There was no significant difference in scores between the posttest and in situ test up to 8 months later (94.23%; IQR: 92.31-100 vs. 92.31%; IQR: 88.46-96.15; p = .13).

36096689,The State of Inpatient Child Neurology: A Survey of North American Academic Programs.,"Inpatient child neurology programs provide essential services for children. We sought to understand the current structure and challenges of inpatient pediatric neurologic care delivery in academic programs in North America. We identified a single child neurologist from 39 of the first 40 programs on the 2019-2020 US News and World Report ranking and 3 large Canadian programs to be invited to participate in an inpatient focused survey. In October 2020, these 42 child neurologists were invited to complete an anonymous on-line survey including 37 questions about the structure, workload, and challenges of their inpatient program. Data were analyzed descriptively. We received responses from 30/42 (71%) invited child neurologists from unique programs. Most (22/30, 73%) were Child Neurology Program Directors, Inpatient Directors, and/or Division Chiefs. Two-thirds (20/30, 67%) reported a total of 2-4 inpatient services. Two-thirds (20/30, 67%) reported a primary neurology admitting service. Nearly two-thirds (19/30, 63%) reported a separate intensive care unit service, and approximately one-third (11/30, 37%) reported a separate stroke/vascular service. Half of the respondents (15/30, 50%) reported some attendings whose primary clinical effort is in the inpatient setting. Over half (17/30, 57%) reported having trainees interested in inpatient-focused careers. Approximately half (16/30, 53%) reported a full-time equivalent metric for inpatient time, and under half (13/30, 43%) reported the use of critical-care billing. Most respondents (26/30, 87%) endorsed that inpatient attendings frequently complete documentation/sign notes outside of normal daytime hours. During night call, attendings commonly spend 30 minutes-2 hours on patient care-related phone calls between 5 and 10 pm (24/30, 80%) and receive 1-3 patient care-related phone calls after 10 pm (21/30, 70%). Faculty burnout was the biggest inpatient-specific challenge before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (25/30, 83%), and concern about faculty well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic was reported in nearly all respondents (28/30, 93%). Academic child neurology programs in North America implement varied models for inpatient care delivery and face common challenges. The information presented in this study serves to stimulate discussion, help optimize operations, and encourage novel approaches to accomplish work and advance careers in academic inpatient child neurology.",Neurology,2022-Oct,"Nash KB, Palaganas J, Abend NS, Hutchinson ML, Messer R, Moharir M, Piantino J, Press CA, Wells E",9,2475,neurology,2025-11-22
38914963,"Perceptions and attitudes regarding complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine among published neurology authors: a large-scale, international cross-sectional survey.","While many patients with neurological disorders and conditions use complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine (CAIM), little is known about the use, perceptions, and attitudes regarding CAIM among published neurology authors. With the increasing popularity of CAIM, our objective was to assess practices, perceptions, and attitudes towards CAIM among published neurology authors. We conducted an anonymous online survey of authors who had published articles in neurology journals indexed in MEDLINE. We emailed potential participants our cross-sectional electronic survey after extracting their email addresses from one of their publications in our sample of journals. Basic descriptive statistics were drawn from quantitative data, and thematic content analysis was used to analyse qualitative data from any open-ended questions. The survey was completed by 783 published neurology authors (1.7% response rate, 83.9% completion rate). Overall, respondents perceived CAIM to be promising in preventing, treating, and/or managing neurological diseases. Mind-body therapies received the most positive responses, indicated by over half of respondents cumulatively agreeing that they are promising (n = 368, 59.0%) and safe (n = 280, 50.3%). Whole medical systems and biofield therapy were less favourable. Most neurology clinicians reported a lack of formal (n = 211, 70.3%) and supplementary training (n = 158, 52.5%) on CAIM. Nearly half of clinicians did not feel comfortable counselling patients about CAIM therapies (n = 121, 44.5%), and over half did not feel comfortable recommending them (n = 161, 59.3%). A lack of scientific evidence for CAIM's safety and efficacy was reported as the greatest challenge to CAIM (n = 515, 92.5%). The majority of respondents believed there is value to conducting research on this topic (n = 461, 82.0%) and supported increasing allocation of research funding towards CAIM (n = 241, 58.9%). Although many participants found CAIM to be promising to the field of neurology, the vast majority did not feel open to integrating CAIM into mainstream medical practices on account of a perceived lack of scientific evidence for its safety and efficacy. Future studies can use our findings to gather more detailed insights, improve educational resources on CAIM within neurology, as well as examine what effects a tailored CAIM education has on the perceptions and attitudes of published neurology authors towards CAIM.",BMC neurology,2024-Jun,"Ng JY, Li SY, Cramer H",3,2459,neurology,2025-11-22
36300372,Investigation on Gender Differences in Leadership of Stroke-Related Clinical Trials.,"Gender disparities among principal investigators of clinical trials (CT) can have implications regarding the areas of investigation, methods, conduct, trial enrollment, and interpretation of results. An estimation of the gender gap in the leadership of stroke-related CTs from North America has to date not been undertaken. We extracted information about stroke-related CTs between 2011 and 2020 from www. gov and PubMed. We examined the gender distribution according to the academic credentials and the trial type. The gender of PIs and authors was determined using gender package in R, which identifies gender using historical data from the United States. Additionally, we obtained information from Association of American Medical Colleges and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education data resource books on the gender composition of full-time neurology faculty, neurology residents and vascular neurology fellows. In these analyses of 821 CTs registered on Clinicaltrials.gov and 110 trials published on PubMed, we found that gender disparity among the PIs, first and last authors have persisted over the last decade without any significant trend toward parity (<i>P</i>>0.05). On examining the gender distribution according to academic credentials and trial type, we found that men were over-represented in the sub-group of PIs with an MD degree (78.11% versus 21.87%; <i>P</i><0.01) and those leading acute stroke trials (86.04% versus 13.89%; <i>P</i><0.01). We also found that a lower proportion of women neurology residents pursued a vascular neurology fellowship during this period (33.5% versus 42.5%; <i>P</i><0.05). Our results show that the favorable trend toward gender parity seen in Neurology faculty over the last decade has not translated to the same in the leadership of CTs.

An expert panel of 19 United States-based neurologists involved in global health was recruited from the American Academy of Neurology Global Health Section and the American Neurological Association International Outreach Committee. An extensive list of global health competencies was generated from review of global health curricula and adapted for global neurology training. Using a modified Delphi method, United States-based neurologists participated in 3 rounds of voting on a survey with potential competencies rated on a 4-point Likert scale. A final group discussion was held to reach consensus. Proposed competencies were then subjected to a formal review from a group of 7 neurologists from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with experience working with neurology trainees from high-income countries (HICs) who commented on potential gaps, feasibility, and local implementation challenges of the proposed competencies. This feedback was used to modify and finalize competencies. Three rounds of surveys, a conference call with United States-based experts, and a semistructured questionnaire and focus group discussion with LMIC experts were used to discuss and reach consensus on the final competencies. This resulted in a competency framework consisting of 47 competencies across 8 domains: (1) cultural context, social determinants of health and access to care; (2) clinical and teaching skills and neurologic medical knowledge; (3) team-based practice; (4) developing global neurology partnerships; (5) ethics; (6) approach to clinical care; (7) community neurologic health; (8) health care systems and multinational health care organizations.

Listening to patient voices, attending to family, advocacy group, and societal views on neurologic disorders can strengthen precision neurology practice. Dialogs on neurodiversity, including antitherapy sentiments, offer to enhance neurologic care, patient agency, and autonomy; encourage respectful communications with patients who challenge the idea their condition is pathologic; and to set the stage for future empirical investigations and practice guidelines.",Neurology,2024-Jul,"Graber A, Rizzo M",2,931,neurology,2025-11-22
34903613,Neurologic Therapeutics in 2035: The Neurology Future Forecasting Series.,"Therapeutic development has accelerated rapidly in the past 5 years in many neurologic and neurodegenerative diseases. The therapeutic categories of development include small molecules, genetic therapies, and cell-based therapies. Current development has provided novel treatment approaches to disorders without available treatment. However, the regulatory procedures to allow for access to these therapies is challenging, as is the ability to provide wide access to increasingly expensive therapies. By 2035, these challenges are likely to have accelerated and have the potential to create bottlenecks in drug approval and reduced access to patients. Innovative regulatory and payer solutions are required. In addition, ethical considerations around genetic therapies should be considered in current and future development. These approaches will ensure that patients with neurologic disease have broad access to highly innovative therapies.",Neurology,2021-Dec,"Johnson NE, Greene E",2,941,neurology,2025-11-22

39736639,Comparison of the effects of different teaching methods on the effectiveness of teaching neurology in China: a bayesian network meta-analysis and systematic review.,"In China, investigations into the efficacy of neurological clinical teaching try to ascertain the impacts of various teaching methods on intervention outcomes. However, these studies often suffer from limited sample sizes, single-center studies and low quality, compounded by the lack of direct comparative analyses between teaching methods, thereby leaving the identification of the most effective method unresolved. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of various teaching methods in the standardized training of Chinese neurology clinicians to inform an optimal teaching model utilizing a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) approach. A comprehensive computer search was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of 7 teaching methods: problem-based learning (PBL), case-based learning (CBL), flipped classroom model (FCM), evidence-based medicine (EBM), clinical practice (CP), team-based learning (TBL), and lecture-based learning (LBL). The search, which spanned databases including the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Citation Database (CDD), China Science Periodical Database (CSPD), Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM), PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, covered the period from the inception of these databases to April 1, 2023. The quality of the included studies was evaluated, and the data were analyzed in R 4.3.2 and Stata 17.0 software. From the 31 studies included, comprising 2124 subjects, significant findings emerged. In theoretical examinations, a statistically significant difference was noted among the teaching methods, with CBL, PBL, TBL, FCM, and EBM showing superior performance over the LBL method. The effectiveness ranking of these methods was as follows: CBL > PBL > TBL > FCM > EBM > CP > LBL. In terms of practical skills examinations, a similar pattern of effectiveness was observed. Here, the order of effectiveness was CBL > EBM > PBL > TBL > FCM > CP > LBL. This NMA indicated that the modern teaching pedagogies, particularly CBL, could be effective in neurology education, and might help improve the theoretical examinations and practical skills of neurology clinicians. Fully tapping into the strengths of modern teaching methods in neurology teaching will require additional work and advancing research.",BMC medical education,2024-Dec,"Li X, Zhang L, Sun W, Lei M, Li Y, Zhang J, Huang X",7,2341,neurology,2025-11-22
37029415,The relationship of online pre-recorded neurology mini-lectures to medical student assessment: a pilot study.,"eLearning has become an essential part of medical education. However, there is a lack of published research on student engagement with online pre-recorded mini-lectures and its relation to assessment. The aim of this pilot study is to explore the relationship between newly introduced neurology pre-recorded mini-lectures and undergraduate medical students engagement and assessment. This may encourage the wider use of mini-lectures in undergraduate medical curricula. The engagement of medical students with 48 online pre-recorded neurology mini-lectures was assessed through a Learning Management System. To measure engagement, data was stratified according to the number of watched/downloaded mini-lectures. A point system was used (out of 5): - 1 point = watching/downloading 0-10 mini-lectures, 2 points = watching/downloading 11-20 mini-lectures, 3 points = watching/downloading 21-30 mini-lectures, 4 points = watching/downloading 31-40 mini-lectures and, 5 points = watching/downloading 41-48 mini-lectures. The students' engagement was correlated with their neurology assessments [Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), and knowledge-based assessment 10 Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and one 10-mark Short Answer Question, (SAQ)], internal medicine grade and annual grade point average (GPA) using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The mean engagement of 34, Year 5, medical students is 3.9/5. There is a significant positive correlation between engagement and internal medicine grade (r = 0.35, p = 0.044). There is a moderate correlation between engagement and neurology OSCE (r = 0.23), annual Year 5 GPA (r = 0.23), neurology knowledge-based score (r = 0.22) and composite neurology knowledge/OSCE (r = 0.27). The knowledge-based assessment included SAQ and MCQs: there was a moderate correlation with SAQ (r = 0.30), but a weak negative correlation with the MCQs (r =-0.11). Sub-groups analysis comparing the top- and low- or non- engaging students made these weaker correlations stronger. This pilot study indicates a high rate of engagement with an online pre-recorded mini-lectures resource and evidence of moderate correlation between engagement and assessment. Online pre-recorded mini-lectures should be used more in delivering the curriculum contents of the clinical clerkships. Further studies are needed to evaluate the relation and the impact of the mini-lectures on assessment.",BMC medical education,2023-Apr,"Benamer HT, Stanley AG",2,2420,neurology,2025-11-22
34158383,Randomized Study of Bedside vs Hallway Rounding: Neurology Rounding Study.,"Over the last century, attending rounds have shifted away from the bedside. Despite evidence for greater patient satisfaction rates and improved nursing perception of teamwork with bedside presentations, residents and attending physicians are apprehensive of the bedside approach. There is lack of data to guide rounding practices within neurology, and therefore, optimal rounding methods remain unclear. The objective of this study was to compare bedside rounding with hallway rounding on an academic neurology inpatient service and assess efficiency, trainee education, and satisfaction among patients and staff. We conducted a single-center prospective randomized study of bedside vs hallway rounding on new inpatient neurology admissions over 1-week blocks. The bedside team presented patients at the bedside, whereas the hallway team presented patients outside of the patient's room. We evaluated the 2 approaches with time-motion analysis, which investigated the rounding style's effect on composition and timing of rounds (primary outcome) and surveys of patients, nurses, residents, and attending physicians on both teams (secondary outcomes). The mean rounding time per newly admitted patient in the bedside group (n = 38 patients) and hallway group (n = 41 patients) was 23 minutes and 23.2 minutes, respectively (<i>p</i> = 0.93). The bedside group spent on average 56.4% of patient rounding time in the patient's room, whereas the hallway group spent 39.5% of rounding time in the patient's room (<i>p</i> = 0.036). Residents perceived hallway rounding to be more efficient and associated it with a superior educational experience and more effective data review. Nurses had improved perception of their participation in bedside rounds. Although patients' views of bedside and hallway rounds were similar, patients who had experienced bedside rounds preferred it. In conclusion, bedside rounding was perceived less favorably by most residents but was as efficient as hallway rounding. Although bedside rounding limited the use of technology for data review, it promoted nursing participation and resulted in more time spent with the patient.

33569366,COVID-19 and Teleneurology in Sub-Saharan Africa: Leveraging the Current Exigency.,"Africa has over 1.3 billion inhabitants, with over 60% of this population residing in rural areas that have poor access to medical experts. Despite having a ridiculously huge, underserved population, very few African countries currently have any form of sustained and organized telemedicine practice, and even fewer have dedicated tele-neurology services. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has proved to be one of the most significant disruptors of vital sectors of human endeavor in modern times. In the healthcare sector, there is an increasing advocacy to deliver non-urgent care <i>via</i> telemedicine. This paper examined the current state of tele-neurology practice and infrastructural preparedness in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, there is over 70% mobile phone penetration in most of the countries and virtually all of them have mobile internet services of different technologies and generations. Although the needed infrastructure is increasingly available, it should be improved upon. We have proposed the access, costs, ethics, and support (ACES) model as a bespoke, holistic strategy for the successful implementation and advancement of tele-neurology in sub-Saharan Africa.",Frontiers in public health,2020-,"Adebayo PB, Oluwole OJ, Taiwo FT",3,1184,neurology,2025-11-22

This article outlines the life of the family's semi-aristocratic patriarch, beginning with Thomas's unusual educational background and his six-year post-graduate hiatus in Paris of the 1830s, where he came under the influence of P. C. A. Louis (1787-1872). It lays out his subsequent career as professor of the Institutes of Medicine and ultimately as dean of an American medical school that was not situated in a major metropolis.

39572267,Providing pediatric neurocritical education across the ages: Bridging of neonatal neurocritical care into pediatric neurocritical care training.,"Pediatric neurocritical care is a field dedicated to providing specialized assessment and care of critically-ill children with neurologic disease or at risk of neurologic compromise. Fellowship programs for providers interested in specializing in pediatric neurocritical care are growing and developing to meet the needs of trainees and the patient populations that they serve. Fetal and neonatal neurocritical care fellowship remains a separate opportunity for training; however, inclusion of fetal and neonatal neurology education into pediatric neurocritical care broadens understanding of normal and pathologic anatomy and physiology, diagnostic interpretation of the developing brain, targeted management interventions, family counseling and prognostication, and long-term optimization of outcomes. For instance, the care of neurologic injury in congenital heart disease emphasizes the incorporation of medical education across the lifespan. Additionally, neonates requiring NICU admission and care are more likely to require future PICU care and be served by neurocritical care providers. Furthermore, neonates with neurologic injury or at risk for neurologic injury are not exclusively admitted to neonatal units. Education across the age-spectrum inclusive of fetal and neonatal neurology is valuable for trainees in understanding underlying disease processes, management, and sequelae and promotes the growth of the field of pediatric neurocritical care.",Seminars in fetal & neonatal medicine,2024-Nov,"Caligiuri LA, Beslow L, Pardo AC",3,1463,neurology,2025-11-22
37919684,Neurophobia among medical students and resident trainees in a tertiary comprehensive hospital in China.,"Medical students and residents have been revealed to have extraordinary difficulties in managing patients with neurological complaints. However, specific information on Chinese trainees is scarce. Herein, we aimed to uncover the presence of, contributing factors for, and potential solutions to neurophobia among medical students and resident trainees in China. Questionnaires were administered to the medical students of Peking Union Medical College and residents of the Internal Medicine Residency Training Program at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. We asked about perceived difficulty, knowledge, interest, and confidence in neurology in contrast to six other specialties. The reasons why neurology is regarded as difficult and approaches for improving neurological teaching have been appraised. A total of 351 surveys were completed by 218 medical students and 133 residents. The response rate exceeded 70% in both groups. The prevalence of neurophobia was 66.1% and 58.6% among medical students and residents, respectively. Respondents declared that greater difficulty was observed in neurology than in other specialties, and the management of patients with neurological problems was the least comfortable (p < 0.0001). Neurophobia has various perceived causes, and neuroanatomy is regarded as the most important contributor. Nearly 80% of medical students felt that improvements in neurology teaching could be achieved through further integration of preclinical and clinical neurological teaching. The findings of the first survey on neurophobia in China are in accordance with those of previous studies. Neurophobia is highly prevalent in Chinese medical students and residents. Strategies to improve teaching, including enhanced integration of teaching and more online resources, are needed to prevent neurophobia.",BMC medical education,2023-Nov,"Han F, Zhang Y, Wang P, Wu D, Zhou LX, Ni J",6,1829,neurology,2025-11-22
38320220,The Auxiliary to the American Academy of Neurology.,"The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) was founded in 1948, and the Women's Auxiliary to the AAN was founded shortly thereafter. We reviewed historical archives of the AAN and Women's Auxiliary and interviewed past Auxiliary leaders to understand the perception and roles of neurologists' spouses. The Women's Auxiliary to the AAN was originally formed for the wives of neurologist Academy members with the intention of facilitating social and intragroup relationships. The first leaders and members of the organization included some of the spouses of the original Academy founders. With the original scope to provide socialization while the men were at meetings, the male neurologists initially planned much of the Auxiliary's activities. Over time, the Auxiliary's activities shifted and became women-led; engagement in community outreach grew, subcommittees expanded, and the group engaged in supporting the AAN in achieving its goals of improving neurology education and research. The change paralleled the women's movement with educational topics during the Auxiliary's meetings evolving from topics on homemaking to business and understanding neurologic diseases. The Auxiliary was intertwined with the Academy and initiated the S. Weir Mitchell Award and the Founders Award of the AAN in 1955 and 1994 to encourage basic and clinical research in neurology, respectively. In 1982, the Auxiliary requested increased involvement in the scientific programs at the annual meetings. Reflecting societal change, the name was changed to the ""Auxiliary to the AAN"" in the 1970s, and in the mid-1990s to the ""Alliance to the AAN"" to accommodate the increasing number of male partners of neurologists. Based on interviews, the Auxiliary provided engagement, empowerment, and connection between women. The Auxiliary's activities tapered in the late 1990s, in part due to changes in women's occupations, and to the rise of women's membership and leadership within the Academy.",Neurology,2024-Mar,"Badihian N, Christy AL, Boes CJ, Gutmann L, Coon EA",5,1971,neurology,2025-11-22
35851551,"Black Patients Matter in Neurology: Race, Racism, and Race-Based Neurodisparities.","Black people living in the United States suffer disproportionate morbidity and mortality across a wide range of neurologic conditions. Despite common conceptions to the contrary, ""race"" is a socially defined construct with little genetic validity. Therefore, racial health inequities in neurology (""neurodisparities"") are not a consequence of biologic differences between races. Instead, racism and associated social determinants of health are the root of neurodisparities. To date, many neurologists have neglected racism as a root cause of neurologic disease, further perpetuating the problem. Structural racism, largely ignored in current neurologic practice and policy, drives neurodisparities through mediators such as excessive poverty, inferior health insurance, and poorer access to neurologic and preventative care. Interpersonal racism (implicit or explicit) and associated discriminatory practices in neurologic research, workforce advancement, and medical education also exacerbate neurodisparities. Neurologists cannot fulfill their professional and ethical responsibility to care for Black patients without understanding how racism, not biologic race, drives neurodisparities. In our review of race, racism, and race-based disparities in neurology, we highlight the current literature on neurodisparities across a wide range of neurologic conditions and focus on racism as the root cause. We discuss why all neurologists are ethically and professionally obligated to actively promote measures to counteract racism. We conclude with a call for actions that should be implemented by individual neurologists and professional neurologic organizations to mitigate racism and work towards health equity in neurology.",Neurology,2022-Jul,"Robbins NM, Charleston L, Saadi A, Thayer Z, Codrington WU, Landry A, Bernat JL, Hamilton R",8,1724,neurology,2025-11-22
34277931,"An Educational Workshop to Improve Neurology Resident Understanding of Burnout, Substance Abuse, and Mood Disorders.","Burnout, substance abuse, and mood disorders are prevalent among neurology residents. Increased recognition of concerning behaviors might encourage more access to mental health resources and reduce burnout. We created an educational resource reviewing burnout, substance abuse, and mood disorders for neurology residents. This resource included an online module (control) and a role-play scenario offered only to one cohort (intervention). Online surveys assessed knowledge as well as confidence in the ability to recognize concerning behaviors. A practical assessment using a previously published ""Stressed Resident"" video was also conducted among resident cohorts. Of neurology residents, 18 participated in the activity, with nine in the control group and nine in the intervention group. In the postvideo survey, the residents who participated in a role-play activity outperformed a control cohort of their peers when identifying signs of burnout, mood disorders, and substance abuse portrayed in the video (84% vs. 72%; <i>t</i> test, <i>p</i> = .01). Residents indicated increased confidence in the ability to recognize symptoms of maladaptive stress as well as identify resources for themselves and peers. Participants demonstrated no difference in knowledge-based questions scores on pre- and postactivity assessments. Our educational resource improved resident ability to recognize signs of maladaptive stress and to identify residents that are a risk to patient safety. The activity is easy to implement and can be easily adapted outside neurology.

33704439,The computational neurology of movement under active inference.,"We propose a computational neurology of movement based on the convergence of theoretical neurobiology and clinical neurology. A significant development in the former is the idea that we can frame brain function as a process of (active) inference, in which the nervous system makes predictions about its sensory data. These predictions depend upon an implicit predictive (generative) model used by the brain. This means neural dynamics can be framed as generating actions to ensure sensations are consistent with these predictions-and adjusting predictions when they are not. We illustrate the significance of this formulation for clinical neurology by simulating a clinical examination of the motor system using an upper limb coordination task. Specifically, we show how tendon reflexes emerge naturally under the right kind of generative model. Through simulated perturbations, pertaining to prior probabilities of this model's variables, we illustrate the emergence of hyperreflexia and pendular reflexes, reminiscent of neurological lesions in the corticospinal tract and cerebellum. We then turn to the computational lesions causing hypokinesia and deficits of coordination. This in silico lesion-deficit analysis provides an opportunity to revisit classic neurological dichotomies (e.g. pyramidal versus extrapyramidal systems) from the perspective of modern approaches to theoretical neurobiology-and our understanding of the neurocomputational architecture of movement control based on first principles.",Brain : a journal of neurology,2021-Jul,"Parr T, Limanowski J, Rawji V, Friston K",4,1510,neurology,2025-11-22
33005731,Brain Death Determination: An Interprofessional Simulation to Determine Brain Death and Communicate with Families Focused on Neurology Residents.,"Significant variation exists in determining brain death despite an expectation of competence for all neurology residents. In addition, family discussions regarding brain death are challenging and may influence organ donation. We developed two simulations of increasing complexity for PGY 2 and PGY 3 neurology residents. High-fidelity mannequins were used to simulate patients; standardized actors portrayed family members. In the first simulation, residents determined brain death and shared this information with a grieving family. In the second simulation, residents determined brain death in a more complicated scenario, requiring ancillary testing and accurate result interpretation. Following the determination, residents met with a challenging family. The residents worked with an interdisciplinary team and responded to the family's emotions, used active listening skills, and supported the family through next steps. Twelve residents completed the simulations. Prior to the simulation, three (25%) residents felt comfortable discussing a brain death diagnosis; following the simulation, eight (67%) residents felt comfortable/very comfortable discussing brain death. Prior to the simulation, eight (67%) residents stated they knew prerequisites for performing a brain death examination and seven (58%) agreed they knew indications for ancillary testing; these numbers increased to 100% following the simulation. The number of residents who felt comfortable performing the brain death exam increased from five (42%) to 10 (83%). This simulation of determining brain death and leading difficult family meetings was well-received by neurology residents.

We developed a fast, convenient, and accessible 15-minute online module to teach basic concepts of EEG screening using a five-step approach. To assess the efficacy of the module among neurology trainees, three surveys were developed. The EEG module and surveys were distributed to neurology trainees at multiple institutions in the United States. Associations between continuous variables were evaluated using t-test and ANOVA test. A total of 199 residents from 7 different adult neurology residency programs participated in the study. We obtained a response rate of 38% (76/199) for EEG survey 1 and 25% (49/199) for the demographic survey, among junior and senior residents; 22 senior residents completed EEG survey 2. The online EEG module improved confidence when interpreting an EEG among junior residents (1.67 vs. 2.56, p < 0.0001). Senior residents improved their EEG survey score after completing the online module (53.9 vs. 68.6%, p < 0.001). Most of the trainees would recommend the online module to other trainees (93.9%) and would consider including it in an introductory course (93.9%). A brief and accessible online EEG module was easily implemented as an early introduction to EEG screening for junior neurology trainees and to improve EEG screening skills for senior trainees.

This study aimed to evaluate the financial relationships between pharmaceutical companies and authors of Clinical Practice Guideline for Headache Disorders (CPGHD) in Japan. This is a retrospective analysis of 2016-2020 personal payments data disclosed by all pharmaceutical companies affiliated with the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. We examined amounts and fraction of personal payments to all 57 CPGHD authors and all neurologists board-certified by the Japanese Society of Neurology. Payment data was descriptively analyzed at individual author level. Among 57 CPGHD authors, 56 (98.3%) received personal payments totaling $2.7 million from pharmaceutical companies between 2016 and 2020. Median five-year payments were $89,955 for CPGHD authors, while $521 for board-certified neurologists. The CPGHD chairperson and vice chairperson received substantial payments during the guideline development period. Nevertheless, because of less rigorous and transparent COI policy compared to international standard policies, only 10 authors disclosed their financial relationships with the pharmaceutical companies in the guideline. More than 98% of CPGHD authors received much higher personal payments from pharmaceutical companies than those to board-certified neurologists during the guideline development period in Japan.",BMC medical ethics,2024-Oct,"Murayama A, Senoo Y",2,1673,neurology,2025-11-22

A total of 8359 items were found and entered into EndNote, and 2921 duplicates were removed. A blind title and abstract review was performed followed by full-text review in duplicate, with conflicts settled through consensus, to identify 348 articles eligible for data abstraction. Articles presenting primary data about an identified adult SGM population addressing a clinical neurology topic were included. Descriptive statistics were used for abstracted variables. Of 348 studies, 205 (58.9%) were case reports or series, 252 (72.4%) included sexual minority cisgender men, and 247 (70.9%) focused on HIV. An association was found between autism spectrum disorder and gender dysphoria in 9 of 16 studies (56.3%), and a higher risk of ischemic stroke in transgender women was shown in other studies. Literature in neuroinfectious disease, the most common topic, largely focused on HIV (173 of 200 studies [86.5%]). Findings in other neurologic topics were limited by lack of data. In this rigorous compendium of SGM neurology literature, several deficiencies were found: most studies focused on a limited breadth of neurologic pathology, included only a portion of the overall SGM community, and did not assess other aspects of sociodemographic diversity that may contribute to disparities in health care access and outcomes among SGM individuals. Expanding neurologic research to include broader representation of SGM individuals and incorporating sociodemographic factors, like race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, are essential steps toward providing equitable neurologic care for this community.",JAMA neurology,2021-Jun,"Rosendale N, Wong JO, Flatt JD, Whitaker E",4,2112,neurology,2025-11-22

39240130,The history of the European Neurological Society (1986-2014)-10 years later.,"The European Academy of Neurology (EAN) was a merger from two parent societies: the European Neurological Association (ENS, founded in 1986) and the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS, founded in 1987). This article was written by nine former presidents, three of whom were also founders of the ENS, and is based on recollections and documents. It follows up on a review of the ENS history stored in the EAN archive. The first European society (ENS) was founded by eight individual European academic clinician-neuroscientists aiming at joining with other qualified European neuroscientists on an individual membership basis. After 1990 members were also invited from behind the former Iron Curtain. A principal goal was holding neurology meetings (700 participants in 1988 and over 3000 in 2010), promoting collaborative research projects with exchange of junior neuroscientists, and providing teaching and education independent from nationality. Health politics were not part of the agenda. The executive boards (4-year term) were staffed with academic scientists from all subspecialties of neurology. Numerous bursaries and fellowships were established for junior neurologists. The impact of ENS members on research activities of young investigators was appreciated by academia at large. After years of negotiations ENS and EFNS joint efforts resulted in forming the EAN covering all fields of neurology and neuroscience under one roof. The basic principles of the ENS were successfully integrated into the new EAN in particular documented by the number of individual members rising to over 4000 in 2024.",European journal of neurology,2024-Nov,"Toyka KV, Krarup C, Steck A, Said G, Argov Z, van Gijn J, Ferro J, Comi G, Bassetti CLA",9,1623,neurology,2025-11-22

35512836,Point-of-Care Ultrasound in Neurology - Report of the EAN SPN/ESNCH/ERcNsono Neuro-POCUS Working Group.,"In the last decade, ultrasound examination in neurology has been undergoing a significant expansion of its modalities. In parallel, there is an increasing demand for rapid and high-quality diagnostics in various acute diseases in the prehospital setting, the emergency room, intensive care unit, and during surgical or interventional procedures. Due to the growing need for rapid answers to clinical questions, there is particular demand for diagnostic ultrasound imaging. The Neuro-POCUS working group, a joint project by the European Academy of Neurology Scientific Panel Neurosonology, the European Society of Neurosonology and Cerebral Hemodynamics, and the European Reference Centers in Neurosonology (EAN SPN/ESNCH/ERcNsono Neuro-POCUS working group), was given the task of creating a concept for point-of-care ultrasound in neurology called ""Neuro-POCUS"". We introduce here a new ultrasound examination concept called point-of-care ultrasound in neurology (Neuro-POCUS) designed to streamline conclusive imaging outside of the ultrasound center, directly at the bedside. The aim of this study is to encourage neurologists to add quick and disease-oriented Neuro-POCUS to accompany the patient in the critical phase as an adjunct not a substitution for computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or standard comprehensive neurosonology examination. Another goal is to avoid unwanted complications during imaging-free periods, ultimately resulting in advantages for the patient.","Ultraschall in der Medizin (Stuttgart, Germany : 1980)",2022-Aug,"Valaikiene J, Schlachetzki F, Azevedo E, Kaps M, Lochner P, Katsanos AH, Walter U, Baracchini C, Bartels E, Školoudík D",10,1489,neurology,2025-11-22
33640115,"Anglo-French neurological interactions in the 19th and early 20th centuries: Physicians, places and events.","The development of neurology as an independent discipline in the mid-19th century was considerably influenced by the almost simultaneous foundation of the Charcot School at the Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris and the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic and it's School at Queen Square in London in the 1860's. We have reviewed the early interactions between Charcot's school and the leading neurologists at the National Hospital and also discussed their neurological antecedents and subsequent links up to the outbreak of World War 1 in 1914. Earlier interactions involved Trousseau and Duchenne in France and Graves, Todd, Laycock and Allbutt in Britain. The French Brown-Séquard was one of the first two physicians appointed to the National Hospital. Charcot was a frequent visitor to Britain culminating in his influential role in the 1881 International Medical Congress in London. He first suggested the terms ""Parkinson's Disease"" and ""Jacksonian Epilepsy"". He attracted numerous British visitors to Paris and his studies of hysteria were influenced by Laycock, Todd and Russell Reynolds. Hughlings Jackson drew upon the anatomical studies of Gratiolet in his interactions with Broca and Charcot which influenced French views on aphasia, epilepsy and cortical localisation. Ball, an Englishman, was the first Professor of mental and brain diseases in Paris in 1877. Bruce in Edinburgh and Kinnier Wilson in London both maintained frequent contacts with Paris, where the latter first presented his studies of hepatolenticular degeneration in 1912. The Entente Cordiale of 1904 led to further interactions with the leading role of the French and British physicians Raymond and Duckworth. Two outstanding British women, Elizabeth Garrett and Blanche Edwards, qualified in Medicine in Paris with neurological interests. Our review emphasises the constructive influence of the French and British Schools on each other and thus on the development of neurology. The French influence was primarily the establishment of the anatomo-clinical method and the use of photographic illustrations in publications. The British School influence was its Clinical Assessment Skills and scientific studies of newly recognised diseases and concepts and its early development of neurosurgery.",Revue neurologique,2021-Oct,"Broussolle E, Reynolds EH",2,2286,neurology,2025-11-22
35486535,"White Matter, Behavioral Neurology, and the Influence of Corticocentrism.","White matter in the human brain occupies roughly the same volume as gray matter but has received far less attention in behavioral neurology and related disciplines. In particular, the cerebral cortex has long dominated thinking about the organization of brain-behavior relationships. As a result, subcortical structures, including deep gray matter and, most notably, white matter, have been accorded relatively little neuroscientific study compared with the extensive work devoted to the cerebral cortex. The influence of corticocentrism can be explained by several factors, including historical precedent in neurology strongly emphasizing the importance of the cortex, a preponderance of investigative methods that selectively target this structure, and a misinterpretation of comparative neuroanatomic data gathered from normal brains. This paper will describe the background of the corticocentric bias and emphasize that white matter merits its own place within the study of the higher functions. Although corticocentrism continues to exert a powerful impact on behavioral neurology, considerable progress is being made in the study of white matter-a development that promises to expand our knowledge of the normal brain and lead to an improved understanding of how it mediates behavior. In turn, a range of vexing neurologic and psychiatric disorders may become better illuminated by considering pathology within, or dysfunction of, white matter tracts. A complete appreciation of brain-behavior relationships requires an understanding not only of the outermost layer of the cerebral hemispheres, but also of white matter connectivity that links gray matter regions into distributed neural networks that subserve cognition and emotion.",Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,2022-Jun,Filley CM,1,1739,neurology,2025-11-22
33549476,Neurology specialists' visual interpretation of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures: Contemplating their etiology and existing challenges.,"The purpose of this study was to explore how neurology specialists with interest in epilepsy depict psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) and their experience of diagnosing and treating the disorder. An art project was organized as part of the curriculum of the 14th Latin American Summer School on Epilepsy (LASSE) in São Paulo (Brazil) from February 27th to March 6th, 2020. Willing neurologists were invited to draw or paint PNES and present their professional perspective of this disorder. Grouped by common themes, the artworks were analyzed in the context of the existing literature on PNES. The participants created 31 paintings and drawings, 13 of which were selected to represent the recurring themes. Throughout the artworks, neurologists often portrayed PNES as masking the underlying psychological issues, but there was little emphasis on the genesis of PNES itself. The manifestation of PNES was more attributed to just emotional suppression rather than to the influence of different situational factors on a pre-established seizure scaffold. Considering the management of PNES, neurology specialists used the symbol of a labyrinth to represent the difficulties of effectively providing diagnosis and multidisciplinary care for the patients. The general outlook on PNES was associated with darkness, possibly due to limited understanding of the disorder's nature and the unavailability of effective treatment options. Our study shows that art projects can be useful to better grasp neurology specialists' opinions about a certain disorder. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of PNES and help establish multidisciplinary care.",Seizure,2021-Aug,"Mameniškienė R, Puteikis K, Carrizosa-Moog J",3,1661,neurology,2025-11-22

This phenomenon is not restricted to medical students and has never been studied before in the Emergency Department. We aimed to study how resident doctors perceive their knowledge in neurology and urgent neurological conditions as well as possible causes for said fears. Cross-sectional multicentric study using self-administered surveys sent to medical residents within the Aragon Health Service. They were questioned about their fear of neurology and other medical specialties, possible causes, and perception of knowledge in neurological pathologies and subareas in the emergency service. We obtained 134 responses. 27.6% (37) suffered from neurophobia. Despite neurology being considered the most difficult discipline, it did also arouse the third most interest among the students. The areas where they showed the most confidence were headaches and vascular pathology. The areas where they felt the most insecure were neuromuscular diseases, neuro-ophthalmology, and spinal cord injury. In none of the areas surveyed, the percentage of respondents who felt secure exceeded 50%. Neurophobia is prevalent among trainee doctors working in the emergency department. Their confidence correlates with the degree of exposure to patients. Neurologist must play an active role in the education of new specialist and promote the collaboration with emergency departments.",Revista de neurologia,2023-Dec,"Saldaña-Inda I, Cisneros-Gimeno AI, Lambea-Gil A",3,1516,neurology,2025-11-22

In this review, we discuss the basic principles of MR, its myriad applications to research in neurology, and potential pitfalls of injudicious applications. Throughout, we provide examples where MR-informed findings have shed light on long-standing epidemiologic controversies, provided insights into the pathophysiology of neurologic conditions, prioritized drug targets, and informed drug repurposing opportunities. With the ever-expanding availability of genome-wide association data, we project MR to become a key driver of progress in the field of neurology.

35016251,Neuroethics in the Era of Teleneurology.,"The accelerating integration of telehealth technologies in neurology practice has transformed traditional interactions between neurologists and patients, allied clinicians and society. Despite the immense promise of these technologies to improve systems of neurological care, the infusion of telehealth technologies into neurology practice introduces a host of unique ethical challenges. Proactive consideration of the ethical dimensions of teleneurology and of the impact of these innovations on the field of neurology more generally can help to ensure responsible development and deployment across stages of implementation. Toward these ends, this article explores key ethical dimensions of teleneurology practice and policy, presents a normative framework for their consideration, and calls attention to underexplored questions ripe for further study at this evolving nexus of teleneurology and neuroethics. To promote successful and ethically resilient development of teleneurology across diverse contexts, clinicians, organizational leaders, and information technology specialists should work closely with neuroethicists with the common goal of identifying and rigorously assessing the trajectories and potential limits of teleneurology systems.",Seminars in neurology,2022-Feb,Young MJ,1,1250,neurology,2025-11-22

The neurology registrars receive telephone consultations from hospitals and primary care practices in the region. While there have been a number of studies examining inpatient neurology consultations in Irish hospitals [2-6], there is a paucity of data examining the support provided by tertiary referral centres to other acute hospitals and primary care centres in their region. The aim of this study is to define the workload of the neurology registrar with respect to telephone consultations and to examine the quality of these referrals. All calls received from the 19th of October 2021 to the 25th of February 2022 were logged by the receiving registrar. Information collected pertained to the nature of the consult and completeness of the referral. The average volume of calls during the study period was six per week. The median call duration was 8 min. The cumulative time spent resolving outside calls during the study period was at least 41.25 hours. Sixty-three per cent of calls were from other acute hospitals in the region. Thirty-nine per cent of referrals were deemed incomplete with respect to either history, collateral history or examination. This is a necessary service in a system that is not adequately resourced to provide specialist led care in all hospitals.

To evaluate diagnoses and outcomes of all patients newly referred with headache to a consultant neurologist at an Irish university teaching hospital over a 2-year period. A retrospective analysis and audit. Data including patient demographics, red flags, investigations, diagnosis, and outcome were collected on consecutive patients newly referred with headache to a consultant neurologist's outpatient clinic over a 2-year period. Two hundred and seventy patients with headache were seen; 75% were women with mean age of 39 years. 89.26% (241/270) were diagnosed with a primary headache disorder alone; 4.44% (12/270) with a secondary headache disorder alone; 3.33% (9/270) with both a primary and secondary headache disorders; and 2.96% (8/270) with a painful cranial neuropathy. Migraine was the most common diagnosis, frequently associated with medication overuse. Non-attendance rates were high. Although imaging abnormalities were frequently found, on no occasion was it thought to be the cause of the headache. Most patients referred to a neurology outpatient clinic with headache have a primary headache disorder.

32918361,Do you want to perform endovascular therapy? Perspectives from neurology trainees across Europe.,"Endovascular therapy (EVT) has become standard care for acute ischaemic stroke caused by large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation. However, access to this treatment in Europe remains poor. The lack of operators is a contributing factor and there is on-going discussion as to whether other specialists, including neurologists, could contribute to the EVT workforce. The question remains whether the next generation of neurologists want to become 'interventional neurologists'. The aim of this study was to address this question. We conducted a short survey within the National Representatives Network (a division of the Resident and Research Fellow Section, European Academy of Neurology) in order to determine the interest of future neurologists in performing EVT. A total of 1218 responses from 27 European countries were received, with some variation in the number of respondents and results among individual countries. In total, 568 neurology trainees (47%) stated that they would want to be an 'interventional neurologist'. Our findings suggest that neurologists could make a significant contribution to the workforce performing EVT and have important implications for the development and uptake of training programmes in Europe.",European journal of neurology,2020-Dec,"Schreier DR, Di Lorenzo F, Iodice F, Shribman S",4,1243,neurology,2025-11-22
38631360,Neurology Training and Medical Education in Resource-Limited Settings: Building and Growing the First Neurology Residency Program in East Africa.,"The burden of neurological disease disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries, where the lowest number of neurologists are located. Building local training opportunities in resource-limited settings is a foundational step to enhancing the neurological workforce and improving access to neurological care in these regions. In this article, we describe the development and growth of the first neurology residency program in East Africa, which was established in 2006 at Zewditu Memorial Hospital and the Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia. We highlight the impact of the program on clinical care, research, collaborations between neurologists across Ethiopia, and ways to build educational opportunities and mentorship while faced with limited resources. The main challenges in starting the residency program included lack of faculty with neurological expertise, lack of a precedent for subspecialty training in our setting, as well as limited resources and space. The formation of sustainable international collaborations with clinicians at established institutions in high-income countries and neurological societies has been a major source of support in developing the initial infrastructure, curriculum and educational content, knowledge assessments, and mentored research projects. Local partnerships with related medical specialties, including internal medicine, critical care, neurological surgery, and psychiatry, were also instrumental in creating training opportunities. As the program continues to evolve, many challenges remain, including limited diagnostics, lack of access to advanced treatment modalities, lack of fellowship training opportunities in various neurological subspecialties, and insufficient training and experience in scientific writing. Despite these challenges, the residency program has persevered and its creation resulted in many positive changes: since its inception in 2006, we graduated 80 neurologists and the number of practicing neurologists in Ethiopia has increased from 5 to 78, our institution has evolved into a national referral center for neurology, graduates have published 61 articles in the past 3 years and contributed to international neurology research, and alumni of the program have grown the Association of Ethiopian Neurologists. Future directions include development of fellowship opportunities, creation of international rotations, and implementation of teleneurology to further strengthen neurological care across Ethiopia.",Seminars in neurology,2024-Apr,"Belay HD, Gebrewold MA, Ayele BA, Oda DM, Kelemu FT, Zewde YZ, Melkamu SK, Wuhib MZ, Gugssa SA, Mengesha AT, Metaferia GZ",11,2532,neurology,2025-11-22

However, the decisions of disciplinary tribunals are not sufficiently analysed to identify the learning elements. This study aimed to investigate the frequency and nature of complaints for the specialty neurology which were upheld by the disciplinary tribunals and to learn from disciplinary law through an analysis of which factors contributed to complaints being upheld. This is a retrospective, observational study. All upheld complaints in the field of neurology were collected for the period of January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2020. A qualitative analysis of the decisions was conducted using the usual characteristics set out by disciplinary tribunals in their annual reports. The relevant factors which potentially played a role in the complaint being upheld were identified for more detailed analysis. In the 10-year period, a complaint was submitted to the disciplinary tribunals against 299 neurologists. Forty-four complaints were upheld (15%). The most common sanction was a warning (70%). A large majority of cases were directly related to patient care, such as decisions about the patient's diagnosis and the treatment. Recordkeeping (50%), interpretation and discussion of imaging (30%), and involvement of several consultants of one or more specialties (34%) frequently played a role in the successful complaints. Medical disciplinary cases in the field of neurology are usually about diagnosis- and treatment-related aspects.

38826082,Education needs in palliative care and advance care planning of Italian residents in neurology: an online survey.,"Most neurological diseases have a chronic and progressive clinical course, with patients living for extended periods with complex healthcare needs. Evidence from other countries suggests that palliative care (PC) is insufficiently integrated in the care of these patients. This study aims to identify PC and advance care planning (ACP) knowledge and the perceived preparedness of Italian residents in neurology. This is a cross-sectional online survey of physicians attending the 36 Italian neurology residency programmes. Of 854 residents, 188 (22%) participated. Their mean age was 28.4 ± 2.0 years; 49% were women; 45% were from the north, 23% from the centre and 32% from the south of Italy. Few residents (6%) reported that a teaching course in PC was part of the graduate programme, and 3% of the postgraduate programme. During their residency, 9% of participants received PC training, and 18% ACP training. Only 13% reported to have participated in the ACP process, half within their neurology residency programme. Residents considered PC support very/extremely important in all the pre-specified clinical situations, with values ranging between 78% and 96%. Over 70% of residents revealed education needs, particularly concerning ACP. Our data confirm the need for improving PC training in the graduate and postgraduate curriculum. This, together with collaboration and joint training of neurology and PC, is essential to improve the quality and continuity of care and respond to the complex needs of people with neurological disorders causing severe disability.",European journal of neurology,2024-Sep,"Bombaci A, Di Lorenzo F, Pucci E, Solari A, Veronese S",5,1570,neurology,2025-11-22

Edward Hun (1842-1880) and the beginnings of neurological research in nineteenth-century America.","Edward Reynolds Hun is easily eclipsed by his father, Thomas (1808-1896), and his younger brother, Henry (1854-1924), in historical accounts of the evolution of neurology as a clinical specialty and academic discipline in nineteenth-century America. His early educational pathway, including a postgraduate year in Paris, was typical for sons of the wealthy seeking a medical degree. On his return from Europe, he embarked on a research career in neuropsychiatry seeking to uncover biochemical and pathological underpinnings for psychiatric disorders. In addition to standard postmortem examinations, he used the most up-to-date technological advances such as sphygmography. He was also one of the first Americans to publish photomicrographs of muscle obtained by biopsy. In his mid-30s he became a charter member of the American Neurological Association and was appointed professor of diseases of the nervous system at Albany Medical College. His health then rapidly deteriorated, leading to his early death at age 37 of an unclear neurologic disorder. His career intersected with those of other notables in late-nineteenth-century American neurology, including John P. Gray, William A.

37414714,Precision or narrative medicine? Child neurology needs both!,"Precision medicine aims to understand the mechanisms of diseases and to find treatments adapted to each individual or group of patients, on the basis of biological characteristics and environment. It uses new tools based on digital technologies. Narrative medicine was theorized, in the 2000s, as a reaction to the increasing technicality and the notion of a lack of human relations in care: It focuses on recognizing the essential place of the patient's experience of illness and life history in the diagnosis and management of diseases as well as in the training of caregivers. These two opposite currents are rarely considered together. In fact, they have in common the basic principle that each patient is unique, and both are often more closely intertwined than we think, especially in the field of child neurology. Five case histories and discussions presented here aim to demonstrate that combining the precision approach with the narrative approach can improve the diagnosis, treatment, classification, and understanding of neurological conditions, as well as enhance the dialog with families and make teaching more meaningful. Not only rare diseases but common problems, such as paroxysmal events, pain, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder, are addressed from both perspectives.",Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie,2023-Aug,Roulet Perez E,1,1315,neurology,2025-11-22

38759131,Implications of Large Language Models for Quality and Efficiency of Neurologic Care: Emerging Issues in Neurology.,"Large language models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems that excel in recognizing and generating human-like language, possibly serving as valuable tools for neurology-related information tasks. Although LLMs have shown remarkable potential in various areas, their performance in the dynamic environment of daily clinical practice remains uncertain. This article outlines multiple limitations and challenges of using LLMs in clinical settings that need to be addressed, including limited clinical reasoning, variable reliability and accuracy, reproducibility bias, self-serving bias, sponsorship bias, and potential for exacerbating health care disparities. These challenges are further compounded by practical business considerations and infrastructure requirements, including associated costs. To overcome these hurdles and harness the potential of LLMs effectively, this article includes considerations for health care organizations, researchers, and neurologists contemplating the use of LLMs in clinical practice. It is essential for health care organizations to cultivate a culture that welcomes AI solutions and aligns them seamlessly with health care operations. Clear objectives and business plans should guide the selection of AI solutions, ensuring they meet organizational needs and budget considerations. Engaging both clinical and nonclinical stakeholders can help secure necessary resources, foster trust, and ensure the long-term sustainability of AI implementations. Testing, validation, training, and ongoing monitoring are pivotal for successful integration. For neurologists, safeguarding patient data privacy is paramount. Seeking guidance from institutional information technology resources for informed, compliant decisions, and remaining vigilant against biases in LLM outputs are essential practices in responsible and unbiased utilization of AI tools. In research, obtaining institutional review board approval is crucial when dealing with patient data, even if deidentified, to ensure ethical use. Compliance with established guidelines like SPIRIT-AI, MI-CLAIM, and CONSORT-AI is necessary to maintain consistency and mitigate biases in AI research. In summary, the integration of LLMs into clinical neurology offers immense promise while presenting formidable challenges. Awareness of these considerations is vital for harnessing the potential of AI in neurologic care effectively and enhancing patient care quality and safety. The article serves as a guide for health care organizations, researchers, and neurologists navigating this transformative landscape.",Neurology,2024-Jun,"Moura L, Jones DT, Sheikh IS, Murphy S, Kalfin M, Kummer BR, Weathers AL, Grinspan ZM, Silsbee HM, Jones LK, Patel AD",11,2611,neurology,2025-11-22
39047511,Assessing the influence of neurology Residency's social media presence on Applicants' decision to apply to US residency training programs.,"The COVID-19 pandemic extensively changed the United States residency application process, including transitioning interviews from in-person to virtually. This study aims to determine the effect of a neurology residency programs' social media presence on applicants and to identify aspects of the program's social media profile influencing students' decisions to apply. This is an observational cross-sectional study of neurology residency applicants utilizing a 10-question survey distributed from October 2022 to March 2023. 115/176 (65%) applicants participated. Statistical tests were performed using SPSS Statistics. Categorical variables were presented as percentages of the total group. Categorical Likert Scale responses were assigned numerical values from one to five and presented as means. Most participants (87.8%) used social media to learn about neurology residency programs. Most participants (52.5) used both Instagram and X (formerly Twitter). Prominent factors affecting program selection were the number of posts and format, layout, or aesthetics of the social media profile. The most influential posts pertained to program culture, with the least influential posts highlighting specific residents. Social media presence had a small-moderate effect on selecting programs for application, and a small effect on ranking programs. Overall, social media profiles have a small to moderate impact on the decision to apply to a specific neurology program, with less effect on the ranking process. These findings can assist residency programs in tailoring social media presence to better align with the preferences of applicants.",Journal of the neurological sciences,2024-Aug,"Reyes CZ, Laswi I, Rehim E, Yacoub HA, Leary MC",5,1640,neurology,2025-11-22

39393031,Using Multilevel Models and Generalized Estimating Equation Models to Account for Clustering in Neurology Clinical Research.,"In clinical and health services research, clustered data (also known as data with a multilevel or hierarchical structure) are frequently encountered. For example, patients may be clustered or nested within hospitals. Understanding when data have a multilevel structure is important because clustering of individuals can induce a homogeneity in outcomes within clusters, so that, even after adjusting for measured covariates, outcomes for 2 individuals in the same cluster are more likely to be similar than outcomes for 2 individuals from different clusters. Using conventional statistical regression models to analyze clustered data can result in incorrect conclusions being drawn. In particular, estimated CIs may be artificially narrow, and significance levels may be artificially low. As a result, one may conclude that there is a statistically significant association when there is none. To avoid this problem, investigators should ensure that their analyses use techniques that account for clustering of data. Generalized linear models estimated using generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods and multilevel regression models (also known as hierarchical regression models, mixed-effects models, or random-effects models) are two such techniques. We provide an introduction to clustered or multilevel data and describe how GEE models or multilevel models can be used for the analysis of multilevel data.",Neurology,2024-Nov,"Austin PC, Kapral MK, Vyas MV, Fang J, Yu AYX",5,1413,neurology,2025-11-22
32756266,Gender Disparity and Potential Strategies for Improvement in Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology.,"Discrimination in the workplace when documented is illegal but is seen to still exist in some forms whether based on culture, race, or gender. Each of these disparities warrants further discussion and study because of their significant impacts on hiring decisions, career advancement, and compensation. In this article, the authors have focused their attention on gender disparity in the fields of neurology and clinical neurophysiology and shared the data currently available to them. At a time when the field of clinical neurophysiology has seen enormous growth, gender disparity in leadership and compensation remain. Despite the increasing number of women entering the fields of neurology and clinical neurophysiology, women remain underrepresented in national leadership positions. Many women physicians report experiencing gender discrimination despite increasing efforts by universities and medical centers to improve inclusivity and diversity. Equity and inclusivity are not the same and there is a disconnect between the increased numbers of women and their shared experiences in the workplace. Implicit bias undermines the ability of women to advance in their careers. For neurologists, data indicate that the latest gender pay gap is $56,000 (24%), increased from $37,000 in 2015, and is one of the largest pay gaps in any medical specialty. One third of the top 12 medical schools in the United States require that maternity leave be taken through disability coverage and/or sick benefits, and most family leave policies constrain benefits to the discretion of departmental leadership. The authors recommend strategies to improve gender disparity include institutional training to Identify and overcome biases, changes to professional organizations and national scientific meeting structure, transparency in academic hiring, promotion and compensation, and mentorship and sponsorship programs.",Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,2020-Sep,"Galloway G, Schmitt S, Herman ST, La Roche S",4,1905,neurology,2025-11-22

For patients whose neurologic problems began in childhood, there is often a lack of organized multidisciplinary care with the desired neurologic expertise in the adult setting. This monograph highlights those difficulties, reviewing disease-specific instances of the problems with transition from pediatric to adult neurologic care. The use of an arbitrary chronologic age cutoff for transition from pediatric to adult expertise in specific disease state may be a disservice in provision of care, and the disease-specific expertise of providers may outweigh the benefit of an age-related provider focus.",Neurologic clinics,2021-Feb,"Schnitzler ER, Schneck MJ",2,688,neurology,2025-11-22
34077587,"Awakening to sleep disorders in Europe: Survey on education, knowledge and treatment competence of European residents and neurologists.","Sleep-wake disorders are common in the general population and in most neurological disorders but are often poorly recognized. With the hypothesis that neurologists do not get sufficient training during their residency, the Young European Sleep Neurologist Association (YESNA) of the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) performed a survey on postgraduate sleep education. A 16-item questionnaire was developed and distributed among neurologists and residents across European countries. Questions assessed demographic, training and learning preferences in sleep disorders, as well as a self-evaluation of knowledge based on five basic multiple-choice questions (MCQs) on sleep-wake disorders. The questionnaire was completed by 568 participants from 20 European countries. The mean age of participants was 31.9 years (SD 7.4 years) and was composed mostly of residents (73%). Three-quarters of the participants reported undergraduate training in sleep medicine, while fewer than 60% did not receive any training on sleep disorders during their residencies. Almost half of the participants (45%) did not feel prepared to treat neurological patients with sleep problems. Only one-third of the participants correctly answered at least three MCQs. Notably, 80% of participants favoured more education on sleep-wake disorders during the neurology residency. Education and knowledge on disorders in European neurological residents is generally insufficient, despite a strong interest in the topic.

Several dose monitoring software like radiation dose monitor (RDM) were developed to estimate the patient skin dose (PSD) distribution in IR. This study benchmarked the accuracy of RDM software in estimating PSD as compared to GafChromic film baseline in-vivo measurements on patients during cardiac, abdominal, and neurology IR procedures. The prospective study conducted in four IR departments included 81 IR procedures (25 cardiac, 31 abdominal, and 25 neurology procedures) on three angiographic systems. PSD and field geometry were measured by placing GafChromic film under the patient's back. Statistical analyses were performed to compare the software estimation and film measurement results in terms of PSD and geometric accuracy. Median values of measured/calculated PSD were 1140/1005, 591/655.9, and 538/409.7 mGy for neurology, cardiac, and abdominal procedures, respectively. For all angiographic systems, the median (InterQuartile Range, IQR) difference between calculated and measured PSD was -10.2% (-21.8%-5.7%) for neurology, -4.5% (-19.5%-15.5%) for cardiac, and -21.9% (-38.7%--3.6%) for abdominal IR procedures. These differences were not significant for all procedures (p > 0.05). Discrepancies increased up to -82% in lower dose regions where the measurement uncertainties are higher. Regarding the geometric accuracy, RDM correctly reproduced the skin dose map and estimated PSD area dimensions closely matched those registered on films with a median (IQR) difference of 0 cm (-1-0.8 cm). RDM is proved to be a useful solution for the estimation of PSD and skin dose distribution during abdominal, cardiac and neurology IR procedures despite a geometry phantom which is not specific to the latter type of IR procedures.",Medical physics,2024-May,"Hadid-Beurrier L, Geryes BH, Jean-Pierre A, Gaudin PA, Feghali JA",5,1854,neurology,2025-11-22

We describe characteristics of registry participants and the performance of neurology providers on 20 of the 2019 Axon Registry quality measures. From the distribution of providers' scores on a quality measure, we calculate the median performance for each quality measure. We test for associations between quality measure performance, provider characteristics, and intrinsic measure parameters. There were 948 neurology providers who contributed a total of 6,480 provider-metric observations. Overall, the average quality measure performance score at the provider level was 66 (median 77). At the measure level (n = 20), the average quality measure performance score was 53 (median 55) with a range of 2 to 100 (interquartile range 20-91). Measures with a lower-complexity category (e.g., discrete orders, singular concepts) or developed through the specialty's qualified clinical data registry pathway had higher performance distributions. There was no difference in performance between Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) and non-MIPS providers. There was no association between quality measure performance and practice size, measure clinical topic/neurologic condition, or measure year of entry. This cross-sectional assessment of quality measure performance in 2019 Axon Registry data demonstrates modest performance scores and considerable variability across measures and providers. More complex measures were associated with lower performance. These findings serve as a baseline assessment of quality of ambulatory neurologic care in the United States and provide insights into future measure design.",Neurology,2021-Aug,"Wilson AM, Benish SM, McCarthy L, Romano JG, Lundgren KB, Byrne M, Schierman B, Jones LK",8,1745,neurology,2025-11-22

33965794,Diversity in neurology leadership: Nuances and nudges.,"Underrepresented in medicine (UIM) academic physicians are poorly represented among medical school faculty when compared with their proportion in the US population, receive NIH research awards less frequently, are promoted less often, indicate lower career satisfaction, and report higher social isolation, than faculty who are not under-represented. Supporting a successful and sustainable workforce of UIM academic physicians is essential in neurology, because such neurologists are more likely to engage in research to reduce disparities in neurological outcomes that affect underserved and/or low-income communities, and help improve the paucity of diverse race-ethnic participation in clinical trials. Having more diverse academic neurologists serve in such roles could bolster their careers and model possibilities for others who share similar cultures and backgrounds. Beyond leading/joining diversity affairs committees, more UIM are needed in mainstream leadership roles. In this work, we explore self-application vs. appointment/nomination opportunities and how this play a role in leadership opportunities. In addition to considering appropriate weighing of self-applications vs. appointments based opportunities, we highlight approaches and introduce the concept of nudging. Nudging, which refers to purposely increasing the visibility and appeal of particular items with the goal of boosting the odds of selecting those items, has been shown to successfully influence the process of selection, and may help level the leadership playing field for UIM in neurology.",Journal of the neurological sciences,2021-Jul,"Charleston L, Ovbiagele B",2,1576,neurology,2025-11-22

A student of Pierre Bretonneau (1778-1862), the famous physician from the western French city of Tours, Trousseau carried forward Bretonneau's clinical description of infectious diseases, developing the notion of their contagion and paving the way toward the discovery of their microbial aetiology by Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) at the end of the century. His teachings, Les Leçons cliniques de l'Hôtel-Dieu, transcribed by his students, played a role in training young physicians for half a century. In this work, Trousseau covered several neurological diseases such as apoplexy, epilepsy, chorea, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The rich, Balzac-like detail of his clinical pictures would be unthinkable today. While he cannot be credited with any seminal descriptions in particular, some of his observations contain significant nuggets, such as a case of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, twenty years before the seminal publication. After a biographical account, we will present the main lessons given by Trousseau on neurological subjects. One of Trousseau's little-known contributions is to have invited Guillaume Duchenne de Boulogne (1806-1875) to his department at the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, setting Duchenne on the path to becoming a pioneer of Parisian neurology.",Revue neurologique,2020-Sep,Walusinski O,1,1525,neurology,2025-11-22

This study aimed to determine the prevalence, characteristics and severity ratings of DRPs and identify factors associated with the occurrence of DRPs in the neurology unit of a tertiary care and academic teaching hospital in China. A retrospective study of DRPs and pharmacists' interventions for neurology patients was performed during a non-consecutive 24-month study period. Patient demographics and clinical characteristics, and pharmacist's intervention records were collected. The characteristics and severity ratings of DRPs were categorized using the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE) DRP classification tool V9.00 and the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC-MERP) classification respectively. A total of 242 DRPs were detected for 974 admitted patients, an average of 0.25 DRPs per patient. Treatment safety was the major type of DRPs (106;43.8%) followed by treatment effectiveness (78;32.2%). The primary causes of DRPs were drug selection (124;44.1%) and dose selection (92;32.7%). Clinical pharmacists provided 525 interventions, and most interventions occurred at the prescriber level (241;45.9%). A total of 91.4% of these interventions were accepted, contributing to solving 93.0% of the identified problems. The majority of DRPs (210;86.8%) were rated at severity categories B to D (causing no patient harm). Multiple logistic regression showed that creatinine clearance, number of medications used, nasogastric feeding, diabetes, and infectious diseases were associated with more frequent DRPs (p < 0.05). DRPs are relatively common in the neurology unit in China, with primary causes of drug and dose selection, and clinical pharmacists can effectively reduce and prevent DRPs to optimize medication therapy.",BMC pharmacology & toxicology,2021-Oct,"Liu P, Li G, Han M, Zhang C",4,1946,neurology,2025-11-22

However, examination of the ocular fundus with a direct ophthalmoscope is often difficult. Nonmydriatic ocular fundus photography allows direct visualization of the ocular fundus with high-quality photographs. We used nonmydriatic ocular fundus photography to improve patient care and funduscopy skills of residents in the Neurology Resident Clinic. At the time of triage, funduscopic photographs of all new neurology resident clinic patients were taken. The images were imported into the hospital's imaging software. The residents completed a full neurologic examination, including a funduscopic examination with a handheld ophthalmoscope. At the time of staffing the patients with the attendings, the residents received immediate feedback and teaching on retina photograph evaluation. A total of 255 patients were enrolled. Of those, 230 (90%) had at least one high-quality funduscopic photograph. Retinal photographs were normal in 161 (70%). Out of the 69 abnormal photographs, only 7% of abnormalities were detected by the residents. Ninety-three percent of residents found the retinal photographs useful. Nonmydriatic ocular fundus photography improved the care in patients presenting to a Neurology resident clinic and facilitated residents in recognizing funduscopic findings. Its benefits are clear when one considers (1) the high risk of negative patient outcomes and possible medicolegal consequences due to missed findings, (2) the ease of incorporating retinal photographs into the patients' medical records, and (3) the benefit of improving resident education in regard to the ophthalmologic examination.",Journal of neuro-ophthalmology : the official journal of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society,2022-Mar,"Pyatka N, Banks MK, Fotedar N, DeLozier SJ, Morgan M, Preston DC",6,1703,neurology,2025-11-22
33523320,Clinical activity changes in the neurology department of Wenzhou during the COVID-19 pandemic: an observational analysis.,"To explore the activity changes in neurology clinical practice that have occurred in tertiary public hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Outpatient and inpatient data from the neurology department were extracted from the electronic medical record system of three tertiary Grade A hospitals in Wenzhou. Data were analyzed across 5 months following the beginning of the pandemic (from January 13 to May 17) and compared with the same period in 2019. Data on reperfusion therapy for acute infarction stroke were extracted monthly from January to April. The number of outpatients declined from 102,300 in 2019 to 75,154 in 2020 (26.54%), while the number of inpatients in the three tertiary Grade A hospitals decreased from 4641 to 3437 (25.94%). The latter trend showed a significant drop from the 3rd week to the 7th week. The number of patients in these hospitals decreased significantly, and a significant drop was seen in the neurology department. As usual, stroke was the most common disease observed; however, anxiety/depression and insomnia increased dramatically in the outpatient consultation department. The results of our study revealed the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the clinical practice of neurology in Wenzhou during the outbreak. Understanding the pandemic's trends and impact on neurological patients and health systems will allow for better preparation of neurologists in the future.",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2021-May,"Cao YG, Li Y, Shen J, Shao MM, Lin XD, Zhu JJ, Huang XY, Cheng ZC, Yan JY, Chen KY",10,1411,neurology,2025-11-22
32385187,Training in neurology: Flexibility and adaptability of a neurology training program at the epicenter of COVID-19.,"To outline changes made to a neurology residency program in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In early March 2020, the first cases of COVID-19 were announced in the United States. New York City quickly became the epicenter of a global pandemic, and our training program needed to rapidly adapt to the increasing number of inpatient cases while being mindful of protecting providers and continuing education. Many of these changes unfolded over days, including removing residents from outpatient services, minimizing the number of residents on inpatient services, deploying residents to medicine services and medical intensive care units, converting continuity clinic patient visits to virtual options, transforming didactics to online platforms only, and maintaining connectedness in an era of social distancing. We have been able to accomplish this through daily virtual meetings among leadership, faculty, and residents. Over time, our program has successfully rolled out initiatives to service the growing number of COVID-related inpatients while maintaining neurologic care for those in need and continuing our neurologic education curriculum. It has been necessary and feasible for our residency training program to undergo rapid structural changes to adapt to a medical crisis. The key ingredients in doing this successfully have been flexibility and teamwork. We suspect that many of the implemented changes will persist long after the COVID-19 crisis has passed and will change the approach to neurologic and medical training.",Neurology,2020-Jun,"Agarwal S, Sabadia S, Abou-Fayssal N, Kurzweil A, Balcer LJ, Galetta SL",6,1549,neurology,2025-11-22
37261329,Interprofessional Education on the Neurology Clerkship for Physical Therapy and Medical Students.,"Globally, neurological disorders make up the second most common cause of death and are the leading cause of years lived with disability. Because neurological patients often require multidisciplinary care and future professionals will encounter increasing demands for neurological care, it is important to emphasize education on the interaction between physical therapy (PT) and neurology. Yet there is a dearth of interprofessional education (IPE) learning activities that include neurology clerkship students and physical therapists. We created a 4-hour IPE experience that incorporated hospitalized patients with neurological disorders who were examined at the bedside by pairs of second- and third-year PT students and second- and third-year medical students, followed by a debriefing. Participants completed the Self-Efficacy for Interprofessional Experiential Learning (SEIEL) survey before and after the session. Significant pre/post improvements were seen for SEIEL total and domain scores (<i>n</i> = 75, <i>p</i> < .001). Qualitative comments were analyzed; major themes that emerged included a greater appreciation for the other discipline. Students felt the IPE activity was a great learning opportunity to understand roles and responsibilities and communicate with the other discipline. Students noted significant increases in their ability to understand and explain the importance of interprofessional communication and in their capabilities as health care professionals to work together on an interprofessional collaborative team. This clinical IPE experience can be seamlessly incorporated into the workplace for medical and PT students. IPE activities like this should be encouraged and developed to reach more students and other health care providers.",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,2023-,"Kung D, Brewer W, Oyelami V, Hessel S, Bramlett L, Gill A",6,1768,neurology,2025-11-22
33460255,Improved care and management of paediatric neurological patients evaluated at a paediatric Rapid Access Neurology clinic: A pilot study.,"Referral wait times for paediatric neurological patients are increasing, leading to an increased burden on the emergency department (ED). The paediatric Rapid Access Neurology (pRAN) clinic was created for paediatric patients who are clinically stable, but require an urgent paediatric neurology consultation. The objectives were to evaluate the pathways of referral, accuracy of referring diagnoses, adherence to clinic appointments, impact of clinic visitation on ED visits and patient satisfaction. Data were collected from the pRAN clinic from March 2018 until April 2019. Information was obtained from patient charts including the referring and final diagnosis, management plan and the number of visits made to the ED before and after visiting the pRAN clinic. Of the 256 referred patients, 91 met inclusion criteria. The most frequent referral diagnosis was a seizure. Referring physicians and pRAN clinic neurologists differed significantly in the level of diagnostic agreement for patients <2 years of age (P = 0.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.294, 0.373). There was a significant reduction in visits to the ED made by patients 3 months after the pRAN appointment compared with before the visit (P < 0.001; 95% CI -0.9070, -0.4088). The majority of patients felt that the clinic had high value and were satisfied with their follow-up plan. This pilot study showed that a pRAN clinic can improve the accuracy of neurological diagnoses and management, especially for children <2 years of age. In addition, pRAN clinic patients make fewer subsequent visits to the ED and express high satisfaction with their care.",Journal of paediatrics and child health,2021-Jun,"Yaworski AM, Yager JY, Richer L, Mailo J, Rajapakse T, Kassiri J",6,1623,neurology,2025-11-22

We used the integrated floating catchment area (iFCA) method to analyze spatial accessibility of general inpatient care (internal medicine, surgery and neurology) on national level in Germany determining an accessibility index (AI) by integrating distances, hospital beds and morbidity data. The analysis of 358 million distances between hospitals and population locations revealed clusters of lower accessibility indices in areas in north east Germany. There was a correlation of urbanity and accessibility up to r = 0.31 (p < 0.001). Furthermore, 10% of the population lived in areas with significant clusters of low spatial accessibility for internal medicine and surgery (neurology: 20%). The analysis revealed the highest accessibility for heart failure (AI = 7.33) and the lowest accessibility for stroke (AI = 0.69). The method applied proofed to reveal important aspects of spatial accessibility i.e. geographic variations that need to be addressed. However, for the majority of the German population, accessibility of general inpatient care was either high or at least not significantly low, which suggests rather adequate allocation of hospital resources for most parts of Germany.",Scientific reports,2020-Nov,"Bauer J, Klingelhöfer D, Maier W, Schwettmann L, Groneberg DA",5,1377,neurology,2025-11-22

Signature Pedagogy in Continuous Electroencephalography Teaching.,"Electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly used in neurology, but there is variability in how neurologists interpret EEGs, potentially from variability in EEG teaching. Little is known about how EEG teaching is done to prepare neurologists for professional practice. We interviewed a group of EEG experts to characterize their teaching practices around continuous EEG (cEEG). We used signature pedagogy as a framework to analyze and interpret the data. We identified pervasive and characteristic forms of cEEG teaching. Teaching is based on apprenticeship, relying on ""learning by doing"" in the context of real-life clinical practice. There are habitual steps that learners take to anchor teaching, which typically occurs during rounds. There is a common language and core knowledge that trainees need to master early in their training. There are pervasive characteristic forms of cEEG teaching. These findings can help facilitate instructional design and implementation of complementary or enhanced cEEG teaching practices.",Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,2025-Jan,"Fernandez A, Asoodar M, van Kranen-Mastenbroek V, Majoie M, Balmer D",5,1022,neurology,2025-11-22

38842035,Islands and Neurology: An Exploration into a Unique Association.,"The current study investigates the intricate connection between neurology and islands shedding light on the historical, epidemiological, and genetic aspects. Based on an elaborate literature review, we identified neurological conditions having a significant clustering in an island(s), confined to a particular island(s), named after an island, and described first in an island. The genetic factors played a crucial role, uncovering disorders like Cayman ataxia, Machado Joseph disease, SGCE-mediated dystonia-myoclonus syndrome, X-linked dystonia parkinsonism, hereditary transthyretinrelated amyloidosis, Charcot Marie Tooth 4F, and progressive myoclonic epilepsy syndromes, that exhibited remarkable clustering in diverse islands. Local customs also left enduring imprints. Practices such as cannibalism in Papua New Guinea led to Kuru, while cycad seed consumption in Guam triggered Lytico-Bodig disease. Toxin-mediated neurologic disorders exhibited intricate island connections, exemplified by Minamata disease in Kyushu islands and atypical parkinsonism in French Caribbean islands. Additionally, the Cuban epidemic of amblyopia and neuropathy was associated with severe nutritional deficiencies. This study pioneers a comprehensive review narrating the genetic, environmental, and cultural factors highlighting the spectrum of neurological disorders in island settings. It enriches the medical literature with a unique understanding of the diverse influences shaping neurological health in island environments.","The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry",2025-Aug,"Dhar D, Mm S, Parvin N, Dey T, Pal A, Pal PK",6,1518,neurology,2025-11-22
38996380,Charcot and Léon Daudet: A missed love story?,"Biographies, articles, and meetings devoted to the founder of modern neurology, Jean-Martin Charcot, are typically dithyrambic, if not hagiographic. It seems that the striking professional and familial qualities of Charcot have erased any other characteristic of the person, and scratches on the Master image commonly have not been well accepted. With this in mind, it is interesting to present and evaluate the rather negative opinions on Charcot by the famous French writer Léon Daudet, who initially was very close to the Charcots through his father, Alphonse Daudet, and who wrote rather extensively on Charcot in his diary and memoirs. Our point is not to underline these writings as the ""truth"" about Charcot's personality and life (Daudet, who was a prominent extreme right-wing figure, was known to exaggerate and play with his sharp opinions), but Daudet's criticisms paradoxically provide a fascinating perspective, which may help to reconstruct better who Charcot really was in counterbalancing a bit the overcrowded, politically correct, praising group.",Journal of the history of the neurosciences,2025-,"Bogousslavsky J, Tatu L",2,1065,neurology,2025-11-22

Diagnosis of catatonia is important because the condition can be reversible and is associated with severe complications. This study aims to screen patients with catatonia admitted to a university hospital's psychiatry and neurology services, examine their characteristics, and compare the coverage of different catatonia scales. During a consecutive 20 months study period, the Turkish adaptations of the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating and the KANNER scales were administered in psychiatry and neurology inpatient units and patients on the waiting list for psychiatric hospitalization. The participants were also evaluated with DSM-5 criteria. In addition, the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the patients in the psychiatric group were compared. A total of 214 patients were evaluated. Twenty-eight (13.1%) screened positive for catatonia, and 23 (82.1%) were diagnosed with catatonia according to DSM-5 criteria. KANNER and Bush- Francis identified the same patients as having catatonia. In addition to schizophrenia and mood disorders; neurodevelopmental disorder, encephalitis, postpartum psychosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, delirium, cerebrovascular disease, functional neurological symptom disorder have also been found to be associated with catatonia. The most common complication was urinary tract infection. Life-threatening complications were also observed. Overlooking catatonia may have dire consequences. Adhering solely to the DSM-5 criteria may miss some patients with catatonia.

Recent studies have described the prevalence Charles Bonnet syndrome and questioned its lack of association with cognitive impairment, used advanced neuroimaging to show that disinhibition of the occipital lobe is involved in the pathogenesis of visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, and demonstrated that visual impairment because of eye disease is a consistent risk factor for visual hallucinations across a number of different neurodegenerative disease populations. Through connections between the primary visual cortex and other brain structures, visual function is closely tied to visual hallucinations. Given that the vast majority of vision loss is caused by ophthalmic disease, much of which is preventable or treatable, the detection and treatment of vision loss in at-risk populations may reduce the burden and consequences of visual hallucinations in older adults.",Current opinion in neurology,2021-Feb,Hamedani AG,1,1126,neurology,2025-11-22
36795882,Diagnostic Ultrasonography in Neurology.,"Ultrasonography allows neurologists to complement clinical information with additional useful, easily acquired, real-time data. This article highlights its clinical applications in neurology. Diagnostic ultrasonography is expanding its applications with smaller and better devices. Most indications in neurology relate to cerebrovascular evaluations. Ultrasonography contributes to the etiologic evaluation and is helpful for hemodynamic diagnosis of brain or eye ischemia. It can accurately characterize cervical vascular atherosclerosis, dissection, vasculitis, or other rarer disorders. Ultrasonography can aid in the diagnosis of intracranial large vessel stenosis or occlusion and evaluation of collateral pathways and indirect hemodynamic signs of more proximal and distal pathology. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is the most sensitive method for detecting paradoxical emboli from a systemic right-left shunt such as a patent foramen ovale. TCD is mandatory for sickle cell disease surveillance, guiding the timing for preventive transfusion. In subarachnoid hemorrhage, TCD is useful in monitoring vasospasm and adapting treatment. Some arteriovenous shunts can be detected by ultrasonography. Cerebral vasoregulation studies are another developing field of interest. TCD enables monitoring of hemodynamic changes related to intracranial hypertension and can diagnose cerebral circulatory arrest. Optic nerve sheath measurement and brain midline deviation are ultrasonography-detectable signs of intracranial hypertension. Most importantly, ultrasonography allows for easily repeated monitoring of evolving clinical conditions or during and after interventions. Diagnostic ultrasonography is an invaluable tool in neurology, used as an extension of the clinical examination. It helps diagnose and monitor many conditions, allowing for more data-driven and rapid treatment interventions.","Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",2023-Feb,Azevedo E,1,1890,neurology,2025-11-22

39099460,An Approach to Successful Development of Clinician-Scientists in Neurology: The NINDS R25 Experience.,"Training clinician-scientists is a primary objective of many academic neurology departments, as these individuals are uniquely positioned to perform insightful clinical or laboratory-based research informed both by clinical knowledge and their own experiences caring for patients. Despite its importance, training clinician-scientists has perhaps never been so challenging. The National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) R25 program was designed in an attempt to support these individuals, decrease the time needed to obtain National Institutes of Health K awards, and to help educate a cohort of trainees preparing for a career in academic neurology. We endeavored to describe the structure and features of the program while examining its outcomes. R25 outcome data from 2009 to 2024 were reviewed. Statistical comparisons were made using 2-sided Mann-Whitney U testing. A total of 67% of adult neurologists who received an R25 had a successful application for a National Institutes of Health K award compared with 45% of adult neurologists who had not received R25 support (p < 0.0001). Among child neurologists, 73% who applied went on to receive K funding after R25 support, compared with 45% who had not been part of the R25 program (p < 0.001). The average time between completion of residency and obtaining a K award for R25 participants was decreased by 26 months among those with an MD/PhD degree, and 32 months for those with an MD degree compared with non-R25 individuals. The R25 program has been successful in achieving its training goals, but stands as only one component of support for aspiring clinician-scientists.

34265143,Transitioning to telegenetics in the COVID-19 era: Patient satisfaction with remote genetic counseling in adult neurology.,"The COVID-19 pandemic rapidly changed genetic counseling services across the United States. At the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), a large academic hospital in an urban setting, nearly all genetic counseling (GC) visits for adult-onset disorders within the Department of Neurology were conducted via secure videoconferencing (telegenetics) or telephone between March and December 2020. Although telemedicine services have been steadily emerging, many clinical programs, including the neurogenetics program at UPenn, had not built infrastructure or widely utilized these services prior to the pandemic. Thus, little is known about patient attitudes toward receiving clinical GC services remotely. From May 18 to October 18, 2020, all individuals seen remotely for GC in adult neurology via telephone or telegenetics were surveyed about their satisfaction with telehealth GC (N = 142), with a response rate of 42% (N = 60/142). Telephone and telegenetics services were referred to as 'telehealth' in the surveys to capture patient perspectives on all remote GC services, though the majority (N = 49/60) of these visits were completed via telegenetics. Surveys included the modified telehealth usability questionnaire (MTUQ), genetic counseling satisfaction scale (GCSS), and novel questions about future telehealth use. Preliminary results suggest that patients were satisfied with receiving remote GC services in adult neurology, with most participants strongly agreeing to all items about satisfaction with telehealth. Just 2% of participants preferred only in-person visits in the future, but every participant was willing to consider using telehealth for future visits if their genetic counselor felt it was appropriate. Most participants preferred a hybrid model (73%), and some (25%) preferred only telehealth for future visits. Additionally, we found no differences in satisfaction with remote services based on visit type (initial vs. results disclosure) nor age. We conclude that remote GC is an acceptable method for the provision of services in adult neurology that is well-received by patients.",Journal of genetic counseling,2021-Aug,"Dratch L, Paul RA, Baldwin A, Brzozowski M, Gonzalez-Alegre P, Tropea TF, Raper A, Bardakjian T",8,2108,neurology,2025-11-22

The neurology experience.,"Interpersonal communication skills by clinicians with patients, carers, fellow health professionals and legal professionals carry many unique challenges in practice. Whilst undergraduate training in communication helps with generic information receiving and information giving, uncomfortable and demanding speciality-specific issues in the various medical specialities are not covered during under- and postgraduate training. The aim of this study was to determine the self-perceived competence of neurology registrars and neurologists in interpersonal communication and the need for such assessment in college exit exams. We undertook a quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional survey by using self-administered printed questionnaires and the EvaSYS online system. Neurology registrars in training from the seven training centres in South Africa and neurologists based at the training centres and in the private sector were recruited. We received a 62.9% response rate. One hundred and twenty-nine participants were recruited comprising 42 neurology registrars and 87 neurologists. Registrars were more commonly female, more likely to be multilingual and less likely to use translators. Undergraduate training in communication was considered insufficient, 42.9% and 39.1% for registrars and specialists respectively, and was also considered not relevant to address speciality-specific issues encountered in practice. Most training received has been by observation of others and on-the-job training. Both groups felt strongly that postgraduate training in interpersonal communication was important (registrars 95.2%, specialists 91.9%), especially when dealing with issues of death and dying, disclosing medical errors and dealing with the legal profession. Postgraduate training of interpersonal communication as required of neurology registrars and neurologists was considered insufficient. Most training has been by observation of others or experiential by trial and error.

We aimed to study the neurology referrals by the cardiovascular-specialized hospital included in our tertiary hospital center. Retrospective study of consecutive patients referred for neurology inpatient consultation between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2022. We analyzed referrals, patients' characteristics, and the approach taken. A detailed subanalysis was performed for patients diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). 143 patients were observed (mean age 67.3 years, 46 [32.2%] females). Most frequent referral reasons were suspected AIS deficits (39.2%), altered mental status (19.6%), suspected seizures (13.3%), and neuroprognostication (11.9%). Mean referral-to-consult time was 2.7 days, and 117 (81.8%) consults were in-person. Additional investigation, treatment changes, and outpatient clinic referral were proposed, respectively, in 79.7%, 60.1%, and 19.6% of patients. Most common diagnoses were AIS (45.5%), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (18.9%), and delirium (7.0%). Regarding patients with AIS (n = 62), most common stroke causes were post-cardiac procedure (44.6%), infective endocarditis (18.5%), aortic dissection (10.8%), acute myocardial infarction (10.8%), and anticoagulant withdrawal in patients with atrial fibrillation (6.2%). Thirty-four AIS patients were diagnosed less than 24 h since last seen well, of which four (6.2%) were treated (three with thrombolysis and one with mechanical thrombectomy). AIS is the most common reason for referral in our cardiovascular hospital.

The model employs a patient-centred care workflow, involving multidisciplinary staff and online administrative tools that are synthesized to expedite care and maintain quality. Virtual Rapid Access Clinic efficacy was studied by determining average wait times and patient throughput, calculated from anonymous data that was extracted from the clinic patient database (n  =  1542). Comparative analysis focused on new patient consultations during the 12-month periods prior to (pre-Virtual Rapid Access Clinic, n  =  456) and following (post-Virtual Rapid Access Clinic, n  =  1086) Virtual Rapid Access Clinic implementation. After Virtual Rapid Access Clinic implementation, there was a mean 15-day wait time reduction, and a monthly average 52-patient increase in patient throughput. Wait time reductions and increased patient throughput were observed in all three Virtual Rapid Access Clinic sub-clinics - epilepsy, headache and concussion. Respectively, average wait times reduced significantly by 26.4 and 18.9 days and insignificantly by 1.1 days; monthly average patient throughputs increased by 235%, 95% and 161%. These findings demonstrated that the Virtual Rapid Access Clinic model of care is effective at reducing patient wait times and increasing patient throughput. While the Virtual Rapid Access Clinic presents a feasible model both during and after pandemic restrictions, further research exploring its scalability in other care contexts, potential changes in care quality and efficiency outside of pandemic restrictions must be performed.",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,2024-Sep,"Rabinovitch BS, Diaz PL, Langleben AC, Katz TM, Gordon T, Le K, Chen FY, Lewis EC",8,1893,neurology,2025-11-22
35001325,Analysis of neurology consultations in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and were consulted by neurology during their hospital stay. All files of patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty Hospital between March 11th and December 31st, 2020 were retrospectively reviewed, and files of patients who consulted by neurology during their stay were included. Demographic and clinical characteristics, neurologic diagnosis, outcome and related laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records and analyzed. Patients were categorized into the first wave and second wave according to the date of hospitalization. A total of 2257 patients were hospitalized for COVID-19; among them, 127 were consulted by a neurologist during their hospital stay. Fifteen patients received a consultation for possible drug interactions. Among the remaining 112 patients, the reason for neurology consultation was i. exacerbation of a neurological comorbidity vs ii. new-onset neurological manifestations. The median age was 68.5 ± 14.2 years, and 60.7% were men. Dementia and stroke were the leading neurological comorbidities. COVID-19 disease was more severe in the patients with the new-onset neurological comorbidity than in patients with exacerbation of a neurological comorbidity (p = 0.07). Serum creatinine kinase levels were higher in the new-onset patient group (p < 0.05). Exacerbation of previous neurological disease or new neurological impairment were jointly and severely related to high mortality (overall 35/112 vs 275/2145, p < 0.001; exacerbation 12/45 vs 275/2145 p < 0.01; new-onset 23/67 vs 275/2145, p < 0.001).

Key informant consensus survey.,"The COVID-19 pandemic will give rise to long-term changes in neurological care, which are not easily predictable. A key informant survey was used to enquire about the changes expected in the specialty over the next 5 years. The survey was completed by heads of neurology departments with broad knowledge of the situation, having been active during the pandemic. Despite a low level of consensus between participants, there was strong (85%) and moderate consensus (70%) about certain subjects, mainly the increase in precautions to be taken, the use of telemedicine and teleconsultations, the reduction of care provided in in-person consultations to avoid the presence of large numbers of people in waiting rooms, the development of remote training solutions, and the changes in monitoring visits during clinical trials. There was consensus that there would be no changes to the indication of complementary testing or neurological examination.

37157829,Development and Evaluation of a Child Neurology Resident Curriculum for Communication Around Serious Illness.,"<b>Background:</b> Communication around serious illness is a core competency for all residencies. One-fifth of neurology residencies have no curriculum. Published curricula use didactics or role-play to assess confidence performing this skill without evaluation in clinical settings. The SPIKES mnemonic (Setting, Perception, Invitation, Knowledge, Empathy, Strategy/Summary) outlines 6 evidence-based steps for communication around serious illness. It is unknown whether child neurology residents can incorporate SPIKES into communication around serious illness in clinical settings. <b>Objective:</b> To develop and evaluate a curriculum on communication around serious illness using SPIKES for child neurology residents that shows long-term skill retention in clinical settings at a single institution. <b>Methods:</b> In 2019, we created a pre-post survey and skills checklist based on SPIKES, with 20 total including 10 core skills. Faculty observed residents' (n  =  7) communication with families and completed both preintervention and postintervention checklists for comparison. Residents underwent training in SPIKES during a 2-hour session using didactic and coached role-play. <b>Results:</b> All (n  =  7) residents completed preintervention surveys, 4 of 6 completed postintervention. All (n  =  6) participated in the training session. Following the training, 75% of residents reported improved confidence in use of SPIKES, though 50% were still unsure about appropriately responding to emotions. There was improvement in all SPIKES skills, with significant improvement in 6 of 20 skills up to 1 year following training. <b>Conclusion:</b> This is the first evaluation of the implementation of a communication around serious illness curriculum for child neurology residents. We identified improved comfort with SPIKES after training. Successful acquisition and utilization of this framework in our program suggests it could be incorporated into any residency program.",Journal of child neurology,2023-Apr,"Martin JA, Sampey F, Feldman A, Silveira L, Press CA, Messer R, Barry M, Kaul P",8,1981,neurology,2025-11-22
31932402,Education Research: The Narrative Evaluation Quality Instrument: Development of a tool to assess the assessor.,"Determining the quality of narrative evaluations to assess medical student neurology clerkship performance remains a challenge. This study sought to develop a tool to comprehensively and systematically assess quality of student narrative evaluations. The Narrative Evaluation Quality Instrument (NEQI) was created to assess several components within clerkship narrative evaluations: performance domains, specificity, and usefulness to learner. In this retrospective study, 5 investigators scored 123 narrative evaluations using the NEQI. Inter-rater reliability was estimated by calculating interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) across 615 NEQI scores. The average overall NEQI score was 6.4 (SD 2.9), with mean component arm scores of 2.6 for performance domains (SD 0.9), 1.8 for specificity (SD 1.1), and 2.0 for usefulness (SD 1.4). Each component arm exhibited moderate reliability: performance domains ICC 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-0.72), specificity ICC 0.69 (95% CI 0.61-0.77), and usefulness ICC 0.73 (95% CI 0.66-0.80). Overall NEQI score exhibited good reliability (0.81; 95% CI 0.77-0.86). The NEQI is a novel, reliable tool to comprehensively assess the quality of narrative evaluation of neurology clerks and will enhance the study of interventions seeking to improve clerkship evaluation.",Neurology,2020-Jan,"Kelly MS, Mooney CJ, Rosati JF, Braun MK, Thompson Stone R",5,1321,neurology,2025-11-22

Children with neurological disease are among the most frequent recipients of pediatric palliative care. Several important elements distinguish pediatric palliative care from adult practice, including a longer illness duration, longitudinal relationships over the span of years, diseases characterized by chronic fragility rather than progressive pathology, and the reliance on parents as proxy decision makers. This chapter will provide an overview of pediatric neuropalliative care, with emphasis on the types of disease trajectories, symptom management, and communication principles for supporting shared decision making with families.

39497319,Perceptions of key informant neurologists before implementing anti-amyloid drugs in the Spanish departments of neurology.,"A deep knowledge of the healthcare system and the organization of neurology departments is important for planning and optimizing changes to facilitate the successful implementation of anti-amyloid antibodies treatments. We aimed to assess the necessary changes prior to introducing these therapies in our setting. We conducted a key informant survey among heads of departments of neurology from 16 hospitals in Spain. The questionnaire comprised questions about changes in the organization and functioning of the departments of neurology with the introduction of anti-amyloid drugs, changes in diagnosis and patient care, use of diagnostic techniques, patients, families and public information, resources allocation, and research. Sixteen key informants completed the survey. They strongly agreed that the introduction of anti-amyloid drugs will impact the functioning of neurology services, especially in hospitals with dementia units. Consensus was reached regarding referring all Alzheimer's disease patients eligible for therapy to dementia units. There was also agreement on the need to expand the neurology services, day hospital units, extend visit durations, and hire more professionals, especially neurologists, neuropsychologists, and nuclear medicine physicians. Furthermore, consensus was achieved on increasing the use of MRI, amyloid PET, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, <i>APOE</i> genotyping, and the necessity of advancing blood biomarkers and tau tracers.

33067273,Management of chronic headache with referral from primary care to direct access to MRI compared with Neurology services: an observational prospective study in London.,"To evaluate the cost, accessibility and patient satisfaction implications of two clinical pathways used in the management of chronic headache. Management of chronic headache following referral from Primary Care that differed in the first appointment, either a Neurology appointment or an MRI brain scan. A pragmatic, non-randomised, prospective, single-centre study at a Central Hospital in London. Adult patients with chronic headache referred from primary to secondary care. Participants' use of healthcare services and costs were estimated using primary and secondary care databases and questionnaires quarterly up to 12 months postrecruitment. Cost analyses were compared using generalised linear models. Secondary outcomes assessed: access to care, patient satisfaction, headache burden and self-perceived quality of life using headache-specific (Migraine Disability Assessment Scale and Headache Impact Test) and a generic questionnaire (5-level EQ-5D). Mean (SD) cost up to 6 months postrecruitment per participant was £578 (£420) for the Neurology group (n=128) and £245 (£172) for the MRI group (n=95), leading to an estimated mean cost difference of £333 (95% CI £253 to £413, p<0.001). The mean cost difference at 12 months increased to £518 (95% CI £401 to £637, p<0.001). When adjusted for baseline and follow-up imbalances between groups, this remained statistically significant. The utilisation of brain MRI improved access to care compared with the Neurology group (p<0.001). Participants in the Neurology group reported higher levels of satisfaction associated with the pathway and led to greater change in care management. Direct referral to brain MRI from Primary Care led to cost-savings and quicker access to care but lower satisfaction levels when compared with referral to Neurology services. Further research into the use of brain MRI for a subset of patient population more likely to be reassured by a negative brain scan should be considered.

31503539,Teleneurology Consultations for Prognostication and Brain Death Diagnosis.,"<i>The diagnosis of brain death and the determination of neurologic prognosis following cardiac arrest are important reasons for neurology consultation in the intensive care unit. In hospitals without access to neurology consultation, it may be challenging to address these important questions with high reliability in a timely manner. The American Academy of Neurology has established consensus criteria for diagnosis of brain death, which include (i) comatose state; (ii) presence of apnea; and (iii) absence of brainstem reflexes in the setting of a diagnosis of underlying brain injury compatible with brain death. It has recently been shown that virtual assessment of coma using standardized scales is feasible with good inter-rater reliability. The supervision of apnea testing and the neurologic examination of the brainstem by a remote neurologist are possible if conducted in conjunction with a well-trained and experienced bedside team. In this communication, we explore the essential clinical and legal framework that can support using virtual teleconsultations to address this complex topic.</i>",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,2020-Apr,"Girkar UM, Palacios R, Gupta A, Schwamm LH, Singla P, May H, Estrada J, Whitney C, Matiello M",9,1107,neurology,2025-11-22
37968099,Meaning and role of functional-organic distinction: a study of clinicians in psychiatry and neurology services.,"The functional-organic distinction attempts to differentiate disorders with diagnosable biological causes from those without and is a central axis on which diagnoses, medical specialities and services are organised. Previous studies report poor agreement between clinicians regarding the meanings of the terms and the conditions to which they apply, as well as noting value-laden implications of relevant diagnoses. Consequently, we aimed to understand how clinicians working in psychiatry and neurology services navigate the functional-organic distinction in their work. Twenty clinicians (10 physicians, 10 psychologists) working in psychiatry and neurology services participated in semistructured interviews that were analysed applying a constructivist grounded theory approach. The distinction was described as often incongruent with how clinicians conceptualise patients' problems. Organic factors were considered to be objective, unambiguously identifiable and clearly causative, whereas functional causes were invisible and to be hypothesised through thinking and conversation. Contextual factors-including cultural assumptions, service demands, patient needs and colleagues' views-were key in how the distinction was deployed in practice. The distinction was considered theoretically unsatisfactory, eventually to be superseded, but clinical decision making required it to be used strategically. These uses included helping communicate medical problems, navigating services, hiding meaning by making psychological explanations more palatable, tackling stigma, giving hope, and giving access to illness identity. Clinicians cited moral issues at both individual and societal levels as integral to the conceptual basis and deployment of the functional-organic distinction and described actively navigating these as part of their work. There was a considerable distance between the status of the functional-organic distinction as a sound theoretical concept generalisable across conditions and its role as a gatekeeping tool within the structures of healthcare. Ambiguity and contradictions were considered as both obstacles and benefits when deployed in practice and strategic considerations were important in deciding which to lean on.",Medical humanities,2024-Feb,"Chesterfield A, Harvey J, Hendrie C, Wilkinson S, Vera San Juan N, Bell V",6,2242,neurology,2025-11-22

However, pressures on higher specialty training in neurology together with an expanding curriculum have led to challenges in adequately preparing trainees for a subspecialist career. In this study we set out to understand current perceptions and barriers to training in neuroinflammatory disorders among neurology trainees in the UK. A structured questionnaire was used to assess trainees' perspectives on training opportunities and career aspirations. Findings reveal significant gaps in training, including insufficient training opportunities, lack of mentorship, and concerns about managing complex treatment regimes. We used these findings to develop structured action points with aim of improving training and retention in this subspecialty. These include early exposure to subspecialty experiences, enhanced mentorship, and equal access to training opportunities regardless of geographical location. Our findings underscore the need for further curriculum development in neurology training, potentially combining early support with dedicated fellowships later in training, in order to ensure sustainability of neuroinflammation as a subspecialty and to meet the growing demand for expertise in MS and related conditions.",Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,2024-Dec,"Arun T, Petheram K, Tallantyre E, Ford H, Chataway J, Dougall NM, Doshi A, Englezou C, Farrell R, Hughes S, McDonnell G, Murray K, Rees R, Robertson N, Schmierer K, Dobson R",16,1349,neurology,2025-11-22
34719505,Improving Patient Outreach by Defining Telehealth Suitability in a Tertiary Huntington's Disease Clinic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for remote healthcare options among patients with Huntington's disease (HD). However, since not every HD patient is suitable for telehealth, it is important to differentiate who can be seen virtually from who should remain as in-person. Unfortunately, there are no clinical guidelines on how to evaluate HD patients for telehealth eligibility. To standardize the teleneurology selection process in HD by implementing a screening tool that accounts for patient-specific factors. We organized various indications and contraindications to teleneurology into a flowchart. If any indications or contraindications were met, patients were assigned to telehealth or maintained as in-person, respectively. If no indications or contraindications were met, patients were given the option of telehealth or in-person for their upcoming appointments. In two implementation cycles, we tested this screening tool among all HD patients scheduled for clinic visits, aided by chart review and phone interview. In a cohort of 81 patients, telehealth acceptance among eligible patients increased from 45.0%to 83.3%. Frequency of telehealth visits increased from a pre-intervention baseline of 12.8%to 28.2%. Teleneurology utilization among HD patients more than doubled across our study. Our intervention promotes consistency and patient-centeredness in HD clinical care and streamlines the overall telehealth selection process. Future studies can seek to reduce telehealth no-shows and also evaluate the utility of the motor and psychiatric criteria included in our screening tool.",Journal of Huntington's disease,2021-,"Lee SJ, Hale LM, Huitz E, Claassen DO, McDonell KE",5,1606,neurology,2025-11-22

Our objectives were to evaluate the feasibility of a wearable biosensor to characterize exercise/sleep in neurology residents and examine its relationship to self-reported, validated survey measures. We also assessed the device's impact on well-being and barriers to use. This prospective cohort study evaluated the WHOOP Strap 2.0 in neurology residents. Participants completed regular online surveys, including self-reported hours of sleep/exercise, and validated sleep/exercise scales at 3-month intervals. Autonomic, exercise, and sleep measures were obtained from WHOOP. Changes were evaluated over time via linear regression. Survey and WHOOP metrics were compared using Pearson correlations. Sixteen (72.7%) of 22 eligible participants enrolled. Eleven (68.8%) met the minimum usage requirement (6+ months) and were classified as 'consecutive wearers.' Significant increases were found in sleep duration and exercise intensity. Moderate-to-low correlations were found between survey responses and WHOOP measures. Most (73%) participants reported a positive impact on well-being. Barriers to use included 'Forgetting to wear' (20%) and 'not motivational' (23.3%).

These fundamental disciplines of basic neuroscience could be more effectively taught during paediatric neurology and most residency programmes, that will strengthen career-long learning. Interdisciplinary training of fetal-neonatal neurology within these programs requires working knowledge of neuroembryology applied to maternal reproductive health influencing the maternal-placental-fetal triad, neonate, and young child. Systematic didactic teaching of development in terms of basic neuroscience with neuropathological context would better address needed clinical skill sets to be incorporated into paediatric neurology and neonatology residencies to address brain health and diseases across childhood. Trainees need to recognize the continuity of development, established by maternal reproductive health before conception with gene -environment influences over the first 1000 days. Considerations of neuroembryology that explain earlier brain development during the first half of pregnancy enhances an understanding of effects throughout gestation through parturition and into neonatal life. Neonatal EEG training enhances these clinical descriptions by applying serial EEG-state analyses of premature neonates through early childhood to recognize evolving patterns associated with neuronal maturation and synaptogenesis. Neuroimaging studies offer comparisons of normal structural images with malformations and destructive lesions to correlate with clinical and neurophysiological findings. This analysis better assesses aberrant developmental processes in the context of neuroembryology. Time-specific developmental events and semantic precision are important for accurate phenotypic descriptions for a better understanding of etiopathogenesis with maturation. Certification of paediatric neurology training programme curricula should apply practical knowledge of basic neuroscience in the context of nervous system development and maturation from conception through postnatal time periods.

38834366,Forensic Neurology and the Role of Neurologists in Forensic Evaluations.,"There is a clear need for experts with the requisite knowledge and experience to offer medicolegal opinions pertaining to various neuropsychiatric conditions. There is also an important distinction between clinical and medicolegal roles, and the need for training and expertise applicable to forensic assessment. But there remain few available experts with credentials spanning neuropsychiatry and forensic assessment. This creates a dilemma whereby parties involved in litigation featuring neuropsychiatric illness or injury are frequently forced to choose between experts with either knowledge and skills applicable to neuropsychiatric conditions or experts with skills and experience applicable to forensic assessment. Either choice introduces risk. Whether flawed medicolegal opinions are a consequence of deficient medical knowledge or an inadequate forensic evaluation process, the result remains the same, with triers of fact potentially being exposed to problematic testimony. There is, however, a more fundamental problem that implicates patient care more broadly: spurious dichotomies created by the historical segregation of psychiatry and neurology. Optimizing clinical care for patients with neuropsychiatric conditions, improving medical education in support of such care, and enabling forensic neuropsychiatric assessment must then start with more proactive efforts to reintegrate psychiatry and neurology.",The journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,2024-Jun,Wortzel HS,1,1421,neurology,2025-11-22

Over 5 weeks, fundus photographs were obtained using a nonmydriatic fundus camera in both eyes of adult patients attending our general neurology and headache clinics. A neurologist, who had received 15 minutes of training on the use of the camera, took the photographs. Quality of photographs was graded. Photographs were reviewed by 2 neuro-ophthalmologists. Treating neurologists completed a survey on the use of this technology in the neurology clinic. Feasibility parameters including ease, comfort, speed, quality, and clinical relevance of nonmydriatic fundus photography was assessed. We obtained 505 fundus photographs of 206 patients. Median time to completion of photographs per patient was 2.12 minutes. Mean rating for ease, comfort, and speed was 9.7 out of 10. Among these, 160 had normal and 44 had abnormal findings. In 114 of 206 patients, neurologists relied on photographs for ocular fundus assessment. In the remaining 92 patients, 18 patients had abnormal photographs, of which neurologists missed the abnormality in 14 (78%). All neurologists preferred nonmydriatic fundus photography over direct ophthalmoscopy. Using nonmydriatic fundus photography in an outpatient neurology clinic is feasible without disrupting patient flow or causing patient discomfort.

This study aimed to elicit best practices and characterize important elements of care to be provided in multidisciplinary headache centers. Qualitative, semi-structured telephone interviews with a purposive sample of headache neurology specialists from across the US, using open-ended questions. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded. Coded data were further analyzed using immersion/crystallization techniques for final interpretation. Mean years providing headache care was 17.7 (SD = 10.6). Twelve of the 13 participants held United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties headache certification. Six described their practice site as providing multidisciplinary headache care. Participants explained most of their patients had seen multiple doctors over many years, and had tried numerous unsuccessful treatments. They noted patients with chronic headache frequently present with comorbidities and become stigmatized. All participants asserted successful care depends on taking time to talk with and listen to patients, gain understanding, and earn trust. All participants believed multidisciplinary care is essential within a comprehensive headache center, along with staffing enough headache specialists, implementing detailed headache intake and follow-up protocols, and providing the newest medications, neuromodulation devices, botulinum toxin injections, monoclonal antibodies, nerve blocks and infusions, and treatment from a health psychologist. Other essential services for a headache center are other behavioral health practitioners providing cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, biofeedback and pain management; and autonomic neurology, neuropsychology, vestibular audiology, sleep medicine, physical therapy, occupational therapy, exercise physiology, speech therapy, nutrition, complementary integrative health modalities, and highly trained support staff.

Although less well known than his contemporaries at the time, Lhermitte eventually was famously recognized for his eponymously named ""Lhermitte's sign."" Lhermitte's contributions to the field of neurology spanned that of monographic clinical descriptions of syndromes to exquisitely detailed descriptions of neuropathology, finally delving into the realm of modern neuropsychiatry in his later years. Lhermitte laid the groundwork for the burgeoning field of neurology, developing the reputation of a renaissance physician by both his contemporaries and current neurologists. Here, we take an extensive look into the life and career of Lhermitte and the legacies that he left behind.","Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)",2020-Apr,"Chu DT, Hautecoeur P, Santoro JD",3,838,neurology,2025-11-22

We sought to characterize the rate and patient-level predictors of in-hospital mortality in a Ugandan Neurology ward.cc. Data was prospectively collected on 335 patients admitted to the Neurology ward of Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate COX proportional hazard modeling were used to assess survival. Within our sample (n = 307), 35.8% received no diagnosis at time of hospital admission. Stroke (27.3%), head trauma (19.6%), and malaria (16.0%) were the most common diagnoses. Among the 56 (18.5%) patients who died during the index hospitalization, the most common diagnosis at admission and at death was stroke. Adjusted regression analysis showed that patients without a diagnosis at time of death (HR = 7.01 [2.42-20.35], p < .001) and those with diagnoses of infections (HR = 5.21 [2.16-12.58], p = <.001), stroke (HR = 2.69 [1.20-6.04], p = .017), or head trauma (HR = 3.39, [1.27-9.07], p = 0.15) had worse survival.

Mitchell's 1869 paper on the physiology of the cerebellum is rich in both content and physiological concepts. Although several of the specific models proposed by Mitchell are no longer considered valid, a number of concepts, or collateral aspects of these concepts, are still considered of value today. No longer valid concepts are (1) that the cerebellum works in concert with the ""spinal ganglia"" to coordinate motion, and (2) that the cerebellum has a higher-order inhibitory effect on the ""spinal ganglia."" The valid concepts are (1) that the cerebellum is part of an integrated system of brain regions that produce and modulate movement, (2) that compensatory neural plasticity and cerebellar reserve allow the cerebellum to compensate in the setting of tissue damage, (3) that higher brain systems exert an inhibitory effect on lower brain systems, and (4) that there is a physiological gap between higher and lower life forms.

The appreciation of pain is not merely the result of abnormal sensory stimulation causing an unpleasant sensation but rather a combination of the recognition of the somatic discomfort in association with an emotional response to that discomfort. The perception of pain and the extent of distress and disability can vary depending on previous experience, cultural background, situational factors, and comorbid psychiatric disease. Though acute pain is usually the result of tissue damage, this is not always the case, as evidenced by primary headache disorders. Chronic pain may be the result of an injury, irreversible underlying disease, or clinical conditions such as fibromyalgia for which the mechanism remains unclear. Treatment of the underlying cause will usually effect a resolution or improvement in the pain, but when the discomfort persists, a consultation with a neurologist or pain management specialist should be considered.",The American journal of medicine,2020-Mar,"Wang VC, Mullally WJ",2,1097,neurology,2025-11-22

The BS was recognized and adopted by neurologists all over the world immediately after its first description. In 1899, this sign was first introduced to the Italian scientific community at two different medical meetings. Some opinions on its clinical value and underlying pathophysiology were discordant, possibly reflecting suboptimal diagnostic accuracy of the first observations. Giovanni Mingazzini (1859-1929) first suggested that the BS reflects a complex mechanism emerging in patients with pyramidal tract dysfunction, whereas Giovanni Boeri (1867-1946) emphasized that the BS can be elicited if the neuromuscular structures underlying it are intact.

32171904,From apathy to addiction: Insights from neurology and psychiatry.,"The tendency to engage in addictive behaviors has long been tied to the actions of the dopamine system. Early theories were based on the fact that all addictive drugs and behaviors (such as gambling) increase dopamine levels in the striatum, and the evidence that dopamine signaled reward or reward prediction error. However, with a changing emphasis of addiction away from purely pharmacological models that emphasize tolerance and withdrawal, towards one of behavioral dyscontrol, is there still a place for abnormal dopamine signaling in addiction? Here we recast the dopamine theory of addiction based on the idea that tonic dopamine may index a continuous phenotype that goes from apathy to impulsivity and compulsivity. Higher tonic dopamine signaling would make individuals vulnerable to drug reinforcement and cue-induced craving. We relate this to computational models of dopamine signaling, and review clinical and neuroimaging evidence from Parkinson's Disease, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in support of this model.",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2020-Jul,"Kirschner M, Rabinowitz A, Singer N, Dagher A",4,1033,neurology,2025-11-22

32843023,Evaluation of standard and semantically-augmented distance metrics for neurology patients.,"Patient distances can be calculated based on signs and symptoms derived from an ontological hierarchy. There is controversy as to whether patient distance metrics that consider the semantic similarity between concepts can outperform standard patient distance metrics that are agnostic to concept similarity. The choice of distance metric can dominate the performance of classification or clustering algorithms. Our objective was to determine if semantically augmented distance metrics would outperform standard metrics on machine learning tasks. We converted the neurological findings from 382 published neurology cases into sets of concepts with corresponding machine-readable codes. We calculated patient distances by four different metrics (cosine distance, a semantically augmented cosine distance, Jaccard distance, and a semantically augmented bipartite distance). Semantic augmentation for two of the metrics depended on concept similarities from a hierarchical neuro-ontology. For machine learning algorithms, we used the patient diagnosis as the ground truth label and patient findings as machine learning features. We assessed classification accuracy for four classifiers and cluster quality for two clustering algorithms for each of the distance metrics. Inter-patient distances were smaller when the distance metric was semantically augmented. Classification accuracy and cluster quality were not significantly different by distance metric. Although semantic augmentation reduced inter-patient distances, we did not find improved classification accuracy or improved cluster quality with semantically augmented patient distance metrics when applied to a dataset of neurology patients. Further work is needed to assess the utility of semantically augmented patient distances.",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2020-Aug,"Hier DB, Kopel J, Brint SU, Wunsch DC, Olbricht GR, Azizi S, Allen B",7,1785,neurology,2025-11-22

This study examines the procedure of informed consent for intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke in high-volume stroke centers in the Netherlands. In four high volume stroke centers, neurology residents and attending neurologists received an online questionnaire concerning informed consent for thrombolysis with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). The respondents were asked to report their usual informed consent practice for tPA treatment and their considerations on whether informed consent should be obtained. From the 203 invited clinicians, 50% (n = 101) completed the questionnaire. One-third of the neurology residents (n = 21) and 21% of the neurologists (n = 8) reported that they always obtain informed consent for tPA treatment. If a patient is not capable of providing informed consent, 30% of the residents (n = 19) reported that they start tPA treatment without informed consent. In these circumstances, 53% of the neurologists (n = 20) reported that the resident under their supervision would start tPA treatment without informed consent. Most neurologists (n = 21; 55%) and neurology residents (n = 45; 72%) obtained informed consent within one minute. None of the respondents used more than five minutes for informed consent. Important themes regarding obtaining informed consent for treatment were patients' capacity, and medical, ethical and legal considerations. The current practice of informed consent for thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke varies among neurologists and neurology residents. If informed consent is obtained, most clinicians stated to obtain informed consent within one minute. In the future, a shortened information provision process may be applied, making a shift from informed consent to informed refusal, while still considering the patient's capacity, stroke severity, and possible treatment delays.",BMC medical ethics,2021-Aug,"Zonjee VJ, Slenders JPL, de Beer F, Visser MC, Ter Meulen BC, Van den Berg-Vos RM, van Schaik SM",7,2083,neurology,2025-11-22

We identified three priority domains for the research mission: funding levels, active guidance, and reducing disparities. Funding levels: to increase funding to match the burden of pediatric neurological disease; to tailor funding mechanisms and strategies to support clinical trial efforts unique to pediatric neurology; and to support investigators across their career trajectory. Active guidance: to optimize infrastructure and strategies, to leverage novel therapeutics, enhance data collection, and improve inclusion of children in clinical trials. Reducing disparities: to reduce health disparities in children with neurological disease, to develop proactive measures to enhance workforce diversity and inclusion, and increase avenues to balance work-life obligations for investigators. In this uniquely challenging epoch, the pediatric neurology research community has a timely and important mission to re-engage the public and government, advancing the health of children with neurological conditions.",Pediatric neurology,2020-Dec,"Bonkowsky JL, deVeber G, Kosofsky BE",3,1871,neurology,2025-11-22
39347854,Emerging Trends: Neurofilament Biomarkers in Precision Neurology.,"Neurofilaments are structural proteins found in the cytoplasm of neurons, particularly in axons, providing structural support and stability to the axon. They consist of multiple subunits, including NF-H, NF-M, and NF-L, which form long filaments along the axon's length. Neurofilaments are crucial for maintaining the shape and integrity of neurons, promoting axonal transport, and regulating neuronal function. They are part of the intermediate filament (IF) family, which has approximately 70 tissue-specific genes. This diversity allows for a customizable cytoplasmic meshwork, adapting to the unique structural demands of different tissues and cell types. Neurofilament proteins show increased levels in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood after neuroaxonal damage, indicating injury regardless of the underlying etiology. Precise measurement and long-term monitoring of damage are necessary for determining prognosis, assessing disease activity, tracking therapeutic responses, and creating treatments. These investigations contribute to our understanding of the importance of proper NF composition in fundamental neuronal processes and have implications for neurological disorders associated with NF abnormalities along with its alteration in different animal and human models. Here in this review, we have highlighted various neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, Dementia, and paved the way to use neurofilament as a marker in managing neurological disorders.",Neurochemical research,2024-Dec,"Sharma P, Giri A, Tripathi PN",3,1505,neurology,2025-11-22
35597078,Feedback from neurology residents and neuroimmunology fellows about the practical training in multiple sclerosis.,"To obtain feedback from Neurology residents and Neuroimmunology fellows about the practical training in multiple sclerosis (MS). A survey was developed and administered electronically to Neurology residents or Neuroimmunology fellows that received training in eight large MS outpatient clinics in Brazil, from 2018 to 2021. We evaluated their beliefs on: (1) the optimal number of MS patients evaluated in a 4-hour outpatient clinic session, (2) the quality of dedicated MS medical records, (3) the training of the neurological exam in MS patients, (4) the teaching discussion with the attending neuroimmunologist and (5) the prescription of MS disease-modifying drugs (DMDs). The response rate was 57% (43/76). We found that 4 or 5 MS patients would be optimal during a 4-hour outpatient clinic session. Optimal MS medical records were considered structured and presented in a timeline of disease activity and the history of DMDs. 18 in 43 (42%) respondents felt insecure in performing clinical scales used in MS patients. Discussion with the attending neurologist specialized in Neuroimmunology was considered adequate in only half of the respondents, suggesting a need for improvement in teaching strategies. Almost a quarter of the respondents (11/43, 26%) felt that the prescription of DMDs was complex and challenging. Some respondents suggested that readymade templates could be helpful. The number of patients, medical records, use of MS clinical scales, discussion with attending neurologist specialized in MS care, and the prescription of DMDs present room for improvement in MS training for Neurology residents and Neuroimmunology fellows.",Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,2022-Jul,Diogo Silva G,1,1650,neurology,2025-11-22
30762494,Teleneurology Network to Improve Access to Neurologists for Patients in Rural Areas: A Real-World Experience.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> The need for neurologists has been steadily increasing over the past few years. The implementation of teleneurology networks could serve as a potential solution to this need. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A retrospective review of the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Teleneurology records for all consults performed between August 2014 and July 2018 was conducted. Collected data included number of consults, baseline characteristics, final diagnosis, and number of providers and hospitals over the study period. <b><i>Results:</i></b> A total of 4,542 Teleneurology consults were performed during the study period. The most common diagnosis was cerebrovascular disease, followed by seizure disorders. The number of consults per month increased throughout the study period from three in August 2014 to 257 in July 2018. The number of community hospitals covered has increased from 3 hospitals in August 2014 to 14 hospitals throughout the state of South Carolina in July 2018. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Over 4 years, the MUSC teleneurology program has evolved into a robust partnership with 14 partner hospitals, and is now delivering more than 250 expert neurology consultations monthly to patients throughout the state of South Carolina.",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,2020-Jan,"Almallouhi E, Al Kasab S, Harvey JB, Simpson KN, Turner N, Debenham E, Holmstedt CA",7,1270,neurology,2025-11-22

33530985,Overlap of burnout-depression symptoms among Chinese neurology graduate students in a national cross-sectional study.,"The overlap of burnout and depression is a phenomenon that can effectively reflect the psychological state of a group. However, whether burnout is a type of depression is still debated in current research. The high incidence of burnout and depressive symptoms among medical students indicates that it is urgent to provide appropriate health services for them. However, the proportion of burnout and depression in the overlapping symptoms experienced by medical students, and the characteristics of the relative influencing factors, remain unclear. Therefore, we addressed these issues for neurology graduate students in China. Using data from a cross-sectional survey of Chinese neurology graduate students, a diagnostic model was established according to their burnout and/or depression symptoms. Burnout was assessed by using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Depression symptoms were assessed with a two-item depression screening tool for primary care evaluation of mental disorders. Univariate analyses with chi-squared tests were conducted to assess associations between variables. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to analyze the effects of multiple factors on dependent variables. The factors included demographic information and three medical-study related problems. In total, 32.2% of surveyed students evidenced overlapping burnout and depression symptoms. Students with depressive symptoms tended to be included in the burnout students' category. In the regression model, being unmarried, having children, and career choice regret were related to students who had only burnout, while the students with overlapping symptoms were affected by more factors such as family income, the consideration of dropping out once. The symptoms and related factors of burnout and depression among Chinese neurology postgraduates have obvious overlap and show a significant trend. The occurrence of depressive symptoms among medical students is closely related to whether they are burned out. Students with only burnout were common, but students with only depressive symptoms were uncommon. Finally, burnout may be a pre-depression state.",BMC medical education,2021-Feb,"Zhou W, Pu J, Zhong X, Yang W, Teng T, Fan L, Wang H, Tian L, Liu Y, Xie P",10,2144,neurology,2025-11-22
32518152,"Analyzing 2,589 child neurology telehealth encounters necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.","To assess the rapid implementation of child neurology telehealth outpatient care with the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in March 2020. This was a cohort study with retrospective comparison of 14,780 in-person encounters and 2,589 telehealth encounters, including 2,093 audio-video telemedicine and 496 scheduled telephone encounters, between October 1, 2019 and April 24, 2020. We compared in-person and telehealth encounters for patient demographics and diagnoses. For audio-video telemedicine encounters, we analyzed questionnaire responses addressing provider experience, follow-up plans, technical quality, need for in-person assessment, and parent/caregiver satisfaction. We performed manual reviews of encounters flagged as concerning by providers. There were no differences in patient age and major ICD-10 codes before and after transition. Clinicians considered telemedicine satisfactory in 93% (1,200 of 1,286) of encounters and suggested telemedicine as a component for follow-up care in 89% (1,144 of 1,286) of encounters. Technical challenges were reported in 40% (519 of 1,314) of encounters. In-person assessment was considered warranted after 5% (65 of 1,285) of encounters. Patients/caregivers indicated interest in telemedicine for future care in 86% (187 of 217) of encounters. Participation in telemedicine encounters compared to telephone encounters was less frequent among patients in racial or ethnic minority groups. We effectively converted most of our outpatient care to telehealth encounters, including mostly audio-video telemedicine encounters. Providers rated the vast majority of telemedicine encounters to be satisfactory, and only a small proportion of encounters required short-term in-person follow-up. These findings suggest that telemedicine is feasible and effective for a large proportion of child neurology care. Additional strategies are needed to ensure equitable telemedicine use.",Neurology,2020-Sep,"Rametta SC, Fridinger SE, Gonzalez AK, Xian J, Galer PD, Kaufman M, Prelack MS, Sharif U, Fitzgerald MP, Melamed SE, Malcolm MP, Kessler SK, Stephenson DJ, Banwell BL, Abend NS, Helbig I",16,1950,neurology,2025-11-22
37990504,Diagnostic accuracy of large and medium vessel occlusions in acute stroke imaging by neurology residents and stroke fellows: A comparison of CT angiography alone and CT angiography with CT perfusion.,"Neurology senior residents and stroke fellows are first to clinically assess and interpret imaging studies of patients presenting to the emergency department with acute stroke. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of brain CT angiography (CTA) with and without CT perfusion (CTP) between neurology senior residents and stroke fellows. In this neuroimaging study, nine practitioners (four senior neurology residents (SNRs) and five stroke fellows (SFs)) clinically assessed and interpreted the imaging data of 50 cases (15 normal images, 21 large vessel occlusions (LVOs) and 14 medium vessel occlusions (MeVOs) in two sessions, 1 week apart in comparison to final diagnosis of experienced neuroradiologist and experienced stroke neurologist consensus. Interrater agreement of CTA alone and CTA with CTP was quantified using kappa statistics, sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy. Overall, arterial occlusions were correctly identified in 221/315 (70.1%) with CTA alone and in 266/315 (84.4%) with CTA and CTP (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The sensitivity of overall arterial occlusions detection with CTA alone was 94.2% (95% CI: 90.8%-96.6%) while with addition of CTP was 98% (95% CI: 95.6%-99.3%), The specificity of CTA alone was 74.7% (95% CI: 67.2%-81.3%) which increased with CTP to 84.4% (95% CI: 77.7%-89.8%). The likelihood of correct identification with CTA alone was 156/189 (82.54%) for LVOs and 65/126 (51.59%) for MeVOs. This increased to 169/189 (89.42%; <i>p</i> = 0.054) for LVOs and 97/126 (76.98%; <i>p</i> < 0.001) for MeVOs when the CTA images with CTP were viewed. There was good overall interrater agreement between readers when using CTA alone (<i>k</i> 0.71, 95% CI, 0.62-0.80) and almost perfect (<i>k</i> 0.85, 95% CI, 0.76-0.94) when CTP was added to the image for interpretation. CTA and CTP had a significantly lower median interquartile range (IQR) interpretation time than CTA alone (114 [IQR, 103-120] s vs 156 [IQR, 133-160] s, <i>p</i> < 0.001). In cerebral arterial occlusions, the rate of LVO and MeVOs detections increases when adding CTP to CTA. The accuracy and time for diagnosing arterial occlusion can be significantly improved if CTP is added to CTA. As MeVOs are commonly missed by front-line neurology senior residents or stroke fellows, cases with significant deficits and no apparent arterial occlusions need to be reviewed with neuroradiological expertise.",European stroke journal,2024-Jun,"Alotaibi FF, Alshahrani A, Mohamed G, AlShamrani MA, Bin Amir H, Alsaeed A, Heji A, Alghanmi S, Alqurishi M, Alanazi A, Aldraye H, Asiri M, Alqahtani M, Alreshaid AA, AlKawi A, AlHazzani A, AlZawahmah M, Alokaili RN, Shuaib A, Al-Ajlan FS",20,2429,neurology,2025-11-22
32732292,Folding a neuroscience center into streamlined COVID-19 response teams: Lessons in origami.,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic epicenter in Bronx, NY, the Montefiore Neuroscience Center required rapid and drastic changes when considering the delivery of neurologic care, health and safety of staff, and continued education and safety for house staff. Health care leaders rely on principles that can be in conflict during a disaster response such as this pandemic, with equal commitments to ensure the best care for those stricken with COVID-19, provide high-quality care and advocacy for patients and families coping with neurologic disease, and advocate for the health and safety of health care teams, particularly house staff and colleagues who are most vulnerable. In our attempt to balance these principles, over 3 weeks, we reformatted our inpatient neuroscience services by reducing from 4 wards to just 1, in the following weeks delivering care to over 600 hospitalized patients with neuro-COVID and over 1,742 total neuroscience hospital bed days. This description from members of our leadership team provides an on-the-ground account of our effort to respond nimbly to a complex and evolving surge of patients with COVID in a large urban hospital network. Our efforts were based on (1) strategies to mitigate exposure and transmission, (2) protection of the health and safety of staff, (3) alleviation of logistical delays and strains in the system, and (4) facilitating coordinated communication. Each center's experience will add to knowledge of best practices, and emerging research will help us gain insights into an evidence-based approach to neurologic care during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",Neurology,2020-Sep,"Correa DJ, Labovitz DL, Milstein MJ, Monderer R, Haut SR",5,1622,neurology,2025-11-22
34715841,Broadening learning communities during COVID-19: developing a curricular framework for telemedicine education in neurology.,"In response to the cancellation of clinical clerkships due to COVID-19, the Johns Hopkins (JH) Neurology Education Team developed a virtual elective to enhance medical students' clinical telemedicine skills and foster community between academic institutions. This two-week clinical elective, entitled ""Virtual Patient Rounds in Neurology,"" was administered once in April 2020 and once in May 2020. The curriculum included attending/fellow-led Virtual Rounds, Student Presentations, and Asynchronous Educational Activities. We also developed a new lecture series entitled JHNeuroChats, which consisted of live synchronous lectures presented by JH faculty and Virtual Visiting Professors. Trainees and faculty from outside institutions were invited to participate in the JHNeuroChats. Students and faculty completed pre- and post-elective surveys to assess the educational impact of the elective. Student's t-tests were used to compare scores between pre- and post-elective surveys. Seven JH medical students enrolled in each iteration of the elective, and an additional 337 trainees and faculty, representing 14 different countries, registered for the JHNeuroChats. We hosted 48 unique JHNeuroChats, 32 (66.7%) of which were led by invited Virtual Visiting Professors. At the end of the elective, students reported increased confidence in virtually obtaining a history (P < 0.0001) and performing a telehealth neurological physical exam (P < 0.0001), compared to the start of the course. In addition, faculty members reported increased confidence in teaching clinical medicine virtually, although these findings were not statistically significant (P = 0.15). Despite the constraints imposed by COVID-19, this virtual Neurology elective increased medical students' confidence in certain telemedicine skills and successfully broadened our learning community to encompass learners from around the world. As virtual medical education becomes more prevalent, it is important that we are intentional in creating opportunities for shared learning across institutions. We believe that this elective can serve as a model for these future educational collaborations.",BMC medical education,2021-Oct,"Gummerson CE, Lo BD, Porosnicu Rodriguez KA, Cosner ZL, Hardenbergh D, Bongiorno DM, Wainger J, Hu K, Gamaldo C, Salas RME, Romo C, Leung DG",12,2155,neurology,2025-11-22

32408841,The impact of teleneurologists on acute stroke care at an advanced primary stroke centre.,"We evaluated the impact of teleneurologists on the time to initiating acute stroke care versus traditional bedside neurologists at an advanced stroke center. This observational study evaluated time to treatment for acute stroke patients at a single hospital, certified as an advanced primary stroke centre, with thrombectomy capabilities. Consecutive stroke alert patients between 1 March, 2016 and 31 March, 2018 were divided into two groups based on their neurology consultation service (bedside neurology: 1 March, 2016-28 February, 2017; teleneurology: 1 April, 2017-31 March, 2018). Door-to-tPA time and door-to-IR time for mechanical thrombectomy were compared between the two groups. Nine hundred and fifty-nine stroke patients met the inclusion criteria (436 bedside neurology, 523 teleneurology patients). There were no significant differences in sex, age, or stroke final diagnosis between groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). 85 bedside neurology patients received tPA and 35 had mechanical thrombectomy, 84 and 44 for the teleneurology group respectively. Door-to-tPA time (median (IQR)) was significantly higher among teleneurology (64 min (51.5-83.5)) than bedside neurology patients (45 min (34-69); <i>p</i> < 0.0001). There was no difference in door-to-IR times (mean ± SD) between bedside neurology (87.2 ± 33.3 min) and teleneurology (90.4 ± 33.4 min; <i>p</i> = 0.67). At this facility, our teleneurology services vendor was associated with a statistically significant delay in tPA administration compared with bedside neurologists. There was no difference in door-to-IR times. Delays in tPA administration make it harder to meet acute stroke care guidelines and could worsen patient outcomes.",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,2022-Feb,"Gutovitz S, Leggett J, Hart L, Leaman SM, James H, Stillinger T",6,1702,neurology,2025-11-22
