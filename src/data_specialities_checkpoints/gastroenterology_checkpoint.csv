35194705,Gastroenterology Practice Consolidation Between 2012 and 2020.,"Multiple studies have indicated physicians are practicing medicine in increasingly larger groups. However, specialty-specific data on the extent of consolidation are lacking for many specialties, including gastroenterology. We aim to determine the extent of consolidation for gastroenterology in recent years. The Physician Compare database was used to gather information at both an individual and group level. This information included location and number of providers for each group. Cochran-Armitage tests were used to test for differences between practice sizes in 2012 and 2020. Between 2012 and 2020, the number of physicians increased from 12,766 to 13,934, while the total number of practices decreased from 4517 to 3865. The total number of physicians who practice in groups of less than 9 physicians decreased by 23.9%, while the total number of physicians in practices of 100 + increased by 16.8%. Significant consolidation has occurred in the field of gastroenterology in every geographic region of the USA. The causes of consolidation are multi-faceted and include the legislative environment, private equity and hospital acquisition of private groups, individual physician lifestyle preferences, and economic benefits of economies of scale. However, the consequences of consolidation are still unclear. Over the last eight years, gastroenterologists have been practicing in increasingly larger groups. This trend has been consistent in each area of the country. Future research should focus on the impact of consolidation on patient care and physician wellbeing.",Digestive diseases and sciences,2022-Aug,"Griffin ZD, Hogan J, Pollock JR, Moore ML, Mehta D",5,1576,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

35385404,Current Applications of Telemedicine in Gastroenterology.,"Telemedicine generally refers to the use of technology to communicate with patients and provide health care from a distance. Advances in technology, specifically computers, cellphones, and other mobile devices, have facilitated healthcare providers' growing ability to virtually monitor and mentor patients. There has been a progressive expansion in the use of telemedicine in the field of gastroenterology (GI), which has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we discuss telemedicine-its history, various forms, and limitations-and its current applications in GI. Specifically, we focus on telemedicine in GI practice in general and specific applications, including the management of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and colorectal cancer surveillance and its use as an aid in endoscopic procedures.",The American journal of gastroenterology,2022-Jul,"Fung BM, Markarian E, Serper M, Tabibian JH",4,832,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

This ""big data,"" discussed in depth in the first section of this two-part series, is increasingly important to understand the nuances of the gastrointestinal tract and its complex interactions and networks involving a host of other organ systems and microbes. Creating and using these datasets correctly requires comprehensive training; however, current instruction in the integration, analysis, and interpretation of big data appears to lag far behind data acquisition. While opportunities exist for those interested in acquiring the requisite training, these appear to be underutilized, in part due to widespread ignorance of their existence. Here, to address these gaps in knowledge, we highlight existing big data learning opportunities and propose innovative approaches to attain such training. We offer suggestions at both the undergraduate and graduate medical education levels for prospective clinical and basic investigators. Lastly, we categorize training opportunities that can be selected to fit specific needs and timeframes.",Digestive diseases and sciences,2024-Jan,"Alizadeh M, Sampaio Moura N, Schledwitz A, Patil SA, Ravel J, Raufman JP",6,1147,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
39119669,Anatomical Benchmarks in the Training of Gastroenterologists.,"Anatomy is one of the oldest medical disciplines and offered over the centuries the morphological explanation for the structure, function and pathology of the body. Learning anatomy was one of the first steps in the accumulation of medical knowledge. Practicing gastroenterology means the approach of pathology presenting with morphological changes. Diagnosis and therapeutical interventions require also precise anatomical knowledge. This is a review of the most important anatomical benchmarks necessary to trainees in gastroenterology. Two teachers of anatomy and one resident of gastroenterology performed a literature survey. They checked the curricula of gastroenterology of continental and national societies of gastroenterology and hepatology. They also checked on Pubmed and Google Scholar pertinent journal papers. They selected and analyzed papers presenting important anatomical benchmarks considered very important for the appropriation of practical skills. A list of recommendations was the outcome of this initiative. These are largely overlapping on the available curricula. The relevant anatomical benchmarks should be used in the training programs of residents in gastroenterology. Good anatomy training enables practitioners to diagnose correctly digestive pathology, to interpret the results of the imaging or endoscopic investigations, to recommend or undertake therapeutic interventions. Although ancient, anatomy is very useful in the training of future gastroenterologists. The trainees should emphasis the learning of the most important anatomical benchmarks.",Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,2024-Sep,"Dumitrascu DI, Rusu I, Filip A",3,1584,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

39243338,Generative AI in Pediatric Gastroenterology.,"The integration of digital technology into medical practice is often thrust upon clinicians, with standards and routines developed long after initiation. Clinicians should endeavor towards a basic understanding even of emerging technologies so that they can direct its use. The intent of this review is to describe the current state of rapidly evolving generative artificial intelligence (GAI), and to explore both how pediatric gastroenterology practice may benefit as well as challenges that will be faced. Although little research demonstrating the acceptance, practice, and outcomes associated with GAI in pediatric gastroenterology is published, there are relevant data adjacent to the specialty and overwhelming potential as professed in the media. Best practice guidelines are widely developed in academic publishing and resources to initiate and improve practical user skills are prevalent. Initial published evidence supports broad acceptance of the technology as part of medical practice by clinicians and patients, describes methods with which higher quality GAI can be developed, and identifies the potential for bias and disparities resulting from its use. GAI is broadly available as a digital tool for incorporation into medical practice and holds promise for improved quality and efficiency of care, but investigation into how GAI can best be used remains at an early stage despite rapid evolution of the technology.",Current gastroenterology reports,2024-Dec,Rosen JM,1,1432,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
33655456,Successful Distancing: Telemedicine in Gastroenterology and Hepatology During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Telemedicine involves delivering healthcare and preventative care services to patients without the need for in-person encounters. Traditionally, telemedicine has been used for acute events (e.g., stroke, used to relay essential information to the emergency department) and chronic disease management (e.g., diabetes and chronic kidney disease management). Though the utilization of telemedicine in gastroenterology and hepatology has been modest at best, especially for inflammatory bowel diseases and chronic liver disease management, since the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, utilization of telemedicine in gastroenterology increased by 4000% in the first two weeks, equivalent to the last six years of growth before the pandemic. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) relaxed rules for the use of telemedicine with easing restrictions on reimbursements, location, licensing requirements (across state lines), and the need for a prior provider-patient relationship. These changes increased the use of telemedicine in inpatient and outpatient settings for gastroenterology-related referrals. The use of inpatient telephonic or video consults helps provide timely care during the pandemic while conserving personal protective equipment and decreasing provider and patient exposure. Nevertheless, telehealth use comes at the cost of no direct patient contact and lesser reimbursements. The appropriate use of technology and equipment, training of healthcare providers, use of platforms that can be integrated into the electronic health record while protecting the privacy and the flow of information are essential components of telemedicine. Furthermore, encouraging patients to seek medical care remotely with the proper equipment and improving digital literacy without the need for physical examinations is a challenge, further compounded in elderly or hard-of-hearing patients and in patients who are more comfortable with in-person visits. The authors will systematically review and discuss how telemedicine can be integrated into the practice of gastroenterology and hepatology, with emphasis placed on discussing barriers to success and the ways they can be mitigated.",Digestive diseases and sciences,2021-Apr,"Perisetti A, Goyal H",2,2201,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

This narrative review explores direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) as a touchstone example of how medical innovation breeds ethical dilemmas. A few quandaries-informed consent as well as informed deferral during the first wave of DAA approvals, sobriety restrictions from payors, and high DAA costs for patients-are addressed through the lens of the foundational principles of clinical medical ethics: autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and utility. By placing these issues within a medical ethics framework, we hope not only to focus on the solutions that the gastroenterology and hepatology community developed in the advent of DAA therapy, but to highlight an ethical paradigm that can be applied to similar dilemmas that will be faced as new therapies for other gastrointestinal diseases are approved.",Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,2021-Oct,"Couri T, Aronsohn A",2,941,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
31696976,Review article: bacteriophages in gastroenterology-from biology to clinical applications.,"The gut microbiota plays an important role in the pathogenesis of several gastrointestinal diseases. Its composition and function are shaped by host-microbiota and intra-microbiota interactions. Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that target bacteria and have the potential to modulate bacterial communities. To summarise phage biology and the clinical applications of phages in gastroenterology METHODS: PubMed was searched to identify relevant studies. Phages induce bacterial cell lysis, integration of viral DNA into the bacteria and/or coexistence in a stable equilibrium. Bacteria and phages have co-evolved and their dynamic interactions are yet to be fully understood. The increasing need to modulate microbial communities (e.g., gut microbiota, multidrug-resistant bacteria) has been a strong stimulus for research in phages as an antibacterial therapy. In gastroenterology, phage therapy has been mainly studied in infectious diseases such as cholera. However, it is currently being explored in several other circumstances such as treating Clostridioides difficile colitis, targeting adherent-invasive Escherichia coli in Crohn's disease or eradicating Fusobacterium nucleatum in colorectal cancer. Overall, phage therapy has a favourable and acceptable safety profile. Presently, trials with phage therapy are ongoing in Crohn's disease. Phage therapy is a promising therapeutic tool against pathogenic bacteria in the fields of infectious diseases and gastroenterology.

The World Health Organisation named the disease caused by the virus 'coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)'. It was declared a pandemic in early 2020, after the disease rapidly spread across the world. COVID-19 has not only resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality but also significantly impacted healthcare service provision and training across all medical specialties with gastroenterology and Hepatology services being no exception. Internationally, most, if not all 'non-urgent' services have been placed on hold during surges of infections. As a result there have been delayed diagnoses, procedures, and surgeries which will undoubtedly result in increased morbidity and mortality. Outpatient services have been converted to remote consultations where possible in many countries. Trainees have been redeployed to help care for COVID-19 patients in other settings, resulting in disruption to their training - particularly endoscopy and outpatient clinics. This has led to significant anxiety amongst trainees, and risks prolongation of training. It is of the utmost importance to develop strategies that continue to support COVID-19-related service provision, whilst also supporting existing and future gastroenterology and Hepatology services and training. Changes to healthcare provision during the pandemic have generated new and improved frameworks of service and training delivery, which can be adopted in the post-COVID-19 world, leading to enhanced patient care.",World journal of gastroenterology,2021-Nov,"Anjum MR, Chalmers J, Hamid R, Rajoriya N",4,1629,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

Digital solutions can monitor and detect early changes in physiological data, predict disease progression and health-related outcomes based on individual risk factors, and manage disease intervention with a range of accessible telemedicine and mobile health options. In this review, we discuss the unique transformation underway in the care of patients with liver disease, specifically examining the digital transformation of diagnostics, prediction and clinical decision-making, and management. Additionally, we discuss the general considerations needed to confirm validity and oversight of new technologies, usability and acceptability of digital solutions, and equity and inclusivity of vulnerable populations.","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",2022-Mar,"Wu T, Simonetto DA, Halamka JD, Shah VH",4,955,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
32107677,Evolving Role and Future Directions of Natural Language Processing in Gastroenterology.,"In line with the current trajectory of healthcare reform, significant emphasis has been placed on improving the utilization of data collected during a clinical encounter. Although the structured fields of electronic health records have provided a convenient foundation on which to begin such efforts, it was well understood that a substantial portion of relevant information is confined in the free-text narratives documenting care. Unfortunately, extracting meaningful information from such narratives is a non-trivial task, traditionally requiring significant manual effort. Today, computational approaches from a field known as Natural Language Processing (NLP) are poised to make a transformational impact in the analysis and utilization of these documents across healthcare practice and research, particularly in procedure-heavy sub-disciplines such as gastroenterology (GI). As such, this manuscript provides a clinically focused review of NLP systems in GI practice. It begins with a detailed synopsis around the state of NLP techniques, presenting state-of-the-art methods and typical use cases in both clinical settings and across other domains. Next, it will present a robust literature review around current applications of NLP within four prominent areas of gastroenterology including endoscopy, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreaticobiliary, and liver diseases. Finally, it concludes with a discussion of open problems and future opportunities of this technology in the field of gastroenterology and health care as a whole.",Digestive diseases and sciences,2021-Jan,"Nehme F, Feldman K",2,1537,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
36942645,Intra-Specialty Citation Pattern in Radiology and Gastroenterology/Hepatology Journals: A Cross-Specialty Comparison.,"<b>Objectives:</b> To investigate intra-specialty citation patterns of radiology articles, compared with another medical specialty: gastroenterology/hepatology. <b>Methods:</b> Four radiology journals (<i>Radiology</i>, <i>European Radiology</i>, <i>Diagnostic and Interventional Imaging</i>, <i>Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal</i>) and four gastroenterology/hepatology journals (<i>Journal of Hepatology, Journal of Gastroenterology, World Journal of Gastroenterology, Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology</i>) with similar Web of Science in-category 2020 IF ranking were selected. The original research, review, letter, and editorial articles published in these journals in 2021 were identified. The average number of intra-specialty citations per article (intra-specialty citation <i>count</i>) and percentage of intra-specialty citations out of total citations per article (intra-specialty citation <i>rate</i>) were compared between radiology and gastroenterology/hepatology articles using Student's <i>t</i>-test. <b>Results:</b> The radiology articles demonstrated a lower total citation count per article (radiology: 29.7 ± .4 (mean ± SEM), n = 2063; gastroenterology/hepatology: 50.1 ± 1.4, <i>n</i> = 1335). The <i>intra-specialty</i> citation <i>count</i> was also lower in radiology articles than gastroenterology/hepatology articles (radiology: 12.9 ± .2, gastroenterology/hepatology: 19.6 ± .7; <i>P</i> < .001), both overall and in all article types. Additionally, the overall <i>intra-specialty</i> citation <i>rate</i> was not significantly different between the two specialties (radiology: 48.8% ± .5%; gastroenterology/hepatology: 47.1 ± .8%; <i>P</i> = .057), although the intra-specialty citation <i>rates</i> were higher in radiology original research and editorial article types. <b>Conclusions:</b> The significantly lower per-article intra-specialty citation <i>counts</i> in all radiology article types, a measurement that directly links to specialty IFs, may contribute to the lower impact factors of radiology journals compared with gastroenterology/hepatology ones.",Canadian Association of Radiologists journal = Journal l'Association canadienne des radiologistes,2023-Nov,"Gong B, Soyer P, McInnes MD, Patlas MN",4,2107,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

The objectives of our study are to identify and explore risk factors associated with burnout among gastroenterology nurses. Identifying the risk factors involved is an essential element for prevention programs. (2) Methods: We performed an analytical descriptive cross-sectional study. Burnout was measured using an adapted version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) questionnaire. Strength of association between burnout scores and risk factors was calculated using Fischer's exact test; (3) Results: Our subjects were all female nurses. Work-related risk factors, such as an increased workload and a large number of night shifts have been associated with burnout in nurses, together with a lack of physical activity. We found no significant associations with sociodemographic factors; (4) Conclusions: Gastroenterology nurses are affected by high levels of emotional exhaustion. Work-related risk factors and a sedentary lifestyle result in a greater prevalence of burnout. In this category of healthcare workers, preventive actions are needed. The physical activity outside work could be a protective factor for burnout, and an exercise program could contribute to the effectiveness of well-established burnout intervention programs.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020-Apr,"Socaciu AI, Ionut R, Barsan M, Ungur AP, Rajnoveanu AG",5,1383,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

37723605,Environmentally sustainable gastroenterology practice: Review of current state and future goals.,"The health-care sector contributes 4.6% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with gastroenterology playing a significant role due to the widespread use of gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. In this review, we aim to understand the carbon footprint in gastroenterology practice associated with GI endoscopy, conferences and recruitment, identify barriers to change, and recommend mitigating strategies. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was conducted to explore the carbon footprint in gastroenterology practice, focusing on endoscopy, inpatient and outpatient settings, and recruitment practices. Recommendations for mitigating the carbon footprint were derived. This narrative review analyzed 34 articles on the carbon footprint in gastroenterology practice. Carbon footprint of endoscopy in the United States is approximately 85,768 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emission annually, equivalent to 9 million gallons of gasoline consumed, or 94 million pounds of coal burned. Each endoscopy generates 2.1 kg of disposable waste (46 L volume), of which 64% of waste goes to the landfill, 28% represents biohazard waste, and 9% is recycled. The per-case manufacturing carbon footprint for single-use devices and reusable devices is 1.37 kg CO<sub>2</sub> and 0.0017 kg CO<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Inpatient and outpatient services contributed through unnecessary procedures, prolonged hospital stays, and excessive use of single-use items. Fellowship recruitment and gastrointestinal conferences added to the footprint, mainly due to air travel and hotel stays. Gastrointestinal endoscopy and practice contribute to the carbon footprint through the use of disposables such as single-use endoscopes and waste generation. To achieve environmental sustainability, measures such as promoting reusable endoscopy equipment over single-use endoscopes, calculating institutional carbon footprints, establishing benchmarking standards, and embracing virtual platforms such as telemedicine and research meetings should be implemented.",Digestive endoscopy : official journal of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society,2024-Apr,"Sonaiya S, Marino R, Agollari K, Sharma P, Desai M",5,2053,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
34387253,Updates in artificial intelligence in gastroenterology endoscopy in 2020.,"Artificial intelligence is becoming rapidly integrated into modern technology including medicine. Artificial intelligence has a wide range of potential in gastroenterology, particularly with endoscopy, given the required analysis of large datasets of images. The aim of this review is to summarize the advances of artificial intelligence in gastroenterology (GI) endoscopy over the past year. Computer-aided detection (CADe) systems during real-time colonoscopy have resulted in increased adenoma detection rate with no significant increase in procedure times. Deep learning techniques have been utilized to accurately assess bowel preparation quality, which would impact surveillance colonoscopy recommendations. For the upper GI tract, CADe systems have been developed to aid in improving the diagnosis of Barrett's neoplasia during real-time endoscopy. Artificial intelligence-assisted real-time endoscopy has been shown to reduce blind spots during EGD. The application of artificial intelligence in gastroenterology endoscopy remains promising. Advances over the past year include improved detection of GI neoplasia during endoscopy and characterization of lesions. Further research including randomized, multicenter trials are needed to further evaluate the use of artificial intelligence for real-time endoscopy.",Current opinion in gastroenterology,2021-Sep,"Moore M, Sharma P",2,1319,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

In this opinion review, we initially elaborate on the current status of the application of AI/ML-based software in gastroenterology. Currently, AI/ML-based models have been developed in the following applications: Models integrated into the clinical setting following real-time patient data flagging patients at high risk for developing a gastrointestinal disease, models employing non-invasive parameters that provide accurate diagnoses aiming to either replace, minimize, or refine the indications of endoscopy, models utilizing genomic data to diagnose various gastrointestinal diseases, computer-aided diagnosis systems facilitating the interpretation of endoscopy images, models to facilitate treatment allocation and predict the response to treatment, and finally, models in prognosis predicting complications, recurrence following treatment, and overall survival. Then, we elaborate on several challenges and how they may negatively impact the widespread application of AI in healthcare and gastroenterology. Specifically, we elaborate on concerns regarding accuracy, cost-effectiveness, cybersecurity, interpretability, oversight, and liability. While AI is unlikely to replace physicians, it will transform the skillset demanded by future physicians to practice.

We aimed to determine the prevalence of medical reversals in gastroenterology (GI) journals and characterize these reversals. We searched the American Journal of Gastroenterology, Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Gastroenterology, Gut, Hepatology, and the Journal of Hepatology, reviewing studies published in 2015-2019. We identified RCTs that tested an established clinical practice and produced negative results, considered tentative reversals. Any systematic review or meta-analysis that included the article was categorized as confirming the reversal, refuting the reversal, or providing insufficient data. During the 5-year period, we identified 5,898 original articles, of which 212 tested an established practice and 52 were categorized as unrefuted medical reversals (25% of articles testing standard of care). Of the reversals, 21 (40%) tested procedures and devices, 15 (29%) tested medications, and 8 (15%) tested vitamins/supplements/diet. Twenty-three (44%) considered the alimentary tract, 12 (23%) considered the liver, pancreas, or biliary tract, and 17 (33%) considered endoscopy. Thirty-eight (73%) were funded exclusively by non-industry sources. This review reveals a total of 52 reversals across all subfields of GI and medical, procedural, screening, and diagnostic interventions, occurring in 25% of randomized trials testing an established practice.

34009578,Gender equality in academic gastroenterology: a review of gastroenterology literature over four decades.,"Historically males have dominated the physician ranks, although in recent years, there has been an increase in the proportion of female doctors to redress this imbalance. With such attention being paid to gender equality in society, this study aimed to characterise the changing prevalence of female authorship of peer-reviewed published research with in the field of gastroenterology. In order to quantitatively assess the growth of female gastroenterologists, we decided to examine the changing face of gender equality within the field of academic gastroenterology from 1971 to 2010. All research published in the January and July issues of Gastroenterology from 1971 to 2010 was reviewed. The gender of the first author and last author (considered the senior author) of each study was recorded. Research was subsequently categorised by type: basic science research, clinical trials, and epidemiologic research. Data was analysed in 5-year time periods. Author gender could be identified from a total of 865 abstracts from 80 journal issues. In total, there were 120 (13.8%) female first authors and 91 (10.5%) female senior authors. Female first authorship has tripled since 1995, from 11% (1991-1995) to 32% (2006-2010). Female senior authorship has also tripled since 2000, from 7% (1996-2000) to 24% (2006-2010). Results demonstrated that there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of female authorship of published research in Gastroenterology since 1995. The increasing prevalence of females within the field of academic gastroenterology can therefore be extrapolated to demonstrate the growing numbers of female gastroenterologists in the entire field including clinical and academic gastroenterology.",Irish journal of medical science,2022-Apr,"Foley C, Harewood G, Benz E, Higgins L, Gibbons E, Kelly S, Cheriyan D",7,1723,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

34008116,Gender and Nationality Trends in Manuscripts Published in Prominent Gastroenterology Journals Between 1997 and 2017.,"Gender disparities remain in the field of gastroenterology (GI) despite the decreasing gender gap in the medical field overall. We sought to examine primary and last female authorship as a marker of academic opportunity and advancement to assess the proportion of women publishing in GI over 20 years (1997-2017). In this observational study, we assessed the gender and nationality of primary and last authors of original research manuscripts in three GI journals (Gastroenterology, Gut, and American Journal of Gastroenterology) across a 20-year period in 5-year intervals (in 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012). We used a validated gender-determining algorithm, genderize.io, to classify gender. Our primary outcome was the proportion of female primary and last authors, with secondary measures assessing trends in gender and nationality. Through the Genderize.io gender database, we were able to identify the gender for 3,673 (95.9%) of primary author names and 3,504 (95.4%) of last author names in the 3,615 manuscripts evaluated. Overall, there was a significant increase in female primary authors over time, from 18.1% in 1997 to 42.6% in 2017, a 6.0% increase per 5-year period (95% CI 4.8-7.2%). A similar trend was found for female last authors, however, at a slower rate, from 8.3% in 1997 to 24.7% in 2017, a 3.5% increase per 5 years (95% CI 2.5-4.4%). These trends were noted cumulatively, and in each journal individually. Manuscripts with a female last author were more likely to demonstrate a female primary author. Female authorship in high-impact gastroenterology journals has increased over time. Last authorship has lagged primary authorship in female representation and has increased more slowly over time. Interventions to reduce gender disparity in GI research should focus on the transition from first to last authorship.",Digestive diseases and sciences,2022-Feb,"Bhatia S, Cotton CC, Kim E, Angle H, Watts AE, Eluri S, Shaheen NJ",7,1839,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

Subsequently, we conducted a survey of all team members from participating offices. <b>Results</b>: Responses were obtained from 54 gastroenterology team members. Most respondents identified the correct answer regarding biosimilars, the nocebo effect, and SDM. Almost half (47.2%) of respondents scored their level of awareness regarding biosimilars prior to reading our educational materials as poor, and nearly one quarter (26.4%) indicated so for SDM. Improvement in scores after reading our materials was significant for both biosimilars and SDM (i.e. biosimilar: z = 6.276, p-value <0.001 and SDM z = 6.328, p-value <0.001). <b>Conclusions</b>: Educational efforts effectively increased the low baseline knowledge and awareness of biosimilars and SDM among gastroenterology team members. More educational projects focused on biosimilars and SDM are needed to reduce the nocebo effect and prevent hampering of the cost-savings of biosimilars.",Expert opinion on biological therapy,2021-Jan,"Ismailov RM, Pouillon L, Selinger CP, Khasanova ZD",4,1484,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

34112036,"Medical professional liability in gastroenterology: definitions, trends, risk factors, provider behaviors, and implications.","<b>Introduction:</b> Medical professional liability (MPL) is a notable concern for many clinicians, especially in procedure-intensive specialties such as gastroenterology (GI). Comprehensive understanding of the basis for MPL claims can improve gastroenterologists' practice, lower MPL risk, and improve the overall patient care experience. This is particularly relevant in the setting of the increasing average compensation per paid GI-related MPL claim, and evolving healthcare delivery patterns and regulations.<b>Areas Covered:</b> MPL claims are generally grounded in the concept of negligence, a broad term that may apply to situations involving medical errors, ameliorable adverse events, inadequate informed consent and/or refusal, and numerous others. Though often not directly discussed in GI training or thereafter, there are various mechanisms and behaviors that can alter (decrease or increase) MPL risk. Additional dimensions of MPL include telemedicine, social media, and vicarious liability. We discuss these topics as well as takeaways to mitigate risk, thus reducing unnecessary clinician anxiety, promoting professional development, and optimizing healthcare outcomes.<b>Expert Opinion:</b> MPL risk is modifiable. Strong provider-patient relationships, through effective communication, patient reassurance, and enhanced informed consent, decrease risk, as does thorough documentation. Conversely, provider 'defensive' mechanisms intended to decrease MPL risk, including assurance and avoidance behaviors, may paradoxically increase it.",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,2021-Aug,"Azizian J, Dalai C, Adams MA, Murcia A, Tabibian JH",5,1555,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

Montefiore's <i>Clinical Looking Glass</i> tool was used to define parameters for electronic medical record data extraction from 2015 to 2018. Two cohorts were generated, one representing referrals placed by <i>gastroenterology to otolaryngology</i> and a second representing referrals placed by <i>otolaryngology to gastroenterology</i>. The ICD-10 codes in both cohorts were reviewed and 13 distinct ""reason for referral"" categories were defined. The rates of referral for each category were then calculated for each of the referral cohorts. Otolaryngology referred to gastroenterology at a greater rate than gastroenterology referred to otolaryngology, despite seeing fewer total patients than gastroenterology. For referrals from gastroenterology to otolaryngology, the three most frequent referral reasons were oral cavity/oropharyngeal pathology (28.3%), dysphagia (28.3%), and gastroesophageal reflux disease/laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (GERD/LPRD) (11.3%). For referrals from otolaryngology to gastroenterology, the three most frequent referral reasons were GERD/LPRD (61.7%), dysphagia (18.6%), and esophageal pathology (5.3%). GERD/LPRD was more frequently referred out by otolaryngology than it was by gastroenterology, suggesting the need for further characterization of the discrepancy in management of a disease commonly treated by both specialties. The discrepant rates of referral for dysphagia also suggest a need to better understand what factors contribute to the differences in management of another clinical condition commonly assessed by both specialties. 4.","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",2020-Aug,"Haines A, Kohli N, Lerner BA, Lerner MZ",4,1850,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

38557953,Review article: Telecare in gastroenterology-Within the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.,"Telehealth is a growing model of care, greatly accelerated with the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Telecare is a synchronous audio-visual or audio-only format of health delivery. To evaluate the existing literature on telecare within adult gastroenterology subspecialties to determine if outcomes are comparable to traditional in-person consultations and to highlight the Pokapū Network, a local initiative in the Lakes Region of New Zealand, amongst these international findings. We completed an OVID MEDLINE search using the terms gastroenterology, endoscopy, digestive system, inflammatory bowel disease, functional, hepatology, liver, telemedicine, telehealth, videoconferencing, remote consultation, video clinic and telephone clinic. Patients showed positive attitudes towards telecare and, in several reports, would elect to have telecare consults in the future. Telecare reduces travel time and out-of-pocket costs for patients and the need for patients to take time off work. Generally, patients engaging with telecare show equivalent health outcomes to patients engaging with traditional models of care. Patients from ethnic minority groups or lower socio-economic backgrounds, or who are older, are less likely to complete a 'successful' telecare consult. Telecare is a useful model of care to allow gastroenterology centres to function within the context of COVID-19 isolation and beyond. It has significant benefits for patients who face geographical and financial barriers to accessing healthcare. Telecare models such as the Pokapū Network hold promise in reducing inequities for gastroenterology patients.

Progress in this field will be measured by whether AI implementation can lead to improved patient outcomes and more efficient clinical workflow for GI endoscopists. The aims of this article are to report the findings of a multidisciplinary group of experts focusing on issues in AI research and applications related to gastroenterology and endoscopy, to review the current status of the field, and to produce recommendations for investigators developing and studying new AI technologies for gastroenterology. A multidisciplinary meeting was held on September 28, 2019, bringing together academic, industry, and regulatory experts in diverse fields including gastroenterology, computer and imaging sciences, machine learning, computer vision, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health. Recent and ongoing studies in gastroenterology and current technology in AI were presented and discussed, key gaps in knowledge were identified, and recommendations were made for research that would have the highest impact in making advances and implementation in the field of AI to gastroenterology. There was a consensus that AI will transform the field of gastroenterology, particularly endoscopy and image interpretation. Powered by advanced machine learning algorithms, the use of computer vision in endoscopy has the potential to result in better prediction and treatment outcomes for patients with gastroenterology disorders and cancer. Large libraries of endoscopic images, ""EndoNet,"" will be important to facilitate development and application of AI systems. The regulatory environment for implementation of AI systems is evolving, but common outcomes such as colon polyp detection have been highlighted as potential clinical trial endpoints. Other threshold outcomes will be important, as well as clarity on iterative improvement of clinical systems. Gastroenterology is a prime candidate for early adoption of AI. AI is rapidly moving from an experimental phase to a clinical implementation phase in gastroenterology. It is anticipated that the implementation of AI in gastroenterology over the next decade will have a significant and positive impact on patient care and clinical workflows. Ongoing collaboration among gastroenterologists, industry experts, and regulatory agencies will be important to ensure that progress is rapid and clinically meaningful. However, several constraints and areas will benefit from further exploration, including potential clinical applications, implementation, structure and governance, role of gastroenterologists, and potential impact of AI in gastroenterology.",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,2020-Oct,"Parasa S, Wallace M, Bagci U, Antonino M, Berzin T, Byrne M, Celik H, Farahani K, Golding M, Gross S, Jamali V, Mendonca P, Mori Y, Ninh A, Repici A, Rex D, Skrinak K, Thakkar SJ, van Hooft JE, Vargo J, Yu H, Xu Z, Sharma P",23,2838,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
32818948,Moving Forward: Gradual Return of Gastroenterology Practice during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption of routine gastroenterology practice, which has resulted in the suspension of elective endoscopic procedures and outpatient consults. For the past months, the strategy was to mitigate infection risk for the healthcare team while still providing essential service to patients. Prolonged suspension of the outpatient clinics and endoscopy practice, however, is deemed unsustainable and could even be detrimental. It can compromise patient care and result in poor outcomes; hence, a well-crafted plan is needed for the gradual resumption of clinic operations and endoscopic procedures. As the world begins to transition to the ""new normal,"" there are new health and safety issues to consider. Adaptive measures like telemedicine and electronic health records should be utilized to facilitate patient care while minimizing exposure. Careful patient screening, adequate supply of personal protective equipment, effective infection-control policies, as well as appropriate administrative modifications are needed for a safe return of gastroenterology practice. Key Messages: Ensuring the safety of patients, caregivers, and healthcare workers should remain as top priority. To help ease the transition as we move forward from this pandemic, we present a review of recommendations to guide gastroenterologists and endoscopy unit administrators in the gradual return to gastroenterology practice.","Digestive diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2021-,"Francisco CP, Cua IH, Aguila EJ, Cabral-Prodigalidad PA, Sy-Janairo ML, Dumagpi JE, Raymundo NT, Gopez-Cervantes J, Co J",9,1432,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

39234774,Exploring the benefits and challenges of AI-driven large language models in gastroenterology: Think out of the box.,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved significantly over the past decades, from its early concepts in the 1950s to the present era of deep learning and natural language processing. Advanced large language models (LLMs), such as Chatbot Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is trained to generate human-like text responses. This technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of gastroenterology, including diagnosis, treatment, education, and decision-making support. The benefits of using LLMs in gastroenterology could include accelerating diagnosis and treatment, providing personalized care, enhancing education and training, assisting in decision-making, and improving communication with patients. However, drawbacks and challenges such as limited AI capability, training on possibly biased data, data errors, security and privacy concerns, and implementation costs must be addressed to ensure the responsible and effective use of this technology. The future of LLMs in gastroenterology relies on the ability to process and analyse large amounts of data, identify patterns, and summarize information and thus assist physicians in creating personalized treatment plans. As AI advances, LLMs will become more accurate and efficient, allowing for faster diagnosis and treatment of gastroenterological conditions. Ensuring effective collaboration between AI developers, healthcare professionals, and regulatory bodies is essential for the responsible and effective use of this technology. By finding the right balance between AI and human expertise and addressing the limitations and risks associated with its use, LLMs can play an increasingly significant role in gastroenterology, contributing to better patient care and supporting doctors in their work.","Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",2024-Nov,"Kral J, Hradis M, Buzga M, Kunovsky L",4,1783,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

33204839,Standardizing Endoscopy Training: A Workshop for Endoscopy Educators.,"Endoscopy education in the US traditionally follows the apprenticeship model, in which educators often have little formal training in education, and the acquisition of procedural skills by trainees relies heavily on procedure volume and learning by doing. A growing appreciation of the need to formally educate endoscopy trainers has led to the development of mandatory training curricula in other countries, but the implementation of such courses in the US has been limited. This 1-hour workshop aimed to provide educators the rationale and skills to offer a more standardized approach to procedural training. We implemented a 1-hour interactive workshop designed for both gastroenterology faculty and trainees. The four sections of the workshop focused on: (1) rationale for standardized approach, (2) verbal and physical preparation for training, (3) training using standardized language and avoidance of cognitive overload, and (4) providing feedback. Four interactive video cases followed by large-group discussion were included. A total of 13 gastroenterology faculty and trainees attended the workshop. Eight additional members of the gastroenterology faculty watched an online video of the workshop. Survey data revealed that the workshop was effective in helping faculty set goals with trainees (<i>M</i><sub>pre</sub> = 2.4, <i>M</i><sub>post</sub> = 3.6), identify standardized language to use during endoscopy (<i>M</i><sub>pre</sub> = 3.1, <i>M</i><sub>post</sub> = 3.8), and give feedback after sessions (<i>M</i><sub>pre</sub> = 3.4, <i>M</i><sub>post</sub> = 4.1). A 1-hour lecture-based interactive workshop with video cases was an engaging and effective introduction to formal endoscopy education techniques. The format was easy to incorporate into faculty conferences and can help bridge the current gap in formal endoscopy faculty training.",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,2020-Nov,"Huang C, Hopkins R, Huang K, Demers L, Wasan S",5,1860,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

There are limited studies comparing the stressful life events, social support, and risk of relapse in relapsed harmful alcohol users between psychiatry and gastroenterology departments.<b>Objective:</b> To compare the stressful life events, social support, and risk of relapse in relapsed harmful alcohol users between psychiatry and gastroenterology departments.<b>Methods:</b> Comparative, cross-sectional study design was used in males with harmful alcohol use as defined by AUDIT and with at least one relapse. Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale, Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale, and Alcohol Relapse Risk Scale were used.<b>Results:</b> Severity of alcohol harmful use was significantly higher in psychiatry patients than gastroenterology. Increased number of gastroenterology patients reported ""change in their sleeping habits"" as an important factor for relapse than psychiatry, which was not significant. Only stimulus-induced vulnerability was significantly increased in psychiatry patients compared to gastroenterology. Social support significantly correlated with the alcohol relapse risk scores in the psychiatry group, while in the gastroenterology, the severity of alcohol harmful use scores significantly correlated with total alcohol relapse risk scores.<b>Conclusions:</b> The individual stressors and the risk for relapse were different between the two groups. There was no difference in social support between the two groups. These findings can have implications for using these factors in relapse prevention strategies by focusing on the factors specifically found in each group. However, these findings have to be studied in a larger community sample.",Journal of addictive diseases,2021-,"J JM, Kunjumon NC, Ruben JP, Devarbhavi H",4,1846,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

There remains a scarcity of easily distributed, effective tools for faculty development in regard to teaching endoscopy. Based on a prior qualitative study, we developed a three-part trigger video to be used for discussion during a faculty development session. We utilized three role-play scenarios between a fellow and supervisor managing a gastrointestinal bleed in the endoscopy suite. We summarized the implementation and instructions in a faculty guide. We used a postsession survey to measure effectiveness of the faculty development session. This workshop has been successfully administered twice in 2018 with over 30 gastroenterologists and hepatologists involved in endoscopic teaching. Overall, all faculty have found the workshop useful in learning about endoscopic teaching behaviors and helpful in adjusting their own behaviors in endoscopic teaching. We developed a faculty development workshop specifically for teaching endoscopy to gastroenterology trainees that is widely generalizable to other programs.

The primary objective of this region-wide pilot study was to evaluate the response rate to a 31-item questionnaire. The secondary objectives were to estimate the prevalence of burnout in gastroenterology trainees within the East of England deanery (EoE) and identify common stressors that trainees experience. This was a cross-sectional study involving gastroenterology trainees from 16 hospitals across the EoE using a 31-item questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of the 22-item MBI-HSS and nine additional free-text questions. All gastroenterology trainees in the EoE were invited to complete the anonymised survey online. Data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively. The response rate for the survey was acceptable: 44.0% (40/91). 57.5% (23/40) of gastroenterology trainees reported emotional exhaustion. 23.5% (8/34) had depersonalisation and 63.9% (23/36) experienced low professional accomplishment. Burnout prevalence was 35.3% (12/34). 48.4% (15/31) of gastroenterology trainees were aware of professional support services within EoE. Stressors related to service requirements (eg, workload, staffing levels) and professional relationships with colleagues and patients were commonly reported: 65.6% and 25.0%, respectively. It is feasible to use a 31-item questionnaire in a national cohort of UK gastroenterology trainees for future burnout studies.

34144013,Impact of Inpatient Attending Specialty and Gastroenterology Consultation on Quality of Care of Patients Hospitalized with Decompensated Cirrhosis.,"Data suggest hospitalists are less adherent to quality indicators for decompensated cirrhosis, and gastroenterology consultation may improve adherence. We sought to evaluate the impact of inpatient attending specialty and gastroenterology consultation on quality of care for decompensated cirrhosis. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with decompensated cirrhosis admitted to gastroenterology or hospitalist service at the University of Michigan between 2016-2020. The primary outcome was adherence to nationally recommended inpatient quality indicators for ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Performance was calculated per patient admission as the proportion of quality indicators met vs quality indicators for which the patient was eligible. Quality indicator scores were compared between services using t-tests. We also evaluated the effect of gastroenterology consultation on quality indicator scores for patients admitted to hospitalist service. Clinical outcomes were compared using multivariable models adjusted for patient characteristics. Two hundred eighty-eight admissions were included (155 to gastroenterology service; 133 to hospitalist service). Quality indicator score for all admissions was 69.9% (standard deviation [SD] ± 24.2%). Quality indicator scores were similar between gastroenterology (69.9%, SD ± 23.6%) and hospitalist (69.8%, SD ± 25.1%) services (P = .913). There was no difference in quality indicator subscores for each complication between services. Hospitalists placed a gastroenterology consultation in 53.4% of admissions, and it was associated with higher albumin administration for patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (57.1% vs 25%, P = .044). Patients admitted to gastroenterology service had higher readmissions within 30 days (adjusted odds ratio = 1.95) and shorter length of hospitalization (adjusted rate ratio = 0.85).

Although it was previously limited in its use across the majority of health care in the US, telehealth is now a widely accepted system in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this unprecedented rapid expansion of telehealth within both new and established telehealth systems is not without challenges or quality concerns. In this report, we present our single-center experience from the past year where virtual care was already an integral part of our clinical practice in pediatric gastroenterology and review satisfaction data and quality measures from the COVID-19 era where our existing telehealth system expanded to nearly exclusive virtual care.",The Permanente journal,2021-Jan,"Leinwand K, Blodgett N, Ramraj R",3,913,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
33399332,The Impact of COVID-19 on Job Prospects and Educational Training for Pediatric Gastroenterology Fellows.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected graduate medical education with redistribution of trainees, altered clinical care, and decreased research. For graduating trainees, there remains concern that financial stability of health systems will affect the availability of new positions and hiring practices. This survey aims to evaluate the pandemic's impact from pediatric gastroenterology fellows' perspectives. An anonymous survey was distributed by e-mail from June 11 to July 1, 2020 to all North American pediatric gastroenterology and advanced training fellows. The survey was tailored for the fellows' year of training including questions on education, clinical experience, research, and job outlook. Of the 434 pediatric gastroenterology fellows, 145 completed the survey. Of all respondents, negative impact was reported in 52% on clinical training, 46% research projects, and 41% procedural confidence. A majority (93%) of third-year respondents had a job contract signed at the time of the survey; however, 18% of those contracts were subsequently altered with 5 respondents having job contracts rescinded due to hiring freezes. Fifty-four percent of first- and second-year fellow respondents reported concern regarding finding a job with the majority being second-year fellows (78%). The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the medical system and healthcare professionals. This survey identified significant impact on job acquisition for graduating pediatric gastroenterology fellows and other critical components of training, which are likely applicable to other pediatric trainees. The survey results raise questions about potential strategies to improve medical education and job search success for graduating trainees.",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,2021-Apr,"Irastorza LE, Hopson P, Ta A, Kemme S, Mallon D, Lee CK",6,1743,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

38813746,The Saudi Gastroenterology Association consensus on the clinical care pathway for the diagnosis and treatment of GERD.,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common problems encountered in outpatient general medicine and gastroenterology clinics. GERD may present with classic esophageal symptoms, extraesophageal symptoms, or mixed symptoms. The diagnosis and treatment of GERD are challenging due to the variety of symptoms and multifactorial pathophysiology. Since there is no consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of GERD in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Gastroenterology Association established an expert group to formulate a consensus on the clinical care pathway for the diagnosis and treatment of GERD to update health-care providers in Saudi Arabia. The expert group reviewed the literature including recently published international guidelines, clinical trials, and expert opinion and conducted virtual and in-person meetings. A total of 22 statements on the definition, diagnosis, and treatment of GERD were formulated, and three algorithms for the clinical care of GERD were developed with a detailed description for each step. The expert group endorsed the new definition of GERD, the practical principles of interpretation of the diagnostic GERD evaluation, and the practical guidance for GERD treatment including medical, surgical, and endoscopic therapy.

36518089,Evaluation of financial conflicts of interest and quality of evidence in Japanese gastroenterology clinical practice guidelines.,"Clinical practice guidelines assist healthcare professionals in providing evidence-based care. However, pharmaceutical companies' financial interests often influence guideline content. This study aimed to elucidate the magnitude of financial ties among Japanese gastroenterology guideline authors and the pharmaceutical industry. Using pharmaceutical company disclosed payment data, we evaluated financial conflicts of interest (COI) among Japanese Society of Gastroenterology guideline authors between 2016 and 2021. Additionally, we assessed the evidence quality supporting guideline recommendations and associations with financial COI. Finally, we evaluated author COI management during guideline development against global standards. Overall, 88.2% (231/262) of guideline authors received a median of $12 968 (interquartile range [IQR]: $1839-$70 374) in payments between 2016 and 2019 for lectures, writings, and consulting. Chairpersons received significantly higher payments (median: $86 444 [IQR: $15 455-$165 679]). Notably, 41 (15.6%) authors had undeclared payments exceeding declaration requirements. Low or very low-quality evidence supported 41.0% of recommendations. There was a negative association between the median 4-year payment per author and the proportion of recommendations based on low-quality evidence (odds ratio: 0.966 [95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.945-0.987], P = 0.002) and positive association with moderate-quality evidence (odds ratio: 1.018 [95% CI: 1.011-1.025], P < 0.001). Still, the Japanese Society of Gastroenterology guideline development process remains less transparent, with insufficient COI policies relative to global standards. There were extensive financial COI between pharmaceutical companies and guideline authors, and more than 40% of recommendations were based on low-quality evidence. More rigorous and transparent COI policies for guideline development adhering to global standards are warranted.",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,2023-Apr,"Murayama A, Kamamoto S, Murata N, Yamasaki R, Yamada K, Yamashita E, Saito H, Tanimoto T, Ozaki A",9,1958,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

Using data from the Web of Science (WoS), I examined 18,855 Gastroenterology-related articles published between 2000 and 2023. The analysis was conducted using Python within the PyCharm environment. I assessed the network at both macro and micro levels. Macro-level indicators included network density, clustering coefficient, components, and average path length. Micro-level indicators included degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality, which helped identify influential researchers and research groups. The analysis revealed an evolution from a fragmented and sparsely connected network in the early 2000s to a more interconnected structure in recent years. Despite the overall increase in network density and clustering, full integration was not achieved, with many researchers remaining in isolated clusters. Key researchers such as Gasbarrini G., Vandenplas Y., and Hassan C. were identified as central figures within the network, playing crucial roles in fostering collaboration. The study highlights the ongoing development of collaborative networks in Gastroenterology research, identifying influential researchers and groups that drive advancements in the field.

36947408,Recommendations on TNFα inhibitor biosimilar use in clinical practice: a comparison of European gastroenterology IBD guidance.,"Professional associations publish guidance advising gastroenterologists on prescribing biosimilars; however, guidelines differ between countries and change over time. This study aimed to map the presence and content of guidance from European gastroenterology associations on TNFα inhibitor biosimilar use and its development over time. Guidelines on biosimilar prescribing from national gastroenterology associations in the European Economic Area (EEA) partnered with the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) were collected. Treatment guidelines and biosimilar position papers from 2010 to 2022 were included. Data were extracted using a template. 26 of 30 EEA countries have an ECCO-partnered gastroenterology association, of which 14 (53.8%) had national guidelines addressing biosimilars, four (15.4%) followed ECCO's position, and three (11.6%) had treatment guidelines without mentioning biosimilars. From five countries (19.2%) no guidelines were retrieved. Among 18 countries with guidance, 14 (77.8%) associations endorsed initiating biological treatment with biosimilars, and 13 (72.2%) endorsed transitioning from originator to biosimilar. Nine associations published multiple guidelines over time addressing biosimilars; overall, their positions became more encouraging. The majority of gastroenterology associations endorsed biosimilar use. The lack of (up-to-date) guidelines for some associations indicates an area of improvement to support biosimilar use in clinical practice.",Expert opinion on biological therapy,2023-,"Meijboom RW, Barbier L, Druedahl LC, Sarnola K, Tolonen HM, Gardarsdottir H, Egberts TCG, Giezen TJ",8,1503,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
33481380,Baby Steps in the Right Direction: Toward a Parental Leave Policy for Gastroenterology Fellows.,"The American Board of Medical Specialties announced in July 2020 the adoption of a parental leave policy for residents and fellows allows for a minimum of 6 weeks of leave. This policy includes caveats: vacation and/or sick leave can be applied toward these 6 weeks, this leave can only be utilized once during training (whether for parental, caregiver, or medical leave), and this policy only applies to training programs of 2 or more years' duration. Although the new existence of a parental leave policy is a step in the right direction, trainees are in need of a more robust and evidence-based policy. There are particular challenges to be addressed in the male-dominated and procedural field of gastroenterology, in which women are underrepresented and female gastroenterology trainees are more likely to have career decisions limited around the availability of parental leave. This article reviews the evidence supporting the creation of a parental leave policy for gastroenterology fellows, with potential benefits to individual trainees as well as the field, in order to promote equity, recruitment, retention, and advancement of women in gastroenterology.",The American journal of gastroenterology,2021-Mar,Feld LD,1,1164,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

We conducted a nationwide survey to gastroenterologists in Spain. Information regarding demographics, training center characteristics, NGM training, self-reported interest, satisfaction with the Tier 1 skills recommended by the ANMS-ESNM, and perceived competence in the diagnosis and management of diseases in the spectrum of NGM was obtained. Surveys of 222 participants were analyzed (age 31 ± 3 years, 68% female, 77% specialists, 23% residents). During GI training, the average time spent on NGM was 4 (IQR 2-8) weeks, and 14% of participants reported they did not have any (0 weeks total) specific time dedicated to NGM in their training center. Ninety-two (41%) participants reported low satisfaction in the NGM skills obtained during training. There was a disparity in the skills acquired, being greatest for gastroesophageal reflux disease and lowest for colonic inertia (97% and 19% confident, respectively). Multiple regression analysis showed that the weeks of specific training in NGM was an independent factor associated with perceived satisfaction in the skills obtained (IC 95% 1.8-2.9, p < 0.001). Our data reveal a relevant deficit in training on NGM during gastroenterology fellowships and highlight the urgent need to extend and standardize the time allocated to learning NGM in the training programs, as training time correlates with satisfaction in the skills obtained.",Neurogastroenterology and motility,2025-Feb,"Alcala-Gonzalez LG, Alcedo J, Santander C, Suárez JF, Serra J",5,1659,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

To address this gap, we developed and piloted a culinary medicine course for a GI fellowship training program. The objective of this study is to describe the development, implementation, and acceptability of the course. A registered dietitian, a chef instructor, and a gastroenterology clinical professor trained in culinary medicine developed the four-class tailored curriculum and delivered the classes remotely. Each class had a theme related to commonly encountered GI disorders and included hands-on meal preparation, a nutrition lecture, and a patient case study discussion. Post-course feedback surveys were disseminated. Twenty-three GI physicians enrolled in the course and the attendance rates in classes 1-4 were 83%, 65%, 61%, and 48%, respectively. Among 15 completed feedback surveys, 80% reported that the class contents were either moderately or extremely useful and all endorsed the curriculum for other gastroenterologists.

37482914,The consequences of limited training in disorders of gut-brain interaction: Results from a national survey of gastroenterology trainees in the United Kingdom.,"Despite their high prevalence and burden, disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) are undertaught and underrepresented in medical curricula. We evaluated the exposure of UK gastroenterology trainees to DGBI and their comfort managing these conditions. An electronic survey was distributed to trainees via UK training program directors. The survey included questions on stage of training; subspecialty interest; access to DGBI training opportunities, and comfort levels with DGBI diagnosis and management. Responses were compared between junior and senior trainees, by subspecialty interest (luminal and non-luminal), by geographical region, and training program size. One hundred twelve trainees from across the UK participated (21.4% of national training post holders). Exposure to DGBI lectures (32.8% junior vs. 73.3% senior trainees, p = 0.00003) and clinics (9.0% junior vs. 42.2% senior trainees, p = 0.00003), increased with seniority. Regardless of seniority, most trainees were rarely comfortable making a DGBI diagnosis (39.5% senior vs. 33.9% junior trainees, p = 0.69), and were not comfortable initiating neuromodulators (50% senior vs. 25.8% junior trainees, p = 0.08).

38639677,AGA Clinical Practice Update on Pain Management in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Commentary.,"Pain is a common symptom among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although pain typically occurs during episodes of inflammation, it is also commonly experienced when intestinal inflammation is quiescent. Many gastroenterologists are at a loss how to approach pain symptoms when they occur in the absence of gut inflammation. We provide guidance in this area as to the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of pain among patients with IBD. This CPU was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology.

33067712,The growing gap between demand and availability of clinical psychology in Paediatric Gastroenterology: a retrospective analysis of clinical routine care.,"Clinical psychology intervention in paediatric gastroenterology is vital given the biopsychosocial aetiology of paediatric functional gastrointestinal disorders, and the psychological impact of chronic conditions. The aim was to assess the availability and benefit of clinical psychology in paediatric gastroenterology across the UK and Germany. A retrospective assessment of referrals (n = 936 referrals) to clinical psychology was performed at our tertiary paediatric gastroenterology centre between 2010 and 2018. The availability of clinical psychologists and outcome of psychology intervention for children with functional abdominal pain were also assessed. Access to clinical psychology across the UK and Germany was assessed using an online questionnaire. We observed a substantial rise in the number of clinical psychology referrals between 2010 and 2018. Increasing demand was not matched by sufficient increase in availability of clinical psychology, leading to longer waiting times. A major benefit of clinical psychology intervention was highlighted with 95% of patients (n = 20) reporting a significant reduction in symptoms. Of the 12 centres who responded, 11 centres have direct access to clinical psychology with a mean of 13% of patients requiring psychology referrals annually.Conclusion: Despite evidence of its benefit and increasing demand, there is insufficient access to clinical psychological services, highlighting the urgent need to address this important issue. What is known: • The biopsychosocial pathophysiology of functional gastrointestinal disorders involves a disordered brain-gut interaction, which emphasizes the close link between psychological factors and altered gut function. • Psychological intervention, as an adjunct to medical treatment, improves outcomes in paediatric patients with gastrointestinal (GI) disease such as functional gastrointestinal disorders and inflammatory bowel diseases What is new: • There is a rising number of referrals from paediatric gastroenterology to clinical psychology in our centre which is not met by a sufficient increase in the availability of clinical psychologists. Similarly, access to clinical psychological services is lacking in several paediatric gastroenterology centres in the UK and Germany. • Strategic action is required to address this important gap in the care of children suffering from GI diseases.",European journal of pediatrics,2021-Apr,"Wong E, Heuschkel R, Lindsay C, Benson S, Zilbauer M",5,2395,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
38637458,Women in Gastroenterology: What Is the Current Situation? Results of an Italian National Survey.,"Many women grow up dreaming of becoming doctors, preferring specialties that allow more focus on time outside the hospital and on family life. Nowadays, specialties, like gastroenterology, have still a significant gender gap. Based on this known discrepancy, a web-based questionnaire was designed by the Young Component of the Scientific Committee of the Federation of Italian Scientific Societies of Digestive Diseases 2023 (FISMAD) to examine the current situation of female gastroenterologists in Italy. The survey, designed specifically for this study, was sent by email to all female gastroenterologists and residents gastroenterologists, members of the three major Italian societies of Gastroenterology. A total of 423 female physicians responded to the survey: 325 (76.8%) had full-time employment, and only a few had an academic career (7.2%). The main occupations were outpatient clinics (n = 288, 68%) and diagnostic endoscopy (n = 289, 68.3%); only 175 (41.3%) performed interventional endoscopy. One hundred and forty-seven (34.7%) had the chance to attend a master in advanced or interventional endoscopy, while 133 (31.4%) faced disadvantages that enabled them to attend. Of the 244 (58%) who reported feeling underappreciated, 194 (79.5%) said it was due to gender bias. We found that women doctors considered themselves disadvantaged compared with men doctors due to career opportunities (n = 338), salary negotiations (n = 64), and training opportunities (n = 144).

Screening allows for removal of polyps before they turn to cancer or by identifying early-stage colorectal cancers, which are most treatable. The American College of Gastroenterology recently released an update of their 2009 recommendations, which includes average risk individuals between ages 45 and 49 years due to the increased incidence of early-onset colorectal cancers. They consider screening two types of screening options: (1) one-step colonoscopy, which is both diagnostic and therapeutic and (2) two-step options, all of which require a follow-up colonoscopy when the first step is positive. They added the recommendation of daily aspirin for some people aged 50 to 69 years. However, the recommendations for screening remain the same when people do take aspirin. They recommend endoscopists measure cecal intubation rates, adenoma detection rates, and withdrawal times to reduce postcolonoscopy cancers due to missed lesions. They also propose strategies to promote screening adherence and suggest health systems adopt them.

However, training satisfaction is important for physician retention and patient care. Although federal and state laws define the general training regulations and conditions, considerable variability still exists concerning their implementation in the healthcare units. Little is known about the expectations concerning training for gastroenterology board certification by trainers and trainees in Germany. This lack of data hinders discussion on and improvement of training in gastroenterology in Germany. assessment of preferred training conditions among trainers and trainees for board certification in gastroenterology in Germany. an anonymous, voluntary survey consisting of single- and multiple-choice questions utilizing the Likert scale and fill-in responses was circulated to all members of the German Society for Digestive and Metabolic Diseases (DGVS - Deutsche Gesellschaft für Gastroenterologie, Verdauungs und Stoffwechselerkrankungen), as well as through the student council mailing lists of all German medical schools. The survey aimed to assess the consent regarding the ideal implementation of training regulations for gastroenterology board certification. Department heads, senior physicians, board-certified physicians, and outpatient-care physicians were classified as trainers and residents and students as trainees. Subgroups defined by place of work, age, gender, professional position, employment status, and parental status were investigated. 958 responses were included in the final analysis. We found a broad consensus among trainers and trainees on most aspects of our survey. Considerable differences were seen in items on part-time work, overtime, protected time for research, and advanced endoscopy training. the broad consensus seen in this survey is indicative of a shared vision for training conditions among trainers and trainees. However, the areas of dissent identified in this survey may assist trainers to better understand the expectations of trainees.

For surgical trainees, 50 colonoscopies is deemed adequate. Two training pathways using different assessment methods make any direct comparison impossible. At the Mayo Clinic colonoscopy training of gastroenterology and colorectal surgery (CRS) fellows were merged in 2017, providing a unique opportunity to define the learning curves of CRS trainees using the Assessment of Competency in Endoscopy (ACE) evaluation tool. In a single-center retrospective descriptive study, ACE scores were collected on colonoscopies performed by CRS fellows over a period of 4 academic years. By calculating the average scores at every 25 procedures of experience, the CRS colonoscopy learning curves were described for each core cognitive and motor skill. Twelve CRS fellows (men, 8; women, 4) had an average prior experience of 123 colonoscopies (range, 50-266) during the general surgical residency. During CRS fellowship, an average of 136 colonoscopies (range, 116-173) were graded per fellow. Although the competency goals for a few metrics were met earlier, most motor and cognitive ACE metrics reached the minimum competency thresholds at 275 to 300 procedures. CRS fellows reached competency in colonoscopy at around 275 to 300 procedures of experience, a trajectory similar to previously reported data for gastroenterology fellows, suggesting little difference in the learning curves between these 2 groups. In addition, no trainee was deemed competent at the onset of training despite an average experience well over the 50 colonoscopies required during residency.",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,2022-Aug,"Sedlack RE, Sedlack AR, Kelley SR, League JB",4,1651,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

This was a retrospective cohort study comparing the 3-year citations of all full-length articles published in five major gastroenterology journals from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2012, tweeted by official journal accounts with those that were not. Multivariate analysis using linear regression was performed to control for journal impact factor, time since publication, article type, frequency of reposting by other users (""retweets""), and media addition to tweets. Secondary analyses were performed to assess the associations between article type or subtopic and the likelihood of social media promotion/engagement. A total of 1666 articles were reviewed, with 477 tweeted by the official journal account. Tweeting an article independently predicted increased citations after controlling for potential confounders (β coefficient=13.09; P=.007). There was significant association between article type and number of retweets on analysis of variance (ANOVA) (P<.001), with guidelines/technical reviews (mean difference 1.04, 95% CI 0.22-1.87; P<.001) and meta-analyses/systemic reviews (mean difference 1.03, 95% CI 0.35-1.70; P<.001) being retweeted more than basic science articles.

In this study the lived experiences of UK South Asian adults with IBD, including support from gastroenterology services, was investigated. A sample of 33 patients representing the diversity of the UK South Asian population were recruited through five gastroenterology clinics in England. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted, audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using the Framework approach. Although many experiences align with those of the general IBD population, participants believed that South Asian cultures and/or religions can lead to additional challenges. These are linked to: family and friends' understanding of IBD; self and family attributions regarding IBD; stigma surrounding ill health; the taboo of bowel symptoms; managing 'spicy food'; beliefs about food and ill health; roles within the family; living with extended family; the use of complementary and alternative therapies; and visits to family overseas. Religious faith helped many to cope with having IBD, but symptoms could hamper their ability to practise faith. Gastroenterology services were viewed positively, but unmet needs were identified, some of which were culturally specific. Gastroenterology services have an important role to play in helping patients to overcome the challenges they encounter in their everyday life, both by providing individual patients with culturally appropriate care and advice, and via interventions to increase awareness and understanding of IBD within wider South Asian communities.",Journal of Crohn's & colitis,2021-Jan,"Mukherjee S, Beresford B, Atkin K, Sebastian S",4,1706,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

32231425,Subtle skills: Using objective structured clinical examinations to assess gastroenterology fellow performance in system based practice milestones.,"System based practice (SBP) milestones require trainees to effectively navigate the larger health care system for optimal patient care. In gastroenterology training programs, the assessment of SBP is difficult due to high volume, high acuity inpatient care, as well as inconsistent direct supervision. Nevertheless, structured assessment is required for training programs. We hypothesized that objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) would be an effective tool for assessment of SBP. To develop a novel method for SBP milestone assessment of gastroenterology fellows using the OSCE. For this observational study, we created 4 OSCE stations: Counseling an impaired colleague, handoff after overnight call, a feeding tube placement discussion, and giving feedback to a medical student on a progress note. Twenty-six first year fellows from 7 programs participated. All fellows encountered identical case presentations. Checklists were completed by trained standardized patients who interacted with each fellow participant. A report with individual and composite scores was generated and forwarded to program directors to utilize in formative assessment. Fellows also received immediate feedback from a faculty observer and completed a post-session program evaluation survey. Survey response rate was 100%. The average composite score across SBP milestones for all cases were 6.22 (SBP1), 4.34 (SBP2), 3.35 (SBP3), and 6.42 (SBP4) out of 9. The lowest composite score was in SBP 3, which asks fellows to advocate for cost effective care. This highest score was in patient care 2, which asks fellows to develop comprehensive management plans. Discrepancies were identified between the fellows' perceived performance in their self-assessments and Standardized Patient checklist evaluations for each case. Eighty-seven percent of fellows agreed that OSCEs are an important component of their clinical training, and 83% stated that the cases were similar to actual clinical encounters. All participating fellows stated that the immediate feedback was ""<i>very useful</i>."" One hundred percent of the fellows stated they would incorporate OSCE learning into their clinical practice. OSCEs may be used for standardized evaluation of SBP milestones. Trainees scored lower on SBP milestones than other more concrete milestones. Training programs should consider OSCEs for assessment of SBP.",World journal of gastroenterology,2020-Mar,"Papademetriou M, Perrault G, Pitman M, Gillespie C, Zabar S, Weinshel E, Williams R",7,2388,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

We executed a consensus-based international strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis. Four general coordinators, six field coordinators, and 12 experts participated in the study. SWOTs were provided for the following fields: neurogastroenterology, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and upper gastrointestinal diseases; inflammatory bowel disease; pancreatology and biliary diseases; endoscopy; gastrointestinal oncology; and hepatology. The GASTROSWOT analysis highlights the following in the current state of the field of gastroenterology: the incidence and complexity of several gastrointestinal diseases, including malignancies, are increasing; the COVID-19 pandemic has affected patient care on several levels; and with the advent of technical innovations in gastroenterology, a well trained workforce and strategic planning are required to optimise health-care utilisation. The analysis calls attention to the following in the future of gastroenterology: artificial intelligence and the use of big data will speed up discovery and smarter health-care provision in the field; the growth and diversification of gastroenterological specialties will improve specialised care for patients, but could promote fragmentation of care and health system inefficiencies; and furthermore, thoughtful planning is needed to reach an effective balance between the need for subspecialists and the value of general gastroenterology services.",The lancet.

We aim to identify the gender-specific barriers of IM residents toward pursuing GI. We surveyed IM residents in the Northeast by emailing 168 IM programs a survey link to be distributed to their residents. A 4-point Likert barrier scale and bivariate analysis were performed with ""yes"" and ""no,"" where ""yes"" was analyzed as ""somewhat of a barrier"" and above. Females received a third table assessing female-specific barriers. Significance was set at < 0.05. Of 215 survey responses, 56.3% (n = 121) were female. Response rate could not be determined due to resident identity protection and inconsistent responses of survey dissemination from programs. Females had significantly greater concerns about fertility, maternity leave, radiation exposure, work-life balance, stress, and burnout compared to males (p < 0.05). For females, 48.7% felt a lack of gender diversity in GI, 54.6% felt a lack of female GI mentors, and 43.7% felt there is a lack of respect as a female in GI. No gender differences existed in motivation to pursue GI, exposure to GI, and access to GI mentors, or GI-related research. Our study reveals that female IM trainees had greater concerns surrounding fertility, radiation exposure, and maternity leave compared to male IM trainees. Lack of gender diversity and lack of female GI mentors were noted barriers for female IM trainees. Addressing these barriers may help increase female representation in GI.",Digestive diseases and sciences,2022-Nov,"Advani R, Arjonilla M, Guerson A, Taub E, Monzur F",5,1576,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
39452615,The United European Gastroenterology green paper-climate change and gastroenterology.,"Climate change, described by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2021 as 'the single biggest health threat facing humanity', causes extreme weather, disrupts food supplies, and increases the prevalence of diseases, thereby affecting human health, medical practice, and healthcare stability. Greener Gastroenterology is an important movement that has the potential to make a real difference in reducing the impact of the delivery of healthcare, on the environment. The WHO defines an environmentally sustainable health system as one which would improve, maintain or restore health while minimizing negative environmental impacts. Gastroenterologists encounter the impacts of climate change in daily patient care. Alterations in the gut microbiome and dietary habits, air pollution, heat waves, and the distribution of infectious diseases result in changed disease patterns affecting gastrointestinal and hepatic health, with particularly severe impacts on vulnerable groups such as children, adolescents, and the elderly. Additionally, women are disproportionally affected, since climate change can exacerbate gender inequalities. Paradoxically, while healthcare aims to improve health, the sector is responsible for 4.4% of global carbon emissions. Endoscopy is a significant waste producer in healthcare, being the third highest generator with 3.09 kg of waste per day per bed, contributing to the carbon footprint of the GI sector. Solutions to the climate crisis can offer significant health co-benefits. Steps to reduce our carbon footprint include fostering a Planetary Health Diet and implementing measures for greener healthcare, such as telemedicine, digitalization, education, and research on sustainable healthcare practices. Adhering to the principles of 'reduce, reuse, recycle' is crucial. Reducing unnecessary procedures, which constitute a significant portion of endoscopies, can significantly decrease the carbon footprint and enhance sustainability. This position paper by the United European Gastroenterology aims to raise awareness and outline key principles that the GI workforce can adopt to tackle the climate crisis together.",United European gastroenterology journal,2024-Nov,"Duijvestein M, Sidhu R, Zimmermann K, Carrington EV, Hann A, Sousa P, Touw HRW, van Hooft JE, Müller M",9,2151,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

34753657,An assessment of pancreatology education in North American pediatric gastroenterology fellowship programs.,"Within the last two decades, an increased incidence of acute pancreatitis (AP) has been reported in childhood, with some progressing to acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP) or chronic pancreatitis (CP). Training future pancreatologists is critical to improve the care of children with pancreatic diseases. There are no studies to assess whether the pediatric gastroenterology (GI) fellowship curriculum prepares specialists to care for children with pancreatic diseases. An electronic survey was distributed to all North American Pediatric Gastroenterology Fellows. The survey included 31 questions on pancreatology training including academic resources, research experience, clinical exposure, clinical confidence, and career plans. A total of 112 (25.8%) fellows responded from 41 (41/72, 56.9%) training centers in North America. Pancreas-specific didactic lectures were reported by 90.2% (n = 101); 49.5% (50/101) had at least quarterly or monthly lectures. Clinical confidence (Likert 4-5) was highest in managing and treating AP (94.6% and 93.8% respectively), relatively lower for ARP (84.8% and 71.4%) and lowest for CP (63.4% and 42.0%). Confidence in diagnosing both ARP and CP was associated with the variety of pancreatic diseases seen (p < 0.001) and total number of patients followed over a 6 month period (p = 0.04). Nine (8%) reported interest in specializing in pancreatology, 12 (10.7%) in pursuing research in the pancreatology. Trainee confidence is highest in managing AP, lowest in CP, and seems to be directly correlated with the variety of pancreatic diseases and number of patients followed.

Identification and treatment of depression and anxiety is crucial for disease management. Guidelines developed by the American College of Gastroenterology include recommendations for preventive health maintenance in patients with IBD to guide quality care. Chart audits in a private gastroenterology practice revealed that only 20% of patients with IBD were receiving recommended health maintenance. The aim was to increase effective preventive care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease by 50% by the end of 8 weeks. The quality improvement project consisted of four rapid Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. The interventions implemented for this quality improvement project included a patient questionnaire, an order sheet/order set, a case management log, and team engagement. Providers identified deficiencies and ordered needed health maintenance for 100% of patients with IBD. While effective preventive care orders increased, order completion rates were unchanged during the project. Patient questionnaires, order sheets, a case management log, and teamwork were successfully used by providers in a private gastroenterology practice to increase orders placed for preventive care in patients with IBD.

Gastroenterology and hepatology utilize multiple sources of information, including visual findings on endoscopy, radiologic imaging, manometric testing, genomes, proteomes, and metabolomes. However, clinical care is complex and requires a thoughtful approach to best deploy AI tools to improve quality of care and bring value to patients and providers. On the operational level, AI-assisted clinical management should consider logistic challenges in care delivery, data management, and algorithmic stewardship. There is still much work to be done on a broader societal level in developing ethical, regulatory, and reimbursement frameworks. A multidisciplinary approach and awareness of AI tools will create a vibrant ecosystem for using AI-assisted tools to guide and enhance clinical practice.

Publications from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 were reviewed from 29 journals. Gender of editorial board leadership, editorial board members, first, and senior authors was identified using publicly available data. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to assess for a relationship among editorial board, first author, and senior author gender and impact factor. Of 29 journals (median impact factor 5.55) with 357 journal issues and 8036 articles, there were 3 of 39 female chief editors (7.7%), 601 of 3455 female editorial board members (17.4%), 2547 of 8036 female first authors (31.7%), and 1390 of 7335 female senior authors (19%). No statistically significant correlations existed between impact factor and chief editor gender with gender distribution of editorial boards, first authors, or senior authors. Positive correlations existed between male-dominated editorial boards and male first (+.52, P = .005) and senior authorship (+.56, P = .002), whereas negative correlations occurred between male-dominated editorial boards and female first (-.51, P = .006) and senior authorship (-.56, P = .002). Positive correlations also existed between publication of first and senior authors of the same gender (+.57, men [P = .001]; +.58, women [P = .001]).

38507124,Implementation and Analysis of a 5-Year Online Esophageal Motility Curriculum for Gastroenterology Fellows.,"Motility disorders are frequently encountered in gastroenterology (GI) practice, yet a national structured training curriculum for GI fellows in motility disorders is lacking. Since GI fellowships vary considerably in opportunities for specialized esophageal motility (EM) training, novel educational technology may be leveraged to provide standardized EM curriculum to train GI fellows in esophageal manometry. GI fellows participated in an online EM learning program at a single academic center from 2017 to 2022. Fellows answered case-based questions and were provided with evidence-based, corrective feedback related to core EM learning objectives. The primary outcome was change in knowledge and comfort in interpretation and clinical application of EM studies. Sixty-nine fellows actively participated in the online EM curriculum. 65 fellows completed a pre-curriculum test, and 54 fellows completed a post-curriculum test. There was a cumulative improvement between pre-curriculum test and post-curriculum test scores from 70 to 87%, respectively (p < 0.001). Fellows had a mean improvement of 19% in questions as they progressed through the curriculum. Prior to enrolling in the EM course, 26% of fellows felt comfortable in interpreting EM studies compared to 54% of fellows after completion of the program (p < 0.001). An online, technology-based curriculum was effective in educating GI fellows on core competencies of EM. Fellows demonstrated improvement in proficiency of clinically important EM studies and increased comfort in interpreting EM studies.

We investigated the financial costs to authors for submitting and publishing manuscripts in gastroenterology (GI) journals in the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), and elsewhere. This was a cross-sectional study carried out from 11/1/2020 to 12/31/2020. We used the SCImago Journal and Country Rankings site to compile a list of gastroenterology and hepatology journals to analyze. We gathered information on the journals' Hirsch indices (h indices), SCImago Journal Rank (SJR), Impact Factor (IF), and base countries as of 2019, processing and publication fees, open access fees, time to first decision, and time from acceptance to publication. We used t-testing and linear regression modeling to evaluate the effect of geography and journal quality metrics on processing fees and times. We analyzed 97 GI journals, of which 51/97 (52.6%) were based in the US/UK while the other 46/97 (47.4%) were based elsewhere.

We also found that 11/51 (21.6%) of US/UK journals and 15/46 (32.6%) of non-US/UK journals had mandatory processing and publication fees. These tended to be significantly larger in the US/UK group than in the non-US/UK group (USD 2380 vs USD 1470, p = 0.04).

39466273,Resurgent Inflation and Its Impact on Medicare Reimbursements for Outpatient Gastroenterology Procedures.,"Rising healthcare costs have led to decreasing reimbursements for various procedures and providers. We chose to analyze Medicare reimbursement trends for 26 esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and 31 colonoscopy current procedural terminology (CPT) codes from 2018 to 2023 for hospital outpatient centers, ambulatory surgical centers (ASC), and gastroenterologists. We also wanted to look at the effects of inflation on these Medicare reimbursements. We calculated the nominal percentage change from 2018 to 2023 for each CPT code. We then took inflation data provided by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and calculated the real change in reimbursements from 2018 to 2023 for each of the 31 colonoscopy and 26 EGD CPT codes. Our results show that although nominal reimbursements to physicians have been steadily declining for performing gastrointestinal procedures, nominal reimbursements to hospital outpatient and ASC have been increasing from 2018 to 2023. After taking into account inflation, physicians saw significant decreases in real purchasing power for performing EGD and colonoscopies. ASC and hospital outpatient centers saw reimbursements keep up with inflation. Physician reimbursements for gastroenterology procedures make up a small portion of reimbursements by Medicare compared to Medicare reimbursements to facilities such as ASC and hospital outpatient centers. However, physicians have seen significant reimbursement cuts, whereas facilities have not. Moreover, higher inflation leads to increased expenses for gastroenterology practices. It remains to be seen how these reimbursement changes will affect patients access to care and physicians practice sustainability.",The American journal of gastroenterology,2025-May,"Patel DD, Amann ST, Hart B",3,1687,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
39134867,Yoga in Pediatric Gastroenterology.,"Pediatric use of yoga as an integrative medicine modality has increased in prevalence over the last several decades. In this article, we review the available evidence for yoga in pediatric gastrointestinal disorders. Evidence supports that in many pediatric disorders of gut brain interaction (DGBI), including irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal pain and functional dyspepsia, yoga decreases pain intensity and frequency and increases school attendance. Yoga has been shown to improve health-related quality of life and improve stress management as an effective adjunct to standard medical therapy in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Further studies are needed regarding optimal frequency, duration of practice and evaluation of the impact on IBD disease activity measures. Yoga may benefit pediatric gastroenterology patients with DGBIs and IBD through improving quality of life and reducing pain. Future yoga studies could investigate biomarkers and continued research will help integrate this modality into routine pediatric gastroenterology care.",Current gastroenterology reports,2024-Dec,"Peropat F, Abbas MI, Perez ME, Yu EL, Leiby A",5,1073,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
31836530,Approaches and Challenges to Management of Pediatric and Adult Patients With Eosinophilic Esophagitis.,"Treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis has progressed from elemental formula for children and esophageal dilation for adults to selective exclusion of food triggers and swallowed topical corticosteroids. Management guidelines are available from the American Gastroenterological Association and the Joint Task Force on Allergy Immunology Practice Parameters. We cannot, however, evaluate the efficacy of treatments without a definition of response. We propose a treat-to-target approach, based on symptoms and findings from endoscopy and histology. This approach addresses dissociations between outcomes, such as symptom persistence despite normalization of histologic features and symptom resolution after esophageal dilation despite histologic features of active disease. Eosinophilic esophagitis can now be treated with biologic agents that target specific immune pathways, and findings from prospective trials have indicated that less-restrictive, empiric, elimination diets can be effective and reduce the need for repeated endoscopic assessment of disease activity during food reintroduction. We also discuss eosinophilic esophagitis subtypes, factors associated with disease, and advances in management.",Gastroenterology,2020-Mar,"Hirano I, Furuta GT",2,1208,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
39377560,Collaboration between registered dietitians and gastroenterologists in cystic fibrosis care: Results of an international cross-sectional survey.,"Collaboration between registered dietitians and gastroenterologists has not been evaluated in cystic fibrosis (CF). We surveyed registered dietitians and gastroenterologists regarding the current participation of gastroenterologists in CF centers and identified possible areas to enhance partnership between the two disciplines. An anonymous online survey was distributed targeting registered dietitians and gastroenterologists involved in CF care through three international listservs (CF Nutrition, CF DIGEST, and PEDGI) over a 6-week period. SurveyMonkey was used, and informed consent was obtained. A total of 131 respondents participated in this survey, including 80 registered dietitians and 51 gastroenterologists (41 pediatric and 10 adult gastroenterologists). Most respondents (82%) were from the United States, and two-thirds had ≥5 years of experience in CF. A significant number of registered dietitians reported the nonavailability of gastroenterologists for collaboration and there was greater availability of gastroenterologists in pediatric centers. Barriers to interdisciplinary collaboration included lack of CF expertise and dedicated time among the gastroenterologists and difficulties in coordinating the gastroenterology clinics. More gastroenterologists than registered dietitians perceived that they worked collaboratively with the other discipline in various domains (clinical care, quality improvement, research, presentations, and publications). Both disciplines had mutual respect and interest to further the collaboration. There is an increased need for gastroenterologist participation and collaboration (particularly in adult centers) in CF alongside registered dietitians to enhance comprehensive patient care. Future efforts should focus on training more gastroenterologists in CF and facilitating easier access to gastroenterologists for the CF population.",Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,2025-Feb,"Sankararaman S, Schindler T, Leonard A, Vavrina K, Bailey J, Thavamani A, Cummings LC, Mascarenhas M",8,1891,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

As AI applications for clinical medicine advance rapidly, there is a clear need for guidance surrounding AI-specific study design, evaluation, comparison, analysis and reporting of results. Several initiatives are in the publication or pre-publication phase including AI-specific amendments to minimum reporting guidelines for clinical trials, society task force initiatives aimed at priority use cases and research priorities, and minimum reporting guidelines that guide the reporting of clinical prediction models. In this paper, we examine applications of AI in clinical trials and discuss elements of newly published AI-specific extensions to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials statements that guide clinical trial reporting and development. We then review AI applications at the pre-trial level in both endoscopy and other subfields of gastroenterology and explore areas where further guidance is needed to supplement the current guidance available at the pre-trial level.",Digestive endoscopy : official journal of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society,2022-Jan,"Glissen Brown JR, Waljee AK, Mori Y, Sharma P, Berzin TM",5,1341,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
36797510,A National Survey of the Infrastructure and Scope of Practice for Gastroenterology Hospitalists.,"Hospital-based specialty-trained physicians have become more prevalent with emerging data suggesting benefit in consult and procedure volume, reduced complication rates, and increased practice productivity. Interest in gastroenterology (GI) hospitalist programs has increased in recent years. However, little is known regarding the types of GI hospitalist models that currently exist. To characterize the infrastructure of GI hospitalist models across the USA. A 50-question survey was distributed to the GI Hospitalist Special Interest Group of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. Information on demographics, hospital infrastructure, and compensation were collected. 31 of 33 (94%) GI hospitalists completed the questionnaire. Respondents were mostly male (65%), white (48%) or Asian (42%). Most GI hospitalists spent at least half of their clinical time dedicated to the inpatient consultation service (73%), during which they had no other clinical duties. Most services had endoscopy suites with dedicated inpatient endoscopy rooms (66%), over 4 h allotted for procedures (83%), and were available on weekends (62%). Over half of GI hospitalists reported having outpatient duties, the most common being performance of direct access endoscopy (69%). Outside of clinical responsibilities, GI hospitalists were most frequently involved in clinical education or fellowship program leadership (48%). Most GI hospitalists were salaried with an incentive-based bonus based on work relative value units.

39361197,"Need for a More Objective, Inclusive, and Equitable Selection Process for Gastroenterology Fellowships.","Diseases related to the digestive system account for a significant proportion of the diseases burden in the United States and result in 36.8 million ambulatory visits, 3.8 million hospital admissions, and 22.2 million gastrointestinal endoscopies. To meet the challenge that this quantum of gastroenterological disorders poses, we are obligated to select and train competent gastroenterologists. Admission into a Gastroenterology (GI) fellowship program is highly selective. In 2023, only 62.7% of candidates who applied were successful in matching into a fellowship program, making it even more competitive than a cardiology fellowship (match rate of 68.4%). Therefore, it is imperative that we ensure that the selection process is fair and transparent. Additionally, we need to be socially more responsible by emphasizing diversity and inclusivity to produce gastroenterologists who reflect the changing society we live in. An analysis of current practices indicates that the process of selection is not standardized and is more subjective than objective. This review is an attempt to identify deficiencies that can be rectified by the introduction of a standardized system that includes structured interviews, Standard Letters of Recommendation (SLOR), and objective scoring protocols-all of which would make the process of selection more equitable, diverse, and inclusive.

Machine learning (ML) refers to a model that learns from past data to predict future data. Medicine and particularly gastroenterology and hepatology, are data-rich fields with extensive data repositories, and therefore fruitful ground for AI/ML-based software applications. In this study, we comprehensively review the current applications of AI/ML-based models in these fields and the opportunities that arise from their application. Specifically, we refer to the applications of AI/ML-based models in prevention, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of gastrointestinal bleeding, inflammatory bowel diseases, gastrointestinal premalignant and malignant lesions, other nonmalignant gastrointestinal lesions and diseases, hepatitis B and C infection, chronic liver diseases, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. At the same time, we identify the major challenges that restrain the widespread use of these models in healthcare in an effort to explore ways to overcome them. Notably, we elaborate on the concerns regarding intrinsic biases, data protection, cybersecurity, intellectual property, liability, ethical challenges, and transparency.

Pancreatic steatosis describes a disease ranging from infiltration of fat in the pancreas to pancreatic inflammation, and development of pancreatic fibrosis. There are multiple aetiologies of this condition, such as metabolic syndrome, alcohol intake, viral infections, toxins, congenital syndromes, etc. Pancreatic steatosis is usually diagnosed by trans-abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging. Fatty infiltration in pancreas may lead to pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus and may be a predisposing cause of pancreatic cancer. Now a day, pancreatic steatosis is a common incidental finding during abdominal ultrasonography for other reasons and is a new challenge in Gastroenterology.

33750544,A Novel Use of Artificial Intelligence to Examine Diversity and Hospital Performance.,"The US population is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse. Research suggests that cultural diversity within organizations can increase team potency and performance, yet this theory has not been explored in the field of surgery. Furthermore, when surveyed, patients express a desire for their care provider to mirror their own race and ethnicity. In the present study, we hypothesize that there is a positive correlation between a high ranking by the US News and World Report for gastroenterology and gastrointestinal (GI) surgery and greater racial, ethnic, and gender diversity among the physicians and surgeons. We used the 2019 US News and World Report rankings for best hospitals by specialty to categorize gastroenterology and GI surgery departments into 2 groups: 1-50 and 51-100. Hospital websites of these top 100 were viewed to determine if racial diversity and inclusion were highlighted in the hospitals' core values or mission statements. To determine the rates of diversity within departments, Betaface (Betaface.com) facial analysis software was used to analyze photos taken from the hospitals' websites. This software was able to determine the race, ethnicity, and gender of the care providers. We examined the racial and ethnic makeup of the populations served by these hospitals to see if the gastroenterologists and surgeons adequately represented the state population. We then ran the independent samples t-test to determine if there was a difference in rankings of more diverse departments. Hospitals with gastroenterology and GI surgery departments in the top 50 were more likely to mention diversity on their websites compared with hospitals that ranked from 51-100 (76% versus 56%; P = 0.035). The top 50 hospitals had a statistically significant higher percentage of underrepresented minority GI physicians and surgeons (7.01% versus 4.04%; P < 0.001). In the 31 states where these hospitals were located, there were more African Americans (13% versus 3%; P < 0.001) and Hispanics (12% versus 2%; P < 0.001), while there were fewer Asians (4% versus 21%; P < 0.001) in the population compared with the faculty. We used artificial intelligence software to determine the degree of racial and ethnic diversity in gastroenterology and GI surgery departments across the county. Higher ranking hospitals had a greater degree of diversity of their faculty and were more likely to emphasize diversity in their mission statements. Hospitals stress the importance of having a culturally diverse staff, yet their care providers may not adequately reflect the populations they serve. Further work is needed to prospectively track diversity rates over time and correlate these changes with measurable outcomes.",The Journal of surgical research,2021-Apr,"Mathis MS, Badewa TE, Obiarinze RN, Wilkinson LT, Martin CA",5,2730,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

38798194,Systematic review: The use of large language models as medical chatbots in digestive diseases.,"Interest in large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, across multiple specialties has grown as a source of patient-facing medical advice and provider-facing clinical decision support. The accuracy of LLM responses for gastroenterology and hepatology-related questions is unknown. To evaluate the accuracy and potential safety implications for LLMs for the diagnosis, management and treatment of questions related to gastroenterology and hepatology. We conducted a systematic literature search including Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science Core Collection to identify relevant articles published from inception until January 28, 2024, using a combination of keywords and controlled vocabulary for LLMs and gastroenterology or hepatology. Accuracy was defined as the percentage of entirely correct answers. Among the 1671 reports screened, we identified 33 full-text articles on using LLMs in gastroenterology and hepatology and included 18 in the final analysis. The accuracy of question-responding varied across different model versions. For example, accuracy ranged from 6.4% to 45.5% with ChatGPT-3.5 and was between 40% and 91.4% with ChatGPT-4. In addition, the absence of standardised methodology and reporting metrics for studies involving LLMs places all the studies at a high risk of bias and does not allow for the generalisation of single-study results. Current general-purpose LLMs have unacceptably low accuracy on clinical gastroenterology and hepatology tasks, which may lead to adverse patient safety events through incorrect information or triage recommendations, which might overburden healthcare systems or delay necessary care.",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,2024-Jul,"Giuffrè M, Kresevic S, You K, Dupont J, Huebner J, Grimshaw AA, Shung DL",7,1723,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
32330565,Donning a New Approach to the Practice of Gastroenterology: Perspectives From the COVID-19 Pandemic Epicenter.,"The COVID-19 pandemic seemingly is peaking now in New York City and has triggered significant changes to the standard management of gastrointestinal diseases. Priorities such as minimizing viral transmission, preserving personal protective equipment, and freeing hospital beds have driven unconventional approaches to managing gastroenterology (GI) patients. Conversion of endoscopy units to COVID units and redeployment of GI fellows and faculty has profoundly changed the profile of most GI services. Meanwhile, consult and procedural volumes have been reduced drastically. In this review, we share our collective experiences regarding how we have changed our practice of medicine in response to the COVID surge. Although we review our management of specific consults and conditions, the overarching theme focuses primarily on noninvasive measures and maximizing medical therapies. Endoscopic procedures have been reserved for those timely interventions that are most likely to be therapeutic. The role of multidisciplinary discussion, although always important, now has become critical. The support of our faculty and trainees remains essential. Local leadership can encourage well-being by frequent team check-ins and by fostering trainee development through remote learning. Advancing a clear vision and a transparent process for how to organize and triage care in the recovery phase will allow for a smooth transition to our new normal.",Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,2020-Jul,"Sethi A, Swaminath A, Latorre M, Behin DS, Jodorkovsky D, Calo D, Aroniadis O, Mone A, Mendelsohn RB, Sharaiha RZ, Gonda TA, Khanna LG, Bucobo JC, Nagula S, Ho S, Carr-Locke DL, Robbins DH",17,1442,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

34690296,The Effect of a Didactic Course on Gastroenterology Nurses' Knowledge and Interest in Anorectal Manometry.,"Anorectal manometry may be performed by a nurse or physician, yet little has been written about what training is needed. Additionally, many gastroenterology nurses receive little exposure to motility studies such as anorectal manometry, limiting their ability to learn these procedures. We therefore sought to evaluate whether a short didactic course on anorectal manometry would increase nurses' knowledge about the procedure and stimulate their interest in becoming trained to perform it. To accomplish this, gastroenterology nurses attended a series of three lectures on anorectal manometry. A 15-question quiz was given as a pre-test and again as a post-test after completing the course. Thirteen nurses participated (11 female, mean age 46). None had experience performing anorectal manometry. Due to the course, test scores increased from a mean of 8.4 (55.9%) correct to 13.3 (88.7%) (p < .001), with improvements noted in 12 of 13 participants (92.3%). All of the nurses felt that the course increased their knowledge of anorectal manometry and reported that they would recommend it to other nurses. Most (61.5%) also expressed an interest in becoming trained to perform anorectal manometry. In conclusion, a short didactic course has been shown to increase nurses' knowledge and interest in performing anorectal manometry.",Gastroenterology nursing : the official journal of the Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates,,"Cohen DL, Richter V, Malikov I, Bermont A, Shirin H",5,1331,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

33611689,Impact of Fellow Participation During Colonoscopy on Adenoma Detection Rates.,"An endoscopist's adenoma detection rate (ADR) is inversely related to interval colorectal cancer risk and cancer mortality. Previous studies evaluating the impact of gastroenterology fellow participation in colonoscopy on ADR have generated conflicting results. We aimed to determine the impact of fellow participation, duration of fellowship training, and physician sex on ADR and advanced ADR (AADR). We retrospectively analyzed average-risk patients undergoing screening colonoscopy at Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Healthcare System Brooklyn Campus and Kings County Hospital Center. Review of colonoscopy and pathology reports were performed to obtain adenoma-specific details, including the presence of advanced adenoma and adenoma location (right vs. left colon). There were 893 colonoscopies performed by attending only and 502 performed with fellow participation. Fellow participation improved overall ADR (44.6% vs. 35.4%, p < 0.001), right-sided ADR (34.1% vs. 25.2%, p < 0.001), and AADR (15.3% vs. 8.3%, p < 0.001); however, these findings were institution-specific. Year of fellowship training did not impact overall ADR or overall AADR, but did significantly improve right-sided AADR (p-value for trend 0.03). Female attending physicians were associated with increased ADR (47.1% vs. 37.0%, p = 0.0037). Fellow sex did not impact ADR.

33403481,Addressing Gender Disparity: Increase in Female Leadership Increases Gender Equality in Program Director and Fellow Ranks.,"Women make up 15% of the total number of practicing gastroenterology (GI) physicians in the US. Despite this disparity, only 33% of the current GI fellows are female. Increasing female GIs is a major goal of all four GI societies. It is known that gender disparity exists in the field of gastroenterology, and women are underrepresented in the leadership ranks and trainee level at academic programs. Whether an increase in female leadership in academic medicine is associated with an increase in female program directors and trainees is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess this relationship in GI. Data were collected via a standardized protocol from all 173 US gastroenterology fellowship programs up until October 2018 from program websites and supplemented by online surveys completed by program coordinators. Any missing information was collected by calling the program coordinators. Data were collected on gender and academic rank of the program director, associate program director, division chief, chair of medicine, program size, academic center affiliation, number, and academic rank of female faculty and geographic region. The association was assessed using a Chi-square test or independent samples t test. In leadership positions, men were listed as comprising 86% of chairs, 82% of division chiefs, 76% of program directors and 63% of associate program directors. Forty-three percent of programs did not have female representation at any leadership level. The presence of a female program director or female associate program director was associated with an increase in the number of female fellows (4.03 vs 3.20; p = 0.076; 4.26 vs 3.36; p = 0.041), respectively. Overall, the presence of a female in any leadership position led to an increase in the number of female fellows (4.04 females vs 2.87 females; p = 0.007) enrolled in a program. If a GI division chief was male, the program director was more likely to be male as well (81% male vs. 18.8% female). Conversely, having a female division chief was likely to lead to a more equitable program director representation, 54% female to 48% male (p value < 0.0001, OR 5.03 95% CI 2.04-12.3). Furthermore, if either the internal medicine department chair or GI chief was female, the proportion of female program directors increased to 41% as compared to 19% if both were male (p value < 0.0001, OR 2.99 95% CI 1.34-6.6). Women are significantly underrepresented in the number of practicing gastroenterologists, at all levels of leadership in GI fellowship programs, and at the fellow level. Increasing the number of women in fellowship leadership positions is associated with an increase in female program directors and trainees. Per our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the relationship between female leadership in fellowship programs and the gender of trainees. Increasing female representation in leadership positions would not only address current gender disparity, but it may also increase the number of female future GI trainees.",Digestive diseases and sciences,2022-Feb,"Sethi S, Edwards J, Webb A, Mendoza S, Kumar A, Chae S",6,3023,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

Healthcare workers are at high risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gastroenterology and hepatology departments and specialists in Spain. This study involves a nationwide survey addressing the impact of COVID-19 on resources, procedures, and physicians of gastroenterology and hepatology departments in 81 hospitals representative of the Spanish National Health Service. Overall, 41.8% of hospital beds and 40.7% of gastroenterology and hepatology beds were allocated to COVID-19 patient care, as well as 24.8% of gastroenterologists and 58.3% of residents. Outpatient visits, abdominal ultrasounds, and endoscopies were reduced by 81.8-91.9%. Nine large university hospitals had 75% and 89% reductions in therapeutic endoscopies and hepatocellular carcinoma surgery, respectively, with cancelation of elective liver transplant and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Prevalence of infected physicians was 10.6% and was dependent on regional population incidence (r = 0.74, P = 0.001), with 11% hospitalized and one physician dying. Up to 63.4% of physicians may have been infected before or shortly after Spain entered lockdown, 57% of them having recently performed endoscopies. Adequate protection was acknowledged in > 80% hospitals, but only 2.9% performed regular SARS-CoV-2 testing. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare delivery has been massive. A wave of gastroenterology-related complications is expected because of resource diversion.

39009918,Ethical Implications of Artificial Intelligence in Gastroenterology: The Co-pilot or the Captain?,"Though artificial intelligence (AI) is being widely implemented in gastroenterology (GI) and hepatology and has the potential to be paradigm shifting for clinical practice, its pitfalls must be considered along with its advantages. Currently, although the use of AI is limited in practice to supporting clinical judgment, medicine is rapidly heading toward a global environment where AI will be increasingly autonomous. Broader implementation of AI will require careful ethical considerations, specifically related to bias, privacy, and consent. Widespread use of AI raises concerns related to increasing rates of systematic errors, potentially due to bias introduced in training datasets. We propose that a central repository for collection and analysis for training and validation datasets is essential to overcoming potential biases. Since AI does not have built-in concepts of bias and equality, humans involved in AI development and implementation must ensure its ethical use and development. Moreover, ethical concerns regarding data ownership and health information privacy are likely to emerge, obviating traditional methods of obtaining patient consent that cover all possible uses of patient data. The question of liability in case of adverse events related to use of AI in GI must be addressed among the physician, the healthcare institution, and the AI developer. Though the future of AI in GI is very promising, herein we review the ethical considerations in need of additional guidance informed by community experience and collective expertise.",Digestive diseases and sciences,2024-Aug,"Aggarwal N, Drew DA, Parikh RB, Guha S",4,1558,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
34051985,AGA Technical Review on the Medical Management of Moderate to Severe Luminal and Perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease.,"The incidence and prevalence of Crohn's disease (CD) is rising globally. Patients with moderate to severe CD are at high risk for needing surgery and hospitalization and for developing disease-related complications, corticosteroid dependence, and serious infections. Optimal management of outpatients with moderate to severe luminal and/or fistulizing (including perianal) CD often requires the use of immunomodulator (thiopurines, methotrexate) and/or biologic therapies, including tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists, vedolizumab, or ustekinumab, either as monotherapy or in combination (with immunomodulators) to mitigate these risks. Decisions about optimal drug therapy in moderate to severe CD are complex, with limited guidance on comparative efficacy and safety of different treatments, leading to considerable practice variability. Since the last iteration of these guidelines published in 2013, significant advances have been made in the field, including the regulatory approval of 2 new biologic agents, vedolizumab and ustekinumab. Therefore, the American Gastroenterological Association prioritized updating clinical guidelines on this topic. To inform the clinical guidelines, this technical review was completed in accordance with the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. The review addressed the following focused questions (in adult outpatients with moderate to severe luminal CD): overall and comparative efficacy of different medications for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with or without prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists, comparative efficacy and safety of biologic monotherapy vs combination therapy with immunomodulators, comparative efficacy of a top-down (upfront use of biologics and/or immunomodulator therapy) vs step-up treatment strategy (acceleration to biologic and/or immunomodulator therapy only after failure of mesalamine), and the role of corticosteroids and mesalamine for induction and/or maintenance of remission. Finally, in adult outpatients with moderate to severe fistulizing CD, this review addressed the efficacy of pharmacologic interventions for achieving fistula and the role of adjunctive antibiotics without clear evidence of active infection.",Gastroenterology,2021-Jun,"Singh S, Proctor D, Scott FI, Falck-Ytter Y, Feuerstein JD",5,2282,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

PSRTs were developed by a multidisciplinary team of pediatric experts of allergy, gastroenterology, and pathology for both EoE and IBD based on available literature and validated scales. Likert surveys (range 1 low acceptance to 5 high acceptance) based on the Technology Acceptance Model assessed user acceptance of the developed PSRTs. The use of PSRTs was monitored via control charts. Overall, evaluation questionnaires achieved >80% response rates. Clinicians and pathologists reported moderate-to-high levels of Perceived Usefulness (median (interquartile range) for EoE PSRT: clinicians 4.0 (4.0, 5.0) and pathologists 3.5 (3.5, 4.0); and IBD PSRT: clinicians 4.0 (3.0, 4.0) and pathologists 4.0 (4.0, 5.0)) and Perceived Ease of Use (EoE PSRT: clinicians 4.5 (4.0, 5.0) and pathologists 4.0 (4.0, 4.0); and IBD PSRT: clinicians 4.0 (4.0, 5.0) and pathologists 4.0 (4.0, 5.0)) of the developed PSRTs. Control charts demonstrated 100% utilization by 2-5 months from launch. We demonstrate successful implementation of synoptic reporting for both pediatric EoE and IBD pathology. EMR synoptic reporting provides standardization of pathology reporting and improved methods of pathology data presentation, which could potentially optimize provider efficiency, clinician interpretation of pathology results and disease trajectory, patient care, and clinician satisfaction.",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,2024-Sep,"Huang JS, Lindgren A, Katibian DJ, Dickerson A, Aceves S, Mo J, Malicki D, Tucker SM",8,1923,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
38609760,The use of faecal microbiota transplant as treatment for recurrent or refractory Clostridioides difficile infection and other potential indications: second edition of joint British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) and Healthcare Infection Society (HIS) guidelines.,"The first British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) and Healthcare Infection Society (HIS)-endorsed faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) guidelines were published in 2018. Over the past 5 years, there has been considerable growth in the evidence base (including publication of outcomes from large national FMT registries), necessitating an updated critical review of the literature and a second edition of the BSG/HIS FMT guidelines. These have been produced in accordance with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence-accredited methodology, thus have particular relevance for UK-based clinicians, but are intended to be of pertinence internationally. This second edition of the guidelines have been divided into recommendations, good practice points and recommendations against certain practices. With respect to FMT for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), key focus areas centred around timing of administration, increasing clinical experience of encapsulated FMT preparations and optimising donor screening. The latter topic is of particular relevance given the COVID-19 pandemic, and cases of patient morbidity and mortality resulting from FMT-related pathogen transmission. The guidelines also considered emergent literature on the use of FMT in non-CDI settings (including both gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal indications), reviewing relevant randomised controlled trials. Recommendations are provided regarding special areas (including compassionate FMT use), and considerations regarding the evolving landscape of FMT and microbiome therapeutics.",The Journal of hospital infection,2024-Jun,"Mullish BH, Merrick B, Quraishi MN, Bak A, Green CA, Moore DJ, Porter RJ, Elumogo NT, Segal JP, Sharma N, Marsh B, Kontkowski G, Manzoor SE, Hart AL, Settle C, Keller JJ, Hawkey P, Iqbal TH, Goldenberg SD, Williams HRT",20,1578,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

Although pediatric gastroenterology fellows are expected to obtain training in the diagnosis and management of patients with these disorders, there is an ongoing concern for unmet needs and lack of exposure and standardized curriculum. In the context of tailoring training components, outcome and expressed needs of pediatric gastroenterology fellows and programs, members of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) and American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society (ANMS) developed guidelines for NGM training in North America in line with specific expectations and goals of training as delineated through already established entrustable professional activities (EPAs). Members of the joint task force applied their expertise to identify the components of knowledge, skills, and management, which are expected of NGM consultants. The clinical knowledge, skills and management elements of the NGM curriculum are divided into domains based on anatomic regions including esophagus, stomach, small bowel, colon and anorectum. In addition, dedicated sections on pediatric functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, research and collaborative approach, role of behavioral health and surgical approaches to NGM disorders and transition from pediatric to adult neurogastroenterology are included in this document.

32247224,High risk of disease-related malnutrition in gastroenterology outpatients.,"Disease-related malnutrition (DRM) in hospitalized patients is known to have significant negative impact on clinical outcomes. Meanwhile, DRM in gastroenterology outpatients is scarcely investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of unintentional weight loss (UWL) and reduced food intake (RFI) as contributors to the risk of DRM in outpatients. Furthermore, the aim was to investigate if UWL may be used as initial screening for DRM, based on the correlation between UWL and RFI. All outpatients visiting the clinics for Medical and Surgery Gastroenterology, Aalborg University Hospital, Denmark, during 1 wk in September 2018, were invited to participate. Data regarding UWL within the past 3 mo, RFI the past week, and nutritional impact symptoms (NIS) were collected in this questionnaire-based cross-sectional study. Descriptive analysis, χ<sup>2</sup> test, and multiple logistic regression analysis were used for statistics. Out of 348 eligible patients, 346 were included at the medical clinic (n = 170) and surgery clinic (n = 176). UWL occurred in 26%, with a mean weight loss of 7.1 kg (standard deviation [SD] 5.2), and 24% had RFI. A significantly increased risk of UWL was identified in patients with body mass index <18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (odds ratio 6.1; confidence interval 2.0-18.7; P = 0.003). NIS were more common in the medical clinic. The main self-reported reasons for NIS affecting UWL were lack of appetite (15% versus 12%), pain (14% versus 8%), and nausea (12% versus 3%). One in four outpatients experienced UWL to an extent that may have a significant negative impact on clinical outcome. A firm correlation was found between UWL and RFI. Thus, based on this superficial study, UWL may be used as initial screening for protein-energy malnutrition in the medical and surgery gastroenterology outpatient setting. The impact on clinical outcome and of early nutritional intervention in these settings need to be investigated.","Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2020-,"Holm MO, Mikkelsen S, Zacher N, Østergaard T, Rasmussen HH, Holst M",6,1977,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
33847628,Global research status of gastroenterology and hepatology: A bibliometrics study.,"There are no reports on global research status of gastroenterology and hepatology (GI). This study was conducted to reveal the current global research status and trends in GI. Articles published during 2009 to 2018 in international GI journals were retrieved from the PubMed database. The top 20 countries by output were determined. The gross domestic product (GDP) of each country was also retrieved to figure out the correlation between outputs in GI and economy. The 5 highest-ranking countries were compared in the number of total articles, articles per capita, articles published in top journals, the accumulated impact factor (IF), and average IF. Total articles and articles per capita of the 5 countries were conducted time-trend analysis. The frequently-used terms in titles and abstracts of articles published in 2009 and 2018 were retrieved to conduct co-occurrence analysis to figure out the change of research highlights in GI. A total of 120,267 articles were included, of which 116,485 articles were from 20 highest-output countries. There was a positive correlation between output and GDP (r = 0.921, P < .001). The USA, Japan, China, Italy, and the UK were the 5 highest-ranking countries. The USA was the largest contributor with 26,215 articles, accounting for 17.4% of the total, but with no significant increasing trend (P = .122). Other 4 countries all showed increasing trends (all P < .001). For articles per capita, Italy ranked 1st among the 5 countries with 1591.0 articles per 10 million. The USA showed a decreasing trend (P = .026), other 4 countries all showed increasing trends (all P < .001). The UK had the highest average IF (6.685). For change of research highlights, it is more inclined to research of endoscopy, inflammatory bowel diseases, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

39705703,Large Language Models in Gastroenterology: Systematic Review.,"As health care continues to evolve with technological advancements, the integration of artificial intelligence into clinical practices has shown promising potential to enhance patient care and operational efficiency. Among the forefront of these innovations are large language models (LLMs), a subset of artificial intelligence designed to understand, generate, and interact with human language at an unprecedented scale. This systematic review describes the role of LLMs in improving diagnostic accuracy, automating documentation, and advancing specialist education and patient engagement within the field of gastroenterology and gastrointestinal endoscopy. Core databases including MEDLINE through PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central registry were searched using keywords related to LLMs (from inception to April 2024). Studies were included if they satisfied the following criteria: (1) any type of studies that investigated the potential role of LLMs in the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy or gastroenterology, (2) studies published in English, and (3) studies in full-text format. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) studies that did not report the potential role of LLMs in the field of gastrointestinal endoscopy or gastroenterology, (2) case reports and review papers, (3) ineligible research objects (eg, animals or basic research), and (4) insufficient data regarding the potential role of LLMs. Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies-of Interventions was used to evaluate the quality of the identified studies. Overall, 21 studies on the potential role of LLMs in gastrointestinal disorders were included in the systematic review, and narrative synthesis was done because of heterogeneity in the specified aims and methodology in each included study. The overall risk of bias was low in 5 studies and moderate in 16 studies. The ability of LLMs to spread general medical information, offer advice for consultations, generate procedure reports automatically, or draw conclusions about the presumptive diagnosis of complex medical illnesses was demonstrated by the systematic review. Despite promising benefits, such as increased efficiency and improved patient outcomes, challenges related to data privacy, accuracy, and interdisciplinary collaboration remain. We highlight the importance of navigating these challenges to fully leverage LLMs in transforming gastrointestinal endoscopy practices.

38977524,Virtual Interviews in the Post-COVID-19 Emergency Era: Insights from the Gastroenterology Fellowship Applicants and Programs.,"Virtual interviews are still recommended for fellowship applications, 3 years after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Improving equity by reducing the cost for the applicants has been the most important reason for continuing virtual interviews. However, some argue that important information may be missed in a virtual setting. Our objective was to assess the perspective of Gastroenterology (GI) fellowship interviewers and applicants toward virtual interviews. We designed two different anonymous surveys directed at GI programs and GI applicants who were interviewed for GI fellowship programs from 2020 to 2022 and matched to a GI program. Survey links were emailed to the Program Directors (PDs) and Program Coordinators via the AGA listserv starting in January 2023. A descriptive analysis was performed using Excel, and Fisher's exact tests were performed using R version 4.3.1. Sixty-one applicants and 79 interviewers responded to our survey. More than 80% of applicants strongly agreed (n = 36; 59%) and agreed (n = 14; 23%) that they would prefer in-person interviews if money was not an issue. When applicants were asked about the interview format in order of their preference, ""in-person, hybrid, virtual"" was the most popular answer (n = 16; 26.2%). Most interviewers (n = 47; 59.5%) do not prefer virtual interviews over in-person interviews. Furthermore, some interviewers were rarely able to judge the applicants' interpersonal (n = 17; 21.5%) and ethical skills (n = 16; 20.3%). These results differed according to the type of interviewer (p = 0.013 and 0.018, respectively). Based on our survey, most programs still prefer in-person interviews. Despite the several advantages of virtual interviews, the majority of applicants would prefer an in-person setting if the financial burden was not a factor. Nonetheless, many applicants think that the cost savings outweigh all the disadvantages associated with virtual interviews. The lack of empathy, personal connections, and engagement may impact the ability of interviewers to judge and ultimately rank a candidate. The virtual interview is here to stay, and we need input from the applicants and the interviewers to make the process more productive.",Digestive diseases and sciences,2024-Sep,"Da Cunha T, Anderson JC, Vaziri H",3,2224,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

The essential matters that must be kept in mind in this situation are the hemorrhagic risk of the procedure, the indication for anticoagulation, and the pharmacology of anticoagulant drugs and platelet aggregation inhibitors. This review is based on publications retrieved by a selective search in PubMed and on the guidelines of the relevant specialist societies. Nearly all procedures in gastroenterology and visceral surgery can be performed under monotherapy with acetyl - salicylic acid. Other platelet aggregation inhibitors, such as clopidogrel or prasugrel, or anticoagulant drugs generally do not need to paused before diagnostic endoscopic procedures with a low risk of bleeding (<1.5%), but they must be paused before procedures in gastroenterology and visceral surgery where the risk of bleeding is high (≥ 1.5%). Bridging with heparin is reserved for patients with a very high risk of thromboembolism ( ≥ 5%). Knowledge of the current recommendations on the management of anticoagulants before gastroenterological and visceral surgical procedures gives the clinician a well-founded means of dealing with this complex and common clinical situation.",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,2022-Dec,"Aulinger BA, Saner FH, Stark K, Mayerle J, Lange CM",5,1382,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

The title page of case-history of 1600 patients admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology of this hospital from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 was sampled as a data source, and the primary and other diagnostic codes, operation or procedure codes involved in the title page of case-history were categorized and statistically analyzed. Of the 531 cases treated with gastrointestinal endoscopy in our hospital in 2021, coding errors were identified in 66 cases and unsuccessful DRG enrollment in 35 cases, including 14 cases with incorrect coding of the primary diagnosis (8 cases with unsuccessful DRG enrollment), 37 cases with incorrect coding of the primary operation (23 cases with unsuccessful DRG enrollment), and 8 cases with incorrect coding of both the primary diagnosis and the primary operation (4 cases with unsuccessful DRG enrollment). Analysis of 66 inpatient cases with coding problems showed a total of 167 deficiencies, including 36 deficiencies in major diagnoses, 84 deficiencies in other diagnoses, and 47 deficiencies in surgery or operation coding. The accuracy of coding of disease diagnosis and surgical operation is the basis for the smooth implementation of DRGs. The medical staff of this hospital has poor cognition of DRGs coding and fails to recognize the important role of the title page of case-history quality to DRGs system, and their attention to DRGs and knowledge base of disease classification coding should be improved. In addition, the high incidence of coding errors, especially the omission of disease diagnosis, requires increased training of physicians and nurses on clinical knowledge and requirements for DRGs medical records, thereby improving the quality of medical cases and ensuring the accuracy of DRGs information.",BMC health services research,2023-Dec,"Yuan B, Quan L",2,2038,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
38308450,Analysis of feeding and eating disorders in 191 children according to psychiatric or gastroenterological recruitment: The PEDIAFED cohort study.,"The DSM-5 classification introduced new Feeding and Eating Disorders (FED) diagnostic categories, notably Avoidant and Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID), which, like other FED, can present psychiatric and gastrointestinal symptoms. However, paediatric clinical research that focuses on children below the age of 12 years remains scarce. The aim of this study was first to investigate the clinical features of FED in a cohort of children, second to compare them according to their recruitment (gastroenterology or psychiatry unit). This non-interventional retrospective cohort study analysed 191 patients in a French paediatric tertiary care centre (gastroenterology n = 100, psychiatry n = 91). The main outcome variables were clinical data (type of FED, BMI, nutritional support, chronic diseases, psychiatric comorbidities, sensory, sleep, language disorders, gastrointestinal complaints, adverse life events, family history). The outcome was defined by a Clinical Global Impression of Change-score. FED diagnoses were ARFID (n = 100), Unspecified FED (UFED, n = 57), anorexia nervosa (AN, n = 33) and one pica/rumination. Mean follow-up was 3.28 years (SD 1.91). ARFID was associated with selective and sensory disorders (p < 0.001); they had more anxiety disorders than patients with UFED (p < 0.001). Patients with UFED had more chewing difficulties, language disorder (p < 0.001), and more FED related to chronic disease (p < 0.05) than patients with ARFID and AN. Patients with AN were female, underweight, referred exclusively to the psychiatrist, and had more depression than patients with ARFID and UFED (p < 0.001). The gastroenterology cohort included more UFED, while the psychiatry cohort included more psychiatric comorbidities (p < 0.001). A worse clinical outcome was associated with ARFID, a younger age at onset (p < 0.001), selective/sensory disorders and nutritional support (p < 0.05). ARFID and UFED children were diagnosed either by gastroenterologists or psychiatrists.

36227305,Medical provider satisfaction with integrated care in a pediatric gastroenterology clinic.,"Benefits of behavioral health (BH) integrated care (IC) in pediatric primary care have been demonstrated (Asarnow et al., 2015). Pediatric subspecialty care treats patients with high levels of medical and psychosocial vulnerability and complexity (Samsel et al., 2017), underscoring the need for increased IC. Medical provider satisfaction (MPS) with IC is highly relevant for the utilization and expansion of these services. The purpose of this preliminary study was to examine MPS related to BH IC services in a pediatric gastroenterology clinic. Eight pediatric gastroenterology providers working in an outpatient clinic completed a 32-item survey (adapted from Corso et al., 2016) assessing their satisfaction with integrated BH care services. Descriptive statistics were utilized to examine and summarize provider satisfaction data. Pediatric gastroenterology medical providers reported high levels of satisfaction with existing IC services and a preference for embedded versus colocated IC. They perceived provider-related and clinical benefits of IC, felt that addressing BH issues is important, and believed IC is a valued service. Medical providers expressed that they wanted expanded IC services, including an embedded psychologist at more locations, BH screenings for younger patients, and an electronic psychosocial screening process. The results of this study align with research findings regarding high medical provider satisfaction with IC in primary care and a preference for embedded BH services (Asarnow et al., 2015). While this preliminary study is small in scale, it is an important initial step to better understand MPS with IC in pediatric subspecialty care.

33434440,Representation by Gender of Recognition Award Recipients from Gastroenterology and Hepatology Professional Societies.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Recognition awards from professional medical societies play an important role in physicians' career advancement. Our aim was to evaluate the gender representation of award recipients from gastroenterology and hepatology societies. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> We analyzed the lists of award recipients from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, American College of Gastroenterology, American Gastroenterological Association, and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and determined the gender of these award recipients. The primary outcome was the overall representation of women physician award recipients as compared with the representation of women in the specialty. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Between 1941 and 2019, there were 921 awards, of which 77 (8.4%) were given to women and 844 (91.6%) to men. There was a significant increase in the proportion of women recipients over time, from 0% in 1970-1984 to 22.0% in 2015-2019 (<i>p</i> for trend <0.0001). Compared with the concurrent representation of women in the specialty, women physician recipients were underrepresented from 1970 to 1981 and 1984 to 2015, equitably represented from 1981 to 1984, and overrepresented from 2015 to 2019. Of the total number of awards in each category, women received 13.8% of teaching/mentorship awards and 3.8% of the highest achievement awards (<i>p</i> = 0.002). The proportion of women recipients varied among the societies, from 6.8% to 14.5%. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The representation of women physician recipients of gastroenterology and hepatology society recognition awards has generally been low until most recently, when it has surpassed the proportion of women in the specialty.

37582075,Patient safety improvement in the gastroenterology department: An action research.,"Patient safety is a global concern. Safe and effective care can shorten hospital stays and prevent or minimize unintentional harm to patients. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously monitor and improve patient safety in all medical environments. This study is aimed at improving patient safety in gastroenterology departments. The study was carried out as action research. The participants were patients, nurses and doctors of the gastroenterology department of Ayatollah Taleghani Hospital in Tehran in 2021-2022. Data were collected using questionnaires (medication adherence tool, patient education effectiveness evaluation checklist, and medication evidence-based checklist), individual interviews and focus groups. The quantitative data analysis was done using SPSS (v.20) and qualitative data analysis was done through content analysis method using MAXQDA analytic pro 2022 software. The majority of errors were related to medication and the patient's fault due to their lack of education and prevention strategy were active supervision, modification of clinical processes, improvement of patient education, and promotion of error reporting culture. The findings of the research showed that the presence of an active supervisor led to the identification and prevention of more errors (P<0.01). Regarding the improvement of clinical processes, elimination of reworks can increase satisfaction in nurses (P<0.01). In terms of patient education, the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.01); however, the mean medication adherence score was significantly different (P<0.01).

32274667,Impacting Underserved Communities as a GI Trainee.,"Gastroenterology fellowship programs commonly include VA and county hospitals whose patient populations consist of some of the most vulnerable and underserved populations in the country who have a multitude of socioeconomic hurdles that limit their ability to address ongoing medical issues, all while having a restricted political voice and receiving care in under-resourced clinical settings. Since trainees are integral to the care of these patients, they have available two approaches that can affect community and hospital-based change, namely quality improvement (QI) and healthcare advocacy. QI projects focused on optimizing colorectal cancer screening, and Helicobacter pylori testing/eradication can provide value at an institutional level. Healthcare advocacy can be approached through involvement in national gastroenterological associations or locally through means such as establishing a fellowship-based advocacy group similar to a journal club. Both routes enable trainees to positively impact underserved communities.",Digestive diseases and sciences,2020-Jun,"Zhornitskiy A, Nguyen A, Kaunitz J",3,1034,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

Radiation is a well-known health hazard. Gastroenterologists who perform FGEPs are required to protect themselves, patients, as well as nurses and radiologists engaged in examinations from radiation exposure. To achieve this, all gastroenterologists must first understand and adhere to the International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication. In particular, it is necessary to understand the three principles of radiation protection (Justification, Optimization, and Dose Limits), the As Low As Reasonably Achievable principle, and the Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRLs) according to them. This review will mainly explain the three principles of radiation exposure protection, DRLs, and occupational radiological protection in interventional procedures while introducing related findings.

34016884,Disparities in Telehealth Utilization Within Pediatric Gastroenterology: One Academic Center's Experience.,"While the use of telemedicine has accelerated significantly with the recent pandemic, it has also magnified disparities in access to telemedicine. This study aims to look at telemedicine utilization patterns within a large pediatric gastroenterology practice. A retrospective study of ambulatory care visits within Yale-New Haven Hospital's pediatric gastroenterology practice during the peak expansion of the telemedicine program was conducted. Zip code-level socioeconomic data were obtained using the Distressed Communities Index. A multivariate logistic regression to evaluate disparities between the use of video versus telephone visits was computed, and unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained. A total of 1273 clinic visits were included in analysis. The majority of the patients listed English as their preferred language, had private insurance, and identified as non-Hispanic White. When adjusting for co-variates, having public insurance/Medicaid was associated with decreased odds of having video over telephone visits (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.60; 95% CI 0.44-0.80). Those whose primary language was not English continued to have a statistically significant decreased odds of using video visits (Spanish aOR 0.24; 95% CI 0.13-0.44; other aOR 0.29; 95% CI 0.12-0.72). Within the adjusted multivariate logistic regression, race/ethnicity and SES were, however, no longer found to have a statistically significant decreased odds of video visits. The accelerated implementation of telemedicine within pediatric gastroenterology has given rise to disparities in its use. Further studies are needed to understand these disparities and develop interventions to lessen this gap in usage.",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,2021-Aug,"Puthenpura V, Du N, Hauptman L, Porto AF",4,1740,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

38833695,Implementation of a Web-Based Outpatient Asynchronous Consultation Service: Mixed Methods Study.,"Asynchronous outpatient patient-to-provider communication is expanding in UK health care, requiring evaluation. During the pandemic, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in Scotland expanded its outpatient asynchronous consultation service from dermatology (deployed in May 2020) to gastroenterology and pain management clinics. We conducted a mixed methods study using staff, patient, and public perspectives and National Health Service (NHS) numerical data to obtain a rounded picture of innovation as it happened. Focus groups (3 web-based and 1 face-to-face; n=22) assessed public readiness for this service, and 14 interviews with staff focused on service design and delivery. The service's effects were examined using NHS Grampian service use data, a patient satisfaction survey (n=66), and 6 follow-up patient interviews. Survey responses were descriptively analyzed. Demographics, acceptability, nonattendance rates, and appointment outcomes of users were compared across levels of area deprivation in which they live and medical specialties. Interviews and focus groups underwent theory-informed thematic analysis. Staff anticipated a simple technical system transfer from dermatology to other receptive medical specialties, but despite a favorable setting and organizational assistance, it was complicated. Key implementation difficulties included pandemic-induced technical integration delays, misalignment with existing administrative processes, and discontinuity in project management. The pain management clinic began asynchronous consultations (digital appointments) in December 2021, followed by the gastroenterology clinic in February 2022. Staff quickly learned how to explain and use this service. It was thought to function better for pain management as it fitted preexisting practices. From May to September 2022, the dermatology (adult and pediatric), gastroenterology, and pain management clinics offered 1709 appointments to a range of patients (n=1417). Digital appointments reduced travel by an estimated 44,712 miles (~71,956.81 km) compared to the face-to-face mode. The deprivation profile of people who chose to use this service closely mirrored that of NHS Grampian's population overall. There was no evidence that deprivation impacted whether digital appointment users subsequently received treatment. Only 18% (12/66) of survey respondents were unhappy or very unhappy with being offered a digital appointment. The benefits mentioned included better access, convenience, decreased travel and waiting time, information sharing, and clinical flexibility. Overall, patients, the public, and staff recognized its potential as an NHS service but highlighted informed choice and flexibility. Better communication-including the use of the term assessment instead of appointment-may increase patient acceptance. Asynchronous pain management and gastroenterology consultations are viable and acceptable. Implementing this service is easiest when existing administrative processes face minimal disruption, although continuous support is needed. This study can inform practical strategies for supporting staff in adopting asynchronous consultations (eg, preparing for nonlinearity and addressing task issues). Patients need clear explanations and access to technical support, along with varied consultation options, to ensure digital inclusion.",Journal of medical Internet research,2024-Jun,"Rzewuska Díaz M, Locock L, Keen A, Melvin M, Myhill A, Ramsay C",6,3354,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

This study evaluates the gender-specific factors that influence gastroenterologists to pursue careers in AE. An anonymous survey was distributed to gastroenterology fellows and attendings through various gastroenterology society online forums. Data were collected on demographics, training, mentorship, current practice, family planning, and career satisfaction. Women comprised 71.1% of the 332 respondents. 24.7% of female fellows plan to pursue an AE career compared with 37.5% of male fellows (P = 0.195). The main motivating factor for both genders was interest in the subject area. Interest in another subspecialty was the main deterring factor for both genders. Women were more deterred by absence of same-sex mentors (P < 0.001), perception of gender-based bias in the workplace (P = 0.009), family planning (P = 0.018), fertility/pregnancy risks from radiation (P < 0.001), and lack of ergonomic equipment (P = 0.003). AE gastroenterologists of both genders were satisfied with their career decision and would recommend the field to any fellow. Most respondents (64%) believed that more female role models/mentors would improve representation of women in AE. There are multiple gender-specific factors that deter women from pursuing AE. Increasing the number of female role models is strongly perceived to improve representation of women in AE.

Although majority of COVID-19 patients present with respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms are also seen. COVID-19 has also disrupted gastrointestinal endoscopy services in numerous ways. There are also concerns regarding the impact of these changes on gastrointestinal cancer screening and management of chronic gastrointestinal diseases. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the implications of COVID-19 for the practicing gastroenterologist. COVID-19 patients can have gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain and anorexia. Separate from the management of COVID-19 patients, there has been a reduction in endoscopy volume worldwide. This has also resulted in reduction/cessation of in-person clinic visits and an increasing use of telemedicine services. In addition, patients with certain chronic diseases like chronic liver disease or inflammatory bowel disease may have worse outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gastroenterologists need to rapidly adapt to the challenges being faced and need to make both systems and practice-based changes to the endoscopy unit and outpatient clinic practices.

To our knowledge, there is no prior literature on medical scribe impact on outpatient pediatric gastroenterology clinic operations. The primary aim of our study was to address this knowledge gap. Data were collected on encounters conducted by pediatric gastroenterology physicians at a tertiary center, during a summer scribe program. Scribes were trained and attended clinics in a nonrandomized fashion. Clinic efficiency was assessed by patient flow, tracked via the electronic medical record system. Medical note complexity codes, associated work relative value units (wRVUs), and note delinquency were compared between encounters with and without scribes. Patient satisfaction survey scores were compared between groups. One thousand nine hundred seventy encounters were included. Documented medical note complexity (and wRVUs), note delinquency, patient satisfaction, and perceived overall quality of service were similar between groups. Clinic time for established encounters was statistically shorter with scribes (median 18 vs 21 minutes, P = 0.01), a 14% reduction. No significant difference was noted in new encounter clinic time. The time to note completion was shorter for new encounters with scribes (2 vs 3 days, P = 0.048). More notes were finalized by the third day postencounter when a scribe was present (63% vs 57%, P = 0.02). The presence of medical scribes was associated with significantly more efficient clinic flow for established encounters and modest improvements in note completion rate.

The aim of this review is to address the growing concern of ERIs by evaluating the ergonomic risk factors and the efficacy of interventions and educational strategies aimed at mitigating these risks, including novel approaches. ERIs are highly prevalent, exacerbated by factors such as repetitive strain, nonneutral postures, suboptimal equipment design, and the procedural learning curve. Female sex and smaller hand sizes have been identified as specific risk factors. Recent guidelines underscore the importance of ergonomic education and the integration of ergonomic principles into the foundational training of gastroenterology fellows. Advances in equipment design focus on adaptability to different hand sizes and ergonomic positions. Furthermore, the incorporation of microbreaks and macrobreaks, along with neutral monitor and bed positioning, has shown promise in reducing the incidence of ERIs. Wearable sensors may be helpful in monitoring and promoting ergonomic practices among trainees. Ergonomic wellness is paramount for gastroenterology trainees to prevent ERIs and ensure a sustainable career. Effective strategies include ergonomic education integrated into curricula, equipment design improvements, and procedural adaptations such as scheduled breaks and optimal positioning. Sensor-based and camera-based systems may allow for education and feedback to be provided regarding ergonomics to trainees in the future.",Current opinion in gastroenterology,2024-Sep,"Gimpaya N, Tran WT, Grover SC",3,1513,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

33256004,Gastroenterology Procedures Generate Aerosols: An Air Quality Turnover Solution to Mitigate COVID-19's Propagation Risk.,"The growing fear of virus transmission during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has called for many scientists to look into the various vehicles of infection, including the potential to travel through aerosols. Few have looked into the issue that gastrointestinal (GI) procedures may produce an abundance of aerosols. The current process of risk management for clinics is to follow a clinic-specific HVAC formula, which is typically calculated once a year and assumes perfect mixing of the air within the space, to determine how many minutes each procedural room refreshes 99% of its air between procedures when doors are closed. This formula is not designed to fit the complex dynamic of small airborne particle transport and deposition that can potentially carry the virus in clinical conditions. It results in reduced procedure throughput as well as an excess of idle time in clinics that process a large number of short procedures such as outpatient GI centers. We present and tested a new cyber-physical system that continuously monitors airborne particle counts in procedural rooms and also at the same time automatically monitors the procedural rooms' state and flexible endoscope status without interfering with the clinic's workflow. We use our data gathered from over 1500 GI cases in one clinical suite to understand the correlation between air quality and standard procedure types as well as identify the risks involved with any HVAC system in a clinical suite environment. Thanks to this system, we demonstrate that standard GI procedures generate large quantities of aerosols, which can potentially promote viral airborne transmission among patients and healthcare staff. We provide a solution for the clinic to improve procedure turnover times and throughput, as well as to mitigate the risk of airborne transmission of the virus.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020-Nov,"Garbey M, Joerger G, Furr S",3,1860,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

A total of 101 children aged 4-18 years plus their mothers who were referred to an outpatient pediatric gastroenterology clinic were included in the first group. The second group consisted of 101 different children aged 4-18 years undergoing pediatric endoscopy. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was administered to mothers. Visual analog scale scores were obtained from the children to measure anxiety. The demographic characteristics of the groups were similar. The mean HADS anxiety score was 3.83 in mothers of the first group. The same score was significantly higher as (6.96) in the mothers whose children underwent an endoscopy (p < .001). The comparison of the depression scores revealed significantly higher scores in the endoscopy group. Visual analog scale values of the children revealed remarkably higher anxiety scores in the endoscopy group. About 5% of mothers in the first group and almost half of the mothers in the endoscopy group developed remarkable anxiety (>8 HADS anxiety).

36445050,Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic and Post-Vaccination Period on Gastroenterology Practice in Turkey.,"The sudden and intense burden due to the novel coronavirus (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has changed the priority of many health services. The highly contagious new variants and vaccination services have greatly impacted the daily practice of gastroenterologists. In the present study, we tried to evaluate the change in the daily practice of Turkish gastroenterologists in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the post-vaccination periods. A questionnaire was prepared using Google forms and sent online to 214 gastroenterologists registered with the Turkish Gastroenterology Association. Approximately half of the gastroenterologists moved their endoscopy unit or gastroenterology clinic to another location in the hospital during the pandemic and about one-third of the endoscopy units were completely closed. About 56% of the respondents reported the interruption of endoscopic procedures and inpatient services. In total, 85% of gastroenterologists thought that follow-up and treatment of chronic patients were disrupted due to patients obtaining their medicine directly from pharmacies. After the first case in Turkey, 74% of gastroenterologists worked in coronavirus disease 2019 patient care services, 28% of gastroenterologists were infected with coronavirus disease 2019, and 3% believed they had a cross-infected patient(s). A total of 78% of gastroenterologists reported that patient management became difficult due to the change in the priority of other departments, and 60% of gastroenterologists confirmed that they experienced a decrease in income. In the post-vaccination period, 70% of gastroenterologists returned to their pre-pandemic working schedule and 31% noticed an increase in endoscopic cancer detection. Prolongation of the pandemic has seriously damaged the practice of gastroenterology and multidisciplinary patient management.",The Turkish journal of gastroenterology : the official journal of Turkish Society of Gastroenterology,2023-Jan,"Gök Sargın Z, Düşünceli İ, Çelik Ü",3,1868,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
32858002,Gender dynamics in education and practice of gastroenterology.,"With an increasing number of women joining procedural fields, including gastroenterology, optimizing the work environment for learning, teaching, and clinical practice is essential to the well-being of both physicians and their patients. We queried female and male gastroenterologists on their beliefs toward the endoscopy suite environment, as well as their experiences in learning and teaching endoscopic skills. We distributed a web-based survey to 403 gastroenterology fellows and practicing gastroenterologists at 12 academic institutions and 3 large private practices. We used univariate and multivariate analysis to compare the responses of female and male gastroenterologists. The overall response rate was 32% (n = 130); 54 women and 61 men completed the survey in its entirety and were included in the analysis (15 respondents did not meet the inclusion criteria). Baseline demographics were comparable between the groups. Overall, fewer women than men were trained using tactile instruction (41% vs 67%; P = .004). Of those trained using tactile instruction, 60.3%, with no gender differences, felt it was also important for endoscopic learning. More women reported experiencing gender bias toward themselves during training (57.4% vs 13.1%; P = .001) as well as in their current careers (50.0% vs 9.8%; P = .001). When queried on treatment of gastroenterologists by endoscopy staff, 75.9% of women reported that men were treated more favorably, whereas 70.5% of men felt that both male and female gastroenterologists were treated equally. Inequities exist with regard to the experience of men and women in gastroenterology, and specific challenges for women may have an impact on their career choices and ability to safely and effectively learn, teach, and practice endoscopy.",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,2021-May,"Rabinowitz LG, Grinspan LT, Williams KE, Zylberberg HM, David Y, Kumta NA, Greenwald DA, Carr P, Kim MK",9,1788,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

As irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is highly correlated with social factors, healthcare disparities are important factors in the sociocultural model of IBS. We used healthcare utilization as a lens to examine potential racial disparities in IBS. We retrospectively matched 3823 IBS minority patients who self-identified as ""Hispanic,"" ""Black,"" or ""Asian"" to white IBS controls and examined the number of patients with gastroenterology consults, gastroenterology procedures, and IBS-related Primary Care visits within each cohort from 2003 to 2017. Minority IBS patients were less likely to receive a gastroenterology consult than white IBS controls. Both Black and Asian IBS patients were more likely to have an IBS-related Primary Care visit than white IBS controls. All 3 minority IBS cohorts received significantly more gastroenterology procedures compared to white IBS controls. Minority IBS patients are more likely to receive gastroenterology procedures than white IBS patients. Further studies are needed to determine whether increased procedure likelihood in minority IBS patients represents a communication gap between minority patients and their providers or patient preference.",Neurogastroenterology and motility,2021-May,"Silvernale C, Kuo B, Staller K",3,1340,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

The panel recognized the high and increasing prevalence of the disease and the consequent anticipated increase in liver-related complications and mortality. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in MAFLD patients; therefore, cardiovascular disease risk assessment and management is important. A simple and clear liver assessment and referral pathway was agreed upon, so that patients with more severe MAFLD can be linked to gastroenterology/hepatology care, while patients with less severe MAFLD can remain in primary care or endocrinology, where they are best managed. Lifestyle intervention is the cornerstone in the management of MAFLD. The panel provided a consensus on the use of statin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, pioglitazone, vitamin E, and metformin, as well as recommendations on bariatric surgery, screening for gastroesophageal varices and hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation in MAFLD patients.

39776129,DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF MICROSCOPIC COLITIS: POSITION PAPER ON BEHALF OF THE BRAZILIAN FEDERATION OF GASTROENTEROLOGY.,"Microscopic colitis (MC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the colon, primarily characterized by watery diarrhea, with normal or near-normal endoscopic findings. It encompasses two main subtypes: lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis. This position paper from the Brazilian Federation of Gastroenterology aims to review current evidence on the diagnosis and management of MC in Brazil, emphasizing the need for standardization across the country's healthcare systems. A comprehensive review of the latest scientific literature, clinical guidelines, and consensus statements was performed, focusing on randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, and cohort studies. The evidence was analyzed by a panel of gastroenterologists and pathologists specializing in MC. The recommendations were based on the consensus of the group, approved by the majority of the panel members. Histological examination with biopsies from multiple segments of the colon remains essential for the accurate diagnosis of MC, as endoscopic findings are often non-specific. Budesonide is the first-line treatment for inducing remission in most patients. However, alternatives such as immunosuppressants and biologics are available for those who are refractory to or intolerant of budesonide. Non-pharmacological interventions, including dietary and lifestyle modifications, can complement medical treatment. The need for long-term follow-up is highlighted due to the high recurrence rates and the impact of MC on the quality of life. Standardizing the diagnosis and treatment of MC in Brazil is crucial, given the significant regional disparities in healthcare access. This position paper provides evidence-based recommendations to optimize care and improve patient outcomes across diverse clinical settings in Brazil. Further research is needed to address the gaps in understanding the epidemiology and management of MC in underserved regions.",Arquivos de gastroenterologia,2024-,"Silva BCD, Azevedo MFC, Mello MK, Macedo MRF, Caetano JS, Moraes ACDS, Pessoa FSRP, Trevisan MADS, Imbrizi M",9,1925,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

We aimed to understand variations in practice amongst specialist pediatric gastroenterology centers (SPGIC) in the United Kingdom (UK). A survey questionnaire was sent to all UK SPGIC (n = 29) providing endoscopy services for CD diagnosis. It was divided into four main subgroups: analyzing diagnosis of CD through adherence to the ESPGHAN (2012) guidelines, post-diagnosis care and long-term follow-up and discharge from pediatric services. All 29 responded. NBP was implemented in 28 of 29 centers. Five of 29 centers had already stopped HLA-DQ2/DQ8 testing for NBP diagnosis. Twenty six of 29 centers were performing endoscopy on screening-identified children (mostly asymptomatic, ""at-risk"" patients). Diagnosis was communicated by a doctor in 65% SPGIC (n = 19). Most centers (n = 23) waited 6-12 months post-diagnosis to start gluten-free oats. Routine vitamin D supplementation was commenced by 4 of 29 centers. All centers repeated TGA-IgA to assess normalization but at varying times post-GFD. Follow-up was with a combination of doctors/dieticians (n = 26). Eleven of 29 centers discharged their patient to primary care. There was excellent uptake of ESPGHAN guidelines (2012) in the UK and adherence to guidelines is generally good.

Pediatric gastroenterologist training and experience with endoscopic hemostasis and other complex therapeutic endoscopy procedures are often limited. We evaluated the impact of the implementation of an advanced complex endoscopy (ACE) team, which provides 24/7 inpatient/outpatient back-up endoscopy support. We analyzed hemostasis quality outcomes in the 2 years before implementation of ACE (2018-2020) versus the year following the implementation of ACE (2020-2021). We analyzed pediatric gastroenterology provider satisfaction and perspectives with a survey that was distributed to faculty, fellows, and advanced practice providers 1 month before implementation of ACE and again 12 months following ACE implementation. Endoscopy volume and outcome metrics for hemostasis procedures, including latency to endoscopy, need for reintervention, and administration/diversity of hemostatic therapy, including multimodal therapy, improved in the year following implementation of the ACE (p < 0.05 for each). Survey results demonstrated a positive impact on provider endoscopy experience and high utilization of ACE. Twenty-two percent of providers reported activating ACE in the prior month and 66% in the prior year. Most providers who activated ACE were very satisfied (85%) or satisfied (7.7%). Eighty-three percent noted ACE had a positive impact on inpatients, and 50% noted a positive impact on outpatient endoscopy. Provider anxiety with endoscopy diminished post-ACE implementation (62% vs. 28%). Respondents unanimously found ACE beneficial to patient care (100%).

37586392,Prevalence of delirium in gastroenterology/hepatology units: A cross-sectional study.,"Prevalence rates of delirium amount to 22.0% within acute-care settings. In contrast, 30-40% of patients with liver cirrhosis may develop hepatic encephalopathy, a condition that has been classified as a syndrome of delirium, based on recent pathophysiology findings. However, the prevalence of delirium in gastroenterology and hepatology units is unknown.The aims of the study were (i) to identify delirium prevalence rates in inpatients of gastroenterology/hepatology wards, (ii) to analyze the delirium motor subtype, and (iii) to assess associations between delirium and patient characteristics.In this monocentric, cross-sectional, epidemiological study, point prevalence was assessed at six time points in three gastroenterology/hepatology units within a German university hospital. Delirium was assessed using the 4 'As' Test (4AT) and delirium subtype by the delirium motor subtype scale. Patient characteristics were collected from patient charts.The sample consisted of 188 patients, aged 18 to 98 years (mean age 64, n=110 male). Of them, 18.1% of patients showed delirium symptoms (61.8% hypoactive, 29.4% mixed, and 8.8% hyperactive). For the participants aged ≥65 years (n=96), prevalence of delirium amounted to 26.0%. Significant associations were observed between delirium and the following characteristics: age (p=0.001), length of hospital stay until assessment (p=0.043), cerebrovascular disease (p=0.002), dementia (p=0.010), diabetes mellitus with chronic complications (p=0.012), and gender (nonsignificant trend, p=0.050), while no association was detected between moderate or severe liver disease and delirium (p=0.414).In conclusion, overall prevalence rates of delirium were rather low and did not increase in patients with liver disease.",Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie,2023-Oct,"Pazouki R, Hasselblatt P, Kugler C",3,1765,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
32574620,AGA Clinical Practice Update on Endoscopic Therapies for Non-Variceal Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Expert Review.,"The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update is to review the available evidence and best practice advice statements regarding the use of endoscopic therapies in treating patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. This review is framed around the 10 best practice advice points agreed upon by the authors, which reflect landmark and recent published articles in this field. This expert review also reflects the experiences of the authors who are gastroenterologists with extensive experience in managing and teaching others to treat patients with non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Endoscopic therapy should achieve hemostasis in the majority of patients with NVUGIB. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Initial management of the patient with NVUGIB should focus on resuscitation, triage, and preparation for upper endoscopy. After stabilization, patients with NVUGIB should undergo endoscopy with endoscopic treatment of sites with active bleeding or high-risk stigmata for rebleeding. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Endoscopists should be familiar with the indications, efficacy, and limitations of currently available tools and techniques for endoscopic hemostasis, and be comfortable applying conventional thermal therapy and placing hemoclips. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Monopolar hemostatic forceps with low-voltage coagulation can be an effective alternative to other mechanical and thermal treatments for NVUGIB, particularly for ulcers in difficult locations or those with a rigid and fibrotic base. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Hemostasis using an over-the-scope clip should be considered in select patients with NVUGIB, in whom conventional electrosurgical coagulation and hemostatic clips are unsuccessful or predicted to be ineffective. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Hemostatic powders are a noncontact endoscopic option that may be considered in cases of massive bleeding with poor visualization, for salvage therapy, and for diffuse bleeding from malignancy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Hemostatic powder should be preferentially used as a rescue therapy and not for primary hemostasis, except in cases of malignant bleeding or massive bleeding with inability to perform thermal therapy or hemoclip placement. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Endoscopists should understand the risk of bleeding from therapeutic endoscopic interventions (eg, endoluminal resection and endoscopic sphincterotomy) and be familiar with the endoscopic tools and techniques to treat intraprocedural bleeding and minimize the risk of delayed bleeding. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: In patients with endoscopically refractory NVUGIB, the etiology of bleeding (peptic ulcer disease, unknown source, post surgical); patient factors (hemodynamic instability, coagulopathy, multi-organ failure, surgical history); risk of rebleeding; and potential adverse events should be taken into consideration when deciding on a case-by-case basis between transcatheter arterial embolization and surgery. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Prophylactic transcatheter arterial embolization of high-risk ulcers after successful endoscopic therapy is not encouraged.",Gastroenterology,2020-Sep,"Mullady DK, Wang AY, Waschke KA",3,3569,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
38115292,Career selection trends among recent gastroenterology fellowship graduates.,"Various career paths exist for gastroenterology (GI) fellowship graduates across the country. These include further training, clinical or nonclinical job opportunities. Clinical career paths for those seeking jobs include academic positions or nonacademic positions (nonacademic hospital employed and private practice jobs). Data regarding career placement trends are limited. This study aims to explore temporal trends in career selection among new GI graduates. This is an observational cohort study. A list of GI fellowship programs was obtained from the FREIDA American Medical Association database. Programs with sufficient information on past graduate or alumni career placement after fellowship between 2017 and 2022 were included. Baseline characteristics and relevant information were collected. A Chi-square test was performed to assess the relationship between the categorical variables. A total of 203 GI fellowship programs were reviewed, among which only 21% (43/203) reported sufficient graduate career information. Across the 43 programs, 636 graduates were included. Thirty-three percent (210/636) of graduates were female. Forty-eight percent (308/636) of the graduates pursued nonacademic positions (nonacademic hospital employed and private practice jobs), 34% (216/636) into academic positions, and 17% (112/636) elected to do additional fellowship training. Both males and females were more likely to be employed in private practice (X2 = 12.8, df = 2, P = .002). Navigating through the decision-making process of selecting the first job after fellowship can be challenging. Our study reveals higher preference for nonacademic roles among graduates, consistent over 5 years, suggesting need to explore obstacles for academic positions or further training.",Medicine,2023-Dec,"Numan L, Jaber F, Husainat NM, Ahmed Z, Baliss M, Ghosh S, Bazarbashi AN, Palagiri J",8,1777,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

Patients usually present late in a decompensated state with varied complications. However, national data on the exact burden of the disease is lacking. The aim of this study was to find out the prevalence of liver cirrhosis among young adults admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology in a tertiary care centre. A descriptive cross-sectional study was done among patients admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology in a tertiary care centre between 25 November 2021 to 30 November 2022 after receiving ethical approval from the Institutional Review Committee [Reference number: 227(6-11)E2-078/079].

35704254,Evidence-Based Cognitive Endoscopy Simulators: Do They Exist? A Systematic Search and Evaluation of Existing Platforms.,"The development of guidelines by gastroenterology societies increasingly stresses evidence-based endoscopic practice. We performed a systematic assessment to determine whether endoscopic video teaching platforms incorporate evidence-based educational strategies and methods in order to disseminate guideline-based endoscopic management strategies. Platforms with a video component were systematically identified using the Google search engine, Apple and Android application stores, and searching four major gastroenterology society websites and three known platforms, to identify all relevant platforms. Two video samples from each teaching platform were reviewed independently by two authors and assessed for use of a priori defined principles of evidence-based medicine, as determined by consensus agreement and for the use of simulation. Fourteen platforms were included in the final analysis, and two videos from each were analyzed. One of the 14 platforms used simulation and incorporated evidence-based medicine principles consistently. Nine of the 14 platforms were not transparent in regard to citation. None of the platforms consistently cited the certainty of evidence or explained how evidence was selected. Education of guideline-based endoscopic management strategies using principles of evidence-based medicine is under-utilized in endoscopic videos. In addition, the use of cognitive simulation is absent in this arena. There is a paucity of evidence-based cognitive endoscopy simulators designed for fellows that incorporate systematic evaluation, and efforts should be made to create this platform.",Digestive diseases and sciences,2023-Mar,"Shah R, Kurin M, Satyavada S, Ismail M, Smith Z, Davitkov P, Isenberg G, Gottumukkala R, Faulx A, Falck-Ytter Y, Chak A",11,1615,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
38554432,The Rate of Burnout Syndrome in A Tertiary Gastroenterology University Center in Romania.,"The burnout syndrome (BOS) is commonly seen in healthcare professionals, particularly in physicians who are exposed to a high level of stress at work and has a negative impact on the medical activity. Physicians with BOS manifest a negative attitude, a reduction in compassion at work, and suboptimal patient care experiences. These all can lead to absenteeism, poor performance and more frequent medical errors. We aimed to assess the level of BOS in a tertiary gastroenterology university center in Romania. This observational study involved 40 physicians from a tertiary gastroenterology university center. An online questionnaire assessed the presence of BOS using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. A total of 40 physicians responded to the questionnaire. The prevalence of overall BOS of 87.5%. In terms of high burnout, 15 doctors (37.5%) had emotional exhaustion, 10 doctors (25%) had depersonalization, and 30 doctors (80%) scored low for personal achievement. Men presented more frequently emotional exhaustion and women lower personal achievement scores, but there was no significant statistical difference. No significant relationship was found between marital status or the number of children and BOS. We identified multiple risk factors associated to BOS, the most important one being strict internal regulations. Physicians presented an increased risk for BOS. The high rate of BOS among physicians found in our study requires careful attention. Further studies aiming to identify other factors that contribute to BOS and to identify measures to combat this syndrome are necessary.",Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,2024-Mar,"Dranga M, Chiriac S, Stanciu C, Cijevschi Prelipcean C, Timofeiov S, Trifan A",6,1592,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

Patients requiring GI care at a regional children's hospital between July 2020 and June 2021 were treated by an in-person or telehealth physician with physician assistant support, randomly assigned based on a weekly preset staffing schedule. A retrospective, multidomain program evaluation was performed based on the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) and STEM (SPROUT Telehealth Evaluation and Management) frameworks, using statistical analysis to compare the patient cohorts and anonymous surveys to assess provider perceptions. In total, 1051 patient-days of GI care were provided for 348 patients, 17% by telehealth and 83% in-person. There were no significant differences in diagnosis, transfer, or readmission rates between the cohorts. No transfers occurred for reasons other than need to access specialized services not available at the regional hospital. Daily consult workload was slightly greater for telehealth physicians. Primary and consult team providers accepted the practice. The model continued beyond the first year. In total, 75% of local GI physicians reported greater Brief Resilience Scores in the context of shifting 20% of their inpatient call weeks to another campus's physicians. Episodic pediatric GI consult service coverage via telehealth at a regional hospital was well accepted, useful, and sustainable, with improved physician resilience and no adverse outcomes seen.

33279517,AGA Clinical Practice Update on Medical Management of Colonic Diverticulitis: Expert Review.,"Colonic diverticulitis is a painful gastrointestinal disease that recurs unpredictably and can lead to chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastroenterologists commonly care for patients with this disease. The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide practical and evidence-based advice for management of diverticulitis. We reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies to develop 14 best practices. In brief, computed tomography is often necessary to make a diagnosis. Rarely, a colon malignancy is misdiagnosed as diverticulitis. Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and disease severity and course. In patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy. Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively rather than routinely in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Antibiotic treatment is strongly advised in immunocompromised patients. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients should consume a high-quality diet, have a normal body mass index, be physically active, not smoke, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use except aspirin prescribed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. At the same time, patients should understand that genetic factors also contribute to diverticulitis risk. Patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest with the first presentation. An elective segmental resection should not be advised based on the number of episodes. Instead, a discussion of elective segmental resection should be personalized to consider severity of disease, patient preferences and values, as well as risks and benefits.",Gastroenterology,2021-Feb,"Peery AF, Shaukat A, Strate LL",3,1876,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

33387591,Comparison of Aerodigestive and Nonaerodigestive Provider Responses to Clinical Case Vignettes.,"To evaluate differences in practice patterns between aerodigestive and nonaerodigestive providers in pediatric gastroenterology when diagnosing and treating common aerodigestive complaints. A questionnaire comprised of clinical vignettes with multiple-choice questions was distributed to both aerodigestive and nonaerodigestive pediatric gastroenterologists. Vignettes focused on management of commonly encountered general gastroenterology and aerodigestive issues, such as gastroesophageal (GE) reflux, aspiration, and feeding difficulties. Tests of equal proportions were used to compare rates of testing and empiric therapy within and across groups. Multivariate analysis was used to assess differences in response rates between aerodigestive and nonaerodigestive providers. A total of 88 pediatric gastroenterologists from 18 institutions completed the questionnaire. There were 35 aerodigestive gastroenterology providers and 53 nonaerodigestive gastroenterology providers. The nonaerodigestive group included 31 general gastroenterologists and 22 providers with self-identified subspecialty gastroenterology expertise. Aerodigestive specialists were more likely than nonaerodigestive gastroenterologists to pursue testing over empiric therapy in cases involving isolated respiratory symptoms (P < .05); aerodigestive providers were more likely to recommend pH-impedance testing, videofluoroscopic swallow studies, and upper gastrointestinal barium study (P < .05 for each test) depending on the referring physician. For vignettes involving infant GE reflux, both groups chose empiric treatments more frequently than testing (P < .001), although aerodigestive providers were more likely than nonaerodigestive providers to pursue testing like upper gastrointestinal barium studies (P < .05).

34140455,Survey Finds Gender Disparities Impact Both Women Mentors and Mentees in Gastroenterology.,"Gastroenterologists at all levels of practice benefit from formal mentoring. Much of the current literature on mentoring in gastroenterology is based on expert opinion rather than data. In this study, we aimed to identify gender-related barriers to successful mentoring relationships from the mentor and mentee perspectives. A voluntary, web-based survey was distributed to physicians at 20 academic institutions across the United States. Overall, 796 gastroenterology fellows and faculty received the survey link, with 334 physicians responding to the survey (42% response rate), of whom 299 (90%; 129 women and 170 men) completed mentorship questions and were included in analysis. Responses of women and men were compared. Compared with men, more women preferred a mentor of the same gender (38.6% women vs 4.2% men, P < 0.0001) but less often had one (45.5% vs 70.2%, P < 0.0001). Women also reported having more difficulty finding a mentor (44.4% vs 16.0%, P < 0.0001) and more often cited inability to identify a mentor of the same gender as a contributing factor (12.8% vs 0.9%, P = 0.0004). More women mentors felt comfortable advising women mentees about work-life balance (88.3% vs 63.8%, P = 0.0005). Nonetheless, fewer women considered themselves effective mentors (33.3% vs 52.6%, P = 0.03). More women reported feeling pressured to mentor because of their gender (39.5% vs 0.9% of men, P < 0.0001).

Potential barriers include multidrug regimen complexity or prescribing/administration errors. A pharmacist-managed <i>H pylori</i> treatment service was implemented to address these barriers and optimize treatment outcomes. The clinical pharmacist provided 2 services: (1) treatment education and monitoring for treatment-naïve patients and (2) treatment initiation, education, and monitoring for treatment-experienced patients. We aimed to evaluate the impact of a pharmacist-managed <i>H pylori</i> treatment service within a gastroenterology clinic. We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of all patients referred to and seen in the pharmacist-managed <i>H pylori</i> treatment service from July 10, 2019, to December 31, 2020. Patient demographics, prior treatment history, course(s) of treatment prescribed, frequency of follow-ups, and outcomes posttreatment were collected. The clinical pharmacist managed 60 referrals for 55 unique patients over a mean of 5 ± 2 visits. Five patients failed <i>H pylori</i> treatment and were re-referred. Identified barriers included prescribing/dispensing and administration errors. Posttreatment, 38 referrals tested for <i>H pylori</i> eradication, of which 100% of treatment-naïve patients and 69% of treatment-experienced patients were cured, and 13 (22%) referrals were lost to follow-up. This study described and assessed the impact of a pharmacist-managed <i>H pylori</i> treatment service in a gastroenterology clinic, in which various barriers were effectively addressed to optimize treatment outcomes.

We analyzed responses generated by ChatGPT to 16 dialog-based queries assessing symptoms and treatments for gastrointestinal conditions and 13 definition-based queries on prevalent topics in gastroenterology. Three board-certified gastroenterologists evaluated output appropriateness with a 5-point Likert-scale proxy measurement of currency, relevance, accuracy, comprehensiveness, clarity, and urgency/next steps. Outputs with a score of 4 or 5 in all 6 categories were designated as ""appropriate."" Output readability was assessed with Flesch Reading Ease score, Flesch-Kinkaid Reading Level, and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook scores. ChatGPT responses to 44% of the 16 dialog-based and 69% of the 13 definition-based questions were deemed appropriate, and the proportion of appropriate responses within the 2 groups of questions was not significantly different ( P = 0.17). Notably, none of ChatGPT's responses to questions related to gastrointestinal emergencies were designated appropriate. The mean readability scores showed that outputs were written at a college-level reading proficiency. ChatGPT can produce generally fitting responses to gastroenterological medical queries, but responses were constrained in appropriateness and readability, which limits the current utility of this large language model. Substantial development is essential before these models can be unequivocally endorsed as reliable sources of medical information.",Clinical and translational gastroenterology,2024-Nov,"Toiv A, Saleh Z, Ishak A, Alsheik E, Venkat D, Nandi N, Zuchelli TE",7,1816,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
31897896,Gender Differences in Hepatology Medical Literature.,"Studies suggest that gender differences in academic medicine exist. Men frequently have better measures of performance such as number of publications, number of citations, remuneration, and funding. To evaluate whether a gender disparity in authorship exists. We recorded the gender of first and senior authors of original papers, editorials/reviews from liver-related manuscripts in Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Transplantation, American Journal of Gastroenterology, and Liver Transplantation from January 2014 to 2016. Of 2424 articles reviewed, we excluded 232 (10%) due to inability to determine gender. Among papers analyzed, 72.0% were original and 28.1% reviews/editorials with 65.1% of first authors being male and 34.9% female. Only 20.3% of papers with multiple authors had a female senior author. The proportion of male first and senior authorship between original papers and reviews/editorials was comparable. 72% of original papers had a male as first or senior author, but only 28% females. 71% of review/editorial papers had a male as first or senior author, but only 29% females. When the senior author of an original paper was female, 47.1% of first authors were male and 52.9% female. When the senior author was male, 67.1% of first authors were male and 32.9% female (p < 0.00001). A significant gender difference exists in Hepatology publications. Female authorship mirrors the percentage of female AASLD membership; however, female senior authorship remains disproportionate. In general, funding for male authors is greater. Fewer women are first authors when the senior author is male, highlighting the importance of female mentorship in Hepatology.",Digestive diseases and sciences,2020-Oct,"Polanco NAP, McNally BB, Levy C, Carey EJ, Palomique J, Tran TT",6,1672,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
31651805,Exploring Use of Endoscopy Simulation in North American Pediatric Gastroenterology Fellowship Training Programs.,"Increasing evidence supports simulation-based training; however, limited data exist regarding its use in pediatric gastroenterology (GI). We explored the use of simulation-based endoscopy training in pediatric GI fellowship programs across North America. GI fellowship program directors (PDs) from the United States and Canada were surveyed between August to November 2018. The pretested, electronic survey comprised 3 sections: program demographics; details of current simulation-based training; and PDs' perceptions of endoscopy simulation. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Forty-three of 71 (61%) PDs responded (6 Canadian, 37 US). Programs were predominantly academic (95%) and enrolled 1.87 ± 1.01 fellows/yr. Twenty-four programs (56%) reported using simulation for endoscopy training, whereas 8 (19%) used simulation for nonprocedural education. Only 2 programs (5%) used endoscopy simulation for assessment. Of those using simulation (n = 24), upper endoscopy and colonoscopy were trained most frequently, and mechanical simulators were used most commonly. Eight programs (33%) required simulation training prior to clinical performance. Although 10 programs (42%) provided protected training time, only 2 (8%) tracked hours. Three programs (13%) reported having an organized curriculum and 6 (25%) train their endoscopic trainers. Cost, time constraints, and lack of a standardized curriculum were perceived as key barriers to integration. Most PDs reported a need for endoscopy simulation to train both technical and nontechnical skills; however, they felt simulation cannot replace clinical experience. PDs recognize the potential importance of endoscopy simulation, particularly for novices; however, only 56% report using it. Perceived barriers indicate the need for inexpensive portable simulators and a validated pediatric simulation curriculum to promote uptake.",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,2020-Jan,"Gabrani A, Monteiro IM, Walsh CM",3,1899,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
31125782,Best Practices in Teaching Endoscopy Based on a Delphi Survey of Gastroenterology Program Directors and Experts in Endoscopy Education.,"Teaching endoscopy is a key objective of gastroenterology (GI) fellowship programs but the best approach is not known. We sought to characterize which teaching competencies experts considered most critical for endoscopy education. We developed and refined 18 endoscopy teaching competencies based on literature review, personal experience, and interviews with experts. We invited GI fellowship program directors and endoscopy education experts to participate in a Delphi process to rate each proposed competency as essential, important but not essential, or not important using a 70% agreement threshold for consensus. Thirty-four GI fellowship program directors and 2 experts in endoscopy education participated (n = 36). Most survey participants were male (61.8%), associate professors (55.9%), and had performed at least a quarter of procedures with fellows (80.6%). Survey response rates were 94% (34 of 36) for round 1 and 91% (31 of 34) for round 2 (overall 31 of 36; 86.1%). After 2 rounds we achieved the predefined consensus level for most competencies. Fourteen of 18 competencies (77.8%) reached consensus after round 2: 10 (55.6%) were deemed essential and 4 (22.2%) were deemed important but not essential. Essential competencies included the following: discusses patient history and plans for procedure with trainee (100%), assumes control of procedure when trainee is unable to progress or if patient safety concerns arise (100%), maintains attention throughout the case (96.8%), and discusses the next steps in management for the patient (96.8%). In a national Delphi survey of endoscopy education experts, we identified 10 essential endoscopy teaching competencies.

Using a systematic PubMed search, we extracted GI randomized controlled trial reports published from 2011 to 2022. We describe time trends in proportions of females among first and last authors overall and within GI subspecialties and high-impact journals. The proportion of females increased from 25.4% to 36.8% and from 14.3% to 24.8% among first and last authors, respectively. Smaller increases in female authorship occurred in most subgroups, although there were proportionately fewer females among authors in high-impact journals and advanced therapeutic endoscopy publications. Over the past decade, female authorship in GI RCT reports has increased. However, female representation, particularly among senior authors and in high-impact journals, remains significantly lower.

37109748,The Promise of Artificial Intelligence in Digestive Healthcare and the Bioethics Challenges It Presents.,"With modern society well entrenched in the digital area, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to extract useful information from big data has become more commonplace in our daily lives than we perhaps realize. Medical specialties that rely heavily on imaging techniques have become a strong focus for the incorporation of AI tools to aid disease diagnosis and monitoring, yet AI-based tools that can be employed in the clinic are only now beginning to become a reality. However, the potential introduction of these applications raises a number of ethical issues that must be addressed before they can be implemented, among the most important of which are issues related to privacy, data protection, data bias, explainability and responsibility. In this short review, we aim to highlight some of the most important bioethical issues that will have to be addressed if AI solutions are to be successfully incorporated into healthcare protocols, and ideally, before they are put in place. In particular, we contemplate the use of these aids in the field of gastroenterology, focusing particularly on capsule endoscopy and highlighting efforts aimed at resolving the issues associated with their use when available.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2023-Apr,"Mascarenhas M, Afonso J, Ribeiro T, Andrade P, Cardoso H, Macedo G",6,1213,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

We developed and administered a 33-item electronic cross-sectional survey to members of 5 national GI and hepatology societies. Survey items were organized into thematic modules and solicited perspectives on racial and ethnic workforce diversity, health care disparities in GI and hepatology, and potential interventions to enhance workforce diversity and improve health equity. Of the 1219 survey participants, 62.3% were male, 48.7% were non-Hispanic White, and 19.9% were from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine. The most frequently reported barriers to increasing racial and ethnic diversity in GI and hepatology were insufficient representation of underrepresented racial and ethnic minority groups in the education and training pipeline (n = 431 [35.4%]), in professional leadership (n = 340 [27.9%]), and among practicing GI and hepatology professionals (n = 324 [26.6%]).

Appropriate surgical training is of paramount importance. In order to continuously improve training strategies, it is necessary to assess current practices. To determine how German bariatric surgeons have been trained and to assess current training strategies. Between February 2017 and March 2017, an online census of surgeons registered as members of the German Society for Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery was conducted. A total of three reminders were sent out. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Data was reported as median (interquartile range); percentages were adjusted for completed answers only. A response rate of 51% (n = 214) was achieved. Surgeons reported a median of 14.5 (8-20) years of surgical experience after initial training, with a specific bariatric experience of 7 (4-13) years. The total cumulative bariatric case volume was 240 (80-500) cases, with an annual case volume of 50 (25-80). The most commonly applied approaches to bariatric skills acquisition were ""learning by doing"" (71%), ""course participation"" (70%) and ""observerships"" (70%). Fellowships and the use of operating videos were less frequently applied strategies (19%/ 47%). Interestingly, observerships (94%) and course participation (89%) were rated as very important/important, whereas ""learning by doing"" (62%), watching operation videos (59%), and fellowships (48%) were less frequently perceived as important/very important training strategies.

35694986,A Primer into the Current State of Artificial Intelligence in Gastroenterology.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is not a new idea or field of research. However, recent advancements in computing technology as well as increasing worldwide experience in applying AI to various fields have enabled us to hope that applying it to the medical practice could improve outcomes. The aim of the article was to evaluate potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in the clinical practice of gastroenterology. AI algorithms can offer many benefits over the traditional diagnostic, prognostic, therapeutic scores, or non-AI enhanced procedures that we perform today. It can very easily process complex mathematical data, which would allow to account for many parameters and with highly sophisticated formulas to determine a conclusion, to a degree that would be impractical or impossible for a human to do alone in the clinical practice. This could allow for significantly more individualized treatments for each patient. As more data becomes available, it can be fed into the algorithm, which allows it to change based on the new data. However, we must be aware that most studies performed today are still early retrospective studies, and their utility still needs to be evaluated in future large scale prospective studies. Apart from the medical challenges, it must be noted that the impact of large-scale implementation of artificial intelligence will have challenges related to ethical and financial aspects as well.",Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,2022-Jun,"Moldoveanu AC, Fierbinteanu-Braticevici C",2,1436,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

SARS-CoV-2 relies on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor for cellular entry and the abundance of this receptor in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may help explain the GI manifestations, including dysgeusia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, present in over 40% of infected patients. GI tract involvement also raises the concern for oral-fecal transmission which is poorly understood. Outcome studies in COVID-19 patients with preexisting liver disease and inflammatory bowel disease show predominantly mild transaminase elevations and no increased risk from the use of biological agents in inflammatory bowel disease patients. High-dose corticosteroids, however, should be avoided. As endoscopic procedures are aerosol-generating, modifications to clinical practice is necessary to minimize the spread of COVID-19.

36850899,Practicing Digital Gastroenterology through Phonoenterography Leveraging Artificial Intelligence: Future Perspectives Using Microwave Systems.,"Production of bowel sounds, established in the 1900s, has limited application in existing patient-care regimes and diagnostic modalities. We review the physiology of bowel sound production, the developments in recording technologies and the clinical application in various scenarios, to understand the potential of a bowel sound recording and analysis device-the phonoenterogram in future gastroenterological practice. Bowel sound production depends on but is not entirely limited to the type of food consumed, amount of air ingested and the type of intestinal contractions. Recording technologies for extraction and analysis of these include the wavelet-based filtering, autoregressive moving average model, multivariate empirical mode decompression, radial basis function network, two-dimensional positional mapping, neural network model and acoustic biosensor technique. Prior studies evaluate the application of bowel sounds in conditions such as intestinal obstruction, acute appendicitis, large bowel disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease and bowel polyps, ascites, post-operative ileus, sepsis, irritable bowel syndrome, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and neonatal conditions such as hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

33120396,Usefulness of Testing for Fecal Calprotectin in Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinical Practice.,"Gastrointestinal tract symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and fever are common reasons for which parents take children to the pediatrician. An increasing prevalence of chronic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and a decrease in the median age of their onset indicate the need to search for new diagnostic methods for differentiating inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) from other gastrointestinal tract diseases. An example of a novel biomarker is fecal calprotectin (FC), which is considered a noninvasive and useful marker of intestinal inflammation. This review summarizes currently available information on the use of FC in the diagnosis and monitoring of IBD in children. Additionally, it attempts to determine the course of action depending on the concentration of FC. Application of FC determination within the framework of primary medical care can decrease the number of children unnecessarily referred either to endoscopic or radiologic examination. There is a double advantage of calprotectin screening; for patients, it reduces delays in diagnosis and unnecessary exposure to endoscopy, and for doctors, it reduces pressure on endoscopy testing and facilitates decision-making. We emphasize the role of FC as a noninvasive marker, primarily in patients with IBD, in monitoring disease activity, predicting relapse, monitoring therapy efficacy, and monitoring postoperative relapses.","Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre",2021-,"Lężyk-Ciemniak E, Tworkiewicz M, Wilczyńska D, Szaflarska-Popławska A, Krogulska A",5,1419,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

Over the past 5-10 yr there has been an explosion in novel methodologies, technologies and approaches that offer great promise to advance our understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying GI function in health and disease. This review focuses on the use of optogenetics combined with electrophysiology in the field of neurogastroenterology. We discuss how these technologies and tools are currently being used to explore the brain-gut axis and debate the future research potential and limitations of these techniques. Taken together, we consider that the use of these technologies will enable researchers to answer important questions in neurogastroenterology through fundamental research. The answers to those questions will shorten the path from basic discovery to new treatments for patient populations with disorders of the brain-gut axis affecting the GI tract such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, achalasia, and delayed gastric emptying.",American journal of physiology.

32741439,Improving colonoscopy quality through individualised training programmes.,"In Denmark, quality-improvement initiatives aimed at providing a better colonoscopy service are few. The primary objective of this study was to improve colonoscopy quality at Aalborg University Hospital, Denmark, using structured training programmes. The secondary aim was to introduce a system for individual colonoscopist performance monitoring. We conducted a colonoscopy-quality pilot study covering two major quality performance indicators: caecum intubation rate (CIR) and polyp detection rate (PDR). The pilot study was followed by colonoscopy training programmes offering experienced colonoscopists colonoscopy skills upgrading, polypectomy and train-the-trainers courses taught by English experts. Junior doctors completed a 20-day module-based colonoscopy-training programme. A regional individual colonoscopy quality-reporting system was developed as a supplementary file within the electronic health records. The CIR increased from 87.1% to 92.1% (p less-than 0.001) and the PDR from 33.7% to 41.7% (p less-than 0.001) in the course of the structured training programme. Multivariable analysis adjusting for patient sex, patient age and colonoscopy indication showed a significant increase in CIR (p less-than 0.001), but not in PDR (p = 0.19). The colonoscopy quality reporting system was introduced and now provides biannual feedback to all colonoscopists. Quality-improvement initiatives may lead to an improved CIR and possibly PDR. Nationwide training programmes and performance monitoring should be implemented to further improve and monitor colonoscopy quality. none. not relevant.",Danish medical journal,2020-Aug,"Pedersen L, Bernstein I, Lindorff-Larsen K, Carlsen CG, Torp-Pedersen C",5,1600,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
36637751,Patient Preferences for Attributes that Characterise Alternative Models of Care in Gastroenterology: A Discrete Choice Experiment.,"Increased demand for gastroenterology services has resulted in growing waitlists, with patients at risk of exceeding clinically recommended wait-times. Given limited healthcare resources, expanded scope models of care are an option to help address this demand, but little is known about patient preferences for these models of care. Low-risk gastroenterology patients (n = 1198) referred to an outpatient tertiary service in Australia over a 2-year period were invited to participate in an unlabelled discrete choice experiment with seven attributes: primary healthcare professional, wait-time, continuity of care, consultation length, manner and communication skills, reassurance, and cost. These were developed using qualitative research, literature review, and stakeholders' experiences. A d-efficient fractional design was used to construct four blocks of 12 choice sets, with two alternatives. A 13th choice set was included as a data and quality check. Latent class and mixed logit regression were used for analysis. The resulting preference parameters for individual attributes were then used to calculate willingness to pay and willingness to wait. Overall, the model based on the 347 respondents suggested no strong preference for professional background. All other attributes were statistically significant predictors of preference (p < 0.001), with respondents willing to make significant trade-offs (time and cost) before accepting deterioration in attributes. There was strong emphasis on manner and communication skills, with a clinician who listens and provides good explanations overwhelmingly the most important attribute. Latent class analysis identified two patient segments who differed in their preference for the primary treating healthcare professional (doctor or dietitian) based on exposure to either traditional medical or non-medical professional role substitution model. Patients have strong but varied preferences for gastroenterology services based on whether they have been exposed to expanded scope models of care. Design and implementation of new models of care need to consider strategies to overcome any perceived loss in utility or deterioration in healthcare quality for those unfamiliar with professional role substitution.",The patient,2023-Mar,"Mutsekwa RN, Campbell KL, Canavan R, Mulhern B, Angus RL, Byrnes JM",6,2261,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

GI Division, William Beaumont Hospital which had 36 GI clinical faculty who used to perform >23,000 endoscopies annually with a massive plunge in endoscopy volume during the past 2 years; fully accredited GI fellowship since 1973; employs >400 house staff annually since 1995; predominantly voluntary attendings; and primary teaching hospital, Oakland-University-Medical-School. Expert opinion, based on: Hospital GI chief >14 years until September 2019; GI fellowship program director, at several hospitals for>20 years; author of 320 publications in peer-reviewed GI journals; and committee-member Food-and-Drug-Administration-GI-Advisory Committee for >5 years. Original study exempted by Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB), April 14, 2020. IRB approval is not required for the present study because this opinion is based on previously published data. Advantageous changes: Division reorganized patient care to add clinical capacity and minimize risks to staff of contracting COVID-19. Affiliated medical school changes included: changing ""live"" to virtual lectures, meetings, and conferences. Initially, virtual meetings usually used telephone conferencing which proved cumbersome until meetings were changed to completely computerized virtual meetings using Microsoft Teams or Google Zoom, which performed superbly. Some clinical electives were canceled for medical students and residents because of the need to prioritize car for COVID-19 infection during the pandemic, and medical students graduated on time despite partly missing electives. Division reorganized by changing ""live"" GI lectures to virtual lectures; by four GI fellows temporarily reassigned as medical attendings supervising COVID-19-infected patients; postponing elective GI endoscopies; and drastically reducing an average number of endoscopies from 100/weekday to a small fraction long-term! GI clinic visits were reduced by half by postponing nonurgent visits, and physical visits were replaced by virtual visits. Economic pandemic impact included a temporary, hospital deficit initially relieved by federal grants and hospital employee terminations. GI program director contacted GI fellows twice weekly to monitor pandemic-induced stress. Applicants for GI fellowship were interviewed virtually. Graduate medical education changes included weekly committee meetings to monitor pandemic-induced changes; program managers working from home; canceling annual ACGME fellowship survey, ACGME site visits, and national GI conventions changed from physical to virtual. Dubious changes: Temporarily mandated intubation of COVID-19-infected patients for EGD; temporarily exempted GI fellows from endoscopy duties during surge; fired highly respected anesthesiology group employed for 20 years during pandemic leading to anesthesiology shortages, and abruptly firing without warning or cause numerous senior respected faculty who greatly contributed to research, academics, and reputation. Profound and pervasive GI divisional changes maximized clinical resources devoted to COVID-19-infected patients and minimized risks of transmitting infection. Academic changes were degraded by massive cost-cutting while offering institutions to about 100 hospital systems and eventually ""selling"" institutions to Spectrum Health, without faculty input.",Gastroenterology clinics of North America,2023-Mar,Cappell MS,1,3707,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

From making diagnosis in various medical conditions, following the latest advancements in scientific literature, suggesting appropriate therapies, to predicting prognosis and outcome of diseases and conditions, AI is offering unprecedented possibilities to improve care for patients. Gastroenterology is a field that AI can make a significant impact. This is partly because the diagnosis of gastrointestinal conditions relies a lot on image-based investigations and procedures (endoscopy and radiology). AI-assisted image analysis can make accurate assessment and provide more information than conventional analysis. AI integration of genomic, epigenetic, and metagenomic data may offer new classifications of gastrointestinal cancers and suggest optimal personalized treatments. In managing relapsing and remitting diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and peptic ulcer bleeding, convoluted neural network may formulate models to predict disease outcome, enhancing treatment efficacy.

Proper documentation of allergies, including food, drugs, and other types, is crucial for patient safety to prevent adverse reactions. The clinical audit was conducted using the ""HOPE"" Hospital Management Information System (HMIS), donated by the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust. It involved a retrospective review of medical records for 20 patients from each ward across two audit cycles. In the first cycle, 10 patients were randomly selected from each ward, making a total of 20 patients. After identifying gaps in allergy documentation, interventions were implemented. A second cycle was then conducted to reassess documentation, selecting another set of 10 patients from each ward. Data collection involved checking if allergies were documented, and the results were recorded in an Excel sheet, marked as 'Yes' or 'No' for allergies. Data analysis was done using Microsoft Excel 2023 and the graphical representations were created in Microsoft Office Word 2023 and Microsoft Excel 2023 (Microsoft® Corp., Redmond, WA). The audit aimed for a 100% documentation standard as per the HMIS reading manual. In the first cycle, 70% (n=7) of patients in the Gastroenterology Ward and 60% (n=6) in the Pulmonology Ward had no documented allergies. After implementing the recommended interventions, the second cycle showed a remarkable improvement, with a 100% documentation rate achieved in both wards. After implementing the recommendations, allergy documentation in the HMIS of Lady Reading Hospital MTI Peshawar significantly improved, which helped in preventing allergic reactions in patients admitted to the Gastroenterology and Pulmonology Wards.","Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",2024-,"Khan MH, Shah MK, Mehmood A, Muhammad UF, Khawaja AM, Tauqir J, Jebin A, Durani MN, Siddiqi B",9,1863,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

Although extensive studies have confirmed that children with CD do not have an increased risk of severe COVID-19, public health regulations associated with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may have exacerbated this problem. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the number of new-onset CD cases. Additionally, the role of SARS-CoV-2 in autoimmune diseases and its influence on clinical practice in pediatric gastroenterology were briefly reviewed. We described the data from the hospital electronic registry of new-onset CD, during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2 years before. A total of 423 children were diagnosed with CD between March 2018 and February 2022: 228 in the 2-year pre-COVID-19 period and 195 during the pandemic. The number of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic was 14.5% lower than in the previous years. The quarterly comparison of CD diagnoses showed a reduction in all quarters. A reduction in diagnoses during the lockdown and in the following months was evident and not compensated thereafter. This is the first study to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the diagnosis of CD in children. Further studies are necessary to improve the system of biopsy-sparing diagnosis and to evaluate the effect of the diagnostic delay.

A multicentre cross-sectional study with anonymous self-reporting was conducted from 24 November 2021 to 26 December 2021. The study was conducted in Fujian Province, China. The participants were 345 gastroenterology nurses from 7 tertiary hospitals. Burn-out, emotional labour and psychological resilience were the primary outcome measures. Using a convenience sampling method, the data were collected using Questionnaire Star (a tool for questionnaire surveys) via WeChat. The Chinese version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Chinese version of the Emotional Labour Scale and the Chinese version of the Psychological Resilience Scale were used to evaluate burn-out, emotional labour and psychological resilience, respectively. The total scores for burn-out, emotional labour and psychological resilience in gastroenterology nurses were 53.07±19.63, 38.79±12.22 and 69.97±22.38, respectively, with less use of deep acting and more use of surface acting. Pearson correlation analysis showed that burn-out was positively correlated with two dimensions of emotional labour; surface acting and emotional expression, and negatively correlated with deep acting. There was a negative correlation between emotional labour and all three dimensions of psychological resilience. Greater adoption of deep acting by nurses can be promoted by improving their psychological resilience during events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which can help improve emotional labour, thereby reducing burn-out and decreasing turnover rates. Senior management in hospitals must pay attention to nurses' psychological status.

This was a retrospective study of all gastroenterology patients <18 years who had FCM (October 2015 to October 2017). Haematological and biochemical parameters were recorded pre-infusion, at 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year post-infusion. Recognised side-effects were documented. Sixty-six children received FCM during this period. Data was analysed on 61 children, 5 excluded because of inadequate data. The median age at administration was 14 years (IQR 7). Thirty-two (52%) were boys. Twenty-six (42%) were <14 years old. Seven (11.5%) were <5 years old. Seventeen (28%) were switched from oral iron supplements to FCM. The median dose of FCM delivered was 19 mg/kg. The median haemoglobin increased from 108 to 126 g/L at 1 month post-infusion (P value <0.00001). The mean cell volume also improved from 80 to 84 fL at 1 month post-infusion (P value = 0.0007). Forty-eight (94%) children corrected their anaemia after receiving FCM. Two patients (3%) reported side-effects with skin bruising and staining. FCM appears to be effective in correcting IDA in children across a wide range of gastroenterology indications and all ages.

In contrast, multi-omics approaches to studying health and disease permit the generation and integration of multiple data types on a much larger scale, offering a comprehensive picture of biological and disease processes. Gastroenterology and hepatobiliary research are particularly well-suited to such analyses, given the unique position of the luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tract at the nexus between the gut (mucosa and luminal contents), brain, immune and endocrine systems, and GI microbiome. The generation of 'big data' from multi-omic, multi-site studies can enhance investigations into the connections between these organ systems and organisms and more broadly and accurately appraise the effects of dietary, pharmacological, and other therapeutic interventions. In this review, we describe a variety of useful omics approaches and how they can be integrated to provide a holistic depiction of the human and microbial genetic and proteomic changes underlying physiological and pathophysiological phenomena.

Nine clinical questions regarding methodology, interpretation, and specific indications of breath testing and treatment of carbohydrate malabsorption were addressed by members of the Gastroenterology Committee (GIC) of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN).A systematic literature search was performed from 1983 to 2020 using PubMed, the MEDLINE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation was applied to evaluate the outcomes.During a consensus meeting, all recommendations were discussed and finalised. In the absence of evidence from randomised controlled trials, recommendations reflect the expert opinion of the authors. A total of 22 recommendations were voted on using the nominal voting technique. At first, recommendations on prerequisites and preparation for as well as on interpretation of breath tests are given. Then, recommendations on the usefulness of H2-lactose breath testing, H2-fructose breath testing as well as of breath tests for other types of carbohydrate malabsorption are provided. Furthermore, breath testing is recommended to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), to control for success of Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy and to diagnose and monitor therapy of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, but not to estimate oro-caecal transit time (OCTT) or to diagnose and follow-up on celiac disease. Breath tests are frequently used in paediatric gastroenterology mainly assessing carbohydrate malabsorption, but also in the diagnosis of small intestinal overgrowth, fat malabsorption, H. pylori infection as well as for measuring gastrointestinal transit times.

38128947,ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN 2023 protocol for paediatric FAPD treatment guidelines (standard operating procedure).,"To date, no international guidelines have been published for the treatment of paediatric functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs), subcategorised into functional abdominal pain-not otherwise specified (FAP-NOS), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia and abdominal migraine (AM). We aim for a treatment guideline, focusing on FAP-NOS, IBS and AM, that appreciates the extensive array of available therapies in this field. We present the prospective operating procedure and technical summary protocol in this manuscript. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) will be followed in the development of the guideline, following the approach as laid out in the GRADE handbook, supported by the WHO. The Guideline Development Group (GDG) is formed by paediatric gastroenterologists from both the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, as well as the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition. Also, one clinical psychologist with expertise in FAPDs is a voting member in the GDG. A final consensus list of treatment options is translated into 'patient, intervention, comparison, outcome' format options. Prospective agreement on the magnitude of health benefits or harms categories was reached through a Delphi process among the GDG to support grading of the literature.There will be a detailed technical evidence review with randomised controlled trial data that will be judged for risk of bias with the Cochrane tool. Recommendations are preferably based on GRADE but could also be best practice statements following the available evidence. A full Delphi process will be used to make recommendations using online response systems.

37437510,Perceptions of shared decision making in gastroenterology and inflammatory bowel disease: A qualitative analysis.,"Shared decision-making (SDM) is the partnership and discussion between clinicians and patients to make an appropriate decision based on scientific evidence and patient preferences. Many benefits are associated with SDM; however, little is known about its awareness or use by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) clinicians in gastroenterology departments across Israel. This study aims to identify barriers and facilitators in implementing SDM as standard practice to achieve optimal disease management and personalized care for patients with IBD. Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with IBD clinicians across Israel to identify the barriers and facilitators for SDM use. An interview guide was developed, based on the systematic approach of the Theoretical Domain Framework (TDF). Interview transcripts were coded into theoretical domains to identify factors that may impact SDM. Sixteen gastroenterologists from nine different hospitals were interviewed. Common TDF domains that presented as barriers were: knowledge, skills, social/professional role and identity, environmental context and resources, and reinforcement. Most participants had never heard the precise term ""shared decision making"" and lacked formal training on SDM. This study identified key barriers and facilitators to SDM in IBD clinics across Israel. Main barriers of SDM include limited or nonexistent training; clinicians were unaware of SDM guidelines or techniques. The main facilitators of SDM were clinicians' social and professional role and identity and their beliefs about the influence of IBD and/or CD. These influencing factors and TDF domains identified provide a basis for developing future interventions to improve the implementation of SDM within IBD management.",Patient education and counseling,2023-Oct,"Blum L, Jarach CM, Ellen ME",3,1761,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
32281517,The daily impact of COVID-19 in gastroenterology.,"A new strain of coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, probably originating from a wild-animal contamination. Since then, the situation rapidly evolved from a cluster of patients with pneumonia, to a regional epidemic and now to a pandemic called COrona VIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This evolution is related to the peculiar modes of transmission of the disease and to the globalization and lifestyle of the 21st century that created the perfect scenario for virus spread. Even though research has not evidenced particular susceptibility of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection, immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory treatments were considered potential risk factors. In this context, initiating treatments with these agents should be cautiously weighted and regular ongoing treatments shall be continued, while the dose of corticosteroids should be reduced whenever possible. Due to the increased risk of contamination, elective endoscopic procedures and surgeries should be postponed and IBD online appointments shall be considered. IBD patients shall also follow the recommendations provided to the general population, such as minimization of contact with infected or suspected patients and to wash hands frequently. In the absence of effective treatments and vaccines, this pandemic can only be controlled through prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission with the main objectives of providing patients the best healthcare possible and reduce mortality.",United European gastroenterology journal,2020-Jun,"Magro F, Abreu C, Rahier JF",3,1521,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

Our objective was to verify if, after the start of the pandemic, there was an increase in in-hospital mortality in patients admitted to a Gastroenterology Service of a 3rd level hospital. The 1039 admissions registered at the Virgen de la Victoria University Hospital in Malaga (Spain) were retrospectively analysed in the period between 1 December 2019 and 30 November 2020 (12 months), which were divided into 4 quarters (pre-wave, first wave, inter-wave and second wave) and mortality and other variables (globally and by disease group) were analysed. No statistically significant differences were observed in terms of overall in-hospital mortality in the different periods. (p 0.23). The greatest burden of disease corresponded to biliopancreatic group and, within them, acute pancreatitis (p 0.04), followed by non-variceal gastrointestinal bleeding. In the second semester, mortality increased in the biliopancreatic group (p 0.01). Patients admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding took longer to request care after the start of the pandemic, especially in the second wave (p 0.03). The same was observed in admissions due to tumours, with the time elapsed until the emergency visit more than double in the second semester, with a consequent increase in mortality (p 0.00). The global in-hospital mortality in a Gastroenterology Service in a 3rd level hospital has not increased with the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, however, a higher in-hospital mortality has been recorded in biliopancreatic diseases and digestive tumours diagnosed on an in-patient basis between June and November 2020.",Gastroenterologia y hepatologia,2023-,"García-García AM, Pinazo-Bandera JM, Asady Ben G, García-Cortés M, Andrade RJ",5,1686,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

Incredible advances, however, have been made especially in the last 50 years, driven by improvements in histology, the development of immunostains, the development of high resolution imaging methods, improved biopsy and resection methods, and the emergence of the molecular era. With these tools, pathologists and their clinical and basic science colleagues moved from classifying liver disease using an observational, pattern-based approach to a refined classification of disease, one based on etiology for medical disease and tumor classification for neoplastic disease. Examples of liver specific diseases are used to illustrate these exciting advances. These impressive advances of the past provide the foundation for hope in the future, as liver pathology continues to play an important role in improving patient care through disease identification and classification and emerging roles in guiding therapy for cures.",Human pathology,2020-Jan,"Torbenson M, Washington K",2,987,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

The statement was sent to the entire group and their approval obtained. To formulate a consensus statement to enable proper diagnosis and management of GERD in children. GER is physiological in most infants and it improves as age advances. The pathological form, called GERD causes distressing symptoms that affect daily activities and may result in complications. The presentation would vary from regurgitation to severe symptoms due to esophageal or respiratory tract disease. In older children, esophagitis is the commonest manifestation of GERD. A careful history and clinical examination are adequate to make a diagnosis in most patients, but judicious investigations are necessary in a few. Upper gastro intestinal tract endoscopy may be required in those with esophageal manifestations, dysphagia and hematemesis. In children with extra-esophageal symptoms, MII-pH monitoring and scintigraphy are necessary. Empirical treatment with a Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has not been proven useful in infants, but a four-week trial is recommended in older children without complications.

38454242,Being a Female Gastroenterologist in Turkey.,"Our aim is to examine the representation of woman gastroenterologists in both work and social life in Turkey and to elucidate the difficulties they encounter during their career pathways or while actively practicing their profession. A self-structured survey consisting of 25 questions was sent via email to all 152 female gastroenterologists. Survey results were received from 140 participants. Sixty percent of the woman gastroenterologists had marriage-career conflicts, and 74% of them stated that they could not manage work-life balance with their children. Among these woman gastroenterologists, 46.6% of them reported that they had faced carrier-related barriers and challenges while applying for an academic rise or expecting a promotion in their job, 58.5% were exposed to gender mobbing, and 35.6% were subjected to verbal or physical violence. On the other hand, woman gastroenterologists are found to be underrepresented in endoscopic interventions where only one-third of the participants perform invasive endoscopic procedures, and the percentage of those who perform advanced endoscopy such as endoscopic submucosal dissection and endoscopic mucosal resection remains even less as 8.9%. The number of women in leadership positions during their careers is found to be low, and only 2 women were selected as the president of the society since 1959, the establishment time of the Turkish Society of Gastroenterology.

However, information on gastroenterologists' practices in the management of H. pylori infection is scarce in this part of the world. This study aimed at evaluating the practice patterns of gastroenterologists and gastroenterology fellows in India. This was a cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey of gastroenterologists and gastroenterology fellows working in India. Total 207 gastroenterologists and 53 fellows filled out the questionnaire. Responses were received from all around India. Approximately 70% of respondents perceive H. pylori to be a gastric pathogen, while 20% regard it as a commensal bacterium. While the proportion of respondents who chose a test and treat method (34.6%) for uninvestigated dyspepsia without alarm symptoms was comparable to empirical proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy (38.8%), about one-fifth chose a scope and treat strategy in this setting. Even in the absence of alarm signs, more than half of respondents (61.5%) preferred endoscopic biopsy to detect H. pylori. While rapid urease testing (RUT) was the preferred modality (80%) for detecting H. pylori, about one-third preferred single-site RUT (from the antrum). Only 40% followed the Updated Sydney protocol, while performing biopsies and a majority (78.8%) are unable to discontinue PPIs before testing for H. pylori. PPI-clarithromycin-based triple treatment was the preferred regimen (67%) for first-line eradication, while nearly a quarter of respondents did not utilize bismuth due to concerns about adverse effects. The survey reveals a lack of adherence to the current H. pylori guidelines for diagnosis, testing and treatment among gastroenterologists and gastroenterology fellows in India.

However, there has been no study on the effect of GAs on the impact factor (IF) of journals, and the citation index or social media exposure of individual articles. We investigated the presence of GAs, total citations and social media exposure of full-length original articles in the top ten journals of gastroenterology and hepatology for three years (2019-2021). Citations and social media exposure were evaluated with the Web of Science citation index, Altmetric Attention score, Dimension recorded citation count, and PlumX index. A total of 4,205 articles from ten journals were evaluated for three years. First, journals that have adopted GAs demonstrated significantly higher IF increases for the past three years than those of journals without GAs. The longer GAs have been utilized in a journal, the higher IFs the journal had. Secondly, individual articles with GAs had significantly higher Web of Science citation counts (median 14 vs. 12), more social media exposure (median 23 vs. 5) and more Altmetric.com tweet counts (median 15 vs. 7) than those of articles without GAs. In multiple regression analysis, the inclusion of GAs was particularly effective in increasing the number of Web of Science citations (β = 14.1, SE = 1.9, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and social media exposure (β = 13.3, SE = 6.1, <i>P</i> = 0.030) after adjusting for journal IFs and topics.

We determined the topic and the gender of all authors of each guideline. The numbers of men authors, women authors and total authors were collected. The trends of women first authors, women senior authors and total women authors were assessed. A logistic regression analysis was performed to analyse the relationship between the gender of the first or senior author and related factors. We identified 103 hepatology guidelines published between January 2008 and September 2022 published by the AGA, ACG, AASLD, APASL, BSG, EASL, and KASL. The gender of 1096 of 1100 (99.6%) authors was determined. Therefore, a total of 1096 authors were included: 223 (20.3%) authors were women and 873 (79.7%) authors were men. Women comprised 14.6% of all first authors, and 20.4% of all senior authors were women. Only the AASLD had writing committees comprising more than 30% total women authors. The proportions of women senior authors and total women authors increased significantly during the study period (p < .05). Women first authors and women senior authors were more likely to publish guidelines with more women authors. Women first authors were less likely to be co-authors with men authors.

This cohort study consisted of patients receiving outpatient care in the Cleveland Clinic gastroenterology department between March 2020 and June 2020 and corresponding time periods in 2019 and 2021. Patient demographics and socioeconomic factors were extracted and analyzed. There were 47,031 patients (mean age 56.3±17.6 years, 61.9% female and 76.4% white) included. Patients ≥65 years sought healthcare less frequently during and after the lockdown (40.1% vs 34.8% vs 35.2% in 2019, 2020, and 2021 respectively). Missed visits (4.2% vs 10% vs 10.4%), tobacco (11.4% vs 15.9% vs 16.1%), alcohol (38.6% vs 45.5% vs 50.9%), and illicit drug use (3.5% vs 5.8% vs 10.7%) have steadily increased during and after the lockdown compared with prepandemic levels. Factors associated with reduced telehealth use were black race (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99), Hispanic race (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.77)), Medicaid/other public insurance (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.95)), unemployed status (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.92)), and non-English/Spanish speakers (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.94)).

This prospective national study identified colonoscopy DOPS submitted over an 18-month period to the UK training e-portfolio. Generalizability analyses were conducted to evaluate internal structure validity and reliability. Benchmarking was performed using receiver operator characteristic analyses. Learning curves for DOPS items and domains were studied, and multivariable analyses were performed to identify predictors of DOPS competency. Across 279 training units, 10,749 DOPS submitted for 1,199 trainees were analyzed. The acceptable reliability threshold (G > 0.70) was achieved with 3 assessors performing 2 DOPS each. DOPS competency rates correlated with the unassisted caecal intubation rate (rho 0.404, P < 0.001). Demonstrating competency in 90% of assessed items provided optimal sensitivity (90.2%) and specificity (87.2%) for benchmarking overall DOPS competence. This threshold was attained in the following order: ""preprocedure"" (50-99 procedures), ""endoscopic nontechnical skills"" and ""postprocedure"" (150-199), ""management"" (200-249), and ""procedure"" (250-299) domain. At item level, competency in ""proactive problem solving"" (rho 0.787) and ""loop management"" (rho 0.780) correlated strongest with the overall DOPS rating (P < 0.001) and was the last to develop. Lifetime procedure count, DOPS count, trainer specialty, easier case difficulty, and higher cecal intubation rate were significant multivariable predictors of DOPS competence. This study establishes milestones for competency acquisition during colonoscopy training and provides novel validity and reliability evidence to support colonoscopy DOPS as a competency assessment tool.",The American journal of gastroenterology,2020-Feb,"Siau K, Crossley J, Dunckley P, Johnson G, Feeney M, Iacucci M, Anderson JT",7,1982,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
34157754,Prevalence and risk factors of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus among gastroenterological patients: a HbA1c-based single center experience - Prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in gastroenterological patients.,"Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for microvascular disease, leading to chronic kidney injury or cardiovascular disease, but there is a tremendous proportion of patients worldwide who suffer from undiagnosed diabetes. Until now, little is known about the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in gastroenterology inpatients. To improve detection of undiagnosed diabetes, a routine screening procedure for gastroenterology inpatients, based on hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurement, was established. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the implemented diabetes screening. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed according to the guideline of the German Diabetes Association in patients with an HbA<sub>1c</sub> of ≥6.5% anld/or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥126 mg/dL. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for undiagnosed diabetes. Within a 3-month period, 606 patients were eligible for a diabetes screening. Pre-existing diabetes was documented in 120 patients (19.8 %), undiagnosed diabetes was found in 24 (3.9%), and 162 patients (26.7%) met the definition for prediabetes. Steroid medication use, age, and liver cirrhosis due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) were identified as risk factors for undiagnosed diabetes. The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in gastroenterology inpatients is markedly elevated in comparison to the general population, and a substantial number of inpatients are in a prediabetic status, underlining the need for diabetes screening. In addition to previously described risk factors of patient age and steroid medication use, we identified PSC-related liver cirrhosis (but not liver cirrhosis due to another etiology) as an independent risk factor for undiagnosed diabetes.",Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie,2022-Sep,"Fründt T, Schröder N, Hölzemer A, Pinnschmidt H, de Heer J, Behrends BC, Renne T, Lautenbach A, Lohse AW, Schrader J",10,1818,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
36453522,Standardizing and optimizing nutrition evaluation frequency of enterally fed patients in an ambulatory pediatric gastroenterology practice: A single-center study.,"Nutrition monitoring is essential in feeding tube-dependent patients receiving home enteral nutrition (HEN). We identified lack of consistency in dietitian evaluations for our pediatric patients receiving HEN. Consequently, after establishing an institutional standard for nutrition reassessment intervals, we underwent a quality improvement (QI) initiative to improve rates of adherence to standard frequency of dietitian consults and referrals among patients receiving HEN. A prospective QI initiative from April 2021 to December 2021 was performed using multiple plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles. Interventions included (1) a reminder placard, (2) the display of feeding tube status and date of the last dietitian note in the electronic health record (EHR) clinic schedule dashboard, and (3) an autotext smart element to the EHR default clinic note template. The goal was to enable clinicians to quickly identify the need for nutrition evaluation with either a same-day dietitian consult or a referral to nutrition clinic. Among 111 HEN patients with >6 months since last nutrition encounter, the dietitian referral/consult rate prior to any interventions was 58%. The placard (PDSA 1) was abandoned before obtaining reportable data because of sampling bias and clinic workflow inefficiencies. The clinic schedule dashboard modification (PDSA 2) improved the dietitian referral/consult rate to 66%. Subsequently, the clinic note smart element (PDSA 3) increased the rate to 77%. An 8-week postintervention check revealed a compliance rate of 78%. Implementation of minimally interruptive EHR enhancements showed a sustained increase in dietitian referrals and consults for patients receiving HEN, which may improve nutrition outcomes.",Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,2023-Aug,"Ngai D, Kotamraju S, Do P, Luffy R, Winser-Bean C, Rockwell J, Hollaway L, Wright V, Barlow S, Sathe M",10,1736,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
35094252,(#WomeninDDW) Persistent Speaker Gender Gap at the Premier Digestive Disease Event.,"Over the last few decades, advances have been made regarding gender equality starting from medical students to trainees, to leadership in academics. The female representation in specialty academic conferences not only reflects the existing gender disparities in that specialty but also can influence young female trainees to join that field. Digestive Disease Week (DDW) is the premier digestive disease event. We aimed to calculate the proportion of female representation among speakers and moderators at the DDW meetings held from 2018 to 2020. The data for DDW 2018-2020 were collected via the online web-based planner. The gender of speakers of presentations and moderators of sessions were identified by a google search. We further categorized the data by each participating society (AGA, ASGE, AASLD, and SSAT), by presentation track, by session track, and total overall representation in each year. Despite the subject of the gender gap being in focus, the proportion of female moderators and speakers was low in DDW in the last 3 years. The female speakers constituted 31.6% in 2018, 33.8% in 2019 and 34.6% in 2020. There was slightly improved female representation in sessions of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Stomach, and Small Bowel Disorders, Microbiome in GI & Liver disease, and Basic Science over the last 3 years. Based on our study and those referenced in this article, we believe that strategies to promote the inclusivity of female moderators and speakers at DDW provide a huge opportunity to influence gender equity within GI.",Digestive diseases and sciences,2022-Feb,"Khan Z, Rukhshan R, Bhatt A, Guha S, Ramireddy S, Patil P, Badillo R, DaVee RT, Thosani N",9,1545,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
35279913,Pediatric Rome IV diagnosis agreement is greater than agreement on diagnostic testing.,"Pediatric Rome IV criteria are used to diagnose childhood functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). This study of pediatric gastroenterology physicians measured their agreement in (1) Making a pediatric Rome IV FGID diagnosis; and (2) Diagnostic testing for patients with FGIDs. Pediatric gastroenterologists and pediatric gastroenterology fellows at two medical centers completed a survey containing clinical FGID vignettes. For each vignette, raters identified the most likely Rome IV diagnosis(es) and selected which diagnostic test(s) (if any) they typically would obtain. The survey was re-administered within 3 months. Inter-rater and intra-rater weighted percent agreement was determined. Linear mixed modeling identified sources of variability in diagnostic testing. Thirty-four raters completed the initial survey of whom thirty-one (91%) completed the repeat survey. Overall inter-rater agreement on Rome IV diagnoses was 68% for initial and repeat surveys whereas intra-rater agreement was 76%. In contrast, overall inter-rater agreement on diagnostic testing was <30% for both initial and repeat surveys and intra-rater agreement was only 57%. Between-physician differences accounted for 43% of the variability in the number of tests selected. Rater identified use of Rome criteria in clinical practice was associated with 1.1 fewer diagnostic tests on average (95% CI 0.2-2.0, p = 0.015). Higher intra-rater agreement was noted for diagnostic testing in faculty when compared to fellows (p = 0.009).

32369320,Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Gastroenterology Fellow Training in North America.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed healthcare systems and training around the world. The Training Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition sought to understand how COVID-19 has affected pediatric gastroenterology fellowship training. A 21 question survey was distributed to all 77 pediatric gastroenterology fellowship program directors (PDs) in the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition program director database via email on April 7. Responses collected through April 19, 2020 were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Fifty-one of 77 (66%) PDs from the United States, Canada, and Mexico responded to the survey. Forty-six of 51 (90%) PDs reported that they were under a ""stay-at-home"" order for a median of 4 weeks at the time of the survey. Two of the 51 (4%) programs had fellows participating in outpatient telehealth before COVID-19 and 39 of 51 (76%) at the time of the survey. Fellows stopped participating in outpatient clinics in 22 of 51 (43%) programs and endoscopy in 26 of 51 (52%) programs. Changes to inpatient care included reduced fellow staffing, limiting who entered patient rooms, and rounding remotely. Fellows in 3 New York programs were deployed to adult medicine units. Didactics were moved to virtual conferences in 47 of 51 (94%) programs, and fellows used various online resources. Clinical research and, disproportionately, bench research were restricted.

32209595,Accuracy of medical billing data against the electronic health record in the measurement of colorectal cancer screening rates.,"Medical billing data are an attractive source of secondary analysis because of their ease of use and potential to answer population-health questions with statistical power. Although these datasets have known susceptibilities to biases, the degree to which they can distort the assessment of quality measures such as colorectal cancer screening rates are not widely appreciated, nor are their causes and possible solutions. Using a billing code database derived from our institution's electronic health records, we estimated the colorectal cancer screening rate of average-risk patients aged 50-74 years seen in primary care or gastroenterology clinic in 2016-2017. 200 records (150 unscreened, 50 screened) were sampled to quantify the accuracy against manual review. Out of 4611 patients, an analysis of billing data suggested a 61% screening rate, an estimate that matches the estimate by the Centers for Disease Control. Manual review revealed a positive predictive value of 96% (86%-100%), negative predictive value of 21% (15%-29%) and a corrected screening rate of 85% (81%-90%). Most false negatives occurred due to examinations performed outside the scope of the database-both within and outside of our institution-but 21% of false negatives fell within the database's scope. False positives occurred due to incomplete examinations and inadequate bowel preparation. Reasons for screening failure include ordered but incomplete examinations (48%), lack of or incorrect documentation by primary care (29%) including incorrect screening intervals (13%) and patients declining screening (13%). Billing databases are prone to substantial bias that may go undetected even in the presence of confirmatory external estimates. Caution is recommended when performing population-level inference from these data. We propose several solutions to improve the use of these data for the assessment of healthcare quality.",BMJ open quality,2020-Mar,"Rudrapatna VA, Glicksberg BS, Avila P, Harding-Theobald E, Wang C, Butte AJ",6,1912,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

We review the concepts, tools, and research in effective transitioning and transfer of care for adolescent/young adult patients with IBD. Given the constraints within the healthcare system, effective transitioning can be challenging to implement in everyday clinical practice. Different barriers include resources and expertise in effective transitioning by pediatric and adult gastroenterology healthcare providers and the impact of non-gastrointestinal issues facing young adult patients who are learning to manage and coordinate all aspects of their medical care and health maintenance. Factors that facilitate successful care transitioning and transfer include structured transitioning programs, utilization of validated transition checklists, and IBD medical summaries. Proactive transitioning by pediatric gastroenterologists in partnership with their emerging young adult patients with IBD leads to better clinical and psychosocial outcomes and ultimately, effective transfer of care to adult gastroenterology. By utilizing utilize comprehensive transition assessment tools and medical summaries in partnership with their patients, pediatric and adult gastroenterology teams can better prepare patients as they transfer to independent care and health maintenance.",Current gastroenterology reports,2024-Oct,"Barry JN, Moses JD, Kim SC",3,1486,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) published a guideline in 2014; however, the rapid evolution of knowledge about pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and therapeutic options have made an update necessary. A consensus group of pediatric gastroenterologists from the ESPGHAN Working Group on Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Diseases (ESPGHAN EGID WG) reviewed the recent literature and proposed statements and recommendations on 28 relevant questions about EoE. A comprehensive electronic literature search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases from 2014 to 2022. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system was used to assess the quality of evidence and formulate recommendations. A total of 52 statements based on the available evidence and 44 consensus-based recommendations are available. A revision of the diagnostic protocol, options for initial drug treatment, and the new concept of simplified empiric elimination diets are now available. Biologics are becoming a part of the potential armamentarium for refractory EoE, and systemic steroids may be considered as the initial treatment for esophageal strictures before esophageal dilation. The importance and assessment of quality of life and a planned transition to adult medical care are new areas addressed in this guideline. Research in recent years has led to a better understanding of childhood EoE. This guideline incorporates the new findings and provides a practical guide for clinicians treating children diagnosed with EoE.",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,2024-Aug,"Amil-Dias J, Oliva S, Papadopoulou A, Thomson M, Gutiérrez-Junquera C, Kalach N, Orel R, Auth MK, Nijenhuis-Hendriks D, Strisciuglio C, Bauraind O, Chong S, Ortega GD, Férnandez SF, Furman M, Garcia-Puig R, Gottrand F, Homan M, Huysentruyt K, Kostovski A, Otte S, Rea F, Roma E, Romano C, Tzivinikos C, Urbonas V, Velde SV, Zangen T, Zevit N",29,1814,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
32519138,Outrunning Burnout in a GI Fellowship Program During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Many GI training programs have needed to adjust to the serious disruption to the training and education of fellows worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A silent problem that has arisen within programs is the issue of burnout among their trainees. Burnout is common among gastroenterologists, especially in fellows (Keswani et al. in Gastroenterology 147(1):11-14, 2014. https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2014.05.023 , Am J Gastroenterol 106(10):1734-1740, 2011. https://doi.org/10.1038/ajg.2011.148 ), with negative consequences to patient care and the safety of the trainees if not effectively dealt with. In this article, the author describes several additional factors potentially contributing to the intensifying burnout of the fellows in their home institution during this pandemic.

These three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures derived from pluripotent and adult hepatobiliary cells model organ structure and function. Building on gastrointestinal organoid establishment, hepatobiliary organoid cultures were generated from mouse leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5-positive liver progenitor cells. Subsequently, 3D hepatobiliary organoid cultures were developed from hepatocytes and cholangiocytes to model human and animal hepatobiliary health and disease. Hepatocyte organoids have been used to study Alagille syndrome, fatty liver disease, Wilson disease, hepatitis B viral infection, and cystic fibrosis. Cholangiocyte organoids have been established to study normal cholangiocyte biology and primary sclerosing cholangitis and to test organoid potential to form bile ducts and gallbladder tissue in vitro. Hepatobiliary cancer organoids, termed tumoroids, have been established from frozen and fresh human tissues and used as a drug-testing platform and for biobanking of cancer samples. CRISPR-based gene modifications and organoid exposure to infectious agents have permitted the generation of organoid models of carcinogenesis. This review summarizes currently available adult cell-derived hepatobiliary organoid models and their applications. Challenges faced by this young technology will be discussed, including the cellular immaturity of organoid-derived hepatocytes, co-culture development to better model complex tissue structure, the imperfection of extracellular matrices, and the absence of standardized protocols and model validation.","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",2021-Oct,"Shiota J, Samuelson LC, Razumilava N",3,1686,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

In recent years, the value of MRI in hepatology has been significantly enhanced by a wide range of contrast agents, both clinically available and under development, that add functional information to anatomically detailed morphological images, or increase the distinction between normal and pathological tissues by targeting molecular and cellular events. Several classes of contrast agents are available for contrast-enhanced hepatic MRI, including i) conventional non-specific extracellular fluid contrast agents for assessing tissue perfusion; ii) hepatobiliary-specific contrast agents that are taken up by functioning hepatocytes and excreted through the biliary system for evaluating hepatobiliary function; iii) superparamagnetic iron oxide particles that accumulate in Kupffer cells; and iv) novel molecular contrast agents that are biochemically targeted to specific molecular/cellular processes for staging liver diseases or detecting treatment responses. The use of different functional and molecular MRI methods enables the non-invasive assessment of disease burden, progression, and treatment response in a variety of liver diseases.

38282184,Applicant-Fellow Virtual Sessions in Recruitment for Gastroenterology Fellowship.,"Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, virtual interviews have become a norm for gastroenterology (GI) fellowship recruitment. Most interviews hold a session for applicant and current fellow interaction. There is wide variability of the sessions across programs. There are a paucity of data on the influence of these sessions on applicants' ranking of programs. We aim to describe applicants' experiences and perceptions of virtual happy hours (i.e., applicant-fellow sessions) during the GI fellowship application process. We surveyed applicants participating in the 2022 GI fellowship match cycle to understand their experience with virtual fellow-only happy hours. Mixed methods analyses were performed. The survey was completed by 68 (13.91%) applicants, of which, 75% reported that at least half of the interviews they attended had conducted a virtual, fellow-only happy hour. Most respondents preferred that the virtual happy hours should be conducted prior to the interview day (58%) and that breakout rooms with a smaller ratio of applicants to fellows are helpful (78%). The majority (87%) of respondents reported attending these sessions at least 75% of the time. Nearly half (44%) of respondents reported that these sessions influenced/altered their ranking decisions with respect to programs. Given the advantages associated with virtual interviews and their ongoing support by professional societies, the virtual platform is likely here to stay in future. Virtual fellow-only happy hours help provide a representation of the program's mission and when successfully implemented, can be leveraged to optimize recruitment and attract qualified, diverse candidates.",Digestive diseases and sciences,2024-Apr,"Gala K, Tome J, Simonetto DA",3,1672,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

33851878,Appraisal of the current guidelines for the management of diverticular disease using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument.,"Diverticular disease is one of the most frequent reasons for attending emergency departments and surgical causes of hospital admission. In the past decade, many surgical and gastroenterological societies have published guidelines for the management of diverticular disease. The aim of the present study was to appraise the methodological quality of these guidelines using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar databases were searched systematically. The methodological quality of the guidelines was appraised independently by five appraisers using the AGREE II instrument. A systematic search of the literature identified 12 guidelines. The median overall score of all guidelines was 68%. Across all guidelines, the highest score of 85% was demonstrated in the domain 'Scope and purpose'. The domains 'Clarity and presentation' and 'Editorial independence' both scored a median of 72%. The lowest scores were demonstrated in the domains 'Stakeholder involvement' and 'Applicability' at 46% and 40%, respectively. Overall, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines performed consistently well, scoring 100% in five of six domains; NICE was one of the few guidelines that specifically reported stakeholder involvement, scoring 97%. Generally, the domain of 'Stakeholder involvement' ranked poorly with seven of twelve guidelines scoring below 50%, with the worst score in this domain demonstrated by Danish guidelines at 25%. Six of twelve guidelines (NICE, American Society of Colon & Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS), European Society of Coloproctology (ESCP), American Gastroenterological Association, German Society of Gastroenterology/German Society for General and Visceral Surgery (German), Netherlands Society of Surgery) scored above 70%. Only three, NICE, ASCRS and ESCP, scored above 75% and were voted unanimously by the appraisers for use as they are. Therefore, use of AGREE II may help improve the methodological quality of guidelines and their future updates.",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,2021-Jul,"Gavriilidis P, Askari A, Gavriilidis E, de'Angelis N, Di Saverio S, Wheeler J, Davies RJ",7,2080,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
38616470,Underfunding of German university-based high-performance medicine exemplified by the treatment of varices in cirrhosis.,"Facing increasing economization in the health care sector, clinicians have to adapt not only to the ever-growing economic challenges, but also to a patient-oriented health care. Treatment costs are the most important variable for optimizing success when facing scarce human resources, increasing material- and infrastructure costs in general, as well as low revenue flexibility due to flat rates per case in Germany, the so-called Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG). University hospitals treat many patients with particularly serious illnesses. Therefore, their share of complex and expensive treatments, such as liver cirrhosis, is significantly higher. The resulting costs are not adequately reflected in the DRG flat rate per case, which is based on an average calculation across all hospitals, which increases this economic pressure. Thus, the aim of this manuscript is to review cost and revenue structures of the management of varices in patients with cirrhosis at a university center with a focus on hepatology. For this monocentric study, the data of 851 patients, treated at the Gastroenterology Department of a University Hospital between 2016 and 2020, were evaluated retrospectively and anonymously. Medical services (e.g., endoscopy, radiology, laboratory diagnostics) were analyzed within the framework of activity-based-costing. As part of the cost unit accounting, the individual steps of the treatment pathways of the 851 patients were monetarily evaluated with corresponding applicable service catalogs and compared with the revenue shares of the cost center and cost element matrix of the German (G-) DRG system. This study examines whether university-based high-performance medicine is efficient and cost-covering within the framework of the G-DRG system. We demonstrate a dramatic underfunding of the management of varicose veins in cirrhosis in our university center. It is therefore generally questionable whether and to what extent an adequate care for this patient collective is reflected in the G-DRG system.","Zeitschrift fur Evidenz, Fortbildung und Qualitat im Gesundheitswesen",2024-May,"Claus S, Brozat JF, Trautwein C, Koch A",4,2030,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
33141389,Gender Disparity in Academic Gastroenterology: Beginning of the End of the Underrepresentation of Women?,"Though there are an increasing number of female medical graduates, women remain underrepresented in academic medicine. There have been several reasons to explain this gender disparity, including marital status, number of children, number of hours worked, job flexibility, perceptions of women as inferior leaders, gender bias, sexual harassment, and unsupportive academic climates. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between scholarly productivity and the representation of female gastroenterologists in academia. Specifically, scholarly productivity measured by the h-index and academic rank were explored to determine if there were gender disparities in academic productivity and rank in gastroenterology. Gastroenterology departmental listings were obtained from the Fellowship and Residency Interactive Database of the American Medical Association. The Scopus database was used to record each physician's h-index. Statistical analyses were conducted with Wilcoxon rank-sum test, which compared matched samples by academic rank, and ANOVA tests, which compared multiple academic ranks. Out of 1703 academic gastroenterologists, women account for 25% of academic physicians. Women have statistically lower h-indices at the level of Assistant Professor (p = 0.0012), and at the level of Chair (p = 0.01). There was no difference in h-indices between male and female at the rank of Associate Professor and Professor. While these results mirror patterns appreciated in other fields of medicine, the results at the rank of Chair may suggest that despite the lower h-index compared to their male counterparts, females are perceived as having strong inherent leadership skills outside of academic productivity that are also conducive to leading a department and may be contributing to their rise to Chair.",Digestive diseases and sciences,2022-Feb,"John JJ, John ES, Pioppo L, Gupta A, Chokhavatia S, Tilara A",6,1815,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
31525361,A gender comparison of motivations for seeking leadership positions among gastroenterologists.,"A gender gap exists in leadership positions in gastroenterology. However, individual motivations for seeking leadership positions within the gastroenterology community among men and women have not been explored. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether motivations for pursuing and attaining leadership positions in gastroenterology differ by gender. A 20-question survey was created by the authors and shared with gastroenterologists electronically via a social media group (Facebook) and emails gathered through publicly available society websites and professional and social contacts. Data gathered from the survey included demographics, practice characteristics, presence of spouse or domestic partner, past and present leadership positions, motivations for pursuit of leadership positions, and reasons for lack of desire for a leadership position. The survey was sent to 981 gastroenterologists (679 women, 302 men). The overall response rate was 21.4% (n = 210) (20.9% for women, 22.5% for men). Overall, 41% of respondents (84 of 206) currently hold a leadership position, including more males than females (52% vs 36%, respectively; P = .03). However, among those who completed their training in the past 5 years, more women than men hold a current leadership role (25% vs 6%; P = .11). Other factors associated with currently holding a leadership position included age and years since completion of training, practice type, full-time status, and having a spouse who is not a physician. The positive factors of leadership cited most frequently were (1) ability to effect change, (2) furthering the goals of the organization, and (3) opportunity for career advancement. The negative factors cited most frequently were increased workload and decreased time for personal life. These reported positive and negative factors were similar for male and female respondents. Forty-nine respondents did not desire a leadership position now or in the future. The most common reason cited was lack of interest in the responsibilities, long hours, or stress that accompanies a leadership position (22 of 42, 52%). The second most common reason was that respondents were too busy at home or work to take on the extra responsibilities. A gender gap in gastroenterology leadership exists but is closing. There is fairly equal representation of men and women in leadership positions among those who completed training in the last 5 years. Many gastroenterologists are motivated for a leadership position and at the same time, many qualified individuals do not desire a leadership position because of factors that affect work-life balance. Ongoing efforts to engage motivated individuals into leadership positions and to revise the nature of leadership positions may allow for a larger talent pool from which to recruit.",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,2020-Jan,"Enestvedt BK, Diamond S, Laird A, Rodriguez SA",4,2823,gastroenterology,2025-11-22

Accreditation has been in place for centers and fellowship programs, but with low uptake. The decision whether to continue, change or cease such accreditation is being discussed. Thus, a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis was conducted. A mixed-methods, cross-sectional study among stakeholders in E-AHPBA, ESSO and UEMS under the E-AHPBA executive council was founded, ensuring representation by gender and geographic distribution. Responses were collected from across E-AHPBA regions, with response from 15 of 24 subchapters. The most frequent and recurring themes are presented in a SWOT matrix which allows for paired evaluations of factors deemed to be helpful (Strengths and Opportunities), those that are harmful (Weaknesses and Threats).

32820340,Development of Entrustable Professional Activities for Advanced Inflammatory Bowel Disease Fellowship Training in the United States.,"The level of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) training in general gastroenterology fellowship is often insufficient to prepare trainees to deliver advanced IBD care in practice. Advanced IBD fellowships have been developed to fill this training gap, but there is no established curriculum, and significant variability exists across programs. Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) are practical and realistic objectives that define essential tasks of a specialty that physicians should master to be competent during independent practice. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and Crohn's & Colitis Foundation (Foundation) established a task force to develop and appraise EPAs for advanced IBD fellowship. Entrustable professional activities were developed using a multistep approach in a similar manner to other specialties. Initial EPAs identified via focus groups were evaluated, critiqued, and changed using an iterative model of feedback. The final EPAs were selected after the task force conducted a 3-phase modified Delphi method consisting of 2 sequential rounds of web-based voting and an in-person consensus meeting. Ten EPAs for advanced IBD fellowship were established including detailed descriptions with the associated knowledge, skills, and attitudes for each that can serve as curricular milestones. Ten EPAs describing the core work of an advanced IBD fellowship-trained physician have been established by a multisociety task force. Creating EPAs for an advanced curriculum comes with unique challenges, particularly the need to prevent duplication of prior training competencies while demonstrating the potential for unique milestones.",Inflammatory bowel diseases,2020-Aug,"Cohen BL, Gallinger ZR, Ha C, Holubar SD, Hou JK, Kinnucan J, Mahadevan U, Moss AC, Raffals LE, Regueiro M, Szigethy E, Wolf D, Dubinsky MC, Patel A, Shah BJ, Ehrlich OG, Hanauer SB",17,1665,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
32428668,"What's new in IBD therapy: An ""omics network"" approach.","The industrial revolution that began in the late 1800s has resulted in dramatic changes in the environment, human lifestyle, dietary habits, social structure, and so on. Almost certainly because this rapid evolution has outpaced the ability of the body to adapt to a number of environmental and behavioral changes, there has been a parallel emergence of several chronic inflammatory diseases, among which are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), primarily ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The ability to treat these conditions has progressively improved in the last 50 years, particularly in the last couple of decades with the introduction of biological therapy targeting primarily soluble mediators produced by inflammatory cells. A large number of biologics are now available, but all of them induce similarly unsatisfactory (<50%) rates of clinical response and remission, and most of them lose efficacy over time, requiring dose escalation or switching from one biologic to another. So, treatment of IBD still needs improvement that will occur only if different approaches are taken. A reason why even the most recent forms of IBD therapy are unsatisfactory is because they target only selected components of an exceedingly complex pathophysiological process, a reality that must be honestly considered if better IBD therapies are to be achieved. Brand new approaches must integrate all relevant factors in their totality - the ""omes"" - and identify the key controllers of biological responses. This can be accomplished by using systems biology-based approaches and advanced bioinformatics tools, which together represent the essence of network medicine. This review looks at the past and the present of IBD pathogenesis and therapy, and discusses how to develop new therapies based on a network medicine approach.",Pharmacological research,2020-Sep,"Fiocchi C, Iliopoulos D",2,1824,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
32213025,Towards evidence-based and personalised care of acute pancreatitis.,"Acute pancreatitis is a heterogeneous illness. Most patients experience a mild course of disease, but one third will develop local complications and/or organ failure associated with increased morbidity and risk of mortality. Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is based on typical epigastric pain, elevation of serum lipase or amylase levels, and/or characteristic findings on imaging. Personalised management is needed in patients with acute pancreatitis. Currently, analgesia, Ringer's lactate solution-based goal-directed fluid resuscitation and early oral refeeding providing enteral nutrition if not tolerated are the cornerstones for early management. Prophylactic antibiotics or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in the absence of cholangitis are considered to be futile. Future clinical trials should address optimal fluid resuscitation, the early administration of anti-inflammatory drugs and the exact role of nutritional support in severe acute pancreatitis.

Experts reached consensus that NAFLD does not reflect current knowledge, and metabolic (dysfunction) associated fatty liver disease ""MAFLD"" was suggested as a more appropriate overarching term.

31927766,Polyp Detection Rate Correlates Strongly with Adenoma Detection Rate in Trainee Endoscopists.,"The adenoma detection rate (ADR) is a widely accepted quality benchmark for screening colonoscopy but can be burdensome to calculate. Previous studies have shown good correlation between polyp detection rate (PDR) and ADR, but this has not been validated in trainees. Additionally, the correlation between PDR and detection rates for sessile serrated polyps (SSPDR) and advanced neoplasia (ANDR) is not well studied. We investigated the relationship between PDR and ADR, SSPDR, and ANDR in trainees. We examined 1600 outpatient colonoscopies performed by 24 trainees at a VA hospital from 2014 to 2017. Variables collected included patient demographics, year of fellowship, colonoscopy indication, and endoscopic and histologic findings. We calculated the overall ratios of PDR to ADR, SSPDR, and ANDR to assess the correlation between measured and calculated ADR, SSPDR, and ANDR, which is equivalent to the correlation between PDR and measured ADR, SSPDR, and ANDR. The overall PDR, ADR, SSPDR, and ANDR were 72%, 52%, 2%, and 14%. PDR (48%) was highest in the left colon, while ADR (32%) and ANDR (7%) were highest in the right colon (p < 0.001 for all). The overall ADR/PDR, SSPDR/PDR, and ANDR/PDR ratios were 0.73, 0.03, and 0.20. Correlation between PDR and ADR was highly positive overall (r = 0.87, p < 0.0001) and stronger in the right (r = 0.91) and transverse (r = 0.94) colon than the left colon (r = 0.80). Correlation between PDR and overall SSPDR and ANDR were not statistically significant. PDR can serve as a surrogate measure of ADR to monitor colonoscopy quality in gastroenterology fellowship.",Digestive diseases and sciences,2020-Aug,"Ng S, Sreenivasan AK, Pecoriello J, Liang PS",4,1614,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
33709606,Artificial intelligence in precision medicine in hepatology.,"The advancement of investigation tools and electronic health records (EHR) enables a paradigm shift from guideline-specific therapy toward patient-specific precision medicine. The multiparametric and large detailed information necessitates novel analyses to explore the insight of diseases and to aid the diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning (DL) provide various models of supervised, or unsupervised algorithms, and sophisticated neural networks to generate predictive models more precisely than conventional ones. The data, application tasks, and algorithms are three key components in AI. Various data formats are available in daily clinical practice of hepatology, including radiological imaging, EHR, liver pathology, data from wearable devices, and multi-omics measurements. The images of abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to predict liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and differentiation of benign tumors from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using EHR, the AI algorithms help predict the diagnosis and outcomes of liver cirrhosis, HCC, NAFLD, portal hypertension, varices, liver transplantation, and acute liver failure. AI helps to predict severity and patterns of fibrosis, steatosis, activity of NAFLD, and survival of HCC by using pathological data. Despite of these high potentials of AI application, data preparation, collection, quality, labeling, and sampling biases of data are major concerns. The selection, evaluation, and validation of algorithms, as well as real-world application of these AI models, are also challenging. Nevertheless, AI opens the new era of precision medicine in hepatology, which will change our future practice.",Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,2021-Mar,"Su TH, Wu CH, Kao JH",3,1821,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
33423305,Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasound in children.,"Gastrointestinal endoscopy is fundamental to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in pediatric gastroenterology. In the decades since endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) for hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease were introduced into clinical practice, there has been increasing interest in these procedures, and practice guidelines and position papers that clearly define the role of ERCP and EUS in children have been published. Based on the distinction of endoscopy between children and adults, this review focuses on the current state of ERCP and EUS procedures in children, including the types of endoscopes used in children, general anesthesia and radiation exposure, biliary and pancreatic indications, considerations of education and training for ERCP and EUS procedures in children, and expectations for development of endoscopes for children.",Digestive endoscopy : official journal of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society,2021-Nov,"Tagawa M, Morita A, Imagawa K, Mizokami Y",4,901,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
32359563,Technical Review on the Management of Eosinophilic Esophagitis: A Report From the AGA Institute and the Joint Task Force on Allergy-Immunology Practice Parameters.,"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the esophagus. Many new studies have been reported recently that describe EoE management. An expert panel was convened by the American Gastroenterological Association Institute and the Joint Task Force on Allergy-Immunology Practice Parameters to provide a technical review to be used as the basis for an updated clinical guideline. This technical review was developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Eighteen focused EoE management questions were considered, with 15 answered using the GRADE framework and 3 with a narrative summary. There is moderate certainty in the evidence that topical glucocorticosteroids effectively reduce esophageal eosinophil counts to <15 per high-power field over a short-term treatment period of 4-12 weeks, but very low certainty about the effects of using topical glucocorticosteroids as maintenance therapy. Multiple dietary strategies may be effective in reducing esophageal eosinophil counts to <15 per high-power field over a short-term treatment period, with moderate certainty for elemental diets, low certainty for empiric 2-, 4-, and 6-food elimination diets, and very low certainty that allergy-based testing dietary eliminations have a higher failure rate compared to empiric diet elimination. There is very low certainty for the effect of proton pump inhibitors in patients with esophageal eosinophilia. Although esophageal dilation appears to be relatively safe, there is no evidence that it reduces esophageal eosinophil counts. There is very low certainty in the effects of multiple other medical treatments for EoE: anti-interleukin-5 therapy, anti-interleukin-13 therapy, anti-IgE therapy, montelukast, cromolyn, and anti-TNF therapy.",Gastroenterology,2020-May,"Rank MA, Sharaf RN, Furuta GT, Aceves SS, Greenhawt M, Spergel JM, Falck-Ytter YT, Dellon ES",8,1817,gastroenterology,2025-11-22
34172254,Overcoming barriers to implementation of artificial intelligence in gastroenterology.,"Artificial intelligence is poised to revolutionize the field of medicine, however significant questions must be answered prior to its implementation on a regular basis. Many artificial intelligence algorithms remain limited by isolated datasets which may cause selection bias and truncated learning for the program. While a central database may solve this issue, several barriers such as security, patient consent, and management structure prevent this from being implemented. An additional barrier to daily use is device approval by the Food and Drug Administration. In order for this to occur, clinical studies must address new endpoints, including and beyond the traditional bio- and medical statistics. These must showcase artificial intelligence's benefit and answer key questions, including challenges posed in the field of medical ethics.",Best practice & research.
