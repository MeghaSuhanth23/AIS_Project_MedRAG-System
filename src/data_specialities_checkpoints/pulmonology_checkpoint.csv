36273933,Diagnosis and Treatment of Pleural Effusion. Recommendations of the Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery. Update 2022.,"Pleural effusion (PE) is a common yet complex disease that requires specialized, multidisciplinary management. Recent advances, novel diagnostic techniques, and innovative patient-centered therapeutic proposals have prompted an update of the current guidelines. This document provides recommendations and protocols based on a critical review of the literature on the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and new therapeutic options in PE, and addresses some cost-effectiveness issues related to the main types of PE.",Archivos de bronconeumologia,2023-Jan,"Botana Rial M, Pérez Pallarés J, Cases Viedma E, López González FJ, Porcel JM, Rodríguez M, Romero Romero B, Valdés Cuadrado L, Villena Garrido V, Cordovilla Pérez R",10,525,pulmonology,2025-11-22
39060018,ERS statement on benign pleural effusions in adults.,"The incidence of non-malignant pleural effusions far outweighs that of malignant pleural effusions and is estimated to be at least 3-fold higher. These so-called benign effusions do not follow a ""benign course"" in many cases, with mortality rates matching and sometimes exceeding those of malignant pleural effusions. In addition to the impact on patients, healthcare systems are also significantly affected, with recent US epidemiological data demonstrating that 75% of resource allocation for pleural effusion management is spent on non-malignant pleural effusions (excluding empyema). Despite this significant burden of disease, and by existing at the junction of multiple medical specialties, reflecting a heterogenous constellation of medical conditions, non-malignant pleural effusions are rarely the focus of research or the subject of management guidelines. With this European Respiratory Society Task Force, we assembled a multispecialty collaborative across 11 countries and three continents to provide a statement based on systematic searches of the medical literature to highlight evidence in the management of the following clinical areas: a diagnostic approach to transudative effusions, heart failure, hepatic hydrothorax, end-stage renal failure, benign asbestos-related pleural effusion, post-surgical effusion and nonspecific pleuritis.",The European respiratory journal,2024-Dec,"Sundaralingam A, Grabczak EM, Burra P, Costa MI, George V, Harriss E, Jankowska EA, Janssen JP, Karpathiou G, Laursen CB, Maceviciute K, Maskell N, Mei F, Nagavci B, Panou V, Pinelli V, Porcel JM, Ricciardi S, Shojaee S, Welch H, Zanetto A, Udayaraj UP, Cardillo G, Rahman NM",24,1354,pulmonology,2025-11-22
38812262,World Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (WABIP) guidelines on airway stenting for malignant central airway obstruction.,"Malignant Central Airway Obstruction (MCAO) encompasses significant and symptomatic narrowing of the central airways that can occur due to primary lung cancer or metastatic disease. Therapeutic bronchoscopy is associated with high technical success and symptomatic relief and includes a wide range of airway interventions including airway stents. Published literature suggests that stenting practices vary significantly across the world primarily due to lack of guidance. This document aims to address this knowledge gap by addressing relevant questions related to airway stenting in MCAO. An international group of 17 experts from 17 institutions across 11 countries with experience in using airway stenting for MCAO was convened as part of this guideline statement through the World Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (WABIP). We performed a literature and internet search for reports addressing six clinically relevant questions. This guideline statement, consisting of recommendations addressing these six PICO questions, was formulated by a systematic and rigorous process involving the evaluation of published evidence, augmented with expert experience when necessary. Panel members participated in the development of the final recommendations using the modified Delphi technique.","Respirology (Carlton, Vic.)",2024-Jul,"Chaddha U, Agrawal A, Kurman J, Ortiz-Comino R, Dutau H, Freitag L, Trisolini R, Dooms C, Zuccatosta L, Gasparini S, Herth F, Saka H, Lee P, Fielding D, Oki M, Rosell A, Murgu S",17,1310,pulmonology,2025-11-22
38719772,European Respiratory Society clinical practice guideline on symptom management for adults with serious respiratory illness.,"Respiratory symptoms are ubiquitous and impair health-related quality of life in people with respiratory disease. This European Respiratory Society (ERS) task force aimed to provide recommendations for symptomatic treatment in people with serious respiratory illness. The ERS task force comprised 16 members, including representatives of people with serious respiratory illness and informal caregivers. Seven questions were formulated, six in the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) format, which were addressed with full systematic reviews and evidence assessed using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). One question was addressed narratively. An ""evidence-to-decision"" framework was used to formulate recommendations. To treat symptoms in people with serious respiratory illness, the task force suggests the use of graded exercise therapy (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence); and suggests the use of a multicomponent services, handheld fan and breathing techniques (conditional recommendations, very low certainty of evidence). The task force suggests not to use opioids (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence); and suggests either administering or not administering supplemental oxygen therapy (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). The task force suggests that needs assessment tools may be used as part of a comprehensive needs assessment, but do not replace patient-centred care and shared decision making (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). The low certainty of evidence, modest impact of interventions on patient-centred outcomes, and absence of effective strategies to ameliorate cough highlight the need for new approaches to reduce symptoms and enhance wellbeing for individuals who live with serious respiratory illness.",The European respiratory journal,2024-Jun,"Holland AE, Spathis A, Marsaa K, Bausewein C, Ahmadi Z, Burge AT, Pascoe A, Gadowski AM, Collis P, Jelen T, Reilly CC, Reinke LF, Romero L, Russell AM, Saggu R, Solheim J, Vagheggini G, Vandendungen C, Wijsenbeek M, Tonia T, Smallwood N, Ekström M",22,1868,pulmonology,2025-11-22
33618053,Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning in Respiratory Medicine and Potential Role in Asthma and COPD Diagnosis.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, a subset of AI, are increasingly used in medicine. AI excels at performing well-defined tasks, such as image recognition; for example, classifying skin biopsy lesions, determining diabetic retinopathy severity, and detecting brain tumors. This article provides an overview of the use of AI in medicine and particularly in respiratory medicine, where it is used to evaluate lung cancer images, diagnose fibrotic lung disease, and more recently is being developed to aid the interpretation of pulmonary function tests and the diagnosis of a range of obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. The development and validation of AI algorithms requires large volumes of well-structured data, and the algorithms must work with variable levels of data quality. It is important that clinicians understand how AI can function in the context of heterogeneous conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease where diagnostic criteria overlap, how AI use fits into everyday clinical practice, and how issues of patient safety should be addressed. AI has a clear role in providing support for doctors in the clinical workplace, but its relatively recent introduction means that confidence in its use still has to be fully established. Overall, AI is expected to play a key role in aiding clinicians in the diagnosis and management of respiratory diseases in the future, and it will be exciting to see the benefits that arise for patients and doctors from its use in everyday clinical practice.",The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

37997890,Pulmonology for the rhinologist.,"The upper and lower airways are inter-related despite serving different functions and can no longer be considered separately. Rhinologists are becoming increasingly aware of the role the lower airway plays in optimizing outcomes for their patients. This review highlights recent developments in pulmonology that impact rhinologic conditions. The unified airway concept now supports the multidisciplinary management of respiratory and rhinologic pathologies. Biomarkers, biologics and the concept of treatable traits have permitted the development of personalized and precise treatment of the entire respiratory tract. The concept of corticosteroid stewardship, the introduction of steroid sparing agents for the treatment of respiratory diseases and the development of biomarkers, now forces us to be more considerate and precise with oral corticosteroid (OCS) prescribing and to consider reduction regimens. Finally, current research on climate change and vaping will allow us to better educate and prepare our patients to improve adherence and avoid exacerbations to maintain optimal global respiratory health. The inter-relatedness of the upper and lower airway has encouraged a multidisciplinary focus in respiratory medicine. More research is required to improve the precision respiratory medicine model, particularly in the realm of biomarkers and endotyping. These developments must also consider the impact of climate change, pollution and toxins for us to provide optimum care for our patients.",Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery,2024-Feb,"Campbell RG, Auyeung T, Katsoulotos GP",3,1503,pulmonology,2025-11-22

37916605,Artificial intelligence in interventional pulmonology.,"In recent years, there has been remarkable progress in the field of artificial intelligence technology. Artificial intelligence applications have been extensively researched and actively implemented across various domains within healthcare. This study reviews the current state of artificial intelligence research in interventional pulmonology and engages in a discussion to comprehend its capabilities and implications. Deep learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has found extensive applications in recent years, enabling highly accurate identification and labeling of bronchial segments solely from intraluminal bronchial images. Furthermore, research has explored the use of artificial intelligence for the analysis of endobronchial ultrasound images, achieving a high degree of accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant targets within ultrasound images. These advancements have become possible due to the increased computational power of modern systems and the utilization of vast datasets, facilitating detections and predictions with greater precision and speed. Artificial intelligence integration into interventional pulmonology has the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient safety, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes. However, the clinical impacts of artificial intelligence enhanced procedures remain unassessed.

35673857,Computational lung modelling in respiratory medicine.,"Computational modelling of the lungs is an active field of study that integrates computational advances with lung biophysics, biomechanics, physiology and medical imaging to promote individualized diagnosis, prognosis and therapy evaluation in lung diseases. The complex and hierarchical architecture of the lung offers a rich, but also challenging, research area demanding a cross-scale understanding of lung mechanics and advanced computational tools to effectively model lung biomechanics in both health and disease. Various approaches have been proposed to study different aspects of respiration, ranging from compartmental to discrete micromechanical and continuum representations of the lungs. This article reviews several developments in computational lung modelling and how they are integrated with preclinical and clinical data. We begin with a description of lung anatomy and how different tissue components across multiple length scales affect lung mechanics at the organ level. We then review common physiological and imaging data acquisition methods used to inform modelling efforts. Building on these reviews, we next present a selection of model-based paradigms that integrate data acquisitions with modelling to understand, simulate and predict lung dynamics in health and disease. Finally, we highlight possible future directions where computational modelling can improve our understanding of the structure-function relationship in the lung.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2022-Jun,"Neelakantan S, Xin Y, Gaver DP, Cereda M, Rizi R, Smith BJ, Avazmohammadi R",7,1458,pulmonology,2025-11-22

36931574,Interventional pulmonology techniques in lung transplantation.,"Lung transplantation is a key therapeutic option for several end-stage lung diseases. Interventional pulmonology techniques, mostly bronchoscopy, play a key role throughout the whole path of lung transplantation, from donor evaluation to diagnosis and management of post-transplant complications. We carried out a non-systematic, narrative literature review aimed at describing the main indications, contraindications, performance characteristics and safety profile of interventional pulmonology techniques in the context of lung transplantation. We highlighted the role of bronchoscopy during donor evaluation and described the debated role of surveillance bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy) to detect early rejection, infections and airways complications. The conventional (transbronchial forceps biopsy) and the new techniques (i.e. cryobiopsy, biopsy molecular assessment, probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy) can detect and grade rejection. Several endoscopic techniques (e.g. balloon dilations, stent placement, ablative techniques) are employed in the management of airways complications (ischemia and necrosis, dehiscence, stenosis and malacia). First line pleural interventions (i.e. thoracentesis, chest tube insertion, indwelling pleural catheters) may be useful in the context of early and late pleural complications occurring after lung transplantation.

The institution of lung cancer screening modalities as well as the search of additional minimally invasive diagnostic and treatment modalities for lung cancer and other chronic lung diseases has led to an increased focus on the field of interventional pulmonology. Rapid advancements in the field over the last 2 decades has led to development of various new minimally invasive bronchoscopic approaches and techniques for patients with cancer as well as for patients with chronic lung diseases. A review of literature was performed using PubMed database to identify all articles published up till October 2020 relevant to the field of interventional pulmonology and bronchoscopy. The reference list of each article was searched to look for additional articles, and all relevant articles were included in the article. Newer technologies are now available such navigation platforms to diagnose and possibly treat peripheral pulmonary nodules, endobronchial ultrasound in diagnosis of mediastinal and hilar adenopathy as well as cryobiopsy in the diagnosis of diffuse lung diseases. In addition, flexible and rigid bronchoscopy continues to provide new and expanding ability to manage patients with benign and malignant central airway obstruction. Interventions are also available for diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and emphysema that were traditionally treated with medical management alone. With continued high quality research and an increasing body of evidence, interventional bronchoscopy has enormous potential to provide both safe and effective options for patients with a variety of lung diseases.",American journal of therapeutics,2021-Feb,Agrawal A,1,1930,pulmonology,2025-11-22
34534017,Overview of Interventional Pulmonology for Radiologists.,"Interventional pulmonology is a growing field specializing in minimally invasive procedures of the mediastinum, lungs, airways, and pleura. These procedures have both diagnostic and therapeutic indications and are performed for benign and malignant diseases. Endobronchial US has been combined with transbronchial needle aspiration to extend tissue sampling beyond the airways and into the lungs and mediastinum. Recent innovations extending the peripheral access of bronchoscopy include electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy and thinner bronchoscopes. An important indication for therapeutic bronchoscopy is the relief of central airway obstruction, which may be severe and life threatening. Techniques for restoring patency of the central airways include mechanical debulking and multiple modalities for ablation, stent placement, and balloon bronchoplasty. Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction improves quality of life in certain patients with severe emphysema and is an important less invasive alternative to lung volume reduction surgery. Bronchial thermoplasty is likewise a nonpharmacologic treatment in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma. Many of these procedures have unique selection criteria that require precise evaluations at preprocedure imaging. Postprocedure imaging is also essential in determining outcome success and the presence of complications. Radiologists should be familiar with these procedures as well as the relevant imaging features in both planning and later surveillance. Evolving techniques that may become more widely available in the near future include robotic-assisted bronchoscopy, bronchoscopic transparenchymal nodule access, transbronchial cryobiopsy, ablation of early-stage cancers, and endobronchial intratumoral chemotherapy. <i>An invited commentary by Wayne et al is available online.</i> <sup>©</sup>RSNA, 2021.","Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",2021-,"Green DB, Groner LK, Lee JJ, Shin J, Broncano J, Vargas D, Castro M, Shostak E",8,1867,pulmonology,2025-11-22

38300006,Child Health and the Pediatric Pulmonology Workforce: 2020-2040.,"There is concern as to whether the supply of pediatric pulmonology (PULM) subspecialists will be adequate to meet future demand. As part of an American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) Foundation-sponsored supplement investigating the future of the pediatric subspecialty workforce, this article assesses the current PULM clinical workforce and estimates the clinical workforce supply in the United States through 2040. The current workforce was assessed using ABP certification and Maintenance of Certification data, and a workforce supply model evaluating population growth, clinical effort, and geographic trends was developed after incorporating ABP data. Findings demonstrate that the number of pediatric pulmonologists has gradually increased over the past decade, and the ratio of subspecialists to children is likely to increase another 20% to 40% over the next 2 decades, although absolute numbers remain small. Geographic variation in access will persist in some regions. The proportion of women in the discipline has increased, but the proportion of pediatric pulmonologists from underrepresented in medicine backgrounds still lags behind the general population. Based on current trends, the PULM clinical workforce appears equipped to meet both population growth and the modest increase in demand for clinical services speculated to occur because of changes in the subspecialty's clinical portfolio. However, several factors could inhibit growth, and geographic maldistribution may continue to impact care access. Efforts to address variation in access and demographic diversity in the field are warranted. This article concludes by discussing the training, clinical practice, policy, and future workforce research implications of the data presented.",Pediatrics,2024-Feb,"Noah TL, Boyer D, Davis SD, Vinci RJ, Oermann CM",5,1755,pulmonology,2025-11-22

To appreciate and illustrate the economic value of interventional pulmonology programs to hospital systems, physicians must have an understanding of basic health-care finance. Total revenue, adjusted gross revenue, contribution margin, variable direct costs, and indirect costs are terms that are essential for understanding the finances of bronchoscopy. Command of such vocabulary and its application is crucial for interventional pulmonologists to successfully establish financially sustainable bronchoscopy programs. Two significant features of an economically sustainable bronchoscopy program are high procedural volume and low direct cost per case. Interventional pulmonology programs are valuable to the patients being served and hospitals as a whole. Consideration of the various factors needed to maintain financial sustainability is essential to improve the quality of care for patients because the cost of care remains a critical driver in defining value.",Chest,2020-Sep,"Mahajan AK, Bautista J, Hodson E, Khandhar SJ, Folch E, Carroll S, Narang S",7,1071,pulmonology,2025-11-22

With the good number of available evidence, the use of interventional pulmonary procedures is also increasing. However, the studies on the safety and therapeutic benefit of these procedures in the elderly population are limited. Because of the paucity of data, we decided to do a systematic review of the scientific literature that is currently available, to boost confidence to do these procedures by clinicians. This review deals with the procedures that are commonly performed in elderly respiratory patients, their indications, safety and the diagnostic and therapeutic yield, and compares them with the results in the younger population. It also focuses on the safety of anaesthetic techniques used for these procedures in the elderly. The bottom line of this review is that there is no significant difference between the older and younger age groups with regard to the above parameters and that age alone is not a criterion to decide whether the patients may undergo interventional pulmonary procedures.",The Indian journal of tuberculosis,2022-,Valsalan P,1,1161,pulmonology,2025-11-22

These clinical practice guidelines include the latest updates of the SEPAR regulations for the diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant TB from 2017 and 2020 as the starting point. The methodology included asking relevant clinical questions based on PICO methodology, a literature search focusing on each question, and a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of the evidence, with a summary of this evidence for each question. Finally, recommendations were developed and the level of evidence and the strength of each recommendation for each question were established in concordance with the GRADE approach. Of the recommendations made, it is worth highlighting the high quality of the existing evidence for the use of nucleic acid amplification techniques (rapid genotypic tests) as initial tests for the detection of the M. tuberculosis genome and rifampicin resistance in people with presumptive signs or symptoms of pulmonary TB; and for the use of an oral combination of anti-TB drugs based on bedaquiline, delamanid (pretomanid), and linezolid, with conditional fluoroquinolone supplementation (conditioned by fluoroquinolone resistance) for six months for the treatment of people affected by pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).

37428775,Intellectual conflicts of interest among cardiology and pulmonology clinical practice guidelines.,"Intellectual conflicts of interest (COI), like financial COI, may threaten the validity and trustworthiness of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). However, comparatively little is known about intellectual COI in CPGs. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of intellectual COI and corresponding management strategies among cardiology and pulmonology CPGs. We conducted a retrospective document review of CPGs published by cardiology or pulmonology professional societies from the United States, Canada, or Europe from 2018 to 2019 available via the Emergency Care Research Institute, Guidelines International Network, or Medscape databases. We assessed the percentage of authors with an intellectual COI, defined as i) authorship on a study reviewed by the CPG, ii) authorship of a prior editorial related to a CPG recommendation, or iii) authorship of a prior related CPG. Management strategies assessed included use of GRADE methodology, inclusion of a methodologist, and recusals due to intellectual COI. Outcomes were assessed overall and compared between cardiology and pulmonology CPGs. Among the 39 CPGs identified (14 cardiology, 25 pulmonology), there were a total of 737 authors, of whom 473 (64%) had at least one intellectual COI. Among all CPGs, a median of 67% (Interquartile Range 50%-76%) of authors had at least one intellectual COI, and COI was more prevalent among cardiology compared with pulmonology CPGs (84% vs 57%, p<0.001). There was variable use of management strategies among the CPGs, including use of GRADE methodology (64% of CPGs), inclusion of a methodologist (49%), and recusals due to intellectual COI (0%). Intellectual conflicts of interest appear to be highly prevalent and under-reported among cardiology and pulmonology CPGs, which may threaten their validity.

38259362,The Algorithmic Lung Detective: Artificial Intelligence in the Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism.,"Pulmonary embolism (PE) poses a significant threat as the third leading cause of cardiovascular death, prompting the widespread use of CT pulmonary angiogram for rapid detection. Despite its prevalence, diagnostic accuracy remains variable among radiologists. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI), notably through convolutional neural networks and deep learning reconstruction, offers a promising avenue to enhance PE detection. AI demonstrates superior sensitivity and negative predictive values, reducing the risk of missed diagnoses. Implementation of AI-based worklist prioritization substantially shortens detection and notification times, streamlining radiological workflows. However, it is crucial to underscore that AI acts as a complement, not a replacement, for radiologists, synergizing with human expertise. As AI integration progresses, it holds the potential to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in pulmonary embolism detection while maintaining the essential role of human judgment in medical decision-making.",Cureus,2023-Dec,"Allena N, Khanal S",2,1056,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Novel noninvasive interventional procedures remain on the rise, accelerating demand for anesthesia support outside the conventional operating room. The field of interventional oncology has introduced a variety of effective minimally invasive therapies making interventional radiology gain a major role in the management of cancer. Technical innovation brings newer ablative and embolotherapy techniques into practice. Flexible bronchoscopy has replaced rigid bronchoscopy for many diagnostic and therapeutic indications. Endobronchial ultrasonography now allows sampling of mediastinal, paratracheal, or subcarinal lymph nodes rendering more invasive procedures such as mediastinoscopy unnecessary. Similarly, endoscopic ultrasonosgraphy currently plays a central position in the management of gastrointestinal disease. Sophisticated catheter techniques for ablating cardiac arrhythmias have become state of the art; Watchman procedure gaining position in the prevention of stroke resulting from atrial fibrillation.

37076652,Pediatric Pulmonology Training in India: Current Status and Future Directions.,"Respiratory illnesses are common causes of morbidity and mortality in children. Postgraduates in Pediatrics spent significant time in learning to manage respiratory disorders. Improved survival of preterm neonates, improved diagnosis and survival of chronic respiratory problems, and advances in diagnosis and therapeutics have increased the need for specialists trained in managing these patients. Training programs in Pediatric Pulmonology are evolving over the past few decades. In India, super-specialty training in Pediatric Pulmonology has grown over the past few years. There is a need to modify the training structure used in industrialized countries due to differences in patient population, priorities, and limited available resources and expertise. Formal training courses have been started in a limited number of institutions. There is a large gap between the need for a trained workforce and the available specialists in the limited number of institutions. The Indian Academy of Pediatrics National Respiratory Chapter (IAPNRC) has initiated a fellowship program to bridge the gap. Comprehensive training involving academic and hands-on training may go a long way to improve the care of children with acute and chronic respiratory problems.

Both percutaneous and surgical techniques have been validated and are chosen based on the local expertise available. A primary advantage to the percutaneous technique is the ability to perform this procedure in the ICU without transporting the patient to a procedure suite or operating room; this has become particularly important with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. An additional advantage is the ability to perform both the tracheostomy and the gastrostomy tube placement, if needed, during the same anesthetic episode. This decreases the need for additional sedation, interruption of anticoagulation, repeat transfusion, and coordination of care between multiple services. In the context of COVID-19, combined tracheostomy and gastrostomy placement exposes less health care providers overall and minimizes transportation needs.",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,2022-Aug,"Magge A, Oberg CL",2,1002,pulmonology,2025-11-22

COPD is more frequent among older adults and affects both genders. The aim of the current cross-sectional survey was to characterize chronic comorbidities stratified by gender and age among patients with COPD under the care of general practitioners (GP) and pulmonologists, using real-world patient data. A total of 7966 COPD patients (women: 45%) with more than 5 years of the observation period in the practice were examined using 60 different Chronic comorbid conditions (CCC) and Elixhauser measures. More than 9 in 10 patients had at least one, and 51.7% had more than three comorbidities. No gender difference was found in the number of comorbidities. However, men had higher Elixhauser-van Walraven index scores than women, and the types of comorbidities differed by gender. An increasing number of comorbidities was seen with aging but the patients in their 30s and 40s also had a high number of comorbidities. Moreover, GP patients had a higher number and a wider array of documented comorbidities than pulmonology patients did. Psychological comorbidities were common in all patients, but particularly among younger patients. These findings around gender- and age-stratified comorbidities under the care of GPs and pulmonologists have implications for the choice of data provenience for decision-making analysis and treatment selection and success.",NPJ primary care respiratory medicine,2022-May,"Kim-Dorner SJ, Schmidt T, Kuhlmann A, Graf von der Schulenburg JM, Welte T, Lingner H",6,1489,pulmonology,2025-11-22
36697210,The role of confocal laser endomicroscopy in pulmonary medicine.,"Accurate diagnosis and subsequent therapeutic options in pulmonary diseases mainly rely on imaging methods and histological assessment. However, imaging examinations are hampered by the limited spatial resolution of images and most procedures that are related to histological assessment are invasive with associated complications. As a result, a high-resolution imaging technology - confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), which is at the forefront and enables real-time microscopic visualisation of the morphologies and architectures of tissues or cells - has been developed to resolve the clinical dilemma pertaining to current techniques. The current evidence has shown that CLE has the potential to facilitate advanced diagnostic capabilities, to monitor and to aid the tailored treatment regime for patients with pulmonary diseases, as well as to expand the horizon for unravelling the mechanism and therapeutic targets of pulmonary diseases. In the future, if CLE can be combined with artificial intelligence, early, rapid and accurate diagnosis will be achieved through identifying the images automatically.

Here, the authors review COVID-19 pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and potential therapeutics, with a focus on management of COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. The authors draw on literature from other viral epidemics, treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and recent publications on COVID-19, as well as guidelines from major health organizations. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the evidence currently available to guide management of critically ill patients with COVID-19.",Anesthesiology,2020-Jun,"Greenland JR, Michelow MD, Wang L, London MJ",4,1158,pulmonology,2025-11-22
35654419,Malignant Central Airway Obstruction: What's New?,"Malignant central airway obstruction (MCAO) is a debilitating and life-limiting complication that occurs in an unfortunately large number of individuals with advanced intrathoracic cancer. Although the management of MCAO is multimodal and interdisciplinary, the task of providing patients with prompt palliation falls increasingly on the shoulders of interventional pulmonologists. While a variety of tools and techniques are available for the management of malignant obstructive lesions, advancements and evolution in this therapeutic venue have been somewhat sluggish and limited when compared with other branches of interventional pulmonary medicine (e.g., the early diagnosis of peripheral lung nodules). Indeed, one pragmatic, albeit somewhat uncharitable, reading of this article's title might suggest a wry smile and shug of the shoulders as to imply that relatively little has changed in recent years. That said, the spectrum of interventions for MCAO continues to expand, even if at a less impressive clip. Herein, we present on MCAO and its endoscopic and nonendoscopic management-that which is old, that which is new, and that which is still on the horizon.",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,2022-Aug,"Shaller BD, Filsoof D, Pineda JM, Gildea TR",4,1168,pulmonology,2025-11-22
32956713,Emotional Intelligence: Leadership Essentials for Chest Medicine Professionals.,"Emotional intelligence (EI) has become widely appreciated as an important leadership attribute, in business, education and, increasingly, in health care. Defined as ""the capacity to understand your own and others' emotions and to motivate and develop yourself and others in service of improved work performance and enhanced organizational effectiveness,"" EI is correlated with a number of success attributes in several sectors; for example, in business, with enhanced business performance and enhanced personal career success, and in health care, with enhanced patient satisfaction, lower burnout, lower litigation risk, and enhanced leadership success. While multiple models of EI have evolved, perhaps the most popular model is framed around four general rubrics with component competencies. The general rubrics are: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. EI can be measured by using available instruments, and it can be learned and taught. Indeed, teaching EI has become increasingly common in health-care organizations in service of improving health care and health-care leadership. Although more research is needed, ample evidence supports the notion that EI is a critical success element for success as a health-care leader, especially because EI competencies differ markedly from the clinical and scientific skills that are core to being a clinician and/or investigator. This review of EI presents evidence in support of the relevance of EI to health care and health-care leadership, discusses how and when EI can be developed among health-care providers, and considers remaining questions.",Chest,2021-May,Stoller JK,1,1638,pulmonology,2025-11-22

The string '(((pulmonary) OR respiratory)) AND ((artificial intelligence) OR machine learning)' was used in PubMed as a search strategy. The majority of studies identified corresponded to the area of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), in particular to COPD and chest computed tomography scans, interpretation of pulmonary function tests, exacerbations and treatment. Another field of interest is the application of AI and ML to the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease, and a few other studies were identified on the fields of mechanical ventilation, interpretation of images on chest X-ray and diagnosis of bronchial asthma.<b>Expert opinion</b>: ML may help to make clinical decisions but will not replace the physician completely.

33384039,The diagnosis of lung cancer in the era of interventional pulmonology.,"Advances in bronchoscopic and other interventional pulmonology technologies have expanded the sampling procedures pulmonologist can use to diagnose lung cancer and accurately stage the mediastinum. Among the modalities available to the interventional pulmonologist are endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needles aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) and transoesophageal bronchoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-B-FNA) for sampling peribronchial/perioesophageal central lesions and for mediastinal lymph node staging, as well as navigational bronchoscopy and radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-EBUS) for the diagnosis of peripheral lung cancer. The role of the interventional pulmonologist in this setting is to apply these procedures based on the correct interpretation of clinical and radiological findings in order to maximise the chances of achieving the diagnosis and obtaining sufficient tissue for molecular biomarker testing to guide targeted therapies for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. The safest and the highest diagnosis-yielding modality should be chosen to avoid a repeat sampling procedure if the first one is non-diagnostic. The choice of site and biopsy modality are influenced by tumour location, patient comorbidities, availability of equipment and local expertise.

The procedure instantaneously became popular throughout the world. Chevalier Jackson Sr from the United States further advanced the instrument, technique, safety, and application. In the 1960s, Professors Harold H. Hopkins and N.S. Kapany introduced optical rods as well as fiberoptics that led Karl Storz to develop the cold light system improving endoluminal illumination, achievements that ushered in the modern era of flexible endoscopy. Several diagnostic and therapeutic procedures became possible such as transbronchial needle biopsy, transbronchial lung biopsy, airway electrosurgery, or cryotherapy. Dr. Jean-François Dumon from France advanced the use of Nd-YAG laser in the endobronchial tree and created the dedicated Dumon silicone stent introducing the whole new field of interventional pulmonology (IP). This major milestone revitalized interest in rigid bronchoscopy (RB). Now, advancements are being made in stenting, instrumentation, and education. RB robotic technology advancements are currently anticipated and can potentially revolutionize the practice of pulmonary medicine.

38843911,ERS statement on transition of care in childhood interstitial lung diseases.,"Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are a heterogeneous group of rare diffuse diseases affecting the lung parenchyma in children and adults. Childhood interstitial lung diseases (chILD) are often diagnosed at very young age, affect the developing lung, and can have different presentations and prognosis compared to adult forms of these diseases. In addition, chILD in many cases may apparently remit, and have a better response to therapy and better prognosis than adult ILD. Many affected children will reach adulthood with minimal activity or clinical remission of the disease. They need continuing care and follow-up from childhood to adulthood if the disease persists and progresses over time, but also if they are asymptomatic and in full remission. Therefore, for every chILD patient an active transition process from paediatric to adult care should be guaranteed. This European Respiratory Society (ERS) statement provides a review of the literature and current practice concerning transition of care in chILD. It draws on work in existing transition care programmes in other chronic respiratory diseases, disease-overarching transition-of-care programmes, evidence on the impact of these programmes on clinical outcomes, current evidence regarding long-term remission of chILD as well as the lack of harmonisation between the current adult ILD and chILD classifications impacting on transition of care. While the transition system is well established in several chronic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or diabetes mellitus, we could not find sufficient published evidence on transition systems in chILD.

31593691,Basic Primer for Finances in Academic Adult and Pediatric Pulmonary Divisions.,"The finances of academic medical centers (AMCs) are complex and rapidly evolving. This financial environment can have important effects on faculty expectations, compensation, and the work environment. This article describes the commonly used concepts and models related to financial decision-making in Pulmonology and Critical Care divisions across AMCs in the United States. Faculty clinical productivity is often measured by work relative value units, which are set nationally for a discrete piece of physician work and attempt to equilibrate aspects of care across specialties. The expected clinical productivity and salary for a given faculty member are often determined relative to one or more national benchmarks developed from data submitted by departments and schools across the country. The most commonly used benchmarks include those from the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Medical Group Management Association. Changes to the paradigm of fee for service reimbursement are beginning to change physician compensation and incentive structures. In addition, research and education are key academic missions for faculty. It is important to understand the limitations of extramural research funding and implications for the support of research infrastructure. Measurements of productivity within education have been less codified, but some centers are attempting to create educational relative value units similar to those used in clinical productivity. In summary, faculty should understand basic concepts of finances. This knowledge includes a common set of terms and concepts that can help all faculty understand basic financial considerations in their work and lead to success for their divisions.",Chest,2020-Feb,"Schnapp LM, Steiner MJ, Davis SD",3,1724,pulmonology,2025-11-22
37210334,Gender equity of authorship in pulmonary medicine over the past decade.,"Gender disparity in authorship broadly persists in medical literature, little is known about female authorship within pulmonary medicine. A bibliometric analysis of publications from 2012 to 2021 in 12 journals with the highest impact in pulmonary medicine was conducted. Only original research and review articles were included. Names of the first and last authors were extracted and their genders were identified using the Gender-API web. Female authorship was described by overall distribution and distribution by country/region/continent and journal. We compared the article citations by gender combinations, evaluated the trend in female authorship, and forecasted when parity for first and last authorship would be reached. We also conducted a systematic review of female authorship in clinical medicine. 14,875 articles were included, and the overall percentage of female first authors was higher than last authors (37.0% vs 22.2%, p<0.001). Asia had the lowest percentage of female first (27.6%) and last (15.2%) authors. The percentages of female first and last authors increased slightly over time, except for a rapid increase in the COVID-19 pandemic periods. Parity was predicted in 2046 for the first authors and 2059 for the last authors. Articles with male authors were cited more than articles with female authors. However, male-male collaborations significantly decreased, whereas female-female collaborations significantly increased. Despite the slow improvement in female authorship over the past decade, there is still a substantial gender disparity in female first and last authorship in high-impact medical journals in pulmonary medicine.",Pulmonology,2023-,"Geng F, Ren Y, Hou H, Dai B, Scott JB, Strickland SL, Mehta S, Li J",8,1660,pulmonology,2025-11-22

This allows for decreased health care costs, less delay in diagnosis and treatment, reduced patient discomfort, and decreased morbidity compared with invasive surgical staging techniques. In comparison to conventional mediastinoscopy, the cost-effectiveness and reduced complication profile of the endoscopic approach has made this a superior initial step in the staging and diagnosis of lung cancer. Moreover, compared with EBUS alone, combined EUS and EBUS has significantly increased yield, as well as diagnostic sensitivity making a combined approach preferable as the emerging gold-standard technique for initial minimally invasive mediastinal staging. We discuss the advantage of using EUS in combination with EBUS and highlight techniques, lymph node landmarks, utility in staging and restaging of the mediastinum, roles in diagnosing mediastinal infections and granulomatous lesions, and future directions in endosonography.",Seminars in respiratory and critical care medicine,2022-Aug,"Khalid S, Hegde P",2,1110,pulmonology,2025-11-22

32250064,The role of a multidisciplinary team in a pediatric pulmonary hypertension center.,"The multidisciplinary team in a pediatric pulmonary hypertension (PH) center can improve the delivery of care to the PH patient by helping them address the different challenges that correlate to a PH diagnosis. Currently, there are a limited number of accredited pediatric PH centers nationwide, and many healthcare facilities have little experience managing patients with this complex and rare disease. Patients with PH may see providers from multiple medical specialties, inherit a high-cost burden from their PH medications, and have little community backing due to unfamiliarity of the disease. The multidisciplinary team can embrace these challenges. Through the delineation of tasks and roles within the composition of the team, patients can experience the support, resources, and care they need. The composition of the team can vary from center to center, but it may include an attending physician, advanced practice provider, nurse, dietitian, physiologists, respiratory therapists, social workers, research coordinators, and subspecialty collaboration including cardiology, pulmonology, genetics, psychology, and palliative care. When composing a multidisciplinary team, consider the heterogeneity of the patient population being served. Look at the resources available and overall community familiarity with PH. It is important to know the center's limits and refer to an expert PH center as necessary. The goal for every patient with pulmonary hypertension is to maximize their quality of life and outcomes, and the use of the multidisciplinary team is one approach to reaching this goal.",Pediatric pulmonology,2021-Mar,"Whalen E, Ely E, Brown A",3,1599,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Identifying current practice patterns for RB pertinent to anesthesia, multidisciplinary teams, and algorithms of intra and post-procedural care may inform best practice recommendations. Thirty-three-question survey created obtaining practice patterns for RB, disseminated via email to the members of the American Association of Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology and the American College of Chest Physicians Interventional Chest Diagnostic Procedures Network. One hundred seventy-five clinicians participated. Presence of a dedicated interventional pulmonology (IP) suite correlated with having a dedicated multidisciplinary RB team ( P =0.0001) and predicted higher likelihood of implementing team-based algorithms for managing complications (39.4% vs. 23.5%, P =0.024). A dedicated anesthesiology team was associated with the increased use of high-frequency jet ventilation ( P =0.0033), higher likelihood of laryngeal mask airway use post-RB extubation ( P =0.0249), and perceived lower rates of postprocedural anesthesia adverse effects ( P =0.0170). Although total intravenous anesthesia was the most used technique during RB (94.29%), significant variability in the modes of ventilation and administration of muscle relaxants was reported. Higher comfort levels in performing RB are reported for both anesthesiologists ( P =0.0074) and interventional pulmonologists ( P =0.05) with the presence of dedicated anesthesia and RB supportive teams, respectively. Interventional bronchoscopists value dedicated services supporting RB. Multidisciplinary dedicated RB teams are more likely to implement protocols guiding management of intraprocedural complications.

However, there are no data on resources and barriers to training and factors associated with fellow productivity. We surveyed US pediatric pulmonology fellowship program directors (FPDs) between March and October 2019. Our primary outcome was fellow productivity (>75% of fellows in the past 5 years had a manuscript accepted in a peer-reviewed journal). Analyses included descriptive statistics, χ<sup>2</sup> and Fisher's exact tests for categorical values, and t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for numerical values. Sixty-one percent (33/54) of FPDs completed the survey. Seventy-nine percent reported that most fellows completed clinical, basic science, or translational research. However, only 21% reported that most fellows pursued research positions after graduation; academic clinical positions were more common. For 21%, lack of funding and competing clinical responsibilities were barriers to completing the scholarly activity. Only 39% had highly productive programs; those FPDs were more likely to be highly satisfied with fellow scholarly activity products (p = 0.049) and have >6 publications in the previous 3 years (p = 0.03). Fifty-two percent of FPDs believed that pediatric pulmonary training should be shortened to 2 years for those pursuing clinical or clinician-educator careers.

32531116,A proposal for the addressing the needs of the pediatric pulmonary work force.,"Unprecedented opportunities and daunting difficulties are anticipated in the future of pediatric pulmonary medicine. To address these issues and optimize pediatric pulmonary training, a group of faculty from various institutions met in 2019 and proposed specific, long-term solutions to the emerging problems in the field. Input on these ideas was then solicited more broadly from faculty with relevant expertise and from recent trainees. This proposal is a synthesis of these ideas. Pediatric pulmonology was among the first pediatric specialties to be grounded deliberately in science, requiring its fellows to demonstrate expertise in scientific inquiry (1). In the future, we will need more training in science, not less. Specifically, the scope of scientific inquiry will need to be broader. The proposal outlined below is designed to help optimize the practices of current providers and to prepare the next generation to be leaders in pediatric care in the future. We are optimistic that this can be accomplished. Our broad objectives are (a) to meet the pediatric subspecialty workforce demand by increasing interest and participation in pediatric pulmonary training; (b) to modernize training to ensure that future pediatric pulmonologists will be prepared clinically and scientifically for the future of the field; (c) to train pediatric pulmonologists who will add value in the future of pediatric healthcare, complemented by advanced practice providers and artificial intelligence systems that are well-informed to optimize quality healthcare delivery; and (d) to decrease the cost and improve the quality of care provided to children with respiratory diseases.",Pediatric pulmonology,2020-Aug,"Gaston B, Laguna TA, Noah TL, Hagood J, Voynow J, Ferkol T, Hershenson M, Boyne K, Delecaris A, Ross K, Gozal D, Celedón JC, Abman SH, Moore P, Davis S, Cornfield DN, Murphy T",17,1672,pulmonology,2025-11-22

In January 2020, the first transmission to healthcare workers (HCWs) was described. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted between people because of contact, droplets, and airborne. Airborne transmission is caused by aerosols that remain infectious when suspended in air over long distances and time. In the clinical setting, airborne transmission may occur during aerosol generating procedures like flexible bronchoscopy. To date, although the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not clear the execution of bronchoscopy is associated with a considerably increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to HCWs. The aim of this overview is to summarize available recommendations and to apply them to pediatric bronchoscopy. We performed systematic literature searches using the MEDLINE (accessed via PubMed) and Scopus databases. We reviewed major recommendations and position statements published at the moment by the American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology, WHO, European Center for Disease Prevention and Control and expert groups on the management of patients with COVID-19 to limit transmission among HCWs.

This is a concise review of the Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine Core Curriculum presented at the 2022 American Thoracic Society International Conference. Neuromuscular diseases (NMD) comprise a variety of conditions that commonly affect the respiratory system and cause significant morbidity including dysphagia, chronic respiratory failure, and sleep disordered breathing. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of mortality in this population. Substantial progress has been made in diagnosis, monitoring and treatment for NMD over the last decade. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) is utilized to objectively measure respiratory pump function and PFT milestones are utilized in NMD-specific pulmonary care guidelines. New disease modifying therapies are approved for the treatment of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), including the first ever approved systemic gene therapy, in the case of SMA. Despite extraordinary progress in the medical management of NMD, little is known regarding the respiratory implications and long-term outcomes for patients in the era of advanced therapeutics and precision medicine. The combination of technological and biomedical advancements has increased the complexity of the medical decision-making process for patients and families, thus emphasizing the importance of balancing respect for autonomy with the other foundational principles of medical ethics.

33743400,Reactive oxygen species modulators in pulmonary medicine.,"Adapted to effectively capture oxygen from inhaled air and deliver it to all other parts of the body, the lungs constitute the organ with the largest surface area. This makes the lungs more susceptible to airborne pathogens and pollutants that mediate pathologies through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

39318837,A Multi-Specialty Delphi Consensus on Assessing and Managing Cardiopulmonary Risk in Patients with COPD.,"In Canada, COPD represents a significant burden to the patient and health system, as it is often under or misdiagnosed and sub-optimally treated. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a common co-morbidity in COPD and there is significant interplay between these two chronic conditions. Across all stages of COPD disease severity, deaths can be attributed not only to respiratory causes but also to cardiovascular-related factors. The established links between COPD and CVD suggest the need for a greater degree of collaboration between respirologists and cardiologists. This modified Delphi consensus was initiated to consider how optimal COPD care can be delivered within Canada, with specific consideration of reducing cardiopulmonary risk and outcomes in COPD patients. A steering group with interest in the management of COPD and CVD from primary care, cardiology, and respirology identified 40 statements formed from four key themes. A 4-point Likert scale questionnaire was sent to healthcare professionals working in COPD across Canada by an independent third party to assess agreement (consensus) with these statements. Consensus was defined as high if ≥75% and very high if ≥90% of respondents agreed with a statement. A total of 100 responses were received from respirologists (n=30), cardiologists (n=30), and primary care physicians (n=40). Consensus was very strong (≥90%) in 28 (70%) statements, strong (≥75 and <90%) in 7 (17.5%) statements and was not achieved (<75%) in 5 (12.5%) of statements. Based on the consensus scores, 9 key recommendations were proposed by the steering group. These focus on the need to comprehensively risk stratify and manage COPD patients to help prevent exacerbations. Consensus within this study provides a call to action for the expeditious implementation of the latest COPD guidelines from the Canadian Thoracic Society.",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,2024-,"Bhutani M, Bourbeau J, Goodman SG, Hawkins NM, Kaplan AG, Lin PJ, Penz ED, Verma S, Zieroth S",9,1864,pulmonology,2025-11-22
39370862,Pulmonary endoscopy - central to an interventional pulmonology program.,"Pulmonary endoscopy occupies a central role in Interventional Pulmonology and is frequently the mainstay of diagnosis of respiratory disease, in particular lung malignancy. Older techniques such as rigid bronchoscopy maintain an important role in central airway obstruction. Renewed interest in the peripheral pulmonary nodule is driving major advances in technologies to increase the diagnostic accuracy and advance new potential endoscopic therapeutic options. This paper describes the role of pulmonary endoscopy, in particular ultrasound in the diagnosis and staging of lung malignancy. We will explore the recent expansion of ultrasound to include endoscopic ultrasound - bronchoscopy (EUS-B) and combined ultrasound (CUS) techniques. We will discuss in detail the advances in the workup of the peripheral pulmonary nodule.We performed a non-systematic, narrative review of the literature to summarize the evidence regarding the indications, diagnostic yield, and safety of current bronchoscopic sampling techniques. EBUS/EUS-B has revolutionized the diagnosis and staging of thoracic malignancy resulting in more accurate assessment of the mediastinum compared to mediastinoscopy alone, thus reducing the rate of futile thoracotomies. Although major advances in the assessment of the peripheral pulmonary nodule have been made, the role of endoscopy in this area requires further clarification and investigation.",Expert review of respiratory medicine,2024-Nov,"Griffiths S, Power L, Breen D",3,1418,pulmonology,2025-11-22

39282881,Integrating novel interventional techniques into pediatric pulmonology training.,"To review the evolution of pediatric pulmonology interventions and propose strategies for advancing training in the field. I examined the historical development of pediatric pulmonology interventions and current training practices, including hands-on courses and fellowship programs. I reviewed a survey of US pediatric pulmonology centers to assess variability in procedural expertise. Historically, foreign body removal dominated pediatric pulmonology interventions. Advancements in technology have expanded the field to include techniques such as endobronchial and transbronchial biopsies, airway lumen restoration, and cryotherapy, enabling more accurate tissue sampling with larger specimens while maintaining safety. Hands-on courses, offered globally and at major conferences, provide opportunities for skill development, self-assessment, and networking. However, limited availability leads to high demand and long waiting lists. A survey of US pediatric pulmonology centers revealed significant variability in procedural expertise, highlighting the need for uniform training across institutions. To better integrate interventional techniques, I propose that pediatric pulmonology training could benefit from a structured, tiered approach: (1) expanding hands-on workshops and incorporating them into fellowship programs, (2) facilitating collaborations between centers of excellence to allow trainees to rotate through institutions with advanced expertise, and (3) developing an additional year of training for an ""Advanced Pediatric Pulmonologist"" certification. This approach aims to ensure proficiency in the latest interventional techniques, standardize care, and foster advancements across the field.",Pediatric pulmonology,2025-Mar,Schramm D,1,1713,pulmonology,2025-11-22

This popularity links inextricably to an increase in ionizing radiation use. Knowing ionizing radiation is hazardous, knowledge and competent use of X-ray imaging and guidance systems are important. The globally implemented As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) principle demands careful attention to minimize radiation exposure while achieving the precise goals of the intervention and imaging therein. To allow careful and targeted weighing of risk against reward while using X-ray based equipment, proper background knowledge of physics as well as imaging system aspects are needed. This white paper summarizes the principles of ionizing radiation which are crucial to enhance awareness and interpretation of dosimetric quantities. Consecutively, a consensus on standards for reporting radiation exposure in interventional pulmonology procedures is indicated to facilitate comparisons between different systems, approaches and results.

32409611,Applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in respiratory medicine.,"The past 5 years have seen an explosion of interest in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques in medicine. This has been driven by the development of deep neural networks (DNNs)-complex networks residing in silico but loosely modelled on the human brain-that can process complex input data such as a chest radiograph image and output a classification such as 'normal' or 'abnormal'. DNNs are 'trained' using large banks of images or other input data that have been assigned the correct labels. DNNs have shown the potential to equal or even surpass the accuracy of human experts in pattern recognition tasks such as interpreting medical images or biosignals. Within respiratory medicine, the main applications of AI and machine learning thus far have been the interpretation of thoracic imaging, lung pathology slides and physiological data such as pulmonary function tests.

The quality of health care can be measured by comparing the performance of an individual or a health service with an ideal threshold or benchmark. The taskforce sought to evaluate quality indicators in EBUS bronchoscopy based on clinical relevance/importance and on the basis that observed significant variation in outcomes indicates potential for improvement in health care outcomes. A comprehensive literature review informed the composition of a comprehensive list of candidate quality indicators in EBUS. A multiple-round modified Delphi consensus process was subsequently performed with the aim of reaching consensus over a final list of quality indicators and performance targets for these indicators. Standard reporting items were developed, with a strong preference for items where evidence demonstrates a relationship with quality indicator outcomes. Twelve quality Indicators are proposed, with performance targets supported by evidence from the literature. Standardized reporting items for both radial and linear EBUS are recommended, with evidence supporting their utility in assessing procedural outcomes presented. This statement is intended to provide a framework for individual proceduralists to assess the quality of EBUS they provide their patients through the identification of clinically relevant, feasible quality measures. Emphasis is placed on outcome measures, with a preference for consistent terminology to allow communication and benchmarking between centres.","Respirology (Carlton, Vic.)",2023-Aug,"Steinfort DP, Evison M, Witt A, Tsaknis G, Kheir F, Manners D, Madan K, Sidhu C, Fantin A, Korevaar DA, Van Der Heijden EHFM",11,1655,pulmonology,2025-11-22
34490551,"Fungal Genomics in Respiratory Medicine: What, How and When?","Respiratory infections caused by fungal pathogens present a growing global health concern and are a major cause of death in immunocompromised patients. Worryingly, coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome has been shown to predispose some patients to airborne fungal co-infections. These include secondary pulmonary aspergillosis and mucormycosis. Aspergillosis is most commonly caused by the fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus and primarily treated using the triazole drug group, however in recent years, this fungus has been rapidly gaining resistance against these antifungals. This is of serious clinical concern as multi-azole resistant forms of aspergillosis have a higher risk of mortality when compared against azole-susceptible infections. With the increasing numbers of COVID-19 and other classes of immunocompromised patients, early diagnosis of fungal infections is critical to ensuring patient survival. However, time-limited diagnosis is difficult to achieve with current culture-based methods. Advances within fungal genomics have enabled molecular diagnostic methods to become a fast, reproducible, and cost-effective alternative for diagnosis of respiratory fungal pathogens and detection of antifungal resistance.

In the field of sleep-disordered breathing, the novel eHealth methods already do offer smart solutions for currently insufficiently addressed problems. In general, the potential of telemedicine tools can be focused on three basic aspects: interaction between clinicians, interaction between clinician and patient, and interaction between patient and the mobile health technology. The pandemic situation resulted in a rapid development of reimbursement for telehealth services. In recent years, evidence on the positive benefits of using telemedicine-based support as part of respiratory therapy follow-up is increasing. It is important to consider patient groups, telemedicine methodology, type of intervention, and targeting criteria in all studies conducted. Given the scarcity of resources for leading common diseases, we must keep an eye on the new digitization concepts in respiratory medicine care. It must be implemented precisely, cost-effectively, and also more connecting between sectors and disciplines and at eye level with our patients. By means of patient engagement systems, an important part of modern precision medicine can be established. Digital support systems are valuable for supporting medical staff.

34698676,The role of interventional pulmonology in pleural disease diagnosis and management.,"Pleural disease guidelines have not been updated in a decade. Advances have been made in the diagnosis and management of pleural diseases since, with expanding evidence of the utility of medical thoracoscopy (MT) as a safe and effective tool. Although thoracic ultrasound has improved early determination of pleural disease etiology, thoracentesis remains limited, and pleural tissue is necessary for the diagnosis of undifferentiated exudative pleural effusions. Medical thoracoscopy has been shown to be superior to traditional closed pleural biopsy, and recent literature is focused on which technique is best. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) found rigid mini-thoracoscopy was not superior to semirigid thoracoscopy. Meta-analyses have not found pleural cyrobiopsy to be superior to forceps biopsies. As a therapeutic tool, meta-analysis suggests MT as a possible first-line tool for the treatment of complicated parapneumonic effusions (CPE) and early empyema. A RCT comparing MT to intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy demonstrated that the former technique is safe, effective, and may shorten hospital length of stay in patients with CPE/empyema. The implications of the recent findings in the medical literature are that medical thoracoscopy, particularly by trained Interventional Pulmonologists, will find an expanded role in future iteration of pleural disease guidelines.",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,2022-Jan,Flora AS,1,1390,pulmonology,2025-11-22
39452060,Utility of Raman Spectroscopy in Pulmonary Medicine.,"The Raman effect, or as per its original description, ""modified scattering"", is an observation that the number of scattered light waves shifts after photons make nonelastic contact with a molecule. This effect allows Raman spectroscopy to be very useful in various fields. Although it is well known that Raman spectroscopy could be very beneficial in medicine as a diagnostic tool, there are not many applications of Raman spectroscopy in pulmonary medicine. Mostly tumor tissue, sputum and saliva have been used as material for analysis in respiratory medicine. Raman spectroscopy has shown promising results in malignancy recognition and even tumor staging. Saliva is a biological fluid that could be used as a reliable biomarker of the physiological state of the human body, and is easily acquired. Saliva analysis using Raman spectroscopy has the potential to be a relatively inexpensive and quick tool that could be used for diagnostic, screening and phenotyping purposes. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a growing cause of disability and death, and its phenotyping using saliva analysis via Raman spectroscopy has a great potential to be a dependable tool to, among other things, help reduce hospitalizations and disease burden. Although existing methods are effective and generally available, Raman spectroscopy has the benefit of being quick and noninvasive, potentially reducing healthcare costs and workload.",Advances in respiratory medicine,2024-Oct,"Dzelve P, Legzdiņa A, Krūmiņa A, Tirzīte M",4,1434,pulmonology,2025-11-22
38081218,Development and Update of Guideline-based Quality Indicators in Lung Cancer.,"In 2022, an update of the German lung cancer guideline, first published in 2010 and revised in 2018, was released. This article aims to show the process of updating, developing, and implementing guideline-based quality indicators (QI) into the certification system for lung cancer centers (LCC). A multidisciplinary and interprofessional working group revised the guideline QIs from 2018 using the strong recommendations of the guideline update, a systematic review for QIs, and the results of the implemented QIs from LCC. For 4 out of 8 indicators from the 2018 guideline, the LCC showed an improved implementation of the requirements in the last 3 years (2018-2020). For 3 indicators, the median of the results was constant at a very high level (≥96% or 100%). Only the ""adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy"" indicator showed declining values between 2018 and 2020. The target values and plausibility limits were well achieved by LCC. After updating the guideline, one QI from 2018 was not included in the new QI set due to the small denominator population. Based on the new strong recommendations, 8 new QIs were defined. From the QI set of the guideline update, 13 of 15 indicators (7 since 2018 and 6 from 2022 on) were adopted into the certification program. The guideline recommendations are implemented by LCC at a high level. The process presented confirms the successful implementation of the so-called quality cycle in oncology. The QIs developed by the German Guideline Program in Oncology (GGPO) are adopted by the certification program. The implementation of the QI is measured in LCC, evaluated by the German Cancer Society (DKG), and reflected back to the GGPO. The ""real world"" data have led to the deletion of one QI and show a high implementation of most QIs in LCC.","Pneumologie (Stuttgart, Germany)",2024-Apr,"Utzig M, Hoffmann H, Reinmuth N, Schütte W, Langer T, Lobitz J, Rückher J, Wesselmann S",8,1787,pulmonology,2025-11-22
32971076,Change: Leadership Essentials for Chest Medicine Professionals.,"Change is a fact of life; the absence of change creates stagnation. This is perhaps especially true in health care, where progress in treating disease depends on innovation and progress. At the same time, change is often uncomfortable. Thus, it is helpful to model the change process to optimize the chances of successfully effecting change. Furthermore, how to lead change is a critical leadership competency. Three models for leading change are reviewed: the first-the eight stages of change-which was not designed for health care; the second called ""switch""; and the third called Amicus, which was uniquely designed for health care. The models share many common features, with the explicit reminder in the third model that physicians should be involved in the change effort early. Although sparse, the evidence does suggest the applicability of these models to health care. Beyond having a roadmap for leading change, it is helpful to assess the worthiness of undertaking a change effort and of predicting the phasic response to change efforts, given that humans are often change-averse. In this regard, both the ""payoff matrix"" and the change curve, derived from the work of Kübler-Ross on grieving, are offered as tools. Finally, physicians' avidity for change is framed by two opposing vectors. On the one hand, physicians share in the general human aversion to change. On the other hand, physicians are data-reverent and also wish to do their best for patients, which encourages their embrace of ever-increasing evidence and change.",Chest,2021-Apr,Stoller JK,1,1539,pulmonology,2025-11-22

38197436,Training in interventional pulmonology: a leap into the future.,"This review holds significant relevance and is timely; as of June 2022, the United States Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) formally recognized interventional pulmonary medicine as a novel subspecialty with a unique fellowship training program pathway beyond Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine. This recognition stands as a culmination of extensive efforts spanning decades, aimed at establishing a specialized training program for interventional pulmonary medicine beyond traditional Pulmonary and Critical Care Fellowship in the United States. Globally, there are apprenticeship models in non-US programs with ongoing efforts to further standardize training in interventional pulmonary medicine. It underscores the progressive evolution and innovative nature inherent to this subspecialty, signifying a distinctive leap forward in medical education and practice, which calls for further inventive development of training tools and standardized educational delivery. Newly discovered insights from the recent literature review will highlight methodologies of procedural education and innovative training approaches. These findings will underscore the significance of standardized curriculum development within the field as well as ongoing challenges. Identifying and addressing future challenges in integrating new technologies into clinical education and broadening the educational scope of trainees in this newly recognized subspecialty is crucial for enhancing competency. The implications of moving toward a more standardized process, creating new clinical pathways with research, and adopting emerging minimally invasive technologies aim to impact patient outcomes in both nonmalignant and malignant thoracic diseases. This progressive shift is redefining the specialty, moving beyond specific procedures, and pivoting towards a more distinct educational pathway.

37100256,Cardiopulmonary exercise testing applied to respiratory medicine: Myths and facts.,"Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) remains poorly understood and, consequently, largely underused in respiratory medicine. In addition to a widespread lack of knowledge of integrative physiology, several tenets of CPET interpretation have relevant controversies and limitations which should be appropriately recognized. With the intent to provide a roadmap for the pulmonologist to realistically calibrate their expectations towards CPET, a collection of deeply entrenched beliefs is critically discussed. They include a) the actual role of CPET in uncovering the cause(s) of dyspnoea of unknown origin, b) peak O<sub>2</sub> uptake as the key metric of cardiorespiratory capacity, c) the value of low lactate (""anaerobic"") threshold to differentiate cardiocirculatory from respiratory causes of exercise limitation, d) the challenges of interpreting heart rate-based indexes of cardiovascular performance, e) the meaning of peak breathing reserve in dyspnoeic patients, f) the merits and drawbacks of measuring operating lung volumes during exercise, g) how best interpret the metrics of gas exchange inefficiency such as the ventilation-CO<sub>2</sub> output relationship, h) when (and why) measurements of arterial blood gases are required, and i) the advantages of recording submaximal dyspnoea ""quantity"" and ""quality"". Based on a conceptual framework that links exertional dyspnoea to ""excessive"" and/or ""restrained"" breathing, I outline the approaches to CPET performance and interpretation that proved clinically more helpful in each of these scenarios. CPET to answer clinically relevant questions in pulmonology is a largely uncharted research field: I, therefore, finalize by highlighting some lines of inquiry to improve its diagnostic and prognostic yield.",Respiratory medicine,2023-Aug,Neder JA,1,1774,pulmonology,2025-11-22
32956716,"Leadership Essentials for CHEST Medicine Professionals: Models, Attributes, and Styles.","In the context that leadership matters and that leadership competencies differ from those needed to practice medicine or conduct research, developing leadership competencies for physicians is important. Indeed, effective leadership is needed ubiquitously in health care, both at the executive level and at the bedside (eg, leading clinical teams and problem-solving on the ward). Various leadership models have been proposed, most converging on common attributes, like envisioning a new and better future state, inspiring others around this shared vision, empowering others to effect the vision, modeling the expected behaviors, and engaging others by appealing to shared values. Attention to creating an organizational culture that is informed by the seven classic virtues (trust, compassion, courage, justice, wisdom, temperance, and hope) can also unleash discretionary effort in the organization to achieve high performance. Health care-specific leadership competencies include: technical expertise, not only in one's clinical/scientific arena to garner colleagues' respect but also regarding operations; strategic thinking; finance; human resources; and information technology. Also, knowledge of the regulatory and legislative environments of health care is critical, as is being a problem-solver and lifelong learner. Perhaps most important to leadership in health care, as in all sectors, is having emotional intelligence.

32345516,The protective and pathogenic roles of CXCL17 in human health and disease: Potential in respiratory medicine.,"C-X-C motif chemokine 17 (CXCL-17) is a novel chemokine that plays a functional role maintaining homeostasis at distinct mucosal barriers, including regulation of myeloid-cell recruitment, angiogenesis, and control of microorganisms. Particularly, CXCL17 is produced along the epithelium of the airways both at steady state and under inflammatory conditions. While increased CXCL17 expression is associated with disease progression in pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung/hepatic cancer, it is thought to play a protective role in pancreatic cancer, autoimmune encephalomyelitis and viral infections. Thus, there is emerging evidence pointing to both a harmful and protective role for CXCL17 in human health and disease, with therapeutic potential for translational applications. In this review, we provide an overview of the discovery, characteristics and functions of CXCL17 emphasizing its clinical potential in respiratory disorders.",Cytokine & growth factor reviews,2020-Jun,"Choreño-Parra JA, Thirunavukkarasu S, Zúñiga J, Khader SA",4,937,pulmonology,2025-11-22

39513972,Competency-based medical education in interventional pulmonology: current state and future opportunities.,"This chapter examines the evolution and current status of competency-based medical education (CBME) in interventional pulmonology, focusing on procedural skills assessment and training. Traditionally, interventional pulmonology training has used an apprenticeship model with case logs and director attestation, leading to inconsistent outcomes due to a lack of standardized curricula. CBME, established to address these issues, relies on outcome-based assessments to ensure trainees achieve necessary competencies. The chapter reviews various assessment tools, including global rating scales, checklists, and simulation-based methods, and their effectiveness in skill acquisition and clinical evaluation. It also covers specific procedures such as EBUS-TBNA, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, and rigid bronchoscopy, discussing their assessment tools and learning curves. The chapter emphasizes the need for standardized assessment tools and suggests using entrustable professional activities (EPAs) to improve competency evaluation. Future directions include integrating real-time artificial intelligence feedback, addressing high-risk low-volume procedures, and enhancing workplace-based assessments to improve interventional pulmonology training and patient care quality. This chapter reviews the transition from traditional apprenticeship models to CBME in interventional pulmonology, highlighting advancements in procedural skills assessment, the effectiveness of various assessment tools, and future directions for improving training and patient care.",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,2025-Jan,"Hostetter LJ, Nelson DR",2,1564,pulmonology,2025-11-22

35339419,Pre- and post-COVID practice of interventional pulmonology in adults in Portugal.,"There is a lack of information regarding bronchoscopy practice in adults in Portugal. Our objective was to obtain an overview of the characteristics, resources, techniques and behaviors in national interventional pulmonology (IP) units, before and after SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. An online survey was developed by an expert panel with a total of 46 questions comprising the specifications of each unit, namely physical space, equipment, staff, procedure planning, monitoring, technical differentiation, and numbers pre- and post-COVID-19. Forty-one interventional pulmonology centers were invited to participate between April and May 2021. 37 units (90.2%) responded to the survey. The majority (64.9%) have a fully dedicated space with a weekly presence of ≥3 chest physicians (82.1%) and support of an anesthesiologist on specific days (48.6%). There is marked heterogeneity in the IP unit's equipment, and 56.8% acquired disposable bronchoscopes after COVID-19 pandemics. Pre-bronchoscopy hemogram, platelet count and coagulation tests are regularly asked by more than 90% of the units, even when deep sedation or biopsies are not planned. In 97.3% of cases, topical anesthesia and midazolam are utilized. Propofol (21.6%) and fentanyl (29.7%) are occasionally employed in some institutions. Most units use ancillary sampling techniques to diagnose central or peripheral lesions, with radial EBUS being used for guidance of distal procedures in 37.8% of centers, linear EBUS and EUS-B-FNA for mediastinal diagnosis and/or staging in 45.9% and 27.0% of units, respectively. Cryobiopsies are used by 21.6% of respondents to diagnose diffuse lung diseases. Rigid bronchoscopy is performed in 37.8% of centers. There was a decrease in the number of flexible (p < 0.001) and rigid (p = 0.005) bronchoscopies and an upscale of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 outbreak.

39210531,The Influence of Thoracic Ultrasound on the Clinical Practice of Pulmonologists in Portugal.,"Thoracic ultrasound (TUS) has garnered increased recognition, both in aiding pleural procedures and as a complement to physical examination. Operator ability is essential to obtain reliable findings. This study aimed to inquire pulmonology specialists and residents about their confidence with the technique and to determine future needs. A self-administered online survey, including a total of 24 questions, was sent to pulmonology specialists and residents registered as members of the Portuguese Pulmonology Society. Participation was pseudoanonymized and voluntary. One hundred fourteen valid answers were obtained. Most responders had prior TUS training. The primary method for knowledge consolidation was unsupervised practice. The majority had an ultrasound machine available in their daily practice; only 17% performed TUS more than 3 times per week. Overall confidence in TUS usage for diagnostic purposes (median: 7/10), disease monitoring (median: 7/10), and invasive procedures (median: 8/10) were high. There was a significant relation between higher levels of confidence and regularly attending TUS courses and performing TUS more than 3 times per week. The main reasons cited as preventing regular use of TUS were the availability/cost of courses and the availability/cost of equipment. Regular TUS training and utilization are essential to boost user's confidence degree. Its use is already a regular feature in the daily practice of pulmonologists in Portugal, but further and better structured training is required to meet the needs of clinicians. The inclusion of mandatory TUS training in residency programs should be considered in the future.",Journal of bronchology & interventional pulmonology,2024-Oct,"Silva BS, Ferraz B, Costa MI, Brandão ME, Cortesão N",5,1663,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Although lung sound auscultation is a common clinical practice, its use in diagnosis is limited due to its high variability and subjectivity. We review the origin of lung sounds, various auscultation and processing methods over the years and their clinical applications to understand the potential for a lung sound auscultation and analysis device. Respiratory sounds result from the intra-pulmonary collision of molecules contained in the air, leading to turbulent flow and subsequent sound production. These sounds have been recorded via an electronic stethoscope and analyzed using back-propagation neural networks, wavelet transform models, Gaussian mixture models and recently with machine learning and deep learning models with possible use in asthma, COVID-19, asbestosis and interstitial lung disease. The purpose of this review was to summarize lung sound physiology, recording technologies and diagnostics methods using AI for digital pulmonology practice. Future research and development in recording and analyzing respiratory sounds in real time could revolutionize clinical practice for both the patients and the healthcare personnel.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2023-Jun,"Sethi AK, Muddaloor P, Anvekar P, Agarwal J, Mohan A, Singh M, Gopalakrishnan K, Yadav A, Adhikari A, Damani D, Kulkarni K, Aakre CA, Ryu AJ, Iyer VN, Arunachalam SP",15,1445,pulmonology,2025-11-22
37517403,Women in Interventional Pulmonology: Results from a Worldwide Survey.,"Gender inequality in medicine remains an issue. Despite the increasing proportion of female physicians, women still appear underrepresented in interventional pulmonology (IP) careers. To date, no data are available on the gender distribution in IP. An online survey was sent to pulmonary physicians internationally between July and December 2022. The survey included questions on gender diversity in the pulmonology departments, such as the proportion of male, female, and gender diverse physicians performing bronchoscopy, career progression, and social life. Responses from 92 physicians (mean age 45 ± 10 years) from 47 hospitals across 17 countries were analysed, of whom 52% were women. Overall, 79% of the respondents were pulmonologists and 83% perform bronchoscopy. Although men continue to dominate bronchoscopy (65 vs. 43%) and are more likely to be involved in research (89 vs. 77%), the observed difference is statistically not significant (p = 0.135 and p = 0.281). Leading positions are held by 60% of male respondents and 23% of female respondents (p = 0.002). Men are also more often reported to have academic awards. Discrimination based on gender was reported by 5.3% of all men and 26.8% of all women (p = 0.023). Men and women are almost equally involved in IP, especially in female-led bronchoscopy units.

It should be pointed out that the scientific literature is to some extent controversial due to a paucity of large randomized multicenter studies with long-term follow-up. Moreover, the telematics devices and systems on the market vary widely. As a result, the recommendations are based primarily on a consensus of expert professionals. Another very important aspect addressed extensively in this document is the obvious lack of regulations on legal matters and the operations of commercial companies. The most important recommendations included in this position paper are that telemedicine is primarily advocated in subjects with travel problems or who live far from the hospital, in patients with poor CPAP compliance, and in most cases treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation. A key element is patient individualization. It is imperative that the relevant technical, legal and ethical requirements (medical device regulations, data protection, and informed consent) are met.

These programs have proliferated as institutions focus on providing greater care coordination and family satisfaction. However, few cost, charge, and satisfaction data exist to support these resource-intensive programs. The goal of this study was to investigate the value of combined triple endoscopy delivered by the Aero Program through analysis of institutional charges, direct costs, operating room efficiency metrics, and parent satisfaction. Program evaluation. Finance, satisfaction, efficiency, and quality-of-care metrics were evaluated within and outside of the Aero Program through retrospective queries of electronic health records, administrative databases, and parent surveys at our institution. Mean anesthesia time in the Aero Program was 54 minutes (49-60; 95% confidence interval), which was significantly less (P < .0001) than the estimated 89 minutes of having the three procedures done separately. Average charges and average direct costs for triple endoscopy were 38.8% and 41.9% less than the sum of the averages for separate procedures, respectively. Parent satisfaction was high for the Aero Program care. As organizations move toward greater coordination of care for complex patients, multidisciplinary programs must demonstrate their value by delivering cost-effective care. Aerodigestive programs have the potential to provide satisfying care that is less costly to the organization, insurer, and family.

31933347,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Spain and the different aspects of its social impact: a multidisciplinary opinion document.,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most prevalent diseases in the World, and one of the most important causes of mortality and morbidity. In adults 40 years and older, it affects more than 10% of the population and has enormous personal, family and social burden. Tobacco smoking is its main cause, but not the only one, and there is probably a genetic predisposition that increases the risk in some patients. The paradigm of this disease is changing in Spain, with an increase of women that has occurred in recent years. Many of the physio pathological mechanisms of this condition are well known, but the psychological alterations to which it leads, the impact of COPD on relatives and caregivers, the limitation of daily life observed in these patients, and the economic and societal burden that they represent for the health system, are not so well-known. A major problem is the high under-diagnosis, mainly due to difficulties for obtaining, in a systematic way, spirometries in hospitals and health-care centers. For this reason, the Fundación de Ciencias de la Salud and the Spanish National Network Center for Research in Respiratory Diseases (CIBERES) have brought together experts in COPD, patients and their organizations, clinical psychologists, experts in health economics, nurses and journalists to obtain their opinion about COPD in Spain. They also discussed the scientific bibliometrics on COPD that is being carried out from the CIBERES and speculated on the future of this condition. The format of the meeting consisted in the discussion of a series of questions that were addressed by different speakers and discussed until a consensus conclusion was reached.",Revista espanola de quimioterapia : publicacion oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Quimioterapia,2020-Feb,"Bouza E, Alvar A, Almagro P, Alonso T, Ancochea J, Barbé F, Corbella J, Gracia D, Mascarós E, Melis J, Miravitlles M, Pastor M, Pérez P, Rudilla D, Torres A, Soriano JB, Vallano A, Vargas F, Palomo E",19,1703,pulmonology,2025-11-22

The aim of this study was to reflect on adolescents' motives and experiences in the process of establishing an advisory council for adolescents with a chronic respiratory disease. A qualitative evaluation study was undertaken to assess the process of starting an advisory youth council in a tertiary hospital in the Netherlands. Data collection consisted of observations of council meetings, in-depth interviews with youth council members, and moderated group discussions. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis to explore the experiences of the council members (n = 9, aged 12-18 years, all with a chronic respiratory disease). Two-hour council meetings took place in the hospital to provide solicited and unsolicited advice to improve research and care. Three themes were identified as motives for adolescents to engage in an advisory council: (1) experience of fun and becoming empowered by their illness; (2) the value of peer support and contact; and (3) being able to contribute to care and research. The council's output consisted of solicited advice on information leaflets for patients, study procedures, and dietary menu options for hospitalized children. The council struggled to have their unsolicited advice heard within the hospital. Council members experienced engagement as beneficial at the individual, group, and organizational levels. However, meaningful youth engagement requires connectedness with, and official support from, officials at all levels within an organization.",Pediatric pulmonology,2021-Jan,"Groot B, Dedding C, Slob E, Maitland H, Teunissen T, Rutjes N, Vijverberg S",7,1672,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Identifying frailty and pre-frailty in patients with chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs) is an emerging assessment in the field of pulmonary medicine and rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to find out the prevalence of frailty among chronic respiratory disease patients. A single centre cross-sectional survey study with a total population of 381 patients, adults aged 18-90 years presenting to the pulmonology OPD was included based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Primary data collected were demographics, medical history, including comorbidities, use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT), BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure), previous hospital admissions, medication history and frailty assessment were done using the Fried frailty index. Univariate analysis showed that sex, ECHO abnormality, patients using LTOT, BiPAP, home nebulizers and patients who did not attend the pulmonary rehabilitation programme had a significant association with frailty. Multivariate analysis showed that female sex, LTOT use and older age were significantly associated with frailty. Frailty is frequent in CRD patients regardless of age. The prevalence of frailty has an association with female sex, patients using LTOT, and home BiPAP.",Lung India : official organ of Indian Chest Society,2024-May,"Ramanathan RP, Muthusamy S, Kumar KJ, Krishnan A",4,1359,pulmonology,2025-11-22
33285207,Creating an Organizational Culture for the Chest Physician: Creating an Organizational Culture for the Chest Physician.,"Culture is a key driver of organizational performance and underpins strategy. As previously discussed, if the strategy is the plants and the garden plan for a garden, the culture is the soil. Without a healthy culture, nothing will grow, irrespective of how well planned the garden or how beautiful the individual flowers. Using the case of establishing the culture in an institute at the Cleveland Clinic, the article examines an approach to establishing and maintaining an organizational culture. Anchors for this process are a situational assessment of the current culture as a new leader steps in and mindfulness by the leader of how members of the institute should experience the organization. Critical success factors include open communication and establishing psychological safety as well as modeling integrity. Fundamentally, when cultures are grounded in the seven classical virtues-trust, compassion, courage, justice, wisdom, temperance, and hope-they are best positioned to unleash the discretionary effort of its members. When people expend discretionary effort, they do the right thing when nobody is watching and the performance drivers are internal motivation and alignment with mission rather than external drivers to seek reward (carrots) or to avoid punishment (sticks).",Chest,2021-Jul,"Stoller JK, Dweik R, Rea P",3,1290,pulmonology,2025-11-22
37772940,"Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Pediatric Pulmonary Workforce: An Official American Thoracic Society Workshop Report.","Despite growing recognition of the need for increased diversity among students, trainees, and faculty in health care, the medical workforce still lacks adequate representation from groups historically underrepresented in medicine (URiM). The subspecialty field of pediatric pulmonology is no exception. Although there have been efforts to address issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in our own field, gaps persist. To address these gaps, the members of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Advisory Group (DEI-AG) of the American Thoracic Society Pediatrics Assembly created and distributed a Needs Assessment Survey in the United States and Canada to better understand the racial and ethnic demographics of the pediatric pulmonary workforce and to learn more about successes, gaps, and opportunities to enhance how we recruit, train, and retain a diverse workforce. The DEI-AG leadership cochairs convened a workshop to review the findings of the DEI Needs Assessment Survey and to develop strategies to improve the recruitment and retention of URiM fellows and faculty. This Official ATS Workshop Report aims to identify barriers and opportunities for recruitment, training, and career development within the field of pediatric pulmonology. Additionally, we offer useful strategies and resources to improve the recruitment of URiM residents, the mentorship of trainees and junior faculty, and the career development of URiM faculty in academic centers.

38529683,Value of rapid on-site evaluation combined with interventional pulmonology techniques in the diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis.,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) combined with computed tomography-guided percutaneous needle biopsy (CT-PNB) or radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial lung biopsy (EBUS-TBLB) for pulmonary cryptococcosis (PC). Clinical data of 33 patients diagnosed with PC at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between February 2018 and June 2023 were retrospectively analysed. Patients were divided into the CT-PNB and EBUS-TBLB groups based on the intervention method, and the diagnostic positivity rate and incidence of complications were compared between the two groups. Compared with the final diagnosis, the positive diagnostic rates of ROSE, histopathology and serum CrAg of all patients were 81.8% (27/33), 72.7% (24/33) and 63.6% (21/33), respectively. The average turnaround times of the three methods were 0.1 (0.1-0.2) h, 96.0 (48.0-120.0) h and 7.8 (4.5-13.6) h, respectively (P < 0.001). The coincidence rate between histopathology and ROSE was 84.8% with a kappa value of 0.574. The positive diagnostic rate for PC was significantly higher in the CT-PNB group than in the EBUS-TBLB group (92.9% vs. 57.9%), and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Combined with the ROSE results, the positive diagnostic rate in the EBUS-TBLB group increased to 84.2% (16/19). ROSE has commendable accuracy and timeliness, and CT-PNB offers further advantages in this regard. ROSE enhances the diagnostic efficiency of EBUS-TBLB for PC and is safe and effective.",The clinical respiratory journal,2024-Mar,"Cao J, Zhou R, He Q, Zhang M, Feng C",5,1557,pulmonology,2025-11-22
31053356,Transition of patients with neuromuscular disease and chronic ventilator-dependent respiratory failure from pediatric to adult pulmonary care.,"Improvements in medical care have allowed many children with neuromuscular disease and chronic respiratory failure to survive into adulthood. There are currently no published guidelines to facilitate transition from pediatric to adult respiratory care in this population. The transition process in neuromuscular disease and chronic respiratory failure is uniquely challenging in that the patients are often declining in health and losing independence as they approach adulthood. Barriers to transition include lack of access to adult providers, incompatible health insurance, loss of resources within patients' medical structures, absence of transition preparation, and patient and family insecurity with a new healthcare system. The six core elements and optimal time frame of transition should be applied, with special consideration of the psychosocial aspects associated with neuromuscular disease. Successful transition revolves around information, open communication between young adults and their medical care team, and individualized planning to ensure optimal health and quality of life.",Paediatric respiratory reviews,2020-Feb,"Cheng PC, Panitch HB, Hansen-Flaschen J",3,1095,pulmonology,2025-11-22

While the use of bulk RNA sequencing has become a ubiquitous technology in systems biology, the technique necessarily averages out individual contributions to the overall transcriptional landscape of a tissue. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a robust, unbiased survey of the transcriptome comparable to bulk RNA sequencing while preserving information on cellular heterogeneity. In just a few years since this technology was developed, scRNA-seq has already been adopted widely in respiratory research and has contributed to impressive advancements such as the discoveries of the pulmonary ionocyte and of a profibrotic macrophage population in pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we discuss general technical considerations when considering the use of scRNA-seq and examine how leading investigators have applied the technology to gain novel insights into respiratory biology, from development to disease. In addition, we discuss the evolution of single-cell technologies with a focus on spatial and multi-omics approaches that promise to drive continued innovation in respiratory research.",European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society,2020-Jun,"Alexander MJ, Budinger GRS, Reyfman PA",3,1208,pulmonology,2025-11-22
32571369,Preventive use of respiratory support after scheduled extubation in critically ill medical patients-a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Respiratory support has been increasingly used after extubation for the prevention of re-intubation and improvement of prognosis in critically ill medical patients. However, the optimal respiratory support method is still under debate. This network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of various respiratory support methods used for preventive purposes after scheduled extubation in critically ill medical patients. A systematic database search was performed from inception to December 19, 2019, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a preventive use of different respiratory support methods, including conventional oxygen therapy (COT), noninvasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow oxygen therapy (HFOT), and combinational use of HFOT and NIV (HFOT+NIV), after planned extubation in adult critically ill medical patients. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessments were performed in duplicate. The primary outcomes included re-intubation rate and short-term mortality. Seventeen RCTs comprising 3341 participants with 4 comparisons were included. Compared with COT, NIV significantly reduced the re-intubation rate [risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.77; moderate quality of evidence] and short-term mortality (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.91; moderate quality of evidence). Compared to COT, HFOT had a beneficial effect on the re-intubation rate (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.86; moderate quality of evidence) but no effect on short-term mortality (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.12; low quality of evidence). No significant difference in the re-intubation rate or short-term mortality was found among NIV, HFOT, and HFOT+NIV. The treatment rankings based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) from best to worst for re-intubation rate were HFOT+NIV (95.1%), NIV (53.4%), HFOT (51.2%), and COT (0.3%), and the rankings for short-term mortality were NIV (91.0%), HFOT (54.3%), HFOT+NIV (43.7%), and COT (11.1%). Sensitivity analyses of trials with a high risk of extubation failure for the primary outcomes indicated that the SUCRA rankings were comparable to those of the primary analysis. After scheduled extubation, the preventive use of NIV is probably the most effective respiratory support method for comprehensively preventing re-intubation and short-term death in critically ill medical patients, especially those with a high risk of extubation failure.","Critical care (London, England)",2020-Jun,"Zhou X, Yao S, Dong P, Chen B, Xu Z, Wang H",6,2455,pulmonology,2025-11-22

38795074,Filling the gaps in the evaluation and selection of mobile health technologies in respiratory medicine.,"Mobile health (mHealth) technology in respiratory medicine is a fast-growing and promising digital technology that is popular among patients and healthcare providers (HCPs). They provide reminders and step-by-step instructions for the correct inhalation technique, monitor patients' adherence to treatment, and facilitate communication between patients and HCPs. While numerous mHealth apps have been developed over the years, most applications do not have supporting evidence. Selecting the best mHealth app in respiratory medicine is challenging due to limited studies carrying out mHealth app selection. Although mHealth technologies play an important part in the future of respiratory medicine, there is no single guide on the evaluation and selection of mHealth technologies for patients with pulmonary diseases. This paper aims to provide an overview of mHealth technologies, particularly emphasizing digital inhalers and standalone applications used in asthma. Additionally, it offers insights into the evaluation, selection, and pertinent considerations surrounding mHealth applications in respiratory medicine. Evaluating mHealth apps will take time, resources, and collaboration between stakeholders such as governmental regulatory bodies, subject-matter experts, and industry representatives.

32428512,Characteristics of Effective Teachers of Invasive Bedside Procedures: A Multi-institutional Qualitative Study.,"Faculty supervision of invasive bedside procedures (IBPs) in the ICU may enhance procedural education and ensure patient safety. However, there is limited research on teaching effectiveness in the ICU, and there are no best teaching practices regarding the supervision of IBPs. We conducted a multi-institutional qualitative study of pulmonary and critical care medicine faculty and fellows to better understand characteristics of effective IBP teachers. Separate focus groups (FGs) were conducted with fellows and faculty at four large academic institutions that were geographically distributed across the United States. FGs were facilitated by a trained investigator, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim for analysis. Themes were identified inductively and compared with constructs from social and situated learning theories. Data were analyzed between and across professional groups. Qualitative research software (NVivo; QSR International) was used to facilitate data organization and create an audit trail of the analysis. A multidisciplinary research team was engaged to minimize interpretive bias. Thirty-three faculty and 30 fellows participated. Inductive analysis revealed three categories of themes among successful IBP teachers: traits, behaviors, and context. Traits included calm demeanor, trust, procedural competence, and effective communication. Behaviors included leading preprocedure huddles to assess learners' experiences and define expectations; debriefing to provide feedback; and allowing appropriate autonomy. Context included learning climate, levels of distraction, patient acuity, and institutional culture. We identified specific traits and behaviors of effective IBP teachers that intersect with the practice environment, which highlights the challenge of teaching IBPs. Notably, FG participants emphasized interpersonal, more than technical, aspects of successful IBP teachers. These findings should inform future curricula on teaching IBPs in the ICU, standardize IBP teaching for pulmonary and critical care medicine fellows, and reduce patient injury from procedural complications.",Chest,2020-Nov,"Kelm DJ, Ridgeway JL, Ratelle JT, Sawatsky AP, Halvorsen AJ, Niven AS, Brady A, Hayes MM, McSparron JI, Ramar K, Beckman TJ",11,2120,pulmonology,2025-11-22

A major shift to telemedicine and mobile health technologies has now taken on an immediate urgency. Newly developed devices designed for home use have facilitated remote monitoring of various physiologic parameters relevant to pulmonary diseases. These devices have also enabled home-based pulmonary rehabilitation programs. In addition, telemedicine and home care services have been leveraged to rapidly develop acute care hospital-at-home programs for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 illness. The benefit of remote monitoring technologies on patient outcomes has not been established in robust trials. Furthermore, the use of these devices, which can increase the burden of care, has not been integrated into current clinical workflows and electronic medical records. Finally, reimbursement for these telemedicine and remote monitoring services is variable. Literature review. Advances in digital technology have improved remote monitoring of physiologic parameters relevant to pulmonary medicine. In addition, telemedicine services for the provision of pulmonary rehabilitation and novel hospital-at-home programs have been developed. These new home-based programs have been adapted for COVID-19 and may also be relevant for the management of acute and chronic pulmonary diseases after the pandemic.

Simulation based training should be considered a part of IP training as seen in other procedural and surgical subspecialties. Procedure volume is a component of training; however, this does not guarantee or translate into competency for learners. Basic competency skills can be assessed using standardized well validated assessment tools designed for various IP procedures including flexible bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS TBNA), rigid bronchoscopy and chest tube placement; however, further work is needed to validate tools in all procedures as new technologies are introduced beyond fellowship training. Currently there are at least 39 IP fellowship programs in the United States (US) and Canada which has led to improved training by accreditation of programs who meet rigorous requirements of standardized curriculum and procedural volume. The challenge is to be innovative in how we teach globally with intention and how to best integrate new evolving technology training for those not only during fellowship training but also beyond fellowship training.",Journal of thoracic disease,2020-Jun,"Aslam W, Lee HJ, Lamb CR",3,1319,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Appropriate training in LUS is essential for the correct and safe use of this technique. To document the current state of LUS education and use among Spanish rheumatologists and pneumologists. A national online survey was designed for members of the Spanish Society of Rheumatology and the ILD Area of the Spanish Society of Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery. The survey consisted of 22 questions on demographics, professional activity, performance and training in LUS. One hundred and thirty-five (56.72% rheumatologists, 41.79% pneumologists) responded to the survey. Of these, 56.30% were part of an ILD Unit in their centre. LUS in clinical practice was performed by 35.82% but only 14.93% performed it in ILD, mainly for diagnostic purposes. Training in LUS of responders had been diverse in format, content and sponsors. The vast majority (87.79%) considered that the optimal model of education in LUS should be standardized and structured and consist of a combination of theoretical-practical courses and the conduct of a minimum number of supervised LUS examinations, with competency assessment.

32956717,A National Survey of Burnout and Depression Among Fellows Training in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine: A Special Report by the Association of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Program Directors.,"The prevalence of burnout and depressive symptoms is high among physician trainees. What is the burden of burnout and depressive symptoms among fellows training in pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM) and what are associated individual fellow, program, and institutional characteristics? We conducted a cross-sectional electronic survey of fellows enrolled in pulmonary, PCCM, and critical care medicine training programs in the United States to assess burnout and depressive symptoms. Burnout symptoms were measured using the Maslach Burnout Index two-item measure. The two-item Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders Procedure was used to screen for depressive symptoms. For each of the two outcomes (burnout and depressive symptoms), we constructed three multivariate logistic regression models to assess individual fellow characteristics, program structure, and institutional polices associated with either burnout or depressive symptoms. Five hundred two of the 976 fellows who received the survey completed it-including both outcome measures-giving a response rate of 51%. Fifty percent of fellows showed positive results for either burnout or depressive symptoms, with 41% showing positive results for depressive symptoms, 32% showing positive results for burnout, and 23% showing positive results for both. Reporting a coverage system in the case of personal illness or emergency (adjusted OR [aOR], 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26-0.73) and access to mental health services (aOR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.47) were associated with lower odds of burnout. Financial concern was associated with higher odds of depressive symptoms (aOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.05-1.22). Working more than 70 hours in an average clinical week and the burdens of electronic health record (EHR) documentation were associated with a higher odds of both burnout and depressive symptoms. Given the high prevalence of burnout and depressive symptoms among fellows training in PCCM, an urgent need exists to identify solutions that address this public health crisis. Strategies such as providing an easily accessible coverage system, access to mental health resources, reducing EHR burden, addressing work hours, and addressing financial concerns among trainees may help to reduce burnout or depressive symptoms and should be studied further by the graduate medical education community.",Chest,2021-Feb,"Sharp M, Burkart KM, Adelman MH, Ashton RW, Daugherty Biddison L, Bosslet GT, Doyle ST, Eckmann T, Khurram S Khan MM, Lenz PH, McCallister JW, O'Toole J, Rand CS, Riekert KA, Soffler MI, Winter GR, Zaeh S, Eakin MN",18,2353,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Self-paced online modules can be an alternative but equally effective teaching tool. Multiple studies demonstrate the benefits of e-learning in medical education. Four interactive, case-based, e-learning modules on asthma, chronic cough, tracheostomy, and obstructive sleep apnea were created and piloted to pediatric residents and medical students in the pediatric pulmonology elective at the University of California, San Francisco and Oakland campus. Modules incorporated videos with experts, images, and multiple-choice questions to enhance learning. The modules were distributed via email on their first day of the rotation and were completed virtually by the trainees during their rotation. Progress was evaluated from December 2021 to July 2022 using pre- and postcourse questions assessing knowledge acquisition and decision-making skills. A total of 22 participants took part in the elective and completed the modules to varying degrees. This group included six fourth-year medical students and three first-year, five second-year, and eight third-year pediatric residents. Data showed an improvement in posttest scores across all four modules, ranging from 9% to 21%, with a large improvement in the obstructive sleep apnea module and a small improvement in the chronic cough module.

A prepost intervention study was conducted after a new ambulatory pulmonary care protocol was implemented and the capacity of the unit was adopted. In the new model, physicians at all levels of healthcare send electronic consultations to specialists. In the preintervention year (2019), the Unit of Pulmonology attended 7,055 consultations (466 e-consultations and 6,589 first face-to-face visits), which decreased to 6,157 (3,934 e-consultations and 2,223 first face-to-face visits; 12.7% reduction) in the postintervention year (all were e-consultations).

Clinical interpretation of pulmonary function and exercise tests, however, has been complicated more recently by temporal changes in demographic characteristics (higher life expectancy), anthropometric attributes (increased obesity prevalence), and the surge of polypharmacy in a sedentary population with multiple chronic degenerative diseases. In this narrative review, we concisely discuss some key challenges to test interpretation that have been affected by these epidemiologic shifts: (a) the confounding effects of advanced age and severe obesity, (b) the contemporary controversies in the diagnosis of obstruction (including asthma and/or COPD), (c) the importance of considering the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (Dlco)/""accessible"" alveolar volume (carbon monoxide transfer coefficient) in association with Dlco to uncover the causes of impaired gas exchange, and (d) the modern role of the pulmonary function laboratory (including cardiopulmonary exercise testing) in the investigation of undetermined dyspnea. Following a Bayesian perspective, we suggest interpretative algorithms that consider the pretest probability of abnormalities as indicated by additional clinical information. We, therefore, adopt a pragmatic approach to help the practicing pulmonologist to apply the information provided by the lung function laboratory to the care of individual patients.",Chest,2020-Oct,"Neder JA, Berton DC, O'Donnell DE",3,1500,pulmonology,2025-11-22

However, a similar standardization system is lacking in PVD subspecialty provider training. Non-Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education PVD advanced fellowships exist nationally, but do not provide a unified approach to trainee education. Therefore, first, a survey of all Pulmonary Hypertension Association-accredited center directors across the United States was performed to gauge interest in a standardized educational initiative in the field of PVD. Second, the National Consortium on Pulmonary Vascular Disease Fellowship Training was founded to establish a common curriculum and set of training requirements across PVD programs in the United States. A particular emphasis was placed on the training requirements for provider competency in PH because (1) reliable access to patients with PH could be supported by all consortium institutions and (2) the consortium members believed that national PH training curricula lacked standardization and detail.

32839494,Exhaled breath compositions under varying respiratory rhythms reflects ventilatory variations: translating breathomics towards respiratory medicine.,"Control of breathing is automatic and its regulation is keen to autonomic functions. Therefore, involuntary and voluntary nervous regulation of breathing affects ventilatory variations, which has profound potential to address expanding challenges in contemporary pulmonology. Nonetheless, the fundamental attributes of the aforementioned phenomena are rarely understood and/or investigated. Implementation of unconventional approach like breathomics may leads to a better comprehension of those complexities in respiratory medicine. We applied breath-resolved spirometry and capnometry, non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring along with continuous trace analysis of exhaled VOCs (volatile organic compounds) by means of real-time mass-spectrometry in 25 young and healthy adult humans to investigate any possible mirroring of instant ventilatory variations by exhaled breath composition, under varying respiratory rhythms. Hemodynamics remained unaffected. Immediate changes in measured breath compositions and corresponding variations occurred when respiratory rhythms were switched between spontaneous (involuntary/unsynchronised) and/or paced (voluntary/synchronised) breathing. Such changes in most abundant, endogenous and bloodborne VOCs were closely related to the minute ventilation and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> exhalation. Unprecedentedly, while preceded by a paced rhythm, spontaneous rhythms in both independent setups became reproducible with significantly (P-value ≤ 0.005) low intra- and inter-individual variation in measured parameters. We modelled breath-resolved ventilatory variations via alveolar isoprene exhalation, which were independently validated with unequivocal precision. Reproducibility i.e. attained via our method would be reliable for human breath sampling, concerning biomarker research. Thus, we may realize the actual metabolic and pathophysiological expressions beyond the everlasting in vivo physiological noise. Consequently, less pronounced changes are often misinterpreted as disease biomarker in cross-sectional studies. We have also provided novel information beyond conventional spirometry and capnometry. Upon clinical translations, our findings will have immense impact on pulmonology and breathomics as they have revealed a reproducible pattern of ventilatory variations and respiratory homeostasis in endogenous VOC exhalations.",Scientific reports,2020-Aug,"Sukul P, Schubert JK, Zanaty K, Trefz P, Sinha A, Kamysek S, Miekisch W",7,2373,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Interventional bronchoscopy refers to procedures performed for therapeutic purposes such as balloon dilation of the airway, tissue debulking, cryotherapy, removal of foreign bodies and insertion of endobronchial valves [1]. For adult patients, these procedures are standard of care [2, 3]. Despite a lack of formalized training, there are numerous case reports and case series describing the use of advanced diagnostic and interventional bronchoscopy techniques in children. The safety and feasibility of EBUS-TBNA, cryotherapy techniques, endobronchial valves among other techniques have been demonstrated in these publications [1, 4-9]. We sought to better understand the current practices and perspectives on interventional and advanced bronchoscopy among pediatric pulmonologists through surveys sent to pediatric teaching hospitals across the United States. We received 43 responses representing 28 programs from 25 states. The highest bronchoscopy procedure volume occurred in the 0-5 years age group. Among our respondents, 31% self-identified as a pediatric interventional/advanced bronchoscopist. 79% believe that advanced and interventional training is feasible in pediatric pulmonology and 77% believe it should be offered to pediatric pulmonary fellows.

The Trustworthy Consensus-Based Statement approach was utilized to develop unbiased, scientifically valid guidance for the management of patients with malignant effusions treated with indwelling pleural catheters. A comprehensive electronic database search of PubMed was performed based on a priori crafted PICO questions (Population/Intervention/Comparator/Outcomes paradigm). Manual searches of the literature were performed to identify additional relevant literature. Dual screenings at the title, abstract, and full-text levels were performed. Identified studies were then assessed for quality based on a combination of validated tools. Appropriateness for data pooling and formation of evidence-based recommendations was assessed using predetermined criteria. All panel members participated in development of the final recommendations utilizing the modified Delphi technique. A total of 7 studies were identified for formal quality assessment, all of which were deemed to have a high risk of bias. There was insufficient evidence to allow for data pooling and formation of any evidence-based recommendations. Panel consensus resulted in 11 ungraded consensus-based recommendations. This manuscript was developed to provide clinicians with guidance on the management of patients with indwelling pleural catheters placed for palliation of malignant pleural effusions. Through a systematic and rigorous process, management suggestions were developed based on the best available evidence with augmentation by expert opinion when necessary.

33567064,Pulmonology approach in the investigation of chronic unexplained dyspnea.,"Chronic unexplained dyspnea and exercise intolerance represent common, distressing symptoms in outpatients. Clinical history taking and physical examination are the mainstays for diagnostic evaluation. However, the cause of dyspnea may remain elusive even after comprehensive diagnostic evaluation-basic laboratory analyses; chest imaging; pulmonary function testing; and cardiac testing. At that point (and frequently before), patients are usually referred to a pulmonologist, who is expected to be the main physician to solve this conundrum. In this context, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), to assess physiological and sensory responses from rest to peak exercise, provides a unique opportunity to unmask the mechanisms of the underlying dyspnea and their interactions with a broad spectrum of disorders. However, CPET is underused in clinical practice, possibly due to operational issues (equipment costs, limited availability, and poor remuneration) and limited medical education regarding the method. To counter the latter shortcoming, we aspire to provide a pragmatic strategy for interpreting CPET results. Clustering findings of exercise response allows the characterization of patterns that permit the clinician to narrow the list of possible diagnoses rather than pinpointing a specific etiology. We present a proposal for a diagnostic workup and some illustrative cases assessed by CPET. Given that airway hyperresponsiveness and pulmonary vascular disorders, which are within the purview of pulmonology, are common causes of chronic unexplained dyspnea, we also aim to describe the role of bronchial challenge tests and the diagnostic reasoning for investigating the pulmonary circulation in this context.",Jornal brasileiro de pneumologia : publicacao oficial da Sociedade Brasileira de Pneumologia e Tisilogia,2021-,"Berton DC, Mendes NBS, Olivo-Neto P, Benedetto IG, Gazzana MB",5,1726,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Offering the potential to predict outcomes and personalise therapy, there is much to be excited by in this new epoch of innovation. However, these digital tools are by no means a silver bullet. It remains uncertain whether, let alone when, the promises of better models of personalisation and prediction will translate into clinically meaningful and cost-effective products for clinicians.",European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society,2024-Jul,"Ottewill C, Gleeson M, Kerr P, Hale EM, Costello RW",5,1497,pulmonology,2025-11-22
34347574,"Enhancing Recruitment and Retention of Minority Populations for Clinical Research in Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine: An Official American Thoracic Society Research Statement.","<b>Background:</b> Well-designed clinical research needs to obtain information that is applicable to the general population. However, most current studies fail to include substantial cohorts of racial/ethnic minority populations. Such underrepresentation may lead to delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis of disease, wide application of approved interventions without appropriate knowledge of their usefulness in certain populations, and development of recommendations that are not broadly applicable.<b>Goals:</b> To develop best practices for recruitment and retention of racial/ethnic minorities for clinical research in pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine.<b>Methods:</b> The American Thoracic Society convened a workshop in May of 2019. This included an international interprofessional group from academia, industry, the NIH, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with expertise ranging from clinical and biomedical research to community-based participatory research methods and patient advocacy. Workshop participants addressed historical and current mistrust of scientific research, systemic bias, and social and structural barriers to minority participation in clinical research. A literature search of PubMed and Google Scholar was performed to support conclusions. The search was not a systematic review of the literature.<b>Results:</b> Barriers at the individual, interpersonal, institutional, and federal/policy levels were identified as limiting to minority participation in clinical research. Through the use of a multilevel framework, workshop participants proposed evidence-based solutions to the identified barriers.<b>Conclusions:</b> To date, minority participation in clinical research is not representative of the U.S. and global populations.

35501278,Diagnostic and therapeutic approach of central sleep apnea in heart failure - the role of adaptive servo-ventilation. A statement of the Portuguese society of pulmonology and the Portuguese sleep association.,"It is known that patients with heart failure (HF) have an increased risk of developing central sleep apnoea (CSA), with Cheyne-Stokes respiration. The development of servo-ventilation aimed to treat CSA and improve the quality of life (QoL) of these patients. A large randomized clinical study, SERVE-HF, was conducted in order to test this theory in patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The results from this trial seemed to indicate that, in these patients, there was no beneficial effect of the assisted ventilation in CSA treatment. More surprisingly, an increased rate of all-cause or cardiovascular mortality was observed. This has led to dramatic changes in clinical practice, with decreased frequency of servo-ventilation prescription across Europe, including Portugal, due to changes in the guidelines. However, SERVE-HF was conducted only in severe systolic HF patients with CSA, and caution must be taken when extrapolating these results to HF patients with preserved ejection fraction or CSA patients without HF. The study also showed poor adherence, methodological and statistical gaps, including study design, patient selection, data collection and analysis, treatment adherence, and group crossovers, which have not been discussed in the trial as potential confounding factors and raise several concerns. Moreover, the adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) device used in SERVE-HF was unable to lower the minimum support pressure below 3 mm H<sub>2</sub>0, and this has been suggested as one of the probable contributing reasons to the excess mortality observed in this study. This limitation has since been solved, and this ASV device is no longer used. This paper describes the results of a Portuguese Task Force on the treatment of central sleep apnoea in patients with chronic HF.",Pulmonology,2023-,"Correia S, Sousa S, Drummond M, Pinto P, Staats R, Brito D, Lousada N, Cardoso JS, Moita J",9,1813,pulmonology,2025-11-22
33876525,Impact of structured curriculum with simulation on bronchoscopy.,"Simulation enhances a physician's competency in procedural skills by accelerating ascent of the learning curve. Training programmes are moving away from the Halstedian model of 'see one, do one, teach one', also referred as medical apprenticeship. We aimed to determine if a 3-month structured bronchoscopy curriculum that incorporated simulator training could improve bronchoscopy competency among pulmonary medicine trainees. We prospectively recruited trainees from hospitals with accredited pulmonary medicine programmes. Trainees from hospitals (A, B and C) were assigned to control group (CG) where they received training by traditional apprenticeship while trainees from hospital D were assigned to intervention group (IG) where they underwent 3-month structured curriculum that incorporated training with the bronchoscopy simulator. Two patient bronchoscopy procedures per trainee were recorded on video and scored independently by two expert bronchoscopists using the modified Bronchoscopy Skills and Tasks Assessment Tool (BSTAT) forms. A 25 multiple choice questions (MCQ) test was administered to all participants at the end of 3 months. Eighteen trainees participated; 10 in CG and eight in IG with equal female:male ratio. Competency assessed by modified BSTAT and MCQ tests was variable and not driven by volume as IG performed fewer patient bronchoscopies but demonstrated better BSTAT, airway anaesthesia and MCQ scores. Bronchoscopy simulator training was the only factor that correlated with better BSTAT (r = 0.80), MCQ (r = 0.85) and airway anaesthesia scores (r = 0.83), and accelerated the learning curve of IG trainees. An intensive 3-month structured bronchoscopy curriculum that incorporated simulator training led to improved cognitive and technical skill performance as compared with apprenticeship training.","Respirology (Carlton, Vic.)",2021-Jun,"Siow WT, Tan GL, Loo CM, Khoo KL, Kee A, Tee A, Bin Mohamed Noor I, Tay N, Lee P",9,1836,pulmonology,2025-11-22
38546009,Virtual interviews and equity: The pediatric pulmonary fellow perspective.,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic shifted medical training programs to utilize virtual interviews (VIs) starting with the 2020 interview cycle. Fellowship interviews continue in the virtual format. It is unknown how this shift has affected equity for applicants as compared to in-person interviews. Equity in this study includes consideration of the opportunity for an applicant to accept, access, and conduct a VI. This study assessed pediatric pulmonary fellows' perception of equity associated with VIs and preferences for future cycles. An anonymous survey link was emailed to Pediatric Pulmonology Program Directors to disseminate to incoming and first-year pediatric pulmonary fellows who participated in the 2022-2023 and 2021-2022 VI seasons. Responses were summarized by frequency and percentages. Inductive coding was used to thematically analyze free-text responses. Nearly 30% of eligible incoming and first-year pulmonary fellows (n = 35/119, 29.4%) completed the survey. Seventy-four percent felt that VIs reduce inequities as compared to in-person interviews. Sixty percent felt that VIs were the most equitable format, and 51% chose a VI as their preferred future format. Important practice considerations to promote equity for future VIs included providing applicants with instruction for the expected dress code, followed by providing applicants with virtual technology (91% and 89% of respondents ranked as at least ""somewhat important,"" respectively). VIs were perceived as a more equitable interview format by pediatric pulmonology fellows compared to in-person interviews in our study. To increase equity for VIs, program directors can consider additional adaptations such as providing standardized instruction for dress code and providing the required technology.",Pediatric pulmonology,2024-Jun,"Richard K, Chiel L, Kazmerski TM, Atteih S, Nelson B, Cohen R, Laguna TA, D'Anna R, Dahlberg S, Zecena M, Casey A",11,1776,pulmonology,2025-11-22
34873098,Current state and future potential of AI in occupational respiratory medicine.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the pace of technological development relating to pulmonary diseases. The advent of newer technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), continues to be adapted for diagnostic purposes. AI offers comparable precision to trained physicians under certain circumstances, as well as the unique ability to process the information characteristic of Big Data. With respect to individual susceptibilities/pre-existing diseases, AI seems poised to integrate such individualized information and contribute to a greater implementation of precision medicine. AI can match trained clinicians in specific applications, but AI has limitations that require clearly defined questions and a high quality of data. Data collected for this purpose is predicted to increase both in quality and volume, as technology concerned with personal health (FitBit, Apple Watch) proliferates. However, the role of AI with respect to physicians in a clinical setting is still being debated. AI generally aims to increase objectivity through its correlational methodology. AI continues to be a proliferative field of study.

35232441,Establishing CREATE: lessons learned in setting up a training environment for early-career researchers in respiratory medicine.,"The purpose of the National Health and Medical Research Council Centre of Research Excellence in Pulmonary Fibrosis (CRE-PF) is to improve and extend the lives of patients living with pulmonary fibrosis through the development of a comprehensive and integrated program of basic and clinical research and education across Australia. A key objective of the CRE-PF was establishment of a unique national training scheme, CREATE, for early-career researchers (ECRs) in respiratory research. CREATE ECRs are broadly drawn from two main fields of researchers: clinicians and scientists, where clinicians tend to be involved in part-time translational research and scientists are involved in broad scientific research including laboratory or genetic research, health economics or population research. We describe the CREATE Program which, with limited budget and the assistance of key organisations, has provided funding opportunities (scholarships, fellowships, prizes, travel and collaboration grants), professional development (mentoring program, symposia, presentation opportunities and on-line training) and fostered a connected, supportive research community for respiratory ECRs. The CREATE program has successfully fostered the development of the supported researchers, contributing substantially to the future of pulmonary fibrosis research in Australia. During the life of the program the CRE-PF has offered 10 PhD scholarships and five postdoctoral fellowships, awarded 13 travel grants and three grants to promote collaboration between ECRs from different institutes. A mentoring program has been established and CREATE Symposia have been held in association with key meetings. During COVID-19 restrictions, a series of virtual research meetings has offered 12 CREATE ECRs from seven universities the opportunity to present their research to a national audience. CREATE research-related achievements are impressive, including over 80 first-author publications by ECRs, and many conference presentations. Contributions to the research community, measured by committee membership, is also strong. In spite of a very limited budget, wide geographic distribution of participants and the multi-disciplinary nature of the cohort, we have succeeded in providing a unique, supportive academic development environment for CREATE ECRs. Lessons learned in the process of developing this program include the importance of leveraging funding, being flexible, building networks and seeking and responding to ECR input.",BMC medical education,2022-Mar,"Christian K, Hey-Cunningham A, Corte T, Goh N, Jaffar J, Reynolds P, Teoh A, Troy L",8,2509,pulmonology,2025-11-22
33345951,Identifying and Characterizing a Chronic Cough Cohort Through Electronic Health Records.,"Chronic cough (CC) of 8 weeks or more affects about 10% of adults and may lead to expensive treatments and reduced quality of life. Incomplete diagnostic coding complicates identifying CC in electronic health records (EHRs). Natural language processing (NLP) of EHR text could improve detection. Can NLP be used to identify cough in EHRs, and to characterize adults and encounters with CC? A Midwestern EHR system identified patients aged 18 to 85 years during 2005 to 2015. NLP was used to evaluate text notes, except prescriptions and instructions, for mentions of cough. Two physicians and a biostatistician reviewed 12 sets of 50 encounters each, with iterative refinements, until the positive predictive value for cough encounters exceeded 90%. NLP, International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, or medication was used to identify cough. Three encounters spanning 56 to 120 days defined CC. Descriptive statistics summarized patients and encounters, including referrals. Optimizing NLP required identifying and eliminating cough denials, instructions, and historical references. Of 235,457 cough encounters, 23% had a relevant diagnostic code or medication. Applying chronicity to cough encounters identified 23,371 patients (61% women) with CC. NLP alone identified 74% of these patients; diagnoses or medications alone identified 15%. The positive predictive value of NLP in the reviewed sample was 97%. Referrals for cough occurred for 3.0% of patients; pulmonary medicine was most common initially (64% of referrals). Some patients with diagnosis codes for cough, encounters at intervals greater than 4 months, or multiple acute cough episodes may have been misclassified. NLP successfully identified a large cohort with CC. Most patients were identified through NLP alone, rather than diagnoses or medications. NLP improved detection of patients nearly sevenfold, addressing the gap in ability to identify and characterize CC disease burden. Nearly all cases appeared to be managed in primary care. Identifying these patients is important for characterizing treatment and unmet needs.",Chest,2021-Jun,"Weiner M, Dexter PR, Heithoff K, Roberts AR, Liu Z, Griffith A, Hui S, Schelfhout J, Dicpinigaitis P, Doshi I, Weaver JP",11,2105,pulmonology,2025-11-22
37121990,Tracheostomy decannulation in children: a proposal for a structured approach on behalf of the working group chronic respiratory insufficiency within the German-speaking society of pediatric pulmonology.,"The number of children with tracheostomies with and without home mechanical ventilation has grown continuously in recent years. For some of these children, the need for tracheostomy resolves and the child can be weaned from the tracheal cannula. Choosing the optimal time point for decannulation after elaborated prior diagnostic work-up needs careful consideration. The decannulation process requires an interdisciplinary team; however, these specialized structures for the experienced care of these children with tracheostomy are not available in all areas. The Working Group on Chronic Respiratory Insufficiency in the German Speaking Pediatric Pneumology Society (GPP) developed these recommendations to guide through a decannulation process. Initial evaluation of decannulation feasibility starts in the outpatient clinic with a detailed history, examination, and a speaking valve trial and is followed by an inpatient workup including sleep study, airway endoscopy and possibly modifications of the tracheal cannula. Downsizing the tracheal cannula allows a stepwise controlled weaning prior to removal of the tracheal cannula. After shrinking of the tracheostomy, the final surgical closure is performed.  Conclusion: An algorithm with diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for a safe and successful decannulation process is proposed. What is Known: • In children tracheostomy decannulation is a complex process that requires careful preparation and surveillance. What is New: • This statement of the German speaking society of pediatric pulmonology provides an expert practice guidance on the decannulation procedure and the value of one-way speaking valves.",European journal of pediatrics,2023-Jul,"Böschen E, Wendt A, Müller-Stöver S, Piechnik L, Fuchs H, Lund M, Steindor M, Große-Onnebrink J, Keßler C, Grychtol R, Rothoeft T, Bieli C, van Egmond-Fröhlich A, Stehling F",14,1666,pulmonology,2025-11-22
37312103,Virtual versus paper-based PBL in a pulmonology course for medical undergraduates.,"Problem-based learning (PBL) remains a valid and effective tool for small-group medical education. Using Virtual patients (VP) case simulation in PBL is a recognizable educational method that has successfully prepared students to focus learning on core information that uses realistic patient-based cases relating to everyday clinical scenarios. Using other modalities as the virtual patient in PBL instead of the paper-based methods remains debatable. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using VP case simulation mannequin in PBL versus the PBL in paper-based cases in improving the cognitive skills by comparing the grades of a multiple-choice question test and assess its ability to reach students' satisfaction using questionnaire with Likert survey instrument. The study was conducted on 459 fourth-year medical students studying in the pulmonology module of the internal medicine course, Faculty of Medicine, October 6 University. All students were divided into 16 PBL classes and randomly divided into groups A and B by simple manual randomization. The groups were parallel with a controlled cross-over study between paper-based and virtual patient PBL. The pre-test showed no significant difference between both, while post-test scores were significantly higher in both VP PBL cases 1 discussing COPD (6.25 ± 0.875) and case 2 discussing pneumonia (6.56 ± 1.396) compared to paper-based PBL (5.29 ± 1.166, 5.57 ± SD1.388, respectively) at p < 0.1 When students in Group A experienced PBL using VP in case 2 after paper-based PBL in case 1, their post-test score improved significantly. (from 5.26 to 6.56, p < .01). Meanwhile, there was a significant regression in the post-test score of the students in Group B when they experienced the paper-based PBL session in case 2 after using PBL using VP in case 1, (from 6.26 to 5.57, p < .01). Most of the students recommended using VP in PBL as they found VP was more engaging and inducing concentration in gathering the information needed to characterize the patient's problem than in a classroom- paper-based cases session. They also enjoyed the teaching of the instructor and found it a suitable learning style for them. Implementing virtual patients in PBL increased knowledge acquisition and understanding in medical students and was more motivating for students than paper based PBL to gather the needed information.",BMC medical education,2023-Jun,"Elnaga HHA, Ahmed MB, Fathi MS, Eissa S",4,2389,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Informative clinical trials and consensus on management are lacking. The European GLILD network (e-GLILDnet) aims to describe how GLILD is currently managed in clinical practice and to determine the main uncertainties and unmet needs regarding diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. The e-GLILDnet collaborators developed and conducted an online survey facilitated by the European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) between February-April 2020. Results were analyzed using SPSS. One hundred and sixty-one responses from adult and pediatric pulmonologists and immunologists from 47 countries were analyzed. Respondents treated a median of 27 (interquartile range, IQR 82-maximum 500) CVID patients, of which a median of 5 (IQR 8-max 200) had GLILD. Most respondents experienced difficulties in establishing the diagnosis of GLILD and only 31 (19%) had access to a standardized protocol. There was little uniformity in diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. Fewer than 40% of respondents saw a definite need for biopsy in all cases or performed bronchoalveolar lavage for diagnostics. Sixty-six percent used glucocorticosteroids for remission-induction and 47% for maintenance therapy; azathioprine, rituximab and mycophenolate mofetil were the most frequently prescribed steroid-sparing agents. Pulmonary function tests were the preferred modality for monitoring patients during follow-up. These data demonstrate an urgent need for clinical studies to provide more evidence for an international consensus regarding management of GLILD.

33974550,Social Media and Research Publication Activity During Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Trend Analysis.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of rapid dissemination of scientific and medical discoveries. Current platforms available for the distribution of scientific and clinical research data and information include preprint repositories and traditional peer-reviewed journals. In recent times, social media has emerged as a helpful platform to share scientific and medical discoveries. This study aimed to comparatively analyze activity on social media (specifically, Twitter) and that related to publications in the form of preprint and peer-reviewed journal articles in the context of COVID-19 and gastroenterology during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19-related data from Twitter (tweets and user data) and articles published in preprint servers (bioRxiv and medRxiv) as well as in the PubMed database were collected and analyzed during the first 6 months of the pandemic, from December 2019 through May 2020. Global and regional geographic and gastrointestinal organ-specific social media trends were compared to preprint and publication activity. Any relationship between Twitter activity and preprint articles published and that between Twitter activity and PubMed articles published overall, by organ system, and by geographic location were identified using Spearman's rank-order correlation. Over the 6-month period, 73,079 tweets from 44,609 users, 7164 journal publications, and 4702 preprint publications were retrieved. Twitter activity (ie, number of tweets) peaked in March 2020, whereas preprint and publication activity (ie, number of articles published) peaked in April 2020. Overall, strong correlations were identified between trends in Twitter activity and preprint and publication activity (P<.001 for both). COVID-19 data across the three platforms mainly concentrated on pulmonology or critical care, but when analyzing the field of gastroenterology specifically, most tweets pertained to pancreatology, most publications focused on hepatology, and most preprints covered hepatology and luminal gastroenterology. Furthermore, there were significant positive associations between trends in Twitter and publication activity for all gastroenterology topics (luminal gastroenterology: P=.009; hepatology and inflammatory bowel disease: P=.006; gastrointestinal endoscopy: P=.007), except pancreatology (P=.20), suggesting that Twitter activity did not correlate with publication activity for this topic. Finally, Twitter activity was the highest in the United States (7331 tweets), whereas PubMed activity was the highest in China (1768 publications). The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the potential of social media as a vehicle for disseminating scientific information during a public health crisis. Sharing and spreading information on COVID-19 in a timely manner during the pandemic has been paramount; this was achieved at a much faster pace on social media, particularly on Twitter. Future investigation could demonstrate how social media can be used to augment and promote scholarly activity, especially as the world begins to increasingly rely on digital or virtual platforms.

34451079,Recent Insights into the Measurement of Carbon Dioxide Concentrations for Clinical Practice in Respiratory Medicine.,"In the field of respiratory clinical practice, the importance of measuring carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations cannot be overemphasized. Within the body, assessment of the arterial partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) has been the gold standard for many decades. Non-invasive assessments are usually predicated on the measurement of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in the air, usually using an infrared analyzer, and these data are clearly important regarding climate changes as well as regulations of air quality in buildings to ascertain adequate ventilation. Measurements of CO<sub>2</sub> production with oxygen consumption yield important indices such as the respiratory quotient and estimates of energy expenditure, which may be used for further investigation in the various fields of metabolism, obesity, sleep disorders, and lifestyle-related issues. Measures of PaCO<sub>2</sub> are nowadays performed using the Severinghaus electrode in arterial blood or in arterialized capillary blood, while the same electrode system has been modified to enable relatively accurate non-invasive monitoring of the transcutaneous partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (PtcCO<sub>2</sub>). PtcCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring during sleep can be helpful for evaluating sleep apnea syndrome, particularly in children. End-tidal PCO<sub>2</sub> is inferior to PtcCO<sub>2</sub> as far as accuracy, but it provides breath-by-breath estimates of respiratory gas exchange, while PtcCO<sub>2</sub> reflects temporal trends in alveolar ventilation. The frequency of monitoring end-tidal PCO<sub>2</sub> has markedly increased in light of its multiple applications (e.g., verify endotracheal intubation, anesthesia or mechanical ventilation, exercise testing, respiratory patterning during sleep, etc.).","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2021-Aug,"Umeda A, Ishizaka M, Ikeda A, Miyagawa K, Mochida A, Takeda H, Takeda K, Fukushi I, Okada Y, Gozal D",10,1804,pulmonology,2025-11-22

36369920,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and lung cancer: targeting the complexity of the pharmacological interconnection.,"Many data already suggested that cancer and IPF are underlined by a number of common pathogenic biologic pathways. However, fewer data regards the interconnections, in terms of synergy or increased toxicities, of drugs used in cancer and IPF. Particularly, how the specific therapy influences the concurrent condition and prognostic factors of response in patients with both lung cancer and IPF are far to be clarified. Similarly, identification of features of IPF patients with higher risk of developing pulmonary adverse events when treated with chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, TKIs, or radiotherapy is of primary importance in clinical practice. We will discuss the scientific rationale, based on the extensive analysis of literature data, by consulting several databases for combining anticancer and antifibrotic treatments and for the design of novel therapeutic strategies.

The contents are based upon the results of research into these diseases by the Diffuse Pulmonary Diseases Study Group (principal researcher: Sakae Homma) supported by the FY2014-FY2016 Health and Labor Sciences Research Grant on Intractable Diseases. This manual focuses on: 1) pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis, 2) bronchiolitis obliterans, and 3) Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome with interstitial pneumonia. As these are rare/intractable diffuse lung diseases (2 and 3 were first recognized as specified intractable diseases in 2015), there have not been sufficient epidemiological studies made, and there has been little progress in formulating diagnostic criteria and severity scales; however, the results of Japan's first surveys and research into such details are presented herein.

Consensus suggestions can standardise care, thereby improving outcomes and facilitating future research. An International Task Force was composed and agreement regarding courses of action was measured using the Convergence of Opinion on Recommendations and Evidence (CORE) process. 70% agreement was necessary to make a consensus suggestion. The Task Force made consensus suggestions to treat patients with acute COVID-19 pneumonia with remdesivir and dexamethasone but suggested against hydroxychloroquine except in the context of a clinical trial; these are revisions of prior suggestions resulting from the interim publication of several randomised trials. It also suggested that COVID-19 patients with a venous thromboembolic event be treated with therapeutic anticoagulant therapy for 3 months. The Task Force was unable to reach sufficient agreement to yield consensus suggestions for the post-hospital care of COVID-19 survivors. The Task Force fell one vote shy of suggesting routine screening for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.

34091456,Swiss Recommendations for the Follow-Up and Treatment of Pulmonary Long COVID.,"Emerging evidence suggests that long-term pulmonary symptoms and functional impairment occurs in a proportion of individuals following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although the proportion of affected patients remains to be determined, physicians are increasingly being confronted with patients reporting respiratory symptoms and impairment beyond the acute phase of COVID-19. In face of limited evidence, the Swiss Society for Pulmonology established a working group to address this area of unmet need and formulated diagnostic and treatment recommendations for the care of patients with pulmonary long COVID (LC). The Swiss COVID Lung Study group and Swiss Society for Pulmonology (SSP) formulated 13 questions addressing the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary LC. A survey within the SSP special interest groups involved in care of LC patients was conducted in Switzerland. A CORE process/Delphi-like process was used to formulate recommendations. Forty experienced pulmonologists replied to the first survey and 22 completed the second follow-up survey. Agreement of ≥70% consensus led to formulation of a recommendation. The participants in the survey reached consensus and formulated a strong recommendation for regarding the following points. Patients hospitalized for COVID-19 should have a pulmonary assessment including pulmonary function tests. Symptomatic subjects affected by COVID-19, including those with mild disease, should benefit from a pulmonary follow-up. Persistent respiratory symptoms after COVID-19 should be investigated by a pulmonary follow-up including plethysmography, diffusion capacity measurement, and blood gases analysis. Individuals having suffered from COVID-19 and who present with persistent respiratory symptoms should be offered a rehabilitation. Additional questions were given moderateor weak recommendations for. The panel did not reach sufficient consensus for pharmacological therapy (e.g., therapy specifically targeting lung fibrosis) to formulate recommendations for LC drug treatment. The formulated recommendations should serve as an interim guidance to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of patients with pulmonary LC.

38471737,Academic Output of Fellows of the American Association for Respiratory Care.,"Research is critical for the advancement of respiratory care. Fellows of the American Association for Respiratory Care (FAARCs) are nominated based on their significant contributions to the respiratory care profession. Research output is potentially an important component of qualification for FAARC. The purpose of this study is to report the academic output of respiratory therapist (RT) FAARCs. We identified FAARCs from the AARC web site. Research output was assessed by searching the Scopus and PubMed databases. We collected total research documents, citations, h-index, co-authors, and document type. We compared those with only the FAARC designation with RTs who are fellows in both the Society of Critical Care Medicine (FCCMs) and FAARC. We identified a total of 371 RT FAARCs, 4 RT FCCMs, and 10 with both designations. FAARCs were 70% male, 22% had a doctorate, 37% had a master's, 13% had a bachelor's, and 29% did not have a degree reported. There were no differences in sex or highest degree between FAARCs and FCCMs. FAARCs had a total of 3,724 publications and 110,207 citations while those with both designations had 1,304 publications and 43,181 citations. In Scopus, 46% of FAARCs had no publications, and 27% had ≥ 10 publications; of those with both credentials, 10% had no publications, and 70% had ≥ 10 publications. FAARCs inducted in 1998 and 1999 had significantly (<i>P</i> < .001) more publications than other eras.

33849039,Variable Learning Curve of Basic Rigid Bronchoscopy in Trainees.,"Despite increased use of rigid bronchoscopy (RB) for therapeutic indications and recommendations from professional societies to use performance-based competency, an assessment tool has not been utilized to measure the competency of trainees to perform RB in clinical settings. The aim of the study was to evaluate a previously developed assessment tool - Rigid Bronchoscopy Tool for Assessment of Skills and Competence (RIGID-TASC) - for determining the RB learning curve of interventional pulmonary (IP) trainees in the clinical setting and explore the variability of learning curve of trainees. IP fellows at 4 institutions were enrolled. After preclinical simulation training, all RBs performed in patients were scored by faculty using RIGID-TASC until competency threshold was achieved. Competency threshold was defined as unassisted RB intubation and navigation through the central airways on 3 consecutive patients at the first attempt with a minimum score of 89. A regression-based model was devised to construct and compare the learning curves. Twelve IP fellows performed 178 RBs. Trainees reached the competency threshold between 5 and 24 RBs, with a median of 15 RBs (95% CI, 6-21). There were differences among trainees in learning curve parameters including starting point, slope, and inflection point, as demonstrated by the curve-fitting model. Subtasks that required the highest number of procedures (median = 10) to gain competency included ability to intubate at the first attempt and intubation time of <60 s. Trainees acquire RB skills at a variable pace, and RIGID-TASC can be used to assess learning curve of IP trainees in clinical settings.",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,2021-,"Mahmood K, Wahidi MM, Shepherd RW, Argento AC, Yarmus LB, Lee H, Shojaee S, Berkowitz DM, Van Nostrand K, Lamb CR, Shofer SL, Gao J, Davoudi M",13,1664,pulmonology,2025-11-22

This document summarizes the work of the hypoventilation syndromes Technical Expert Panel working group. The most pressing current coverage barriers identified were: (1) overreliance on arterial blood gases (particularly during sleep); (2) need to perform testing on prescribed oxygen; (3) requiring a sleep study to rule out OSA as the cause of sustained hypoxemia; (4) need for spirometry; (5) need to show bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) without a backup rate failure to qualify for BPAP spontaneous/timed; and (6) qualifying hospitalized patients for home NIV therapy at the time of discharge. Critical evidence support for changes to current policies includes randomized controlled trial evidence and clinical practice guidelines. To decrease morbidity and mortality by achieving timely access to NIV for patients with hypoventilation, particularly those with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, we make the following key suggestions: (1) given the significant technological advances, we advise acceptance of surrogate noninvasive end-tidal and transcutaneous Pco<sub>2</sub> and venous blood gases in lieu of arterial blood gases; (2) not requiring Pco<sub>2</sub> measures while on prescribed oxygen; (3) not requiring a sleep study to avoid delays in care in patients being discharged from the hospital; (4) remove spirometry as a requirement; and (5) not requiring BPAP without a backup rate failure to approve BPAP spontaneous/timed. The overarching goal of the Technical Expert Panel is to establish pathways that improve clinicians' management capability to provide Medicare beneficiaries access to appropriate home NIV therapy.

32739326,Evaluation of reproducible and transparent research practices in pulmonology.,"Study reproducibility is valuable for validating or refuting results. Provision of reproducibility indicators, such as materials, protocols, and raw data in a study improve its potential for reproduction. Efforts to reproduce noteworthy studies in the biomedical sciences have resulted in an overwhelming majority of them being found to be unreplicable, causing concern for the integrity of research in other fields, including medical specialties. Here, we analyzed the reproducibility of studies in the field of pulmonology. 500 pulmonology articles were randomly selected from an initial PubMed search for data extraction. Two authors scoured these articles for reproducibility indicators including materials, protocols, raw data, analysis scripts, inclusion in systematic reviews, and citations by replication studies as well as other factors of research transparency including open accessibility, funding source and competing interest disclosures, and study preregistration. Few publications included statements regarding materials (10%), protocols (1%), data (15%), and analysis script (0%) availability. Less than 10% indicated preregistration. More than half of the publications analyzed failed to provide a funding statement. Conversely, 63% of the publications were open access and 73% included a conflict of interest statement. Overall, our study indicates pulmonology research is currently lacking in efforts to increase replicability. Future studies should focus on providing sufficient information regarding materials, protocols, raw data, and analysis scripts, among other indicators, for the sake of clinical decisions that depend on replicable or refutable results from the primary literature.",Pulmonology,2021-,"Smith CA, Nolan J, Tritz DJ, Heavener TE, Pelton J, Cook K, Vassar M",7,1709,pulmonology,2025-11-22

The objective of this study was to analyse differences in the profile of those admitted for AEPOC and their prognosis during this period. Prospective study (SocioEPOC validation cohort) conducted in two hospitals. Demographic, clinical and social characteristics were compared among patients admitted for an AECOPD before and after the declaration of the COVID-19 healthcare emergency.

Applicants for the pulmonary and critical care medicine and critical care medicine fellowships were offered a choice of interview format during the 2022 interview cycle. Applicants were invited to participate in pre and postinterview questionnaires. Interviews were offered to 88 applicants. Sixty-two applicants (71%) completed the preinterview questionnaire, and 53 applicants (60%) completed both questionnaires. On preinterview surveys, IPI was the most preferred interview format (57%), followed by VI (28%) and VI+ (15.5%). Thirty-eight (43%), 47 (53%), and 3 (4%) applicants attended the IPI, VI, and VI+ formats, respectively. Applicants who preferred VI most commonly cited cost, distance, and ability to arrange time away from work as influential. Applicants who preferred IPI cited the ability to assess program culture and ""fit,"" facilities, and fellowship happiness as influential. Applicants who participated in IPIs were more confident in their ability to assess all program aspects. Most applicants prefer an IPI format.

The Thoracic Competency Assessment Tool-Anatomic Resection for Lung Cancer (TCAT-ARC) was developed through a multistep process involving logical analysis, expert review, and simulation-based and clinical pilot testing. Validity evidence was gathered during a 6-month clinical study of trainees performing anatomic lung resections and assessments of practicing surgeons. Feedback was gathered via post-encounter questionnaires. A 35-item instrument was developed and was tested in the clinical validation study. Seven trainees in 4 North American institutions participated and completed 64 anatomic lung resections. Reliability was high (α = 0.93). Interobserver reliability (k = 0.73) and correlation with an existing global competency scale (k = 0.68) were moderately high. Item analysis revealed the most difficult and discriminatory items, which matched well with a conceptual understanding of lung resection. Both trainees and assessors viewed the instrument as highly educationally effective and user-friendly. Practicing surgeons outperformed trainees. The TCAT-ARC demonstrated early evidence of validity and reliability in assessing performance of anatomic lung resection. The instrument may be most useful early in training and as a means for providing fine-grained formative feedback about which steps have been mastered and which still require improvement. The TCAT-ARC may be used in training programs to aid in the development of trainees' competency and as a part of an aggregate assessment of trainees' overall mastery of the procedure and readiness for independent practice.",The Annals of thoracic surgery,2020-Jun,"Turner SR, Lai H, Nasir BS, Yasufuku K, Schieman C, Huang J, Bédard ELR",7,1778,pulmonology,2025-11-22

We aimed to investigate the influence of the clinical implementation of AI-CAD for chest radiograph (CR) interpretation in daily practice on the rate of referral for chest computed tomography (CT). AI-CAD was implemented in clinical practice at the Seoul National University Hospital. CRs obtained from patients who visited the pulmonology outpatient clinics before (January-December 2019) and after (January-December 2020) implementation were included in this study. After implementation, the referring pulmonologist requested CRs with or without AI-CAD analysis. We conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses to evaluate the associations between using AI-CAD and the following study outcomes: the rate of chest CT referral, defined as request and actual acquisition of chest CT within 30 days after CR acquisition, and the CT referral rates separately for subsequent positive and negative CT results. Multivariable analyses included various covariates such as patient age and sex, time of CR acquisition (before versus after AI-CAD implementation), referring pulmonologist, nature of the CR examination (baseline versus follow-up examination), and radiology reports presence at the time of the pulmonology visit. A total of 28546 CRs from 14565 patients (mean age: 67 years; 7130 males) and 25888 CRs from 12929 patients (mean age: 67 years; 6435 males) before and after AI-CAD implementation were included. The use of AI-CAD was independently associated with increased chest CT referrals (odds ratio [OR], 1.33; <i>P</i> = 0.008) and referrals with subsequent negative chest CT results (OR, 1.46; <i>P</i> = 0.005). Meanwhile, referrals with positive chest CT results were not significantly associated with AI-CAD use (OR, 1.08; <i>P</i> = 0.647). The use of AI-CAD for CR interpretation in pulmonology outpatients was independently associated with an increased frequency of overall referrals for chest CT scans and referrals with subsequent negative results.",Korean journal of radiology,2023-Sep,"Hong W, Hwang EJ, Park CM, Goo JM",4,2105,pulmonology,2025-11-22
40121639,"Allergies Documentation In Hmis History Of Patients Admitted In Gastroenterology And Pulmonology Ward At Lady Reading Hospital, Medical Teaching Institute - Peshawar.","This clinical audit aimed to assess the accuracy of allergy documentation within the Hospital Management Information System (HMIS) of the Gastroenterology and Pulmonology Wards at Lady Reading Hospital, MTI Peshawar. Proper documentation of allergies, including food, drugs, and other types, is crucial for patient safety to prevent adverse reactions. The clinical audit was conducted using the ""HOPE"" Hospital Management Information System (HMIS), donated by the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust. It involved a retrospective review of medical records for 20 patients from each ward across two audit cycles. In the first cycle, 10 patients were randomly selected from each ward, making a total of 20 patients. After identifying gaps in allergy documentation, interventions were implemented. A second cycle was then conducted to reassess documentation, selecting another set of 10 patients from each ward. Data collection involved checking if allergies were documented, and the results were recorded in an Excel sheet, marked as 'Yes' or 'No' for allergies. Data analysis was done using Microsoft Excel 2023 and the graphical representations were created in Microsoft Office Word 2023 and Microsoft Excel 2023 (Microsoft® Corp., Redmond, WA). The audit aimed for a 100% documentation standard as per the HMIS reading manual. In the first cycle, 70% (n=7) of patients in the Gastroenterology Ward and 60% (n=6) in the Pulmonology Ward had no documented allergies. After implementing the recommended interventions, the second cycle showed a remarkable improvement, with a 100% documentation rate achieved in both wards. After implementing the recommendations, allergy documentation in the HMIS of Lady Reading Hospital MTI Peshawar significantly improved, which helped in preventing allergic reactions in patients admitted to the Gastroenterology and Pulmonology Wards.","Journal of Ayub Medical College, Abbottabad : JAMC",2024-,"Khan MH, Shah MK, Mehmood A, Muhammad UF, Khawaja AM, Tauqir J, Jebin A, Durani MN, Siddiqi B",9,1863,pulmonology,2025-11-22

A multinational survey of respiratory medicine and palliative care physicians.,"Respiratory medicine (RM) and palliative care (PC) physicians' management of chronic breathlessness in advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), fibrotic interstitial lung disease (fILD) and lung cancer (LC), and the influence of practice guidelines was explored via an online survey. A voluntary, online survey was distributed to RM and PC physicians via society newsletter mailing lists. 450 evaluable questionnaires (348 (77%) RM and 102 (23%) PC) were analysed. Significantly more PC physicians indicated routine use (often/always) of opioids across conditions (COPD: 92% vs. 39%, fILD: 83% vs. 36%, LC: 95% vs. 76%; all p < 0.001) and significantly more PC physicians indicated routine use of benzodiazepines for COPD (33% vs. 10%) and fILD (25% vs. 12%) (both p < 0.001). Significantly more RM physicians reported routine use of a breathlessness score (62% vs. 13%, p < 0.001) and prioritised exercise training/rehabilitation for COPD (49% vs. 7%) and fILD (30% vs. 18%) (both p < 0.001). Overall, 40% of all respondents reported reading non-cancer palliative care guidelines (either carefully or looked at them briefly). Respondents who reported reading these guidelines were more likely to: routinely use a breathlessness score (χ<sup>2</sup> = 13.8; p < 0.001), use opioids (χ<sup>2</sup> = 12.58, p < 0.001) and refer to pulmonary rehabilitation (χ<sup>2</sup> = 6.41, p = 0.011) in COPD; use antidepressants (χ<sup>2</sup> = 6.25; p = 0.044) and refer to PC (χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.83; p = 0.016) in fILD; and use a handheld fan in COPD (χ<sup>2</sup> = 8.75, p = 0.003), fILD (χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.85, p = 0.028) and LC (χ<sup>2</sup> = 5.63; p = 0.018). These findings suggest a need for improved dissemination and uptake of jointly developed breathlessness management guidelines in order to encourage appropriate use of existing, evidence-based therapies.

33295695,Mental health history and social barriers impacting caregivers of infants with cystic fibrosis.,"Caregivers of infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) carry a heavy treatment burden for their child along with the inherent difficulties of raising an infant. This study investigated the impact of self-reported caregiver mental health diagnoses and social barriers during the 1st year of life on clinical outcomes. A retrospective chart review was conducted for infants seen in a large tertiary hospital CF clinic over a 5-year period. Baseline characteristics were collected, and documentation from physician and social work notes were reviewed. Demographics and clinical characteristics were compared by the presence or absence of self-reported mental health diagnoses, social barriers, and ""emotional concern."" Analyses were conducted on 71 patients. Thirty-five percent of caregivers disclosed mental health diagnoses, 52% identified social barriers to care, and 55% reported feeling upset or fatigued. Having a caregiver with a self-reported mental health diagnosis was associated with tobacco smoke exposure (p < .001) and increased odds of hospitalizations (odds ratio [OR], 3.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-6.06), emergency department/urgent care visits (OR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.32-7.64), and longer lengths of stay (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.69-2.20). Caregivers who expressed emotional concern had infants with significantly lower weight-for-length percentiles (p = .012). Caregiver mental health and social barriers to care are important determinants to address as they may impact clinical outcomes in infants with CF. Identifying barriers and struggles early increases the likelihood that clinical teams can intervene and provide support. Further research into mental health and socioeconomic barriers faced by caregivers of infants with CF is crucial.",Pediatric pulmonology,2021-Feb,"Gillespie ML, Nemastil CJ, Moore-Clingenpeel M, Gilmore D, Dell ML, Krivchenia K",6,1757,pulmonology,2025-11-22

It is unclear if adopting TUS can reduce the number of CR in the daily clinical routine. This retrospective study investigates the utilization of post-interventional CR and TUS for PTX detection after the introduction of TUS as the method of choice in an interventional pulmonology unit. All interventions with CR or TUS for ruling out PTX performed in the Pneumology Department of the University Hospital Halle (Germany) 2014 to 2020 were included. The documented TUS and CR performed before (period A) and after the introduction of TUS as the method of choice (period B), as well as the number of diagnosed and missed PTX were recorded. The study included 754 interventions (110 in period A and 644 in period B). The proportion of CR decreased from 98.2% (n = 108) to 25.8% (n = 166) (p < 0.001). During period B, a total of 29 (4.5%) PTX were diagnosed. Of these, 28 (96.6%) were detected on initial imaging (14 by CR, 14 by TUS ). One PTX (0.2%) was initially missed by TUS, none by CR. Confirmatory investigations were ordered more frequently after TUS (21 of 478, 4.4%) than after CR (3 of 166, 1.8%). The use of TUS in interventional pulmonology can effectively reduce the number of CR and thus save resources. However, CR may still be favored in specific circumstances or if pre-existing conditions limit sonographic findings.",BMC pulmonary medicine,2023-Jun,"Sieber S, Garbe J, Böhm S, Eisenmann S",4,1466,pulmonology,2025-11-22
37413906,Derivation of a new model of lung adenocarcinoma using canine lung cancer organoids for translational research in pulmonary medicine.,"Canine primary lung cancer (cPLC) is a rare malignant tumor in dogs, and exhibits poor prognosis. Effective therapeutic drugs against cPLC have not been established yet. Also, cPLC resembles human lung cancer in histopathological characteristics and gene expression profiles and thus could be an important research model for this disease. Three-dimensional organoid culture is known to recapitulate the tissue dynamics in vivo. We, therefore, tried to generate cPLC organoids (cPLCO) for analyzing the profiles of cPLC. After samples from cPLC and the corresponding normal lung tissue were collected, cPLCO were successfully generated, which recapitulated the tissue architecture of cPLC, expressed lung adenocarcinoma marker (TTF1), and exhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. The sensitivity of cPLCO to anti-cancer drugs was different among strains. RNA-sequencing analysis showed significantly upregulated 11 genes in cPLCO compared with canine normal lung organoids (cNLO). Moreover, cPLCO were enriched with the MEK-signaling pathway compared with cNLO. The MEK inhibitor, trametinib decreased the viability of several strains of cPLCO and inhibited the growth of cPLC xenografts. Collectively, our established cPLCO model might be a useful tool for identifying novel biomarkers for cPLC and a new research model for dog and human lung cancer.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2023-Sep,"Shiota Sato Y, Elbadawy M, Suzuki K, Tsunedomi R, Nagano H, Ishihara Y, Yamamoto H, Azakami D, Uchide T, Fukushima R, Tanaka R, Yoshida T, Mori T, Abugomaa A, Kaneda M, Yamawaki H, Shinohara Y, Aboubakr M, El-Asrag ME, Usui T, Sasaki K",21,1342,pulmonology,2025-11-22

34433880,"Respiratory sound classification for crackles, wheezes, and rhonchi in the clinical field using deep learning.","Auscultation has been essential part of the physical examination; this is non-invasive, real-time, and very informative. Detection of abnormal respiratory sounds with a stethoscope is important in diagnosing respiratory diseases and providing first aid. However, accurate interpretation of respiratory sounds requires clinician's considerable expertise, so trainees such as interns and residents sometimes misidentify respiratory sounds. To overcome such limitations, we tried to develop an automated classification of breath sounds. We utilized deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) to categorize 1918 respiratory sounds (normal, crackles, wheezes, rhonchi) recorded in the clinical setting. We developed the predictive model for respiratory sound classification combining pretrained image feature extractor of series, respiratory sound, and CNN classifier. It detected abnormal sounds with an accuracy of 86.5% and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.93. It further classified abnormal lung sounds into crackles, wheezes, or rhonchi with an overall accuracy of 85.7% and a mean AUC of 0.92. On the other hand, as a result of respiratory sound classification by different groups showed varying degree in terms of accuracy; the overall accuracies were 60.3% for medical students, 53.4% for interns, 68.8% for residents, and 80.1% for fellows. Our deep learning-based classification would be able to complement the inaccuracies of clinicians' auscultation, and it may aid in the rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment of respiratory diseases.",Scientific reports,2021-Aug,"Kim Y, Hyon Y, Jung SS, Lee S, Yoo G, Chung C, Ha T",7,1559,pulmonology,2025-11-22
32622822,Development of Learning Curves for Bronchoscopy: Results of a Multicenter Study of Pulmonary Trainees.,"There are currently no reference standards for the development of competence in bronchoscopy. The aims of this study were to (1) develop learning curves for bronchoscopy skill development and (2) estimate the number of bronchoscopies required to achieve competence. Trainees from seven North American academic centers were enrolled at the beginning of their pulmonology training. Performance during clinical bronchoscopies was assessed by supervising physicians using the Ontario Bronchoscopy Assessment Tool (OBAT). Group-level learning curves were modeled using a quantile regression growth model, where the dependent variable was the mean OBAT score and the independent variable was the number of bronchoscopies performed at the time the OBAT was completed. A total of 591 OBAT assessments were collected from 31 trainees. The estimated regression quantiles illustrate significantly different learning curves based on trainees' performance percentiles. When competence was defined as the mean OBAT score for all bronchoscopies rated as being completed without need for supervision, the mean OBAT score associated with competence was 4.54 (95% CI, 4.47-4.58). Using this metric, the number of bronchoscopies required to achieve this score varied from seven to 10 for the 90th percentile of trainees and from 109 to 126 for the lowest 10th percentile of trainees. When competence was defined as the mean OBAT score for the first independent bronchoscopy, the mean was 4.40 (95% CI, 4.20-4.60). On the basis of this metric, the number of bronchoscopies required varied from one to 11 for the 90th percentile of trainees and from 83 to 129 for the lowest 10th percentile of trainees. We were able to generate learning curves for bronchoscopy across a range of trainees and centers. Furthermore, we established the average number of bronchoscopies required for the attainment of competence. This information can be used for purposes of curriculum planning and allows a trainee's progress to be compared with an established norm.",Chest,2020-Dec,"Voduc N, Adamson R, Kashgari A, Fenton M, Porhownick N, Wojnar M, Sharma K, Gillson AM, Chung C, McConnell M",10,2026,pulmonology,2025-11-22

There is a scarcity of published literature on critical asthma, considered acute asthma requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. The goal of this study was to describe the clinical care of children with critical asthma admitted to a single center PICU and to determine whether pulmonary medicine consultation during admission impacted outcomes. Retrospective chart review of known asthma patients aged 4-18 years admitted to a quaternary PICU between 01/2013 and 07/2019 for management of critical asthma.

33231713,Interobserver agreement between interpretations of acute changes after lung stereotactic body radiotherapy.,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an effective treatment modality for inoperable early-stage lung cancer or metastatic lung lesions. Post-SBRT, acute radiological lung changes sometimes mimic tumor progression, so over-investigation may be applied. We aimed to reveal the interobserver agreement among physicians regarding acute radiographic changes on CT of the thorax obtained shortly after SBRT MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiologic images of 20 lesions treated with SBRT were evaluated for acute lung changes. Two physicians, one senior and one junior, from diagnostic radiology, radiation oncology, nuclear medicine, and chest disease departments reviewed these images. The final interpretations were categorized as stable, regression/consolidation, progressive disease, and SBRT-related changes. The evaluations of the physicians were compared with the experienced reference radiation oncologist. The gold standard was accepted as the reference physician's final score. Unweighted Cohen's kappa (κ) coefficient was used for assessing interobserver agreement between physicians. The evaluations of the physicians were compared with the reference radiation oncologist. The strongest coherence coefficient was found with the senior radiation oncologist (κ: 0.72). The kappa coefficients between the junior radiation oncologist, junior nuclear medicine physician, and the reference physician were 0.61 and 0.55, respectively. The disciplines with the lowest kappa coefficients were junior chest disease and senior radiologist, and the kappa values were 0.37 and 0.44, respectively. Disciplines dealing with lung cancer treatment may not be aware of the various radiologic changes after SBRT or inexperienced in interpreting them from recurrence. Therefore, physicians must have detailed radiotherapy information such as planning target volume (PTV), dose/fractionation, etc. In addition, final evaluations should be performed in the multidisciplinary team dealing with the treatment of the patient.",Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

CRS is associated with significant morbidity in CF, including its ability to trigger pulmonary exacerbations. CRS in CF is typically managed by pediatricians, otolaryngologists and pulmonologists. This survey evaluates the variance in practice patterns of CRS in CF amongst specialists. This is a cross-sectional, electronic survey in which maximum variation purposive sampling was used by a multi-disciplinary group of pediatric, otolaryngology and pulmonology providers in order to select a survey population with expertise in CRS in CF patients. The survey was distributed to 381 practitioners from September to October 2019. 175 participants responded (45% response rate). Ten (of 54) statements achieved 75% consensus agreement. Consensus statements included: The decision to pursue surgical intervention for CRS in CF is a multi-disciplinary approach (94%; n = 146); maximal medical management should include nasal saline irrigation (93%; n = 142), topical steroids (75%; n = 117), maximal medical management should not include intravenous steroids (79%; n = 122); image guidance in surgery is necessary for all surgery involving the frontal sinuses (77%; n = 43), and all revision surgery(80%, n = 45); the appropriate setting for sinus surgery in a CF patient varies depending on patient presentation (89%; n = 133); post-operative regimen should include nasal saline (93%; n = 137); but does depend on the severity of disease discovered intra-operatively (84%; n = 124); post-operative antibiotics should be guided by intra-operative culture data (82%; n = 121).

This study aimed to evaluate ChatGPT's performance in a pulmonology examination through a comparative analysis with that of third-year medical students. In this cross-sectional study, we conducted a comparative analysis with 2 distinct groups. The first group comprised 244 third-year medical students who had previously taken our institution's 2020 pulmonology examination, which was conducted in French. The second group involved ChatGPT-3.5 in 2 separate sets of conversations: without contextualization (V1) and with contextualization (V2). In both V1 and V2, ChatGPT received the same set of questions administered to the students. V1 demonstrated exceptional proficiency in radiology, microbiology, and thoracic surgery, surpassing the majority of medical students in these domains. However, it faced challenges in pathology, pharmacology, and clinical pneumology. In contrast, V2 consistently delivered more accurate responses across various question categories, regardless of the specialization. ChatGPT exhibited suboptimal performance in multiple choice questions compared to medical students. V2 excelled in responding to structured open-ended questions. Both ChatGPT conversations, particularly V2, outperformed students in addressing questions of low and intermediate difficulty. Interestingly, students showcased enhanced proficiency when confronted with highly challenging questions. V1 fell short of passing the examination. Conversely, V2 successfully achieved examination success, outperforming 139 (62.1%) medical students. While ChatGPT has access to a comprehensive web-based data set, its performance closely mirrors that of an average medical student. Outcomes are influenced by question format, item complexity, and contextual nuances.

34126057,"Bronchoscopy Teaching Without a Gold Standard: Attending Pulmonologists' Assessment of Learners, Supervisory Styles, and Variation in Practice.","Despite the growing role of simulation in procedural teaching, bronchoscopy training largely is experiential and occurs during patient care. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education sets a target of 100 bronchoscopies to be performed during pulmonary fellowship. Attending physicians must balance fellow autonomy with patient safety during these clinical teaching experiences. Few data on best practices for bronchoscopy teaching exist, and a better understanding of how bronchoscopy currently is supervised could allow for improvement in bronchoscopy teaching. How do attending bronchoscopists supervise bronchoscopy, and in particular, how do attendings balance fellow autonomy with patient safety? This was a focused ethnography conducted at a single center using audio recording of dialog between attendings and fellows during bronchoscopies, supplemented by observation of nonverbal teaching. Interviews with attending bronchoscopists and limited interviews of fellows also were recorded. Interviews were transcribed verbatim before analysis. We used constant comparative analysis to analyze data and qualitative research software to support data organization and thematic analysis. Education researchers from outside of pulmonary critical care joined the team to minimize bias. We observed seven attending bronchoscopists supervising eight bronchoscopies. We noted distinct teaching behaviors, classified into themes, which then were grouped into four supervisory styles of modelling, coaching, scaffolding, and fading. Observation and interviews illuminated that assessing fellow skill was one tool used to choose a style, and attendings moved between styles. Attendings accepted some, but not all, variation in both performing and supervising bronchoscopy. Attending pulmonologists used a range of teaching microskills as they moved between different supervisory styles and selectively accepted variation in practice. These distinct approaches may create well-rounded bronchoscopists by the end of fellowship training and should be studied further.",Chest,2021-Nov,"Brady AK, Town JA, Robins L, Bowen J",4,2072,pulmonology,2025-11-22
35247680,Objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) for students' training and assessment in the French respiratory medicine departments in 2021: An overview.,"Medical professional performances can be assessed by objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) where medical trainees go through a series of simulated clinical situations. OSCEs are now the gold standard for the assessment of medical students' competence during their training. In France, the first national OSCEs will take place in May 2024 and respiratory teachers will be involved in this reform and will use OSCEs for students' training and assessment in respiratory medicine. Students training regarding this final OSCE may vary across medical faculties and may impact students' results. Therefore, we aimed to provide a national overview of OSCE's training performed by respiratory teachers and their interest in developing a common French databank of OSCEs. We conducted a national anonymous online survey among the members of the French college of respiratory teachers (CEP), from 2021 February the 15th to 2021 June the 15th. The survey consisted of 32 questions. Among 118 French pulmonologists teachers, 52 (45%) responded to the survey. We received a response from at least one of each of the French Medical Universities. Twenty-two (42%) had received specific training on how to conduct an OSCE. Twenty-eight (54%) of respondents used OSCEs for training purposes and 24 (46%) for assessment purposes, for less than 1 year in more than half of the participants. The average satisfaction scores out of 10 about OSCEs was 7.3 ± 1.7 for training and 7.4 ± 1.5 for students' assessment. Respondents were willing (8.9 ± 1.8 out of ten) to develop a common databank to share OSCEs subjects in respiratory medicine in France. This survey confirms heterogeneity in the training and the use of OSCEs among French respiratory teachers. However, a common national databank could be a useful tool to reduce these disparities.",Respiratory medicine and research,2022-May,"Jutant EM, Sesé L, Patout M, Messika J, Maître B, Gille T, Zysman M",7,1834,pulmonology,2025-11-22
31780285,Evaluation of the Integrated Tuberculosis Research Program Sponsored by the Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery: 11 Years on.,"The objective of the study was to determine the trend of variables related to tuberculosis (TB) from the Integrated Tuberculosis Research Program (PII-TB) registry of the Spanish Society of Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR), and to evaluate the PII-TB according to indicators related to its scientific objectives. Cross-sectional, population-based, multicenter study of new TB cases prospectively registered in the PII-TB between 2006 and 2016. The time trend of quantitative variables was calculated using a lineal regression model, and qualitative variables using the χy test for lineal trend. A total of 6,892 cases with an annual median of 531 were analyzed. Overall, a significant downward trend was observed in women, immigrants, prisoners, and patients initially treated with 3 drugs. Significant upward trends were observed in patients aged 40-50 and > 50 years, first visit conducted by a specialist, hospitalization, diagnostic delay, disseminated disease and single extrapulmonary location, culture(+), sensitivity testing performed, drug resistance, directly observed treatment, prolonged treatment, and death from another cause. The scientific objectives of the PII-TB that showed a significant upward trend were publications, which reached a maximum of 8 in 2016 with a total impact factor of 49,664, numbers of projects initiated annually, presentations at conferences, and theses.

38990104,Trends in racial and ethnic disparities in pediatric lung transplantation in the United States.,"Racial and ethnic disparities in pediatric lung transplantation (LTx) related to the shifting cystic fibrosis (CF) population receiving highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT) has not been well investigated. The UNOS Registry was queried for patients age 1-25 years undergoing bilateral LTx between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2021. Race and ethnicity were classified as non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, or none of the above. The primary outcome was posttransplant mortality. Trends in the association between race/ethnicity and mortality were examined using transplant year as a continuous variable and stratifying year based on introduction of HEMT (triple combination therapy) in November 2019. In the study sample (N = 941), 7% of patients were non-Hispanic Black, 15% were Hispanic, and 2% were some other racial or ethnic group. One hundred (11%) received LTx after approval of triple combination therapy, and 407 (43%) died during follow-up. We identified a statistically significant disparity in mortality hazard (hazard ratio: 1.91; 95% confidence interval: 1.31, 2.80) in non-Hispanic Black compared to non-Hispanic White patients in the pre-triple combination therapy era. We found higher mortality hazard among non-Hispanic Black compared to non-Hispanic White children undergoing LTx in the United States. Further monitoring of LTx outcomes to identify and address disparities is needed in the current era of triple combination therapy for CF.",Pediatric pulmonology,2024-Dec,"Alachraf K, Tumin D, Hayes D, Benden C",4,1478,pulmonology,2025-11-22
36346075,Interventional pulmonology use of cell-free DNA assay for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer: the UC Davis experience.,"Interventional pulmonologists (IPs) are often the first specialist to see patients with suspected metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC). Consequently, they are potentially ideally positioned to expedite the identification of actionable molecular mutations by ordering blood-based cell-free DNA (cfDNA), prior to or upon tissue diagnosis of mNSCLC. Retrospective review of cfDNA ordered by IP as part of a routine clinical practice. Patients were categorized into two groups based on when cfDNA was ordered by IP: (1) IP suspected mNSCLC prior to histologic confirmation or (2) IP diagnosed mNSCLC based on histologic confirmation of NSCLC. Twenty patients were identified. Twelve of 13 in group 1 were confirmed to have mNSCLC by oncology and 1 had stage IIIA. Seven of 7 in group 2 were confirmed to have mNSCLC by oncology. Fifteen of 20 also had next-generation tissue molecular testing. Thirteen of 20 (65%) had targetable alterations. Seven of 13 (54%) were identified on cfDNA and tissue, 5/13 (38%) on cfDNA only, and 1/13 (8%) on tissue alone. Tissue results were available a medium of 24 days after, and cfDNA results a medium of 4 days prior to, the patients' first oncology visit. IP appears to be able identify patients who have mNSCLC and for whom testing for molecular mutations is appropriate even prior to tissue confirmation of NSCLC. A strategy whereby IP employ blood-based cfDNA testing in suspected and tissue confirmed mNSCLC could potentially provide medical oncologists with more timely information on actionable mutations than tissue-based testing first, potentially expediting patient treatment.",Therapeutic advances in respiratory disease,2022-,"Phan C, Jespersen F, Weipert C, Li T, Yoneda KY",5,1630,pulmonology,2025-11-22
31725497,Career Development Training for Interventional Pulmonary Fellows: Are They Ready for the Workforce?,"Interventional pulmonary (IP) fellows spend ≥6 years of postgraduate medical education before IP training. Given the high employment attrition rates of early medical professionals, we investigated the IP fellows' self-assessed readiness for employment and the role of an intense preemployment educational intervention on improving the same. Over 2 consecutive academic years, IP fellows nationally were invited to a mid-year career development symposium focusing on employment search strategy and early career development. Attendees were anonymously surveyed presymposium/postsymposium and 6 months later at graduation. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Attendees' knowledge and skills were rated on a 5-point Likert scale. A control group of IP fellows that did not attend the symposium were also surveyed at graduation. In total, 53 of 55 attendees (96% response rate) completed the presymposium survey and 50 of 55 (91%) completed the final survey at graduation. Overall, 16 of 18 (89%) nonattendees also completed the final survey at graduation. IP Fellows reported low baseline self-assessment scores on all question domains. Scores increased significantly postsymposium and were sustained at graduation (P<0.05). At graduation, the average response score of symposium attendees was significantly higher than that of nonattendees (P=0.04). Overall, 84% reported that the symposium helped them with their employment search. Advanced IP fellows were not well-equipped for a strategic employment search and early career development at the onset of their IP fellowship training.

32107203,Feasibility and acceptability of introducing advance care planning on a thoracic medicine inpatient ward: an exploratory mixed method study.,"Advance care planning (ACP) is communication about wishes and preferences for end-of-life care. ACP is not routinely used in any Norwegian hospitals. We performed a pilot study (2014-2017) introducing ACP on a thoracic medicine ward in Norway. The aims of this study were to explore which topics patients discussed during ACP conversations and to assess how patients, relatives and clinicians experienced the acceptability and feasibility of performing ACP. Conversations were led by a study nurse or physician using a semistructured guide, encouraging patients to talk freely. Each conversation was summarised in a report in the patient's medical record. At the end of the pilot period, clinicians discussed their experiences in focus group interviews. Reports and transcribed interviews were analysed using systematic text condensation. Fifty-one patients participated in ACP conversations (41-86 years; 9 COPD, 41 lung cancer, 1 lung fibrosis; 11 women); 18 were accompanied by a relative. Four themes emerged: (1) disturbing symptoms, (2) existential topics, (3) care planning and (4) important relationships. All participants appreciated the conversations. Clinicians (1 physician and 7 nurses) participated in two focus group interviews. Reports from ACP conversations revealed patient values previously unknown to clinicians; important information was passed on to primary care. Fearing they would deprive patients of hope, clinicians acted as gatekeepers for recruitment. Although they reported barriers during recruitment, many clinicians saw ACP as pertinent and called for time and skills to integrate it into their daily clinical practice. Patients, relatives and clinicians showed a positive attitude towards ACP. Focusing on present and future symptom control may be an acceptable way to introduce ACP. Important aspects for implementing ACP in this patient group are management support, education, training, feasible routines and allocated time to perform the conversations.",BMJ open respiratory research,2020-Feb,"Hjorth NE, Schaufel MA, Sigurdardottir KR, Haugen DRF",4,1989,pulmonology,2025-11-22
33470090,Depression and anxiety symptoms among people with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis receiving in-patient care in the National Pulmonology Reference Institute in Romania.,"Mental health comorbidities are common among tuberculosis patients, with higher prevalence among people with rifampicin-resistant/multidrug-resistant (RR/MDR) tuberculosis.  TB and depression share common risk factors adding to the overall disease burden. There is limited evidence about prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among tuberculosis patients in Romania. We assessed the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms and their evolution over the course of the treatment in RR/MDR-TB patients receiving in-patient care at the National Institute of Pneumonology (NIP) ""Marius Nasta"" in Romania during May-September 2020. We conducted a cohort study and used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety (defined as score≥ 8) symptoms at admission (baseline) and the second month of in-patient treatment (follow-up). Difference between baseline and follow-up depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using McNemar test. Binary logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between sociodemographic and clinical characteristics with the presence of depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline. The cohort included 46 patients, 63% were male, mean age was 46 (±13.3) years. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in our cohort was 46% and 43% at baseline respectively, and 50% and 39%, at the follow-up respectively. About one third (7/25) of patients who had normal HADS depression score at baseline, had an increase above the threshold at the second month of treatment. No statistical difference in prevalence of depression or anxiety was found between the baseline and second month of treatment. Unadjusted analysis showed that odds of depression at baseline was lower in patients with education above 8th grade compared to patients with education below 8th grade (odds ratio=0.2, 95% confidence interval: 0.1,0.8, p=0.026). The study revealed high prevalence of depression and anxiety among RR/MDR-TB patients admitted to the NIP, underlining the necessity of evaluating the mental health of TB patients and linking them to appropriate care.",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,2021-Jan,"Stoichita A, Dumitrescu A, Ciobanu A, Oancea C, Petronela F, Dabja R, Dumchev K, Dadu A, Mahler-Boca B, Akopyan K",10,2132,pulmonology,2025-11-22
34128758,Consensus on the treatment of allergic asthma with sublingual house dust mite immunotherapy in the field of pneumology.,"<b>Introduction</b>: Many patients sensitized to mites remain symptomatic and uncontrolled despite traditional treatment. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) has demonstrated to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, the need for additional drug treatments, and to reduce the number of moderate and severe exacerbations in patients with allergic asthma caused by mites that had not been adequately controlled.<b>Areas covered</b>: After reviewing the most recent literature, a scientific committee composed by five pneumologists experts in asthma proposed 41 items that addressed the diagnosis of allergic asthma caused by mites, the role of house dust mite (HDM) SLIT tablet in the therapeutic plan and in the control of the disease, and the profile of patients with asthma candidates for this therapy. Through a modified Delphi method, the items were send to 106 pneumologists involved in asthma to be agreed.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The high degree of consensus reached by the panel of pneumologists shows the importance of HDM SLIT tablet in the treatment of allergic asthma caused by mites, particularly taking into account that they barely use this therapy because until now they did not have a registered treatment with solid evidence of efficacy and safety.",Expert review of respiratory medicine,2021-Oct,"Plaza V, Arnedillo A, Blanco-Aparicio M, Ignacio JM, Urrutia I",5,1262,pulmonology,2025-11-22
38372490,Improved tracheostomy-dependent patient outcomes after implementation of the Pediatric Resident Education in Pulmonary (PREP) Boot Camp.,"Children with tracheostomies are high risk for morbidity and mortality. Pediatric resident physicians are not routinely taught skills to care for this vulnerable patient population. Few reports link educational interventions to improved patient outcomes. This study evaluates the impact of an intensive educational training program on pediatric residents' observed skills and tracheostomy-dependent patient outcomes. Pediatric post-graduate year 2 (PGY2) resident physicians rotating through the inpatient pediatric pulmonology month at Children's Hospital Colorado July 2018-2019 participated in the Pediatric Resident Education in Pulmonary (PREP) Boot Camp, an intensive educational program with an interactive lecture and simulation experience on patients with tracheostomy-dependence. PGY2s who partook in PREP and PGY3s who rotated before PREP initiation were invited to be studied. Primary outcomes included: (1) resident skills assessed by direct observation during simulation encounters and (2) rates of intensive care unit (ICU) transfers in tracheostomy-dependent patients following acute events before and after introduction of PREP. We hypothesized that increased education would enhance resident skills and improve patient outcomes by decreasing the rate of ICU transfers. PGY2 residents retained skills learned during PREP up to 11 months following initial participation, and significantly outperformed their PGY3 counterparts. There was a significant decrease in ICU transfer rate in patients with tracheostomies admitted to the pulmonary team during the 19 months following initiation of PREP. Enhanced early education may improve resident physicians' ability to care for complex patients with tracheostomies and could improve outcomes in this high-risk population.",Pediatric pulmonology,2024-May,"Khan EK, Lockspeiser TM, Meier M, Liptzin DR, Baker CD",5,1782,pulmonology,2025-11-22
38918025,Perspectives on Using Race in Pulmonary Function Testing: A National Survey Fellows and Program Directors.,"Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) have historically used race-specific prediction equations. The recent American Thoracic Society guidelines recommend the use of a race-neutral approach in prediction equations. There are limited studies centering the opinions of practicing pulmonologists on the use of race in spirometry. Provider opinion will impact adoption of the new guideline. The aim of this study was to ascertain the beliefs of academic pulmonary and critical care providers regarding the use of race as a variable in spirometry prediction equations. We report data from 151 open-ended responses from a voluntary, nationwide survey (distributed by the Association of Pulmonary Critical Care Medicine Program Directors) of academic pulmonary and critical care providers regarding the use of race in PFT prediction equations. Responses were coded using inductive and deductive methods, and a thematic content analysis was conducted. There was a balanced distribution of opinions among respondents supporting, opposing, or being unsure about the incorporation of race in spirometry prediction equations. Responses demonstrated a wide array of understanding related to the concept and definition of race and its relationship to physiology. There was no consensus among providers regarding the use of race in spirometry prediction equations. Concepts of race having biologic implications persist among pulmonary providers and will likely affect the uptake of the Global Lung Function Initiative per the American Thoracic Society guidelines.",Respiratory care,2024-Oct,"Banerjee D, Aijaz S, Nassikas NJ, Singh P, Lakshman S, Boyd C, Brown Q, Mathew A, Rosen RK, Lantini R, Andrea SB, Walsh SR, Gartman EJ, Levinson A, Carino G, Braun L",16,1542,pulmonology,2025-11-22

35449467,Management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections with focus on patients with chronic lung diseases (as of 10 January 2022) : Updated statement of the Austrian Society of Pneumology (ASP).,"The Austrian Society of Pneumology (ASP) launched a first statement on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in May 2020, at a time when in Austria 285 people had died from this disease and vaccinations were not available. Lockdown and social distancing were the only available measures to prevent more infections and the breakdown of the health system. Meanwhile, in Austria over 13,000 patients have died in association with a SARS-CoV‑2 infection and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was among the most common causes of death; however, SARS-CoV‑2 has been mutating all the time and currently, most patients have been affected by the delta variant where the vaccination is very effective but the omicron variant is rapidly rising and becoming predominant. Particularly in children and young adults, where the vaccination rate is low, the omicron variant is expected to spread very fast. This poses a particular threat to unvaccinated people who are at elevated risk of severe COVID-19 disease but also to people with an active vaccination. There are few publications that comprehensively addressed the special issues with SARS-CoV‑2 infection in patients with chronic lung diseases. These were the reasons for this updated statement. Pulmonologists care for many patients with an elevated risk of death in case of COVID-19 but also for patients that might be at an elevated risk of vaccination reactions or vaccination failure. In addition, lung function tests, bronchoscopy, respiratory physiotherapy and training therapy may put both patients and health professionals at an increased risk of infection.

35778527,The efficiency of a clinical pathway to guide combined applications of interventional pulmonology in undiagnosed pleural effusions.,"The diagnostic procedure of pleural effusion (PEs) is challenging due to low detection rates and numerous aetiologies. Hence, any attempt to enhance diagnosis is worthwhile. We present a clinical pathway to guide combined application of interventional pulmonology (IP) for tracing causes of undiagnosed PEs. Subjects with undiagnosed PEs were identified in the Hospital Information System of Dalian Municipal Central Hospital from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2018. Eligible subjects were divided into a group of combined tests and a group of medical thoracoscopy (MT). Optimal and subsequent diagnostic tests were performed depending on the guidance of the clinical pathway by matching profitable chest lesions with the respective adaptation. As the guidance of clinical pathway, common bronchoscopy would be preferentially selected if pulmonary lesions involved or within the central bronchus, EBUS-TBNA was favoured when pulmonary lesions were adjacent to the central bronchus or with the enlarged mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes, guided bronchoscopy would be preferred if pulmonary nodules/masses were larger than 20 mm with discernible bronchus signs, CT-assisted transthoracic core biopsy was preferred if pulmonary nodules were less than 20 mm, image guided cutting needle biopsy was the recommendation if the pleural thickness was larger than 10 mm and pulmonary lesions were miliary. MT was preferred only when undiagnosed PEs was the initial symptom and pulmonary lesions were miliary or absent. A total of 83.57% cases of undiagnosed PEs were eligible for the clinical pathway, and 659 and 216 subjects were included in the combined tests and MT groups, respectively, depending on the optimal recommendation of the clinical pathway. The total diagnostic yields in the combined tests and MT groups were 95.99% and 91.20%, respectively, and the difference in total diagnostic yield was statistically significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 7.510, p = 0.006). Overall, clinical pathway guidance of the combined application of IP is useful for tracing the causes of undiagnosed PEs.

33932038,The Diagnostic Contribution of Systematic Lung Ultrasonography in Patients Admitted to a Conventional Pulmonology Hospitalization Unit.,"Although the evidence to date remains limited, we hypothesized that performing protocolized lung ultrasound (LUS) in patients, admitted to a conventional pulmonology hospitalization unit, could improve diagnostic precision. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic contribution and changes in the treatments administered after performing a protocolized LUS in patients hospitalized in a Pulmonology Department ward. This was a prospective, observational study, which included patients admitted from the Emergency Department to a conventional Pulmonology Department hospitalization unit, after first being evaluated by a pulmonologist. LUS was performed within the first 48 hours of admission. The diagnosis at the time of discharge was used as the reference diagnosis. A total of 180 patients were included in this study. The admitting diagnoses were the decompensation of an underlying obstructive disease in 60 patients (33.3%), respiratory infection in 93 (51.7%), pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) in 9 (5%), exacerbation of an interstitial lung disease in 14 (7.8%), and other causes in 4 cases (2.2%). Ultrasonography provided new information, unsuspected at the patient's admission, in 117 (65%) of the patients by capturing images suggestive of infection in 63 patients (35%), 1 new case of ILD, 23 (12.7%) cases of cardiogenic edema, and pleural pathology in 19 (10.5%), as well as two tumors and indirect data related to a PE. The use of LUS resulted in the decision to change the already established treatment in 17.2% of the cases. LUS provided additive information in more than half of patients that ended up reclassifying or potentially changing diagnosis or treatment. Thus, including LUS in management algorithms could reduce the need for other complementary tests or unnecessary treatments.",Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,2022-Mar,"Ramos-Hernández C, Botana-Rial M, Mouronte-Roibas C, Núñez-Fernández M, González-Montaos A, Caldera-Díaz AC, Ruano-Raviña A, Fernández-Villar A",8,1829,pulmonology,2025-11-22

The present study focuses on the demographic, clinical and laboratory profile of such patients from a tertiary level non-COVID respiratory care hospital. This is a retrospective observational study. Seventy-seven sick patients fulfilling COVID suspect criteria were admitted to the isolation area. Their RT-PCR test was done from the designated laboratory and 35 of them  were confirmed to be COVID-19 patients. The detailed demographic, clinical and laboratory profile of these COVID-19 patients was studied. The mean age was 46±17 years with male predominance (57%). Majority  of the cases (83%) were symptomatic. The most common symptom was cough (66%) followed by breathlessness and fever. Nineteen (54.3%) patients had one or the other co-morbidity and 16 (45.7%) had chronic lung diseases as one of the comorbidities. Nearly half of the patients (51%) required supplementary oxygen on presentation. Two patients were put on invasive mechanical ventilation while 4 patients required non-invasive ventilation before being shifted to the COVID hospital. Hence, it can be concluded that COVID-19 in patients of chronic respiratory diseases  manifests with higher prevalence of symptoms and also higher severity of disease. Further, the  symptomatology of COVID-19 closely mimics the acute exacerbation of chronic lung diseases, so cautious screening and testing should be done, especially at the pulmonary department.",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,2020-Nov,"Goel N, Spalgais S, Mrigpuri P, Khanna M, Menon B, Kumar R",6,1583,pulmonology,2025-11-22
36302345,Crossover Patient Outcomes for Targeted Lung Denervation in Moderate to Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: AIRFLOW-2.,"Targeted Lung Denervation (TLD) is a potential new therapy for COPD. Radiofrequency energy is bronchoscopically delivered to the airways to disrupt pulmonary parasympathetic nerves, to reduce bronchoconstriction, mucus hypersecretion, and bronchial hyperreactivity. This work assesses the effect of TLD on COPD exacerbations (AECOPD) in crossover subjects in the AIRFLOW-2 trial. The AIRFLOW-2 trial is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled crossover trial of TLD in COPD. Patients with symptomatic COPD on optimal medical therapy with an FEV1 of 30-60% predicted received either TLD or sham bronchoscopy in a 1:1 randomization. Those in the sham arm had the opportunity to cross into the treatment arm after 12 months. The primary end point was rate of respiratory adverse events. Secondary end points included adverse events, changes in lung function and health-related quality of life and symptom scores. Twenty patients were treated with TLD in the crossover phase and were subsequently followed up for 12 months (50% female, mean age 64.1 ± 6.9 years). After TLD, there was a trend towards a reduction in time to first AECOPD (hazard ratio 0.65, p = 0.28, not statistically significant) in comparison to sham follow-up period. There was also a reduction in time to first severe AECOPD in the crossover period (hazard ratio 0.38, p = 0.227, not statistically significant). Symptom scores and lung function showed stability.

33298375,Respiratory medicine curriculum in Portuguese family medicine training: A Delphi study.,"Respiratory diseases (RD) constitute a significant part of the workload of family physicians. There is no consensus on what family doctors should know in this area but established methods for achieving consensus may help to overcome this. The purpose of the study was to obtain a national consensus on the required knowledge and skills in respiratory medicine for family medicine trainees after vocational training. A Delphi study was conducted via e-mail with a diverse panel of experts. We developed a Learning Curriculum Framework (LCF) with 399 items adapted from the Royal Australasian College of Physicians ..÷ Respiratory Medicine Advanced Training Curriculum. The LCF was submitted to the experts in two rounds for consensus. Consensus was considered for items that had an agreement of 80% in the classifications above 4 on a scale of importance that ranged from 1 (not important) to 5 (very important). Consensus was obtained for 159 items (38.8%). These included structure and function of the respiratory tract (0.6%), presenting problems (21.4%), diagnosis (7.5%), interventions and prevention (11.3%), COPD-emphysema (12.6%), tumours (3.1%), infections (10.7%), tuberculosis (5.7%), HIV (1.3%), thromboembolic disease (2.5%), pleural-pulmonary disease (3.1%), pregnancy (0.6%) and sleep disorders (3.8%). Items on iatrogenic diseases and respiratory research did not reach consensus. Consensus on the respiratory medicine curriculum may contribute to further development of the vocational training curriculum in Portugal.

31144543,Four seasons of Czech asthma study: asthma characteristics and management reality in the Czech Republic.,"<b>Objective:</b> To describe the characteristics and management of asthma in clinical practice in the Czech Republic in the context of international guidelines and clinical realities.<b>Methods:</b> Data were collected over four seasons from summer 2016 to spring 2017 and are mostly presented using descriptive statistics.<b>Results:</b> We obtained valid data for 4557 adult patients with asthma, including detailed phenotyping (71% eosinophilic allergic, 10% eosinophilic non-allergic, 19% non-eosinophilic non-allergic asthma) from 58 allergologists and 56 pulmonologists. The average time to diagnosis was 3 years. In more than half of the subjects, bronchodilator testing (BDT) results were available at primary diagnosis. More than 10% of physicians did not test for mold allergy. Occupational asthma was diagnosed in 0.7% of subjects. According to the attending physician, 68% of patients had well-controlled and 10% had uncontrolled asthma. Ninety-four percent of patients were on preventive treatment, with 91% using an inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at an average dose of 705 µg/day budesonide equivalent. Approximately 75% of patients were on an ICS/LABA, with 91% using fixed combinations. Among patients using ICS/formoterol, a maintenance and reliever therapy regime was prescribed in 67%.<b>Conclusions:</b> The quality of asthma management in the Czech Republic is comparable to that of other developed countries and better in some respects (frequent BDT, phenotyping, and use of preventive treatment). Nevertheless, there is unnecessary delay in diagnosis and lack of research on possible environmental causes (workplace, molds). Pharmacotherapy shows good adherence to guidelines.

39822226,Determination of Priorities for Lung Transplant Education for Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Fellows.,"In the United States, a growing number of lung transplants are performed each year, necessitating an increased number of general and transplant pulmonologists skilled in the care of these complex patients. However, pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM) fellowships across the country do not universally have dedicated lung transplantation curricula, and there is scarce literature in this area. We describe the generation of a content outline for curriculum development created through modified electronic Delphi methodology. To identify ""must know"" topics in lung transplantation for a graduating PCCM fellows. We developed expert consensus on ""must know"" lung transplant topics and subtopics (""items"") for a graduating fellow through three survey rounds from July 2023 to October 2023. Thirty-three panelists were asked to rank author-provided items as ""must know,"" ""nice to know,"" or ""not necessary to know"" and to generate new items in round 1 to be submitted for ranking in subsequent rounds. ""Must know consensus"" was defined as ≥50% must know responses. Survey response and completion rates across rounds were 58-70% and 96-100%, respectively. In round 1, panelists were provided eight topics and 30 subtopics for initial ranking. Panelists generated 82 new items in this round, of which 19 were included in round 2 for ranking after author review, together with one item from round 1 that required reranking. From round 2, only two items required reranking, and these items comprised round 3. Seven topics were identified as ""must know"": transplant immunology, evaluation of a lung transplant candidate, surgical and peri/postoperative management, rejection, immunosuppression, infections, and other complications, together with 36 subtopics. Self-identified lung transplantation experts obtained consensus on seven ""must know"" topics and 36 subtopics in lung transplantation for graduating PCCM fellows.

32237908,Understanding the Knowledge Gap and Assessing Comfort Level among Healthcare Professionals Who Provide Inhaler Education.,"Inhaled medications play a pivotal role in the management of COPD and asthma. Provider knowledge and ability to teach various devices is paramount as poor inhaler technique directly correlates with worse disease control. The goal of our survey was to assess the knowledge and comfort level with various inhaled devices among providers involved in patient inhaler education. We constructed a 20-question survey consisting of a five-question Likert scale-based comfort assessment and a 15-question multiple-choice inhaler knowledge test that was distributed both internally and nationwide. Groups surveyed included internal medicine residents, family medicine residents, pulmonary fellows, respiratory therapists, nursing staff, and pharmacists. A total of 557 providers responded to the survey. The overall correct response rate among all respondents was only 47%. There was no significant difference between correct response rates among prescribers (internal medicine residents, family medicine residents, and pulmonary fellows) and non-prescribers (respiratory therapists, nursing staff, and pharmacists), 47% and 47%, respectively (<i>p</i> = 0.6919). However, respiratory therapists had the overall highest correct response rate of 85%. Over 72% of respondents indicated that they educate patients on inhaler technique as part of their clinical duties. Furthermore, the correct response rates for various inhaler devices varied with 55% among metered dose inhalers, 52% among dry powder inhalers, and 34% among soft-mist inhalers. Our study reveals that there is a continued need for education on the subject of inhaler devices among providers given their overall poor knowledge, particularly in an era of fast-changing inhaler devices.

37903340,Challenges and Opportunities for Commercializing Technologies in the Pulmonary Arena: An Official American Thoracic Society Report.,"""Translational medicine"" has been a buzzword for over two decades. The concept was intended to be lofty, to reflect a new ""bench-to-bedside"" approach to basic and clinical research that would bridge fields, close gaps, accelerate innovation, and shorten the time and effort it takes to bring novel technologies from basic discovery to clinical application. Has this approach been successful and lived up to its promise? Despite incredible scientific advances and innovations developed within academia, successful clinical translation into real-world solutions has been difficult. This has been particularly challenging within the pulmonary field, because there have been fewer U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and higher failure rates for pulmonary therapies than with other common disease areas. The American Thoracic Society convened a working group with the goal of identifying major challenges related to the commercialization of technologies within the pulmonary space and opportunities to enhance this process. A survey was developed and administered to 164 participants within the pulmonary arena. This report provides a summary of these survey results. Importantly, this report identifies a number of poorly recognized challenges that exist in pulmonary academic settings, which likely contribute to diminished efficiency of commercialization efforts, ultimately hindering the rate of successful clinical translation. Because many innovations are initially developed in academic settings, this is a global public health issue that impacts the entire American Thoracic Society community. This report also summarizes key resources and opportunities and provides recommendations to enhance successful commercialization of pulmonary technologies.",Annals of the American Thoracic Society,2024-Jan,"Vukmirovic M, Benam KH, Rose JJ, Turner S, Magin CM, Lagares D, Cohen AH, Kaminski N, Hirota JA, Maher TM, Konigshoff M, Mallampalli RK, Sheppard D, Tarran R, Gomer RH, Kenyon NJ, Morris D, Hobbie S, Raju SV, Petrache I, Watkins T, Kumar R, Lam WA, Sherer T, Hecker L",25,1766,pulmonology,2025-11-22
39600292,Basic Bronchoscopy Competence Achieved by a Nationwide One-day Simulation-based Training.,"In 2020, a mandatory, nationwide 1-day bronchoscopy simulation-based training (SBT) course was implemented for novice pulmonology residents in the Netherlands. This pretest-posttest study was the first to evaluate the effectiveness of such a nationwide course in improving residents' simulated basic bronchoscopy skills. After passing a theoretical test, residents followed a 1-day SBT course, available in 7 centers, where they practiced their bronchoscopy skills step-by-step on a virtual reality simulator under pulmonologist supervision. Residents practiced scope handling efficiency (task 1) and navigational skills combined with lung anatomy knowledge (task 2). Task 1 outcome measures were navigational skill simulator metrics: percentage of time at mid-lumen, percentage of time with scope-wall contact, procedure time (PT), number of wall contacts and number of wall contacts per minute of PT. Task 2 outcome measures were PT, observational assessment scores of a validated tool with a 5-point scale (1 representing the worst and 5 the best competence) and blinded dexterity assessments. The study included 100 residents. All outcome measures of task 1 improved significantly (P<0.001), except for the number of wall contacts per minute of PT (4.3 [IQR 3.0 to 6.2] pre vs. 3.5 [IQR 2.6 to 5.3] post, P=0.07). For task 2, PT was reduced by 54% (10.3±2.7 minutes pre vs. 4.7±0.9 minutes post, P<0.001) with an improvement in overall-competence scores (2.0 [IQR 1.0 to 2.0] pre vs. 4.0 [IQR 4.0 to 5.0] post, P<0.001) and all dexterity parameters (P<0.001).

36802952,Practicing Serious Illness Conversations in a Pulmonary Medicine Teaching Clinic.,"Physician trainees in pulmonary medicine are not provided with supervised practice opportunities to gain confidence and skill in having serious illness conversations in the ambulatory setting. We incorporated a palliative medicine attending into an ambulatory pulmonology teaching clinic to provide supervised opportunities for serious illness conversations. Trainees in a pulmonary medicine teaching clinic requested supervision from a palliative medicine attending based on a set of evidence-based pulmonary-specific triggers that indicate advanced disease. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to determine the trainee's perceptions of the educational intervention. The palliative medicine attending supervised 8 trainees in 58 patient encounters. The most common trigger for palliative medicine supervision was answering ""no"" to the ""surprise question."" At baseline, all trainees cited lack of time as the primary barrier to having serious illness conversations. Themes emerging from post-intervention semi-structured interviews included trainees learning that (1) patients are grateful to have conversations about the severity of their illness, (2) patients do not have a good sense of their prognosis, and (3) with improved skills, these conversations can be conducted efficiently. Pulmonary medicine trainees were provided practice opportunities for having serious illness conversations under the supervision of the palliative medicine attending.

Imaging revealed destructive bronchiectasis and multifocal lung abscesses, more advanced in the right lung. He was discharged home after 42-day hospital admission. 3.5 months after his discharge, he re-presented to the Emergency Department with a large right pneumothorax and a pneumatocele measuring 10.2 × 6.2 cm<sup>2</sup> . He was admitted to the hospital and while his pneumothorax resolved in 2 days, the size of the pneumatocele was noted to fluctuate with different phases of respiration. A computed tomography scan of the chest demonstrated a fistula between the pneumatocele and right upper lobe bronchus. Following discussion between Pulmonary medicine and Interventional radiology, transbronchial closure of the air leak was planned. Intubation was done with a dual-lumen endotracheal tube. Bronchography was performed using a diagnostic catheter. A large air leak was noted from the anterior segment of the right upper lobe bronchus. Embolization of the fistula was performed using n-butyl cyanoacrylate (nBCA, glue) injected through a second catheter under fluoroscopic guidance. The residual pneumatocele slowly resolved over 2 months. Endobronchial embolization has been described in the literature as a treatment strategy for air leaks, largely in adult patients. Endobronchial embolization of large pneumatoceles and bronchopleural fistulas may offer an alternative treatment option with less morbidity than the classic surgical approach.",Pediatric pulmonology,2021-Oct,"Klouda T, Gunnlaugsson S, Shashi K, Alomari A, Fishman MP, Casey A",6,1674,pulmonology,2025-11-22
39567954,Understanding characteristics of internal medicine residents matching into pulmonary critical care medicine fellowships.,"Internal medicine (IM) residents face significant challenges when pursing subspecialty fellowships. This study determined the factors that differentiate IM residents entering pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM) fellowships from those pursuing other careers. We completed a retrospective study of 12 classes of IM residents at a single institution completing residency between 2010 and 2021. Data included pre-residency characteristics, global residency performance, and PCCM-specific experiences. Logistic regression models examined associations between these variables and the primary outcome of matching into a PCCM fellowship within one year of completing IM residency. Among 522 residents, 10.3% matched into PCCM. Completing a pulmonary elective significantly increased the odds of matching into PCCM (OR 7.78, 99% CI 3.10-19.53, p < 0.0001). Residents who match into PCCM were more likely to have < 3 publications than 3 + (OR 3.51 (1.20-10.25), p = 0.003)."" A stated intent to enter PCCM was positively associated with matching into PCCM in the univariable, but not the multivariable, model. Matriculating into PCCM fellowship was significantly associated with completing a pulmonary elective during residency. PCCM-bound residents were less likely to achieve high numbers of publications, suggesting these residents' preferences for clinical learning and practice over scholarship. This study provides insights into characteristics of residents who match into PCCM and guides mentors as they counsel residents considering PCCM.",BMC medical education,2024-Nov,"Stultz BR, Beckman TJ, Halvorsen AJ, Cullen MW, Kelm DJ",5,1543,pulmonology,2025-11-22
39577764,Keeping Up With Technological Innovation: The Moral Imperative for Pragmatic Clinical Trials in Interventional Pulmonology.,"The advances in minimally invasive lung cancer diagnostics of the last decade have transformed patient care but have also raised important concerns about the regulatory processes used to approve new devices and the best way to generate data to support their use. Disruptive technologies, such as robotic bronchoscopy, have been widely adopted by interventional pulmonologists in the absence of robust data demonstrating improved patient outcomes. Comparative research is needed to inform patient care, but traditional methods of conducting clinical trials in which research teams operate separately from clinical teams are ill-suited to testing the safety and effectiveness of technologies being introduced on the market at unprecedented speed. Pragmatic clinical trials, which integrate trial procedures into routine clinical care, represent an appealing alternative approach for generating much-needed data to inform clinical care. In this article we illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of these research paradigms, using two recently completed randomized controlled trials in navigational bronchoscopy, and highlight the barriers and facilitators to using pragmatic trials to address the gap in comparative effectiveness research: these include the need for increased clarity of research regulations for pragmatic trials, adequate federal and private funding for such research, and alignment of incentives between clinicians, researchers, regulators, and industry.",Chest,2025-Mar,"Maldonado F, Paez R, Lentz RJ, Ratwani A, Casey JD",5,1475,pulmonology,2025-11-22

As it is a disease related to the exacerbation of the inflammatory process and oxidative stress, this study searched to investigate the micronucleus frequency in patients with and without bronchiectasis treated at a specialized pulmonology service in a hospital in the extreme south of Brazil. Patients with a confirmed tomographic diagnosis of bronchiectasis were defined as cases. Mutagenicity was evaluated by the micronucleus test in patients' oral mucosa cells. Data collection was performed through a questionnaire containing socioeconomic, demographic, lifestyle, and health condition information. Of the 95 patients involved in this study, 21 (22.1%) were diagnosed with bronchiectasis aged between 12 and 89 years. There was no significant difference in the frequency of micronucleus between patients with and without bronchiectasis. There was a significant positive association between age and frequency of micronucleus among patients with bronchiectasis, but this association does not occur among patients without the disease.

33642231,The Japanese respiratory society guidelines for the management of cough and sputum (digest edition).,"Cough and sputum are common complaints at outpatient visits. In this digest version, we provide a general overview of these two symptoms and discuss the management of acute (up to three weeks) and prolonged/chronic cough (longer than three weeks). Flowcharts are provided, along with a step-by-step explanation of their diagnosis and management. Most cases of acute cough are due to an infection. In chronic respiratory illness, a cough could be a symptom of a respiratory infection such as pulmonary tuberculosis, malignancy such as a pulmonary tumor, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, drug-induced lung injury, heart failure, nasal sinus disease, sinobronchial syndrome, eosinophilic sinusitis, cough variant asthma (CVA), atopic cough, chronic laryngeal allergy, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and post-infectious cough. Antibiotics should not be prescribed for over-peak cough but can be considered for atypical infections. The exploration of a single/major cause is recommended for persistent/chronic cough. When sputum is present, a sputum smear/culture (general bacteria, mycobacteria), cytology, cell differentiation, chest computed tomography (CT), and sinus X-ray or CT should be performed. There are two types of rhinosinusitis. Conventional sinusitis and eosinophilic rhinosinusitis present primarily with neutrophilic inflammation and eosinophilic inflammation, respectively. The most common causes of dry cough include CVA, atopic cough/laryngeal allergy (chronic), GER, and post-infectious cough. In the last chapter, future challenges and perspectives are discussed.

Patients attending the bronchiectasis clinic between August 2015 and April 2020 with radiologically proven bronchiectasis on computed tomography were recruited. Clinical characteristics, spirometry, radiology, microbiology and clinical course over a median period of 2.4 years is presented. A total of 168 patients were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. They were predominantly women (67.8%), Chinese (87.5%) and never-smokers (76.9%). Median age of diagnosis was 64 years (interquartile range 56-71) and the most common aetiology was ""idiopathic"" bronchiectasis (44.6%). Thirty-nine percent had normal spirometries. Compared to female patients, there were more smokers among the male patients (53.8% versus 8.5%, <i>P</i><0.001) and a significantly larger proportion with post-tuberculous bronchiectasis (37.0% vs 15.8%, <i>P</i>=0.002). Fifty-five percent of our cohort had a history of haemoptysis. Lower body mass index, presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ever-smoker status, modified Reiff score, radiological severity and history of exacerbations were risk factors for mortality.

33620151,Diagnosis and management of aspiration using fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing in a Pediatric Pulmonology Unit.,"Swallowing disorders lead to chronic lung aspiration. Early detection and treatment of aspiration in children with dysphagia are important to prevent lung damage. Diagnosis of aspiration, which may be silent, requires an instrumental study such as fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Despite its usefulness, it is rarely practiced by pediatric pulmonologists. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and utility of FEES performed in the pediatric respiratory unit of a tertiary hospital, analyze the clinical characteristics, endoscopic findings and proposed treatments, and identify the factors associated with penetration or aspiration. Medical records of 373 children with suspected aspiration who were referred to the pediatric respiratory unit for FEES were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical characteristics, FEES findings, and the proposed treatments were analyzed. Laryngeal penetration/aspiration was seen in 47.9% of the patients. The most common associated conditions were neurological disease and prematurity. The most frequently observed endoscopic finding was altered laryngeal sensitivity (36.5%). Intervention was recommended in 54.2% of the patients. Complications were not seen during any of the procedures. The multivariate logistic regression model revealed an independent association between aspiration and alterations in laryngeal sensitivity (odds ratio [OR], 5.68), pharyngeal pooling (OR, 11.47), and post-swallowing food residues (OR, 8.08). The FEES procedure performed by pediatric pulmonologists is a reliable method for diagnosing aspiration in children.

Procedure duration, safety, breadth, and diagnostic performance of ADBs performed by PCCM fellows supervised by interventional pulmonologists (IPs) were compared with those completed solely by IP faculty. <b>Results:</b> Among 628 ADBs, fellows participated in 379 (60.3%). With unadjusted analysis, fellow-involved cases were a median 11.5 minutes longer for convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscopy (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.0-14.0; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and 10.5 minutes longer for peripheral bronchoscopy (95% CI, 2.0-18.0; <i>P</i> = 0.016). Compared with ADBs performed by IP faculty alone, procedures with second-year (post-graduate year 5) fellows had the largest duration differences. These included convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscopy (+14.5 min; 95% CI, 7.0-18.0 min; <i>P</i> < 0.001), cases not using rapid on-site evaluation (+14.0 min; 95% CI, 8.0-21.0 min; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and those performed with moderate sedation (+12.0 min; 95% CI, 7.0-18.0 min; <i>P</i> < 0.001). After multivariate adjustment, fellow-involved procedures overall were 7.2 minutes longer in duration (95% CI, 3.8-10.5; <i>P</i> < 0.001), and 8.8 minutes longer when performed by post-graduate year 5 fellows-an approximate 16% decrease in efficiency. Bronchoscopies performed with fellows were also more likely to experience complications (38.7% compared with 25.8% with faculty procedures; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.0; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and be prematurely terminated (adjusted OR, 4.95; 95% CI, 1.44-17.02; <i>P</i> = 0.011). Diagnostic performance and occurrence of major complications were similar between fellow and no-fellow bronchoscopies. <b>Conclusion:</b> Participation of PCCM fellows during ADB increases procedure duration and the risk for minor complications compared with cases completed solely by IPs. Procedures performed with fellows on the steepest portion of the ADB learning curve are the least efficient. Fellowship directors and faculty bronchoscopists should acknowledge these potential impacts on ABD practice while optimizing the approach to bronchoscopy training.",ATS scholar,2025-Mar,"Chrissian AA, De Silva S, Wiltchik E, Furukawa B, Rizzo NS, Ho E, Moretta D, Cheek G",8,2608,pulmonology,2025-11-22

34605477,"Frequency of Osteoporosis among Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients Attending Respiratory Medicine Out Patient Department, BSMMU.","Osteoporosis is an important systemic manifestation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Osteoporosis is a systemic disease of bone which may present as low bone mass and micro-architectural disarray that increases the risk of fracture. The World Health Organization defines osteoporosis as bone density ≥2.5 standard deviations below the bone density of a normal young adult. Osteopenia, a less severe form of bone loss, is defined as a bone density between 1 and 2.5 standard deviations below that reference point. The aetiology of osteoporosis in COPD patients remain unclear, but several factors significantly correspond to reduced bone density in COPD, including older age, female sex and body mass index (BMI). However, the relationship to other factors, such as FEV₁, tobacco smoking, physical inactivity and corticosteroid therapy, are still an unresolved issue. This cross-sectional study was done in the Department of Respiratory Medicine, BSMMU from March 2018 to March 2019. A total of 86 patients of which prevalence of osteoporosis is 29.1%, osteopenia 50% and normal BMD in 20.9%, majority of them was belonging to age group 51-60 years. Male were predominant with male-female ratio of 3.5:1. The frequency of osteoporosis was 32.0%, 64.0% and 4.0% in moderate, severe and in very severe COPD patients, respectively. The frequency of osteopenia was 14.0% in mild, 53.5% in moderate, 20.9% in severe and 11.6% were in very severe COPD patients.

39262178,Survey of Clinical Knowledge and Procedural Readiness of Pulmonary Fellows to Start Interventional Pulmonary Fellowship: A Survey of Interventional Pulmonary Fellowship Directors.,"Entry into the interventional pulmonary (IP) fellowship requires prerequisite training in pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM) fellowship in the United States. IP fellowship has become standardized, but the prerequisite training may be quite variable depending on the learner's exposure to IP during their PCCM fellowship. A survey study was conducted to identify potential foundational knowledge and/or skills gaps of new fellows entering IP fellowships. This may help both PCCM and IP fellowship directors to identify common knowledge gaps within PCCM training specific to IP. Based on components of the ACGME's common program requirements for PCCM fellowships, a survey was developed and categorized into 5 domains: nonprocedural skills, didactic knowledge, diagnostic bronchoscopy, pleural procedures, and airway/percutaneous procedures. The survey was then sent to 42 IP fellowship directors after the content validity review and approval by the Association of Interventional Pulmonary Program Directors. The survey response rate was 88.1% (37/42). The overall mean scores in all 5 domains were perceived as below competent (<3). The highest mean domain was nonprocedural skills, and the lowest was airway/percutaneous procedures.

33271467,Physician's attitude against COPD guidelines and the choice of first-line treatment for COPD.,"Our aim was to evaluate changes in attitudes of pulmonologists in Turkey towards COPD guidelines and their choice of first-line treatments for COPD patients. 333 physicians who completed the questionnaire were included in this cross-sectional questionnaire study. The questionnaire contained demographic data, professional information, extent of guideline use, rationales behind using or not using a guideline. The data was compared with the same survey conducted previously in 2011 and was analyzed by appropriate statistical methods. 80 physicians were resident pulmonologists (24%), 250 physicians were specialists (75.1%). 298 (89.5%) physicians reported that they follow at least one guideline for selection of the appropriate treatment in COPD. The current application of guidelines when compared with the first survey in 2011, was found to be decreased, 91.2% and 89.5%, respectively (p = 0.07). 46.8% (n = 156) of participants thought that guidelines provided the physicians more legal protection (p < 0.001). The number of physicians who didn't follow the guidelines due to workload increased over this period of time (36.8% in 2011, 85.3% in 2018, p < 0.001). The number of physicians using inhaler steroid combinations as their first choice of treatment was found to be similar with the previous survey (p = 0.909). According to the results of previous questionnaire, the application of COPD guidelines has decreased. The number of pulmonologists who declared they have no time for following or applying guidelines has profoundly increased since 2011.

38014586,Lung ultrasound evaluation in people with cystic fibrosis: A new approach in the pulmonology outpatient clinic.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that causes progressive lung disease with major impact on the quality of life. Lung ultrasound (LUS) allows to assess the lung involvement through the artefacts analysis and is increasingly used in children but is not yet used to monitor people with CF(pwCF). The main aim of this study was to describe the LUS pattern of pwCF during their routinary check-up visit. The secondary objective was to correlate the LUS findings with pulmonary function indices. We performed a cross-sectional observational study, enrolling adolescents and young adults with CF. Each patient underwent clinical assessment, measurement of SpO2, assessment of lung function by spirometry and LUS. Twenty-nine subjects with CF were included. The most frequent alterations were consolidations (72.4%) located in the left apical anterior and right apical posterior regions followed by interstitial syndrome (65.5%). The 41.4% of cases presented the lingula involvement, characterized by a consolidation with static air bronchogram, and 55.2% showed pleural irregularity mainly in the posterior apical regions. A significant correlation was found between the LUS total score and spirometric indices: FEV<sub>1</sub> (p = .003), FVC (p = .002), Tiffenau Index <80% (p = .014), and FEF 25-75 (p = .004). Our study describes LUS findings in pwCF. It also showed a correlation between LUS score and the patients' lung function measured by spirometric indices. We conclude that LUS may be useful in routine monitoring of pwCF in combination with clinical and spirometric assessment.",Pediatric pulmonology,2024-Mar,"Curatola A, Corona F, Squillaci D, Saccari A, Chiaretti A, Barbi E, Maschio M",7,1591,pulmonology,2025-11-22

However, prognostic validations of this risk assessment are limited, especially outside Europe. Here, we validated the risk assessment strategy in PAH patients in our institution in Japan. Eighty consecutive PAH patients who underwent right heart catheterization between November 2006 and December 2018 were analyzed. Patients were classified as low, intermediate, or high risk by using a simplified version of the risk assessment that included seven variables: World Health Organization functional class, 6-min walking distance, peak oxygen consumption, brain natriuretic peptide, right atrial pressure, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and cardiac index. The high-risk group showed significantly higher mortality than the low- or intermediate-risk group at baseline (<i>P</i> < 0.001 for both comparisons), and the mortalities in the intermediate- and low-risk groups were both low (<i>P</i> = 0.989). At follow-up, patients who improved to or maintained a low-risk status showed better survival than those who did not (<i>P</i> = 0.041).

38553682,Enhancing knowledge mastery in resident students through peer-teaching: a study in respiratory medicine.,"The transition from medical students to competent physicians requires comprehensive training during residency programs. In China, resident students typically undergo 2- or 3-year training programs. While they learn from patient interactions under the guidance of experienced doctors, integrating theoretical knowledge from textbooks into practical cases remains a challenge. This study aimed to explore the impact of medical interns acting as peer-students on the knowledge mastery of resident students. The participants of this study consisted of resident students specializing in respiratory medicine at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, School of Medicine. Resident students were given the opportunity to volunteer as peer-teachers for medical interns in the respiratory department. Those who chose to instruct interns were automatically placed into the test group, while those who opted not to partake in intern instruction formed the control group. In their role as peer-teachers, resident students assumed the responsibility of guiding interns in patient management throughout the entire continuum, spanning from initial engagement to discharge, a commitment that extended over a minimum period of 2 weeks. The resident students' academic performance was evaluated through a departmental examination consisting of 50 multiple-choice questions, which was administered upon completing their rotation. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the impact of peer-teaching on the resident students' performance. Between January 2023 and June 2023, a total of 158 resident students completed their rotation in the respiratory department. Among them, 40 resident students willingly took on the responsibility of instructing medical interns, while 118 resident students did not participate in intern teaching. With a ""one-to-one"" teaching policy in place, the overall satisfaction rate of the interns was an impressive 95.35%. Pre-rotation test scores for the test group averaged 81.66 ± 8.325 (Mean ± SD) and the control group averaged 81.66 ± 8.002, without significance. The departmental examination scores of the test group averaged 85.60 ± 7.886, while the control group scored an average of 82.25 ± 8.292, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.027).

39822215,A Multicenter Study of Pulmonary Critical Care Trainees' Perception of Airway Management Training during Fellowship.,"There is significant variability in airway management training among pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM) fellows. To assess the airway management training of PCCM fellows, specifically evaluating the role of the institutional approach to intubations (anesthesia-predominant primary operators vs. PCCM-predominant) to the overall fellows' educational experience. We performed a survey of PCCM fellows at 14 institutions to assess the perceptions of airway management training. Summary statistics were used to analyze the Likert scale responses. Based on our hypothesis of a relationship of a fellow's experience to the institutional approach to intubations, we stratified responses based on whether the primary operator for airway management for critically ill patients was generally anesthesiology or PCCM providers. Statistical significance was determined using either <i>t</i> testing (after converting Likert-style responses to continuous variables) or analysis of variance for categorical variables (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Respondents included 132 fellows across 14 PCCM programs (47% response rate), spanning all fellowship years (29% in first year [<i>n</i> = 38], 31% in second year [<i>n</i> = 41], 26% in third/fourth year [<i>n</i> = 34]). Seventy percent (<i>n</i> = 80) of fellows were very or somewhat satisfied with their airway management training. In fellows training where anesthesia providers primarily perform airway management (29% [<i>n</i> = 34]), satisfaction with training was significantly lower, as was the self-assessment of one's airway management skills. The location of airway management experience in anesthesia-predominant programs was mainly the operating room (69% [<i>n</i> = 22]), versus mainly in the intensive care unit for PCCM-predominant programs (94% [<i>n</i> = 77]). The number of completed intubations was lower for fellows in anesthesia-predominant programs (<i>P</i> = 0.02). We found significant differences in fellows' experiences in airway management based on the institutional approach to intubations (anesthesia-predominant primary operators vs. PCCM-predominant). Ongoing focus on strategies to optimize competency-based airway management training is needed, particularly at programs where anesthesia involvement limits the amount of clinical exposure.",ATS scholar,2024-Dec,"Ghiathi C, Lanfranco AR, Heath JK",3,2308,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Our experience and The New Modified Criteria Clinical Radiological Physiological (TNMC CRP) score for sarcoidosis: A novel proposition to assess the functional status.,"Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disease most commonly involving the pulmonary system and having a myriad of manifestations. However literature is scanty pertaining to the profile and scoring system in sarcoidosis. This study was undertaken to understand the profile of sarcoidosis and an endeavor to assess the functional status with a simplified scoring system. This was an observational study undertaken in the department of Pulmonary Medicine at a tertiary care. The profile of these patients was studied in terms of clinical features, radiological findings, the New Modified Criteria Clinical Radiological Physiological (TNMC CRP) score, six-minute walk distance (6MWD), spirometry, arterial blood gas parameters, serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels and tissue biopsy histopathology. The 68 patients included 41 women and 27 men with a mean age of 42.7 years. They comprised of 18 (27%), 39 (57%), 4 (6%), 7 (10%) cases of stage 1, 2, 3, 4 sarcoidosis respectively. Most common presenting symptom and sign was progressive dyspnea 49 (72%), and peripheral lymphadenopathy 15 (22%). Serum ACE was elevated in 57 (83%). The average 6MWD was 360 meters. Most common high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) finding was mediastinal lymphadenopathy and peri-bronchovascular nodules. Spirometry was restrictive abnormality in 48 (96%) patients. Evidence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) was present in 32 (47%) patients. Tissue diagnosis revealed granulomatous inflammation in 51 biopsies with a transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) yield of 62%. The average TNMC CRP score was 5. There was a positive correlation between this score and 6MWD which was statistically significant. The score correlated with the functional status.

The highest registered incidence was observed in asthma patients (548 per 100,000 inhabitants) followed by COPD patients (233 per 100,000 inhabitants). Asthma patients were also characterised by the highest prevalence, with lower values being observed in COPD patients. In the group of adults, patients aged 65 years or older and 80 years or older accounted for 44% and 14% of hospitalised adults respectively. The analysis also revealed that 66% of hospitalisations of adults included patients with asthma, COPD and respiratory failure. The development of respiratory failure prolongs hospitalisation and increases both in-hospital and post-discharge mortality. In children, 90% of the identified hospitalisations were for asthma, chronic inflammatory lung diseases and cystic fibrosis. The results of the study demonstrate that pulmonary obstructive diseases are associated with a considerable burden. Therefore, corrective actions within the Polish healthcare system are required to decrease the number of hospitalisations for these diseases.",Advances in respiratory medicine,2020-,"Jahnz-Różyk K, Czajkowska-Malinowska M, Krenke K, Sands D, Batura-Gabryel H, Kabicz P, Diaków E, Więckowska B",8,1606,pulmonology,2025-11-22
34091201,Bronchoscopy in times of COVID-19 pandemic: An interventional pulmonology unit experience.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory disease that has rapidly spread to become a global pandemic. Bronchoscopy is clearly a high-risk manoeuvrer, so to continue endoscopic activity safely it was necessary to make many changes. We created different ways to access and exit the endoscopy theatre and reinforced our dressing/undressing regimens as well as equipment cleaning techniques. To prevent aerosol dispersion we used a bag valve mask with an antibacterial-antiviral filter, introducing the flexible bronchoscope orally rather than through the nose. For procedures with increased contagious risk a nasopharyngeal swab was required. From the date of the first case of COVID-19 in our hospital to December 31 2020, we performed 1027 bronchoscopies, in both negative and positive patients. No outbreaks occurred within the staff and no patients are known to have developed COVID-19 after a procedure.

33893068,Statement from the Japanese Respiratory Society: Working diagnosis and initial management of COPD during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) has recommended spirometry for the diagnosis of respiratory diseases. It is indispensable for the confirmation of airflow obstruction by spirometry in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis. However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has made it difficult for many clinics to perform spirometry as it may lead to possible aerosol infections. Thus, the diagnosis of COPD, especially in the early stage, has become difficult. To overcome this situation, JRS issued a ""Flowchart of Working Diagnosis and Management of COPD during the COVID-19 Pandemic"".

34010863,Longitudinal Milestone Assessment Extending Through Subspecialty Training: The Relationship Between ACGME Internal Medicine Residency Milestones and Subsequent Pulmonary and Critical Care Fellowship Milestones.,"Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) milestones were implemented across medical subspecialties in 2015. Although milestones were proposed as a longitudinal assessment tool potentially providing opportunities for early implementation of individualized fellowship learning plans, the association of subspecialty fellowship ratings with prior residency ratings remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the relationship between internal medicine (IM) residency milestones and pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM) fellowship milestones. A multicenter retrospective cohort analysis was conducted for all PCCM trainees in ACGME-accredited PCCM fellowship programs, 2017-2018, who had complete prior IM milestone ratings from 2014 to 2017. Only professionalism and interpersonal and communication skills (ICS) were included based on shared anchors between IM and PCCM milestones. Using a generalized estimating equations model, the association of PCCM milestones ≤ 2.5 during the first fellowship year with corresponding IM subcompetencies was assessed at each time point, nested by program. Statistical significance was determined using logistic regression. The study included 354 unique PCCM fellows. For ICS and professionalism subcompetencies, fellows with higher IM ratings were less likely to obtain PCCM ratings ≤ 2.5 during the first fellowship year. Each ICS subcompetency was significantly associated with future lapses in fellowship (ICS01: β = -0.67, P = .003; ICS02: β = -0.70, P = .001; ICS03: β = -0.60, P = .004) at various residency time points. Similar associations were noted for PROF03 (β = -0.57, P = .007). Findings demonstrated an association between IM milestone ratings and low milestone ratings during PCCM fellowship. IM trainees with low ratings in several professionalism and ICS subcompetencies were more likely to be rated ≤ 2.5 during the first PCCM fellowship year. This highlights a potential use of longitudinal milestones to target educational gaps at the beginning of PCCM fellowship.",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2021-Nov,"Heath JK, Wang T, Santhosh L, Denson JL, Holmboe E, Yamazaki K, Clay AS, Carlos WG",8,2047,pulmonology,2025-11-22

We designed a survey to explore whether the participants of our courses implement MT at their hospital after attending the course as no real-life data exist. We distributed by e-mail a questionnaire to the participants of the courses. The questionnaire included general information about the participants, the precourse experience on MT, the postcourse implementation of the technique, and the reasons for failure. Responses were obtained from 104 of 324 (32.3%) identified emails. Responders were males (76%), seniors (59.7%), respiratory physicians (91.3%), working in a public/university hospital (78.8%), and mostly beginners (65.3%) from 41 countries. Following the course, 58.6% of responders either created or modified a MT program in their workplace. The reasons for not performing MT before the course were as follows: patients' referral to a thoracic surgeon, not enough training, lack of funding, department understaffed, and refusal by the hospital/department. Overall, these reasons were significantly decreased (p = 0.002) after the course. Real-life data of our survey suggest that more than half of the responders have implemented the technique or modified their practice according to the skills they got from the course.",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,2021-,"Froudarakis ME, Anevlavis S, Marquette CH, Astoul P",4,1342,pulmonology,2025-11-22

In much of the discourse about COVID-19 lung disease, the more familiar clinical entity of ARDS has been used as the guiding paradigm. Reflecting on studies in ARDS, particularly that due to influenza, and on data from the SARS-CoV and MERS epidemics, many authorities, including within the discipline of infectious diseases, were initially passionate in their opposition to the use of corticosteroids for lung involvement in COVID-19. The voice of the pulmonology community-the community of lung experts-has continued to be among the quietest in this conversation. Herein we offer our perspective as academic pulmonologists who encountered COVID-19 in its first United States epicenter of New York City. We encourage a conceptual separation between early COVID-19 lung involvement and ARDS. We draw on history with other immune cell-mediated lung diseases, on insights from the SARS-CoV experience, and on frontline observations in an attempt to allay the skepticism towards corticosteroids in COVID-19 lung disease that is likely to persist even as favorable study results emerge.",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2020-Nov,"Macauley P, Martin A, Epelbaum O",3,1200,pulmonology,2025-11-22

This is a single-center case series of lung autotransplantation with ex vivo bench surgery. Five patients underwent lung autotransplantation between September 2014 and October 2018. A common surgical technique was as follows: pneumonectomy was first completed. The intact lobes were then separated ex vivo, flushed using cold ET-Kyoto solution on a back table, and reimplanted. The indications for lung autotransplantation were postpneumonectomy-like syndrome, locally advanced lung cancer, pulmonary artery sarcoma, central lung cancer, and bronchopleural fistula after right upper bronchial sleeve lobectomy. No major post-transplant complications were observed except for mild stenosis of bronchial anastomosis in one case that required bronchial intervention. One patient died of recurrence of pulmonary artery sarcoma 14 months after surgery. The other patients are alive without any recurrence of the native respiratory diseases or symptoms.

Effect sizes were calculated using Cramér's V.<b>Results:</b> A total of 1,216 total narrative evaluations were analyzed, representing 62 faculty members (17 women and 45 men), with analysis continued for the full cohort beyond achieving saturation of themes. Five overarching themes emerged: teaching skills, clinical skills, supervision, interpersonal and communication skills, and leadership skills. Within subthemes, we found no significant gender differences in reference to general teaching skills, learning environment, enthusiasm for teaching, or interpersonal concern. We identified subtheme differences between male and female faculty evaluations in regard to mentions of learner autonomy, clinical learning environment, humor, and motivating the trainee for patient care. Although the mention of constructive criticisms did not differ between genders, constructive criticisms of female faculty were more likely to mention demeanor (<i>P</i> = 0.06).<b>Conclusions:</b> Our data suggest minimal thematic differences in trainee narrative evaluations of male and female pulmonary and critical care medicine faculty.

33325455,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - diagnosis and management of stable disease; a personalized approach to care, using the treatable traits concept based on clinical phenotypes. Position paper of the Czech Pneumological and Phthisiological Society.","This position paper has been drafted by experts from the Czech national board of diseases with bronchial obstruction, of the Czech Pneumological and Phthisiological Society. The statements and recommendations are based on both the results of randomized controlled trials and data from cross-sectional and prospective real-life studies to ensure they are as close as possible to the context of daily clinical practice and the current health care system of the Czech Republic. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable heterogeneous syndrome with a number of pulmonary and extrapulmonary clinical features and concomitant chronic diseases. The disease is associated with significant mortality, morbidity and reduced quality of life. The main characteristics include persistent respiratory symptoms and only partially reversible airflow obstruction developing due to an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles and gases. Oxidative stress, protease-antiprotease imbalance and increased numbers of pro-inflammatory cells (mainly neutrophils) are the main drivers of primarily non-infectious inflammation in COPD. Besides smoking, household air pollution, occupational exposure, low birth weight, frequent respiratory infections during childhood and also genetic factors are important risk factors of COPD development. Progressive airflow limitation and airway remodelling leads to air trapping, static and dynamic hyperinflation, gas exchange abnormalities and decreased exercise capacity. Various features of the disease are expressed unequally in individual patients, resulting in various types of disease presentation, emerging as the ""clinical phenotypes"" (for specific clinical characteristics) and ""treatable traits"" (for treatable characteristics) concept. The estimated prevalence of COPD in Czechia is around 6.7% with 3,200-3,500 deaths reported annually. The elementary requirements for diagnosis of COPD are spirometric confirmation of post-bronchodilator airflow obstruction (post-BD FEV<sub>1</sub>/VCmax <70%) and respiratory symptoms assessement (dyspnoea, exercise limitation, cough and/or sputum production. In order to establish definite COPD diagnosis, a five-step evaluation should be performed, including: 1/ inhalation risk assessment, 2/ symptoms evaluation, 3/ lung function tests, 4/ laboratory tests and 5/ imaging. At the same time, all alternative diagnoses should be excluded. For disease classification, this position paper uses both GOLD stages (1 to 4), GOLD groups (A to D) and evaluation of clinical phenotype(s). Prognosis assessment should be done in each patient. For this purpose, we recommend the use of the BODE or the CADOT index. Six elementary clinical phenotypes are recognized, including chronic bronchitis, frequent exacerbator, emphysematous, asthma/COPD overlap (ACO), bronchiectases with COPD overlap (BCO) and pulmonary cachexia. In our concept, all of these clinical phenotypes are also considered independent treatable traits. For each treatable trait, specific pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies are defined in this document. The coincidence of two or more clinical phenotypes (i.e., treatable traits) may occur in a single individual, giving the opportunity of fully individualized, phenotype-specific treatment. Treatment of COPD should reflect the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease and be tailored to individual patients. Major goals of COPD treatment are symptom reduction and decreased exacerbation risk. Treatment strategy is divided into five strata: risk elimination, basic treatment, phenotype-specific treatment, treatment of respiratory failure and palliative care, and treatment of comorbidities. Risk elimination includes interventions against tobacco smoking and environmental/occupational exposures. Basic treatment is based on bronchodilator therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, vaccination, care for appropriate nutrition, inhalation training, education and psychosocial support. Adequate phenotype-specific treatment varies phenotype by phenotype, including more than ten different pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies. If more than one clinical phenotype is present, treatment strategy should follow the expression of each phenotypic label separately. In such patients, multicomponental therapeutic regimens are needed, resulting in fully individualized care. In the future, stronger measures against smoking, improvements in occupational and environmental health, early diagnosis strategies, as well as biomarker identification for patients responsive to specific treatments are warranted. New classes of treatment (inhaled PDE3/4 inhibitors, single molecule dual bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory drugs, gene editing molecules or new bronchoscopic procedures) are expected to enter the clinical practice in a very few years.","Biomedical papers of the Medical Faculty of the University Palacky, Olomouc, Czechoslovakia",2020-Dec,"Zatloukal J, Brat K, Neumannova K, Volakova E, Hejduk K, Kocova E, Kudela O, Kopecky M, Plutinsky M, Koblizek V",10,4891,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Asthma is a common airway disease, particularly diagnosed in children, often treated with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators. Due to the disease's tendency for exacerbations and consequently, when severe will require unscheduled health care utilisation including hospital admissions, considerable research has been done into the effects of medication adherence on asthma control.

The daily case rate is now declining in many states and there is a need for guidance about the resumption of elective clinical services for patients with lung disease or sleep conditions.<b>Methods:</b> Volunteers were solicited from the Association of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Division Directors and American Thoracic Society. Working groups developed plans by discussion and consensus for resuming elective services in pulmonary and sleep-medicine clinics, pulmonary function testing laboratories, bronchoscopy and procedure suites, polysomnography laboratories, and pulmonary rehabilitation facilities.<b>Results:</b> The community new case rate should be consistently low or have a downward trajectory for at least 14 days before resuming elective clinical services. In addition, institutions should have an operational strategy that consists of patient prioritization, screening, diagnostic testing, physical distancing, infection control, and follow-up surveillance. The goals are to protect patients and staff from exposure to the virus, account for limitations in staff, equipment, and space that are essential for the care of patients with COVID-19, and provide access to care for patients with acute and chronic conditions.<b>Conclusions:</b> Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a dynamic process and, therefore, it is likely that the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community will wax and wane.

A panel of experts was selected according to their clinical curricula and their responses were analyzed. A total of 1,215 physicians completed the survey questionnaire (17.4% response rate). Of these, 188 (15.5%) were COVID-19 experts. Chest computed tomography was the most used method to detect and monitor COVID-19 pneumonia. Most of the experts managed acute respiratory failure with CPAP (56.4%), high flow nasal cannula (18.6%), and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (8%), while an intensivist referral for early intubation was requested in 17% of the cases. Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed as an antiviral in 90% of cases, both as monotherapy (11.7%), and combined with protease inhibitors (43.6%) or azithromycin (36.2%). The experts unanimously prescribed low-molecular-weight heparin to patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and half of them (51.6%) used a dose higher than standard. The respiratory burden in patients who survived the acute phase was estimated as relevant in 28.2% of the cases, modest in 39.4%, and negligible in 9%. In our survey some major topics, such as the role of non-invasive respiratory support and drug treatments, show disagreement between experts, likely reflecting the absence of high-quality evidence studies.

Clinical data of respiratory medicine patients treated in our hospital over the years were collected and 96 patients who met the requirements of the purpose of this study and the sample inclusion criteria were selected as the study subjects from the patients treated between April 2019 and January 2020. According to the care methods received by the patients in our hospital, 48 of them who implemented conventional care were used as the control group, and another 48 patients who were given quality care interventions were used as the observation group. The data were statistically recorded and comparatively analyzed for the indicators such as nursing oxygen index, heart rate, and clinical treatment efficiency of patients in both groups. Compared with the control group, patients in the observation group who received quality nursing intervention had more significant improvement in blood oxygen index and heart rate after nursing care; the clinical treatment efficiency of patients in the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group (95.83% vs. 81.25%).

35987466,Usability of administration devices for oral and respiratory medicines: Views from a UK primary school.,"The correct use of medicine administration devices is pivotal for optimal drug therapy in children. Little is known about end users' perspectives on administration device use. Thus, the aim of this study was to conduct a survey to gain information and opinions from caregivers and children regarding the usability of paediatric medicine administration devices. A survey was conducted at a primary school in the United Kingdom in children aged 10-12 years and their caregivers. It focused on oral and respiratory devices and comprised two identical parts: 1) for the caregivers, 2) for the children with parental consent. Ethics approval (REC4612-016) was obtained. A total of 57 caregiver-child pairs accessed the survey and it was completed by parents only (n = 4), children only (n = 31) or jointly (n = 22). Most participants (65 %) had taken liquid dosage forms (e.g., syrups/suspensions) compared to solid dosage forms (34 %). Oral devices most frequently used were oral syringes (42 %), measuring spoons (22 %), and household spoons (18 %), with parents most frequently demonstrating device use to their children. Respiratory devices were used less frequently, and pressurised metered-dose inhalers with/without spacer (pMDIs) were the most commonly used devices (11/13). Instructions on use were provided by healthcare professionals to both caregivers and children. Generally, oral and respiratory devices were considered easy to use and instructions were clear. However, for both oral and respiratory devices, some suggestions for device improvement were provided by participants. Education/training by healthcare professionals and clear supplier instructions (e.g., pictograms) may be especially effective in ensuring that caregivers and children are able to use administration devices appropriately and receive sufficient information on their correct use.",European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,2022-Sep,"Alessandrini E, Walsh J, Salunke S",3,1865,pulmonology,2025-11-22
38843917,"European Respiratory Society statement on preschool wheezing disorders: updated definitions, knowledge gaps and proposed future research directions.","Since the publication of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) task force reports on the management of preschool wheezing in 2008 and 2014, a large body of evidence has accumulated suggesting that the clinical phenotypes that were proposed (episodic (viral) wheezing and multiple-trigger wheezing) do not relate to underlying airway pathology and may not help determine response to treatment. Specifically, using clinical phenotypes alone may no longer be appropriate, and new approaches that can be used to inform clinical care are needed for future research. This ERS task force reviewed the literature published after 2008 related to preschool wheezing and has suggested that the criteria used to define wheezing disorders in preschool children should include age of diagnosis (0 to <6 years), confirmation of wheezing on at least one occasion, and more than one episode of wheezing ever. Furthermore, diagnosis and management may be improved by identifying treatable traits, including inflammatory biomarkers (blood eosinophils, aeroallergen sensitisation) associated with type-2 immunity and differential response to inhaled corticosteroids, lung function parameters and airway infection. However, more comprehensive use of biomarkers/treatable traits in predicting the response to treatment requires prospective validation. There is evidence that specific genetic traits may help guide management, but these must be adequately tested. In addition, the task force identified an absence of caregiver-reported outcomes, caregiver/self-management options and features that should prompt specialist referral for this age group. Priorities for future research include a focus on identifying 1) mechanisms driving preschool wheezing; 2) biomarkers of treatable traits and efficacy of interventions in those without allergic sensitisation/eosinophilia; 3) the need to include both objective outcomes and caregiver-reported outcomes in clinical trials; 4) the need for a suitable action plan for children with preschool wheezing; and 5) a definition of severe/difficult-to-treat preschool wheezing.",The European respiratory journal,2024-Sep,"Makrinioti H, Fainardi V, Bonnelykke K, Custovic A, Cicutto L, Coleman C, Eiwegger T, Kuehni C, Moeller A, Pedersen E, Pijnenburg M, Pinnock H, Ranganathan S, Tonia T, Subbarao P, Saglani S",16,2096,pulmonology,2025-11-22
32854106,Sleep Breathing Disorders in the COVID-19 Era: Italian Thoracic Society Organizational Models for a Correct Approach to Diagnosis and Treatment.,"The attenuation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, at least in Italy, allows a gradual resumption of diagnostic and therapeutic activities for sleep respiratory disorders. The knowledge on this new disorder is growing fast, but our experience is still limited and when a physician cannot rely on evidence-based medicine, the experience of his peers can support the decision-making and operational process of reopening sleep laboratories. The aim of this paper is to focus on the safety of patients and operators accessing hospitals and the practice of diagnosing and treating sleep-related respiratory disorders. The whole process requires a careful plan, starting with a triage preceding the access to the facility, to minimize the risk of infection. Preparation of the medical record can be performed through standard questionnaires administered over the phone or by e-mail, including an assessment of the COVID-19 risk. The home sleep test should include single-patient sensors or easy-to-sanitize material. The use of nasal cannulas is discouraged in view of the risk of the virus colonizing the internal reading chamber, since no filter has been tested and certified to be used extensively for coronavirus due to its small size. The adaptation to positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment can also be performed mainly using telemedicine procedures. In the adaptation session, the mask should be new or correctly sanitized and the PAP device, without a humidifier, should be protected by an antibacterial/antiviral filter, then sanitized and reassigned after at least 4 days since SARS-CoV-2 was detected on some surfaces up to 72 h after. Identification of pressure should preferably be performed by telemedicine. The patient should be informed of the risk of spreading the disease in the family environment through droplets and how to reduce this risk. The follow-up phase can again be performed mainly by telemedicine both for problem solving and the collection of data. Public access to hospital should be minimized and granted to patients only. Constant monitoring of institutional communications will help in implementing the necessary recommendations.",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,2020-,"Insalaco G, Dal Farra F, Braghiroli A, Salvaggio A",4,2200,pulmonology,2025-11-22
39192524,"Barriers and facilitators to early initiation of palliative care as perceived by nurses working on pneumology and nephrology, a descriptive qualitative study.","Initiation of palliative care early in the disease trajectory is beneficial for patients with a life-limiting disease. However, palliative care is still introduced rather late or not at all. Therefore, this study aims to explore barriers and facilitators to early initiation of palliative care as perceived by nurses working on pneumology and nephrology. A descriptive interview-based study was conducted from a critical realist perspective until data sufficiency was reached. Fifteen nurses presented and discussed a patient for whom palliative care was initiated too late. Template analysis was conducted to develop themes and subthemes. Five key themes were extracted: (1) communication, (2) fear, (3) personal beliefs about life and death, (4) ambiguity in terminology and (5) workload and time pressure. Barriers related to poor interdisciplinary communication were therapeutic obstinance, hierarchy, unawareness of the patient's wishes and fear of saying something inappropriate. Other barriers were patients' religious beliefs which often hindered the use of sedatives or morphine and led to discomfort and time restraints. A palliative support team in hospital and advance care planning (ACP) were enablers for early palliative care. This study started from a negative experience, leading to identification of a lot of barriers and only a few facilitators. The limited sample size and the restriction to two wards within one single hospital limit the diversity of perspectives and the generalisability of the findings. More attention is needed for ACP and interdisciplinary communication. Palliative care, including ACP, and interdisciplinary communication should be included in the basic curricula of all healthcare professional courses. Further research is needed to explore barriers and facilitators to early initiation of palliative care in other healthcare settings and patient populations. This is crucial in order to develop and implement sustainable interventions for specific groups of patients.",Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,2024-Dec,"Paque K, Baudry L, Van Fraeyenhove F, Heyrman B",4,2012,pulmonology,2025-11-22
34183598,Continued Supervision for the Common Pediatric Subspecialty Entrustable Professional Activities May Be Needed Following Fellowship Graduation.,"Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) are one approach to competency-based medical education (CBME), and 7 EPAs have been developed that address content relevant for all pediatric subspecialties. However, it is not known what level of supervision fellowship program directors (FPDs) deem necessary for graduation. The Subspecialty Pediatrics Investigator Network (SPIN) investigated FPD perceptions of the minimum level of supervision required for a trainee to successfully graduate. In 2017, SPIN surveyed all FPDs of accredited fellowships for 14 subspecialties. For each EPA, the minimum supervision level for graduation (ranging from observation only to unsupervised practice) was set such that no more than 20% of FPDs would accept a lower level. The survey response rate was 82% (660/802). The minimum supervision level for graduation varied across the 7 EPAs from 2 (direct) to 4 (indirect for complex cases), with significant differences between EPAs. The percentage of FPDs desiring a lower minimum supervision level ranged from 3% to 17%. Compared with the 4 nonclinical EPAs (quality improvement, management, lead within the profession, scholarship), the 3 clinical EPAs (consultation, handover, lead a team) had higher minimum supervision graduation levels (P < .001), with less likelihood that an FPD would graduate a learner below their minimum level (P < .001). Consensus among FPDs across all pediatric subspecialties demonstrates the potential need for ongoing supervision for graduates in all 7 common pediatric subspecialty EPAs after fellowship.

37567792,Clinical Practice Guideline of Spanish Society of Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR) on Pharmacological Treatment of Tobacco Dependence 2023.,"There are multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments against nicotine dependence. However, there are few guidelines to answer frequent questions asked by a clinician treating a smoker. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to facilitate the treatment of tobacco addiction. 12 PICO questions are formulated from a GLOBAL PICO question: ""Efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatment of tobacco dependence"". A systematic review was carried out to answer each of the questions and recommendations were made. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system was used to grade the certainty of the estimated effects and the strength of the recommendations. Varenicline, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion and cytisine are more effective than placebo. Varenicline and combined nicotine therapy are superior to the other therapies. In smokers with high dependence, a combination of drugs is recommended, being more effective those associations containing varenicline. Other optimization strategies with lower efficacy consist of increasing the doses, the duration, or retreat with varenicline. In specific populations varenicline or NRT is recommended. In hospitalized, the treatment of choice is NRT. In pregnancy it is indicated to prioritize behavioral treatment. The financing of smoking cessation treatments increases the number of smokers who quit smoking. There is no scientific evidence of the efficacy of pharmacological treatment of smoking cessation in adolescents. The answers to the 12 questions allow us to extract recommendations and algorithms for the pharmacological treatment of tobacco dependence.",Archivos de bronconeumologia,2023-Oct,"Rábade-Castedo C, de Granda-Orive JI, Riesco-Miranda JA, De Higes-Martínez E, Ramos-Pinedo Á, Cabrera-César E, Signes-Costa Miñana J, García Rueda M, Pastor-Esplá E, Jiménez-Ruiz CA",10,1718,pulmonology,2025-11-22
32299079,Consensus-Based Care Recommendations for Pulmonologists Treating Adults with Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1.,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a severe, progressive genetic disease that affects approximately 1 in 2,500 individuals globally [Ashizawa et al.: Neurol Clin Pract 2018;8(6):507-20]. In patients with DM1, respiratory muscle weakness frequently evolves, leading to respiratory failure as the main cause of death in this patient population, followed by cardiac complications [de Die-Smulders et al.: Brain 1998;121(Pt 8):1557-63], [Mathieu et al.: Neurology 1999;52(8):1658-62], [Groh et al.: Muscle Nerve 2011;43(5):648-51]. This paper provides a more detailed outline on the diagnostic and management protocols, which can guide pulmonologists who may not have experience with DM1 or who are not part of a neuromuscular multidisciplinary clinic. A group of neuromuscular experts in DM1 including pulmonologists, respiratory physiotherapists and sleep specialists discussed respiratory testing and management at baseline and during follow-up visits, based on their clinical experience with patients with DM1. The details are presented in this report. Myotonic recruited 66 international clinicians experienced in the treatment of people living with DM1 to develop and publish consensus-based care recommendations targeting all body systems affected by this disease [Ashizawa et al.: Neurol Clin Pract. 2018;8(6):507-20]. Myotonic then worked with 12 international respiratory therapists, pulmonologists and neurologists with long-standing experience in DM respiratory care to develop consensus-based care recommendations for pulmonologists using a methodology called the Single Text Procedure. This process generated a 7-page document that provides detailed respiratory care recommendations for the management of patients living with DM1. This consensus is completely based on expert opinion and not backed up by empirical evidence due to limited clinical care data available for respiratory care management in DM patients. Nevertheless, we believe it is of relevance for professionals treating adults with myotonic dystrophy because it addresses practical issues related to respiratory management and care, which have been adapted to meet the specific issues in patients with DM1. The resulting recommendations are intended to improve respiratory care for the most vulnerable of DM1 patients and lower the risk of untoward respiratory complications and mortality by providing pulmonologist who are less experienced with DM1 with practical indications on which tests and when to perform them, adapting the general respiratory knowledge to specific issues related to this multiorgan disease.",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,2020-,"Boentert M, Cao M, Mass D, De Mattia E, Falcier E, Goncalves M, Holland V, Katz SL, Orlikowski D, Sannicolò G, Wijkstra P, Hellerstein L, Sansone VA",13,2592,pulmonology,2025-11-22
39055327,Impact of Ambulatory Blocks on Pulmonary Critical Care Fellow Outpatient Training Experience.,"The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (PCCM) fellows spend a minimum of 7% of their time in the outpatient setting over 3 years of training. In a multi-institutional survey, only 47% of PCCM fellows rated their ambulatory training as adequate. Internal medicine residencies previously adopted the ""x + y"" scheduling model, which separates inpatient (""x"") and outpatient (""y"") rotations to provide focused ambulatory experiences, to address similar concerns. To observe the effects of dedicated ambulatory blocks at a single academic PCCM fellowship on fellow exposure to outpatient pulmonary medicine, and on fellow and faculty perceptions of education. In the 2021-2022 academic year, PCCM fellows of all class years in a single academic fellowship program in the northeast United States rotated through four 2-week ambulatory blocks that included longitudinal clinics, themed subspecialty clinics, and a dedicated educational half-day for small group learning. Before the intervention, fellow ambulatory clinics were scheduled longitudinally one-half day per week during inpatient and research blocks. Both fellows and faculty were surveyed before and after the intervention; fellows were also interviewed via focus groups at the conclusion of the intervention. The degree of subspecialty clinic exposure was compared before and after intervention. There was an increase in the quantity and variety of pulmonary subspecialty clinics per fellow when compared with preintervention years (<i>P</i> < 0.01). After intervention, we observed increased fellow satisfaction with ambulatory education, perceived preparedness for independent practice, and satisfaction with subspecialty clinic exposure (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Faculty satisfaction with fellow ambulatory pulmonary education also increased (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Thematic analysis from focus groups highlighted focused topical learning, exposure to the breadth of pulmonary medicine, career development, interaction with engaged faculty experts, and enhanced interprofessional competence. The ambulatory block structure provides a potential model to expand PCCM fellow outpatient pulmonary training through increased exposure to ambulatory pulmonology and dedicated ambulatory teaching. Important features of the ambulatory block structure include separation of outpatient clinics from competing responsibilities, expansion of fellow pulmonary exposure, opportunities for deliberate practice, and faculty engagement in fellow education.",ATS scholar,2024-Jun,"McAvoy KA, Gielissen KA, Possick JD, Honiden S",4,2550,pulmonology,2025-11-22

In this report, we discuss a case of a patient with HSS. A 30-year-old male patient was admitted to the pulmonary medicine ward for hemoptysis. After evaluation with chest CT, bilateral pulmonary embolism and pulmonary aneurysms were observed. Due to a history of aphthous lesions, Behçet's disease (BD) was considered the initial diagnosis; however, the patient did not fit the criteria and was later diagnosed with HSS. Intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated, along with a maintenance treatment with cyclophosphamide. Treatment response was observed in the fourth month; however, due to the persistence of hemoptysis, additional cycles of cyclophosphamide were later required, under which the patient's condition has been stable.

This review synthesizes current research on the application of XAI in analyzing vocal biomarkers for lung diseases, highlighting how these techniques elucidate the connections between specific vocal features and lung pathology. We critically examine the methodologies employed, the types of lung diseases studied, and the performance of various XAI models. The potential for XAI to aid in early detection, monitor disease progression, and personalize treatment strategies in pulmonary medicine is emphasized. Furthermore, this review identifies current challenges, including data heterogeneity and model generalizability, and proposes future directions for research.

The aim of our qualitative study is to understand the patient perception of video consultations in telemedicine, which has been used by a single pulmonologist in only one university hospital in Turkey since the first three months of the pandemic. Research findings are essential when it comes to a more effective and widespread future use of telemedicine, as it focuses on patient experience about a medical technology that is newly introduced. Totally 30 patients were randomly chosen and interviewed who get healthcare support via telemedicine. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to learn the experiences and opinions of the interviewees. The expressions of the patients highlight some advantages of using telemedicine such as being free from risk of contagion caused by exposure in the hospital, being able to save time and money while reaching to the physician online whenever needed, and success in technical details even though they were experiencing it for the first time. A very few of the patients are feeling discomfort to be in front of the screen. Almost all patients are applicants to suggest to other individuals the system they used, in conditions to be appropriate, and continuity after the pandemic period. Since the pandemic has propagated from one patient, the worldwide implementation of telemedicine might be catalyzed by following in the footsteps of the sporadic examples of decisiveness nourished from patient experiences.","Bulletin of science, technology & society",2022-Jun,"Altinisik Ergur G, Nuhoglu S, Cobanoglu C, Sengul M, Eryildiz N, Ergur A",6,1612,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Choking has been considered the major symptom and is defined as airway blockage by a foreign body (FB), leading to marked morbidity or mortality. This retrospective study indicates the possibility of misdiagnosis or rigid bronchoscope (RB) failure, which is the standard gold method for extracting FB in the airway. Six children with airway FBA who failed treatment using RB between 2018 and 2019 were retrospectively studied. The inclusion criterion was a history of failure to extract FB using RB followed by flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FFB). In the present study, among 63 patients who had undergone rigid bronchoscopy, airway FBs were successfully removed in 57 (90.48%). Rigid bronchoscopy failed in 6 (9.52%) patients. The age of cases at the time of bronchoscopy ranged from 11 months to 13 years. FFB was performed to extract missing or remaining FBs and was done successfully in all patients. The patients made an uneventful recovery following FB extraction using the FFB method. It is not easy to diagnose and treat airway FB in children.

39503155,Respiratory manifestations of pediatric granulomatosis with polyangiitis: A 12-year experience from a tertiary care facility.,"Pediatric granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is associated with several pulmonary manifestations. This study aims to describe these manifestations at time of diagnosis and longitudinally at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital. We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with GPA treated at our facility between 1 January 2010 through 31 December 2021. We collected baseline demographics, reported symptoms, imaging findings, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and laboratory data at time of diagnosis. Data were collected using 6-month observation intervals to follow recurrence of respiratory manifestations, testing during recurrence, and resultant treatment modifications. Of 13 patients treated for GPA during the study period, 12 developed respiratory tract involvement. A total of 87 6-month observation periods were analyzed. At time of diagnosis, 83% (10/12) of subjects reported respiratory symptoms, 92% (11/12) had abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) imaging, and 42% (5/12) had abnormal PFTs. Fewer than half of the patients were seen by pulmonology within 6 months of diagnosis. Eight subjects (75%) had respiratory manifestations during subsequent observation periods. Chest CT or PFTs were obtained in 23/44 (52%) of observations periods with respiratory symptoms, with pulmonary consultation in only 9/44 (20%). This is the first US study to describe respiratory manifestations in pediatric GPA patients longitudinally, finding they are common and frequently recurrent. Our cohort had almost universally abnormal imaging at diagnosis regardless of respiratory symptoms. Early collaboration with pediatric pulmonology in the care of GPA patients may allow rheumatology teams to efficiently evaluate recurrent symptoms and address concomitant lung disease.",Pediatric pulmonology,2025-Jan,"Sridhar S, Akoghlanian S, Krivchenia K",3,1786,pulmonology,2025-11-22
37239108,Lymphocyte Subsets and Pulmonary Nodules to Predict the Progression of Sarcoidosis.,"The search for biological markers, which allow a relatively accurate assessment of the individual course of pulmonary sarcoidosis at the time of diagnosis, remains one of the research priorities in this field of pulmonary medicine. The aim of our study was to investigate possible prognostic factors for pulmonary sarcoidosis with a special focus on cellular immune inflammation markers. A 2-year follow-up of the study population after the initial prospective and simultaneous analysis of lymphocyte activation markers expression in the blood, as well as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung biopsy tissue of patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary sarcoidosis, was performed. We found that some blood and BAL fluid immunological markers and lung computed tomography (CT) patterns have been associated with a different course of sarcoidosis. We revealed five markers that had a significant negative association with the course of sarcoidosis (worsening pulmonary function tests and/or the chest CT changes)-blood CD4+CD31+ and CD4+CD44+ T lymphocytes, BALF CD8+CD31+ and CD8+CD103+ T lymphocytes and a number of lung nodules on chest CT at the time of the diagnosis. Cut-off values, sensitivity, specificity and odds ratio for predictors of sarcoidosis progression were calculated.

33288469,Diagnostic accuracy of TB-LAMP assay in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis...a case-control study in northern India.,"A tertiary care hospital in North India. Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health problem in developing countries. The diagnosis of tuberculosis is still challenging in primary care settings in endemic countries like India. WHO has endorsed loop mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP) for TB as a replacement for smear microscopy for peripheral settings, however, more data is required to establish the specificity of this modality for the diagnosis of TB. In this study we aim to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the TB-LAMP assay in pulmonary tuberculosis. A total of 236 patients (117 cases suspected of TB and 119 patients with non-TB pulmonary disease) were enrolled between February to July, 2018. Microbiological workups consisting of mycobacterial smear microscopy, culture, Xpert MTB/Rif and TB-LAMP were performed. From 236 samples, 18 (7.6%) were excluded from the study. TB-LAMP and Xpert MTB/RIF were positive in 46 (21.1%) and 49 (22.5%) of the samples, respectively. The sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF and TB-LAMP, when culture was taken as a reference standard, was 90% (95%CI: 78.2-96.7) and 82% (95%CI: 68.6...91.4), respectively. The specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of TB-LAMP assay were 96.8% (95%CI: 92.8...98.9), 89.1% (95%CI: 77.4...95.2), and 94.4% (95%CI: 90.4...96.5), respectively.

31593955,Advances in Optical Coherence Tomography and Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy in Pulmonary Diseases.,"Diagnosing and monitoring pulmonary diseases is highly dependent on imaging, physiological function tests and tissue sampling. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) are novel imaging techniques with near-microscopic resolution that can be easily and safely combined with conventional bronchoscopy. Disease-related pulmonary anatomical compartments can be visualized, real time, using these techniques. In obstructive lung diseases, airway wall layers and related structural remodelling can be identified and quantified. In malignant lung disease, normal and malignant areas of the central airways, lung parenchyma, lymph nodes and pleura can be discriminated. A growing number of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) have been visualized using OCT or CLE. Several ILD-associated structural changes can be imaged: fibrosis, cellular infiltration, bronchi(ol)ectasis, cysts and microscopic honeycombing. Although not yet implemented in clinical practice, OCT and CLE have the potential to improve detection and monitoring pulmonary diseases and can contribute in unravelling the pathophysiology of disease and mechanism of action of novel treatments. Indeed, assessment of the airway wall layers with OCT might be helpful when evaluating treatments targeting airway remodelling. By visualizing individual malignant cells, CLE has the potential as a real-time lung cancer detection tool. In the future, both techniques could be combined with laser-enhanced fluorescent-labelled tracer detection. This review discusses the value of OCT and CLE in pulmonary medicine by summarizing the current evidence and elaborating on future perspectives.",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,2020-,"Goorsenberg A, Kalverda KA, Annema J, Bonta P",4,1671,pulmonology,2025-11-22

The ideal moment for detection with chest X-ray or ultrasound has not yet been defined. Earlier studies demonstrated the utility of performing these tests with a certain delay, which always results in a potentially dangerous gap. We prospectively enrolled patients with pulmonary interventions at increased risk of pneumothorax. Thoracic ultrasound was performed immediately after the intervention and at the moment of chest X-ray with a delay up to two hours. Overall, we detected four pneumothoraxes in 115 procedures. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were 75%, 100%, 100%, 99%, 99% for ultrasound and 75%, 90%, 21%, 99% und 89% for chest X-ray respectively. All pneumothoraces requiring chest tube were sufficiently detected by both methods. Thoracic ultrasound when performed immediately can more accurately exclude pneumothorax after interventional bronchoscopy when compared to chest X-ray.

During pregnancy, women with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome are at risk for hypoventilation and require frequent assessments of oxygenation and ventilation during wakefulness and sleep on their ventilator. This could potentially lead to adjustments in the ventilator settings or a change in the assisted ventilation modality. We report the case of a 31-year-old pregnant woman with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and an implanted cardiac pacemaker who underwent prenatal genetic testing for congenital central hypoventilation syndrome and who delivered a healthy newborn by cesarean delivery. She received collaborative multidisciplinary care from a team that included specialists in obstetrics, maternal and fetal medicine, medical genetics, sleep and pulmonary medicine, cardiology, and anesthesiology.

The response rate was 52.1%. Allergology departments of dermatology, ENT and pulmonology were predominantly located in metropolitan areas (> 100,000 inhabitants), whereas responses of pediatric departments were mostly from smaller towns. 76.8% of the respondents reported existing interdisciplinary treatment plans with other specialties. Pediatric and pulmonology clinics stated disproportionately few interdisciplinary treatment concepts with dermatology and ENT clinics, especially in smaller cities with < 100,000 inhabitants. Diagnosis and therapy of allergic rhinitis were performed in particular by the departments of ENT, asthma mainly by the pulmonology departments. Care of other allergological diseases was most frequently reported by chief physicians of dermatology and pediatrics. In metropolitan areas, participating departments provide allergology care in a cooperative manner. A large spectrum of care is covered in cooperation with dermatological clinics. In more rural areas, cooperation is rarer; here, mainly pediatric departments provide allergological care, which may explain the more limited range of services compared to metropolitan areas.",Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft = Journal of the German Society of Dermatology : JDDG,2023-Sep,"Hollstein MM, Schober A, Treudler R, Becker S, Epping J, Hamelmann E, Taube C, Wagenmann M, Wedi B, Worm M, Zink A, Buhl T, Werfel T, Traidl S",14,1664,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Lower prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among children, in addition to higher numbers of mild and asymptomatic cases, continues to provide challenges in determining appropriate prevention and treatment courses. Here, we summarize the current evidence on the transmission, clinical presentation, complications and risk factors in regard to SARS-CoV-2 in children, and highlight crucial gaps in knowledge going forward. Based on current evidence, children are rarely the primary source of secondary transmission in the household or in child care and school settings and are more likely to contract the virus from an adult household member. Higher transmission rates are observed in older children (10-19 years old) compared with younger children ( <10 years old). While increasing incidence of COVID-19 in neonates raises the suspicion of vertical transmission, it is unlikely that breast milk is a vehicle for transmission from mother to infant. The vast majority of clinical cases of COVID-19 in children are mild, but there are rare cases that have developed complications such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, which often presents with severe cardiac symptoms requiring intensive care. Childhood obesity is associated with a higher risk of infection and a more severe clinical presentation.

The present bench study aimed to compare the performance of a new single-use bronchoscope (Boston Scientific EXALT Model B) to a marketed single-use comparator (Ambu aScope 4), each in slim, regular and large diameters. Three bronchoscopy tasks were performed: water suction and visualization, ""mucus"" mass (synthetic mucoid mixture) suctioned in 30 s, and ""mucus"" plug (thicker mucoid mixture) suction. Suction ability, task completion times, and subjective ratings of visualization and overall performance on a scale of one to 10 (best) were compared. All bronchoscopy tasks were completed by 15 physicians representing diversity in specialization including pulmonary, interventional pulmonary, critical care, anesthesia, and thoracic surgery.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability, measurement error and construct validity of the 6MWT and identify determinants of 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) in patients with asthma. 201 asthma patients referred for pre-pulmonary rehabilitation assessment, were retrospectively analyzed (age 61±12 years, 42% male, FEV<sub>1</sub> 78±27% predicted). Patients performed two 6MWTs on subsequent days using a 30 m straight walking course. Other measurements included resting dyspnea, maximal exercise capacity, body composition, pulmonary function, pulmonary and quadriceps muscle strength and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Measurement error (absolute reliability) was tested using standard error of measurement (SEM), minimal detectable change at 95% confidence interval (MDC95%) and Bland and Altman 95% limits of agreement, whereas test-retest reliability (relative reliability) and construct validity were assessed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC<sub>2,1</sub>) and correlations, respectively. The 6MWD showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC<sub>2,1</sub>: 0.91). The mean change in 6MWD after the second 6MWT was 18m (95%CI 11-24m), with 73% of the patients walking further in the second test. The SEM and MDC95% for the 6MWT were 35 m and 98 m, respectively. The best 6MWD correlated strongly with peak oxygen uptake during CPET and resting dyspnea (r = 0.61-0.64) and had no-to-moderate correlations with body composition, pulmonary function, respiratory and quadriceps muscle strength and symptoms of anxiety and depression (r = 0.02-0.45).

The majority were pulmonologists, and most had started performing thoracoscopy within the last 5 years. Rigid thoracoscope was the most commonly used instrument. The common indications of procedure included undiagnosed pleural effusion, talc pleurodesis, and adhesiolysis. Local anesthesia with conscious sedation was the preferred anesthetic modality. Midazolam, along with fentanyl, was the most widely used sedation combination. 2% lignocaine was the most commonly used concentration for local infiltrative anesthesia. Nearly two-thirds of the respondents reported having encountered any complication of thoracoscopy. Significant reported complications included empyema, incision/port-site infection, re-expansion pulmonary edema, and procedure-related mortality. MT is a rapidly evolving interventional pulmonology procedure in India. There is, however, a significant variation in practice and variable adherence to available international guidelines on thoracoscopy. Formal training programs within India and national guidelines for pleuroscopy considering the local resources are required to improve the safety and yield of this useful modality.",Lung India : official organ of Indian Chest Society,2021-,"Madan K, Tiwari P, Thankgakunam B, Mittal S, Hadda V, Mohan A, Guleria R",7,1609,pulmonology,2025-11-22

We aimed to characterize and assess the diagnostic yield of EBUS and virtual CT navigation guided biopsies in children. This single center, retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent radial or linear EBUS procedures (+/- CT navigation) for biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes, tumors, and pulmonary nodules. Demographic, procedural, and outcome were collected. Sixty procedures were performed in 56 patients aged 2-22 years of age between January 2015 and May 2023. The most common indications for biopsy were pulmonary nodules (45%) and hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy (33%). For cases in which a final diagnosis was ascertained by any means, the diagnostic yield for linear EBUS (mediastinal pathology) was 76% and the diagnostic yield from radial EBUS (pulmonary nodules and lung masses) was 85%. The most common diagnoses were infection (45%), malignancy (17%), and sarcoidosis (11%). Among patients in whom infection was the final diagnosis, a total of 31 pathogens were identified. Eighteen were identified on bronchoalveolar lavage and an additional 14 pathogens identified on EBUS-TBB, representing an increase of 77% (p < .005). The sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values for malignancy detection were 73%, 100%, 94%, and 100%, respectively.

38570594,Long-term pulmonary outcomes in BPD throughout the life-course.,"Respiratory disease is one of the most common complications of preterm birth. Survivors of prematurity have increased risks of morbidities and mortalities independent of prematurity, and frequently require multiple medications, home respiratory support, and subspecialty care to maintain health. Although advances in neonatal and pulmonary care have improved overall survival, earlier gestational age, lower birth weight, chorioamnionitis and late onset sepsis continue to be major factors in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. These early life events associated with prematurity can have respiratory consequences that persist into adulthood. Furthermore, after initial hospital discharge, air pollution, respiratory tract infections and socioeconomic status may modify lung growth trajectories and influence respiratory outcomes in later life. Given that the incidence of respiratory disease associated with prematurity remains stable or increased, there is a need for pediatric and adult providers to be familiar with the natural history, manifestations, and common complications of disease.",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,2024-Apr,"Collaco JM, Eldredge LC, McGrath-Morrow SA",3,1105,pulmonology,2025-11-22
31587528,Impact of early caffeine therapy in preterm newborns on infant lung function.,"To know the effect of caffeine therapy on infant lung function in preterm infants with a gestational age less than 31 weeks. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at 0.5 seconds (FEV<sub>0.5</sub> ), and forced expiratory flows were measured by raised volume rapid thoracoabdominal compression technique; functional residual capacity was measured by plethysmography (FRC<sub>pleth</sub> ). Compliance of the respiratory system was measured by a single interruption technique (Crs). The Student t test was used to compare lung function measurements between the two groups: treated versus nontreated with caffeine. A multivariate analysis was carried out considering each and every lung function parameter (z-score) as the dependent variable; and gender, gestational age, birth weight (z-score), corrected age, invasive mechanical ventilation (yes/no), and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) diagnosis (yes/no) as independent ones. Additionally, stratified analyses by BPD diagnosis were performed. The multivariate analysis showed significant higher z-scores of FVC and FEV<sub>0.5</sub> in preterm infants treated with caffeine (P = .004 and P = .024, respectively). This result only being significant in the group of non-BPD infants (P = .021 and P = .042), after stratifying by BPD diagnosis. Differences were not found in z-scores of FEV0.5/FVC, FEF75, FEF25-75, FRCpleth, nor Crs. Lung function (FVC and FEV<sub>0.5</sub> ) is improved in infants born under 31 weeks of gestation when treated with caffeine. This improvement is driven by the group of infants who did not suffer from BPD.

It has spread from Wuhan, China, in December 2019 to a large number of countries within three months. The objective of this work is to report the initial experience with epidemiologic and clinical features, as well as with the management of COVID-19 patients in India. This is a descriptive case series of the first 21 COVID-19 infected patients confirmed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and admitted to a tertiary care centre in India from 01.02.2020 to 19.03.2020. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data were collected, including age, sex, nationality, travel history, symptoms, duration of stay, and comorbidities. The mean age of the population was 40.3 years with a male preponderance. Thirteen (62%) patients had recent travel history outside India in the previous 30 days, two thirds of whom had travelled to Italy. The most common symptoms were fever and cough (42.9%) followed by sore throat, headache and breathlessness. Vital and laboratory parameters were preserved in all patients and none of them required ventilatory support. Among the first 21 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in India, the typical clinical presentation consisted in a mild upper respiratory tract infection predominantly affecting the young male population. One patient required supplemental oxygen. All patients recovered with no residual symptoms.   *The Safdarjung Hospital COVID 2019 working group: Nitesh Gupta, Sumita Agrawal, Pranav Ish, Suruchi Mishra, Rajni Gaind, Ganapathy Usha, Balvinder Singh, Manas Kamal Sen, Shibdas Chakrabarti (Consultant and Head, Pulmonary Medicine); NK Gupta (Professor, Pulmonary medicine); Dipak Bhattacharya (Consultant, Pulmonary medicine); Rohit Kumar (Assistant Professor, Pulmonary Medicine); Siddharth R.

We aimed to assess the role of telomere length (TL) in fibrotic-Interstitial Lung Diseases (f-ILDs) associated with a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern as well as in IPF acute exacerbation (IPF-AE). TL was measured from peripheral white blood cells using a multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction in consecutive patients with f-ILDs, all presenting UIP pattern in the high-resolution chest-computed-tomography and compared to age-matched healthy controls. Seventy-nine individuals were included (mean age 69.77 ± 0.72 years); 24 stable IPF, 18 IPF-AE, 10 combined pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, 7 Rheumatoid arthritis-UIP-ILDs and 20 controls. TL in all patients was significantly shorter compared to controls [mean T/S ratio (SE) 0.77 (±0.05) vs 2.26 (±0.36), p < 0.001] as well as separately in each one of f-ILD subgroups. IPF-AE patients presented significantly shorter TL compared to stable IPF (p = 0.029). Patients with IPF and shorter than the median TL (0-0.72) showed reduced overall survival (p = 0.004). T/S < 0.72 was associated with increased risk for IPF-AE (OR = 30.787, 95% CI: 2.153, 440.183, p = 0.012) independent of age, gender, smoking and lung function impairment. A protective effect of TL was observed, as it was inversely associated with risk of death both in UIP-f-ILDs (HR = 0.174, 95%CI: 0.036, 0.846, p = 0.030) and IPF patients (HR = 0.096, 95%CI: 0.011, 0.849, p = 0.035). Shorter TL characterizes different UIP f-ILDs. Although no difference was observed in TL among diverse UIP subgroups, IPF-AE presented shorter TL compared to stable IPF.

38704309,"Issue 3-The occupational burden of respiratory diseases, an update.","Workplace exposures are widely known to cause specific occupational diseases such as silicosis and asbestosis, but they also can contribute substantially to causation of common respiratory diseases. In 2019, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) published a joint statement on the occupational burden of respiratory diseases. Our aim on this narrative review is to summarise the most recent evidence published after the ATS/ERS statement as well as to provide information on traditional occupational lung diseases that can be useful for clinicians and researchers. Newer publications confirm the findings of the ATS/ERS statement on the role of workplace exposure in contributing to the aetiology of the respiratory diseases considered in this review (asthma, COPD, chronic bronchitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, infectious pneumonia). Except for COPD, chronic bronchitis and infectious pneumonia, the number of publications in the last 5 years for the other diseases is limited. For traditional occupational lung diseases such as silicosis and asbestosis, there are old as well as novel sources of exposure and their burden continues to be relevant, especially in developing countries. Occupational exposure remains an important risk factor for airways and interstitial lung diseases, causing occupational lung diseases and contributing substantially in the aetiology of common respiratory diseases. This information is critical for public health professionals formulating effective preventive strategies but also for clinicians in patient care.

Allelic variations of enzymes involved in dopamine metabolism are being considered as candidates for nicotine addiction. We set out to assess whether rs4680 G/A and rs2235186 G/A polymorphisms of COMT and MAO-A, respectively are associated with the ability to quit smoking in chronic inflammatory pulmonary disease patients. Patients managed for chronic inflammatory pulmonary disease by the Department of Pulmonology (University of Debrecen, Hungary), with a current or past smoking habit were included in the current analysis. The study was designed in line with the STROBE statement for cross-sectional studies and was approved by the National Center for Public Health, Hungary. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood specimens. SNPs were genotyped using TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. rs4680 COMT polymorphism showed significant effect for successful smoking cessation in patients with pulmonary disease. Accordingly, A/A subjects had lower odds for successful smoking cessation (odds ratio 0.37; 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.69, p = 0.002 (additive model). On the other hand, patients homozygous for the minor allele (A) at rs2235186 of MAO-A showed a non-significant trend toward increased odds for successful smoking cessation. The presence of the minor allele for rs4680 COMT was shown to decrease the odds for successful smoking cessation, a finding that may be interpreted in view of the altered balance between tonic and phasic dopamine release.",BMC pulmonary medicine,2024-Aug,"Mikaczo A, Papp C, Erdei T, Posa A, Zahuczky G, Varga C, Szabo J, Gesztelyi R, Szilasi M, Zsuga J",10,1641,pulmonology,2025-11-22
34520400,Dysregulated overexpression of Sox9 induces fibroblast activation in pulmonary fibrosis.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal fibrotic lung disease associated with unremitting fibroblast activation including fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transformation (FMT), migration, resistance to apoptotic clearance, and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the distal lung parenchyma. Aberrant activation of lung-developmental pathways is associated with severe fibrotic lung disease; however, the mechanisms through which these pathways activate fibroblasts in IPF remain unclear. Sry-box transcription factor 9 (Sox9) is a member of the high-mobility group box family of DNA-binding transcription factors that are selectively expressed by epithelial cell progenitors to modulate branching morphogenesis during lung development. We demonstrate that Sox9 is upregulated via MAPK/PI3K-dependent signaling and by the transcription factor Wilms' tumor 1 in distal lung-resident fibroblasts in IPF. Mechanistically, using fibroblast activation assays, we demonstrate that Sox9 functions as a positive regulator of FMT, migration, survival, and ECM production. Importantly, our in vivo studies demonstrate that fibroblast-specific deletion of Sox9 is sufficient to attenuate collagen deposition and improve lung function during TGF-α-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Using a mouse model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, we show that myofibroblast-specific Sox9 overexpression augments fibroblast activation and pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, Sox9 functions as a profibrotic transcription factor in activating fibroblasts, illustrating the potential utility of targeting Sox9 in IPF treatment.",JCI insight,2021-Oct,"Gajjala PR, Kasam RK, Soundararajan D, Sinner D, Huang SK, Jegga AG, Madala SK",7,1620,pulmonology,2025-11-22

A state analysis guided by the PEPPA framework was initiated by the Pulmonology Clinic of University Hospital Zürich. Literature describing the current provision of COPD care regarding exacerbations in Switzerland and international qualitative studies describing the patient perspective were systematically searched and summarised. The health providers' perspective was investigated in three focus-group interviews. A lack of systematic and state-of-the-art support for patient self-management in Switzerland was described in literature and confirmed by the health providers interviewed. While care was assessed as being comprehensive and of good quality in each individual sector, such as inpatient, outpatient, rehabilitation and home settings, it was identified as being highly fragmented across sectors. The interview participants described day-to-day examples in which a lack of support in COPD self-management and fragmentation of care negatively affected the patients' disease management. The necessity of coordinating the transition between healthcare sectors and self-management support and that these organisational boundaries should be addressed by a multi-professional team were identified. Initial evaluation indicates that advanced practice nurses potentially have the skill set to coordinate the team and address patients' self-management needs in complex patient situations.

The impact of TIP inhalation maneuvers on distribution of tobramycin is unknown. We hypothesized that (1) fast TIP inhalations result in greater extrathoracic and reduced small airway concentrations compared with slow or uninstructed TIP inhalations; (2) slow TIP inhalations result in greater small airway concentrations than TIS inhalations. The aim of the study was to assess TIP and TIS deposition with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Uninstructed, instructed fast, and instructed slow TIP inhalations of CF patients on maintenance TIP therapy, and inhalations during nebulization of saline with PARI LC Plus<sup>®</sup> were recorded at home. Drug deposition was determined using TIP and TIS aerosol characteristics together with CFD simulations based on airway geometries from chest computed tomography scans. The drug concentration was assessed in extrathoracic, central, large, and small airways. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Twelve patients aged 12-45 years were included, and 144 CFD simulations were performed. In all individual analyses, the tobramycin concentrations were well above the threshold for effective dose of 10 times minimal inhibitory concentration throughout the bronchial tree. Extrathoracic concentrations were comparable between fast and uninstructed TIP inhalations, while slow inhalations resulted in reduced extrathoracic concentrations compared with uninstructed TIP inhalations (<i>p</i> = 0.024).

35086992,A nationwide survey on awareness and knowledge about Bronchial Provocation Test amongst doctors in Malaysia.,"Bronchial provocation test (BPT) is widely used internationally not only to evaluate bronchial responsiveness in conditions especially asthma, but is also utilized as a marker of control, severity and prognosis for asthma. However, the uptake of BPT in certain countries including Malaysia remains low. We aimed to explore this lack of knowledge by assessing the current level of awareness and knowledge on BPT amongst doctors in Malaysia. A nationwide web-based questionnaire targeting doctors was sent through social media (Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram) and Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) mailing lists between 1 October 2020 - 5 February 2021. In all 415 survey responses were analysed from doctors of various grades namely medical officers to consultants. A total of 404 (97.35%) encountered patients with asthma in their daily practice. According to specialty: 169 (40.72%) were from primary care, 121 (29.16%) internal medicine, 50 (12.05%) pulmonary medicine and 75 (18.07%) others. Only 163 (39.28%) were aware of BPT as a tool to diagnose asthma. 232 (55.90%) and 124 (29.88%) regarded BPT as an important test and felt confident to refer patients for BPT respectively. Of those participants who were not confident to refer: 35.17% were unsure of BPT indications, 33.21% were unsure of centres providing BPT, 8.17% cited logistic reasons, 6.04% were concerned of possible BPT side effects. 387 (93.25%) wanted more training in BPT. The median BPT knowledge score was 20% (1 out of 5). Awareness and knowledge were affected by specialty but not by: region of practice, gender, age and grade from logistic regression analysis.

This review seeks to describe the recent developments in peripheral bronchoscopy in regards to navigation, imaging, and sampling target lesions in the pulmonary parenchyma. Robotic assisted bronchoscopy has improved navigation to the peripheral airways for sampling of peripheral parenchymal lesions. These navigational platforms use innovative technology utilizing electromagnetic navigation and shape-sensing technology for guidance. The greatest improvement has been the stabilization of the robotic scope in the periphery to allow for accurate sampling. Despite improvements in these platforms, limitations of CT to body divergence continue to impact navigation to the lesion and therefore diagnostic yield of the procedure. Advanced intraprocedural imaging with cone beam CT or augmented fluoroscopy has been a recent focus to improve this area.

33508883,Lung transplantation from swimming pool drowning victims: A case series.,"The use of donor lungs from victims of drowning remains a rare occurrence, given concerns over lung parenchymal injury and microbial contamination secondary to aspiration. Given this infrequency, there is a relative paucity of literature surrounding the use of organs from drowned donors, with the few that exist on this subject focusing primarily on cases of drowning in naturally occurring bodies of water (i.e., drowning at sea). Little is known regarding the outcomes of utilizing donor lungs from victims of drowning in artificial bodies of water (i.e., swimming pools). Here, we describe three cases of bilateral lung transplantation from donors who drowned in swimming pools, with good short- and long-term outcomes. These cases lend further evidence to the feasibility of using such organs that have traditionally been viewed with much trepidation. With continually growing demand for donor organs, the use of drowned donor lungs may serve as a means to expand the donor pool and lessen the burden of waitlist mortality.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,2021-Jun,"Tsou S, Chen J, Brzezinski M, Hays S, Leard L, Singer JP, Trinh B, Kukreja J",8,1028,pulmonology,2025-11-22

35434928,Corticosteroid response predicts bronchopulmonary dysplasia status at 36 weeks in preterm infants treated with dexamethasone: A pilot study.,"A major barrier to therapeutic development in neonates is a lack of standardized drug response measures that can be used as clinical trial endpoints. The ability to quantify treatment response in a way that aligns with relevant downstream outcomes may be useful as a surrogate marker for new therapies, such as those for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). To construct a measure of clinical response to dexamethasone that was well aligned with the incidence of severe BPD or death at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Retrospective cohort study. Level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Infants treated with dexamethasone for developing BPD between 2010 and 2020. Two models were built based on demographics, changes in ventilatory support, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO<sub>2</sub> ) after dexamethasone administration. An ordinal logistic regression and regularized binary logistic model for the composite outcome were used to associate response level to BPD outcomes defined by both the 2017 BPD Collaborative and 2018 Neonatal Research Network definitions. Ninety-five infants were treated with dexamethasone before 36 weeks. Compared to the baseline support and demographic data at the time of treatment, changes in ventilatory support improved ordinal model sensitivity and specificity. For the binary classification, BPD incidence was well aligned with risk levels, increasing from 16% to 59%. Incorporation of response variables as measured by changes in ventilatory parameters and pCO<sub>2</sub> following dexamethasone administration were associated with downstream outcomes.

32349709,Development and outcomes of a comprehensive multidisciplinary incidental lung nodule and lung cancer screening program.,"Appropriate management of lung nodules detected incidentally or through lung cancer screening can increase the rate of early-stage diagnoses and potentially improve treatment outcomes. However, the implementation and management of comprehensive lung nodule programs is challenging. This single-center, retrospective report describes the development and outcomes of a comprehensive lung nodule program at a community practice in Tennessee. Computed tomography (CT) scans potentially revealing incidental lung nodules were identified by a computerized search. Incidental or screening-identified lung nodules that were enlarging or not seen in prior scans were entered into a nodule database and guideline-based review determined whether to conduct a diagnostic intervention or radiologic follow-up. Referral rates, diagnosis methods, stage distribution, treatment modalities, and days to treatment are reported. The number of patients with lung nodules referred to the program increased over 2 years, from 665 patients in Year 1 to 745 patients in Year 2. Most nodules were incidental (62-65%). Nodules identified with symptoms (15.2% in Year 1) or through screening (12.6% in Year 1) were less common. In Year 1, 27% (182/665) of nodules required a diagnostic intervention and 18% (121/665) were malignant. Most diagnostic interventions were image-guided bronchoscopy (88%) or percutaneous biopsy (9%). The proportion of Stage I-II cancer diagnoses increased from 23% prior to program implementation to 36% in Year 1 and 38% in Year 2. In screening cases, 71% of patients completed follow-up scans within 18 months. Only 2% of Year 1 patients under watchful waiting required a diagnostic intervention, of which 1% received a cancer diagnosis. The current study reports outcomes over the first 2 years of a lung cancer screening and incidental nodule program. The results show that the program was successful, given the appropriate level of data management and oversight. Comprehensive lung nodule programs have the potential to benefit the patient, physician, and hospital system.",BMC pulmonary medicine,2020-Apr,"LeMense GP, Waller EA, Campbell C, Bowen T",4,2079,pulmonology,2025-11-22
32706527,"Promoting emotional wellness in children with CF, part II: Mental health assessment and intervention.","This is the second of two companion papers that examine the emotional wellness of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) during the early years of life, defined here as the period between birth and age 12. Both papers promote optimal mental health and well-being, with an emphasis on early identification and intervention. The first paper explores child and family resilience. Here, we discuss strategies for pediatric CF teams to provide routine, systematic mental health assessment, anticipatory guidance, brief intervention, and triage to evidence-based treatment when needed, while addressing barriers to accessing care. Many mental health conditions emerge before the age of 12, with the potential for lifelong effects on individuals, their families, and society. Living with a chronic illness such as CF can further increase the risk of mental health concerns and, in a bidirectional manner, their consequences for the quality of life, sustaining daily care, and health outcomes. There has been a significant focus in recent years on the mental health and wellness of adolescents and adults with CF, but less attention to specifics of depression and anxiety in younger children, or to other common pediatric comorbidities including trauma, developmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or autism spectrum disorder, and oppositional behavior.

38614859,Association between lung function and dyspnoea and its variation in the multinational Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease (BOLD) study.,"Dyspnoea is a common symptom of respiratory disease. However, data on its prevalence in general populations and its association with lung function are limited and are mainly from high-income countries. The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of dyspnoea across several world regions, and to investigate the association of dyspnoea with lung function. Dyspnoea was assessed, and lung function measured in 25,806 adult participants of the multinational Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease study. Dyspnoea was defined as ≥2 on the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale. The prevalence of dyspnoea was estimated for each of the study sites and compared across countries and world regions. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the association of dyspnoea with lung function in each site. Results were then pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. The prevalence of dyspnoea varied widely across sites without a clear geographical pattern. The mean prevalence of dyspnoea was 13.7 % (SD=8.2 %), ranging from 0 % in Mysore (India) to 28.8 % in Nampicuan-Talugtug (Philippines). Dyspnoea was strongly associated with both spirometry restriction (FVC<LLN: OR 2.07, 95 %CI 1.75-2.45) and spirometry airflow obstruction (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC<LLN: OR 3.76, 95 %CI 1.04-4.65). These associations did not significantly differ between sexes, age groups or smoking history. The association of dyspnoea with airflow obstruction was weaker among obese participants (OR 2.20, 95 %CI 1.61-3.01). The prevalence of dyspnoea varies substantially across the world and is strongly associated with lung function impairment.

Indeed, a principal goal in PAH today is an early diagnosis for prompt initiation of treatment to achieve a minimal symptom burden; optimize the patient's biochemical, hemodynamic, and functional profile; and limit adverse events. To accomplish this end, clinicians must be familiar with novel risk factors and the revised hemodynamic definition for PAH. Fresh insights into the role of developmental biology (i.e., perinatal health) may also be useful for predicting incident PAH in early adulthood. Emergent or underused approaches to PAH management include a novel TGF-β ligand trap pharmacotherapy, remote pulmonary arterial pressure monitoring, next-generation imaging using inert gas-based magnetic resonance and other technologies, right atrial pacing, and pulmonary arterial denervation.

34935642,E4 engages uPAR and enolase-1 and activates urokinase to exert antifibrotic effects.,"Fibroproliferative disorders such as systemic sclerosis (SSc) have no effective therapies and result in significant morbidity and mortality. We recently demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of endostatin, known as E4, prevented and reversed both dermal and pulmonary fibrosis. Our goal was to identify the mechanism by which E4 abrogates fibrosis and its cell surface binding partner(s). Our findings show that E4 activated the urokinase pathway and increased the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) to type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) ratio. In addition, E4 substantially increased MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression and activity. In vivo, E4 reversed bleomycin induction of PAI-1 and increased uPA activity. In patients with SSc, the uPA/PAI-1 ratio was decreased in both lung tissues and pulmonary fibroblasts compared with normal donors. Proteins bound to biotinylated-E4 were identified as enolase-1 (ENO) and uPA receptor (uPAR). The antifibrotic effects of E4 required uPAR. Further, ENO mediated the fibrotic effects of TGF-β1 and exerted TGF-β1-independent fibrotic effects. Our findings suggest that the antifibrotic effect of E4 is mediated, in part, by regulation of the urokinase pathway and induction of MMP-1 and MMP-3 levels and activity in a uPAR-dependent manner, thus promoting extracellular matrix degradation. Further, our findings identify a moonlighting function for the glycolytic enzyme ENO in fibrosis.",JCI insight,2021-Dec,"Sharma S, Watanabe T, Nishimoto T, Takihara T, Mlakar L, Nguyen XX, Sanderson M, Su Y, Chambers RA, Feghali-Bostwick C",10,1439,pulmonology,2025-11-22

31873073,β1 Integrin regulates adult lung alveolar epithelial cell inflammation.,"Integrins, the extracellular matrix receptors that facilitate cell adhesion and migration, are necessary for organ morphogenesis; however, their role in maintaining adult tissue homeostasis is poorly understood. To define the functional importance of β1 integrin in adult mouse lung, we deleted it after completion of development in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). Aged β1 integrin-deficient mice exhibited chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-like (COPD-like) pathology characterized by emphysema, lymphoid aggregates, and increased macrophage infiltration. These histopathological abnormalities were preceded by β1 integrin-deficient AEC dysfunction such as excessive ROS production and upregulation of NF-κB-dependent chemokines, including CCL2. Genetic deletion of the CCL2 receptor, Ccr2, in mice with β1 integrin-deficient type 2 AECs impaired recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages and resulted in accelerated inflammation and severe premature emphysematous destruction. The lungs exhibited reduced AEC efferocytosis and excessive numbers of inflamed type 2 AECs, demonstrating the requirement for recruited monocytes/macrophages in limiting lung injury and remodeling in the setting of a chronically inflamed epithelium.

The disease has imposed a huge burden on health resources. Evaluation of clinical and epidemiological profiles of such patients can help in understanding and managing the outbreak more efficiently. This study was a prospective observational analysis of 200 diagnosed COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care center from 20th march to 8th May 2020. All these patients were positive for COVID-19 by an oro-nasopharyngeal swab-rtPCR based testing. Analyses of demographic factors, clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory parameters, and the outcomes were performed. The mean age of the population was 40 years with a slight male predominance (116 patients out of 200, 58%). A majority of the patients (147, 73.5 %) were symptomatic, with fever being the most common symptom (109, 54.5%), followed by cough (91, 45.5%). An older age, presence of symptoms and their duration, leukocytosis, a high quick SOFA score, a high modified SOFA score, need for ventilator support, an AST level more than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), and a serum creatinine level of 2 mg/dl or greater were at a significantly higher risk of ICU admission and mortality. Presence of diabetes mellitus, AST > three times ULN, serum creatinine 2 mg/dl or higher, and a qSOFA score of 1 or higher were all associated with significantly greater odds of critical care requirement. Triage and severity assessment helps in deciding the requirement for a hospital stay and ICU admission for COVID-19 which can easily be done using clinical and laboratory parameters.

38382478,Advances in the Treatment of Pulmonary Nodules.,"Early detection and accurate diagnosis of pulmonary nodules are crucial for improving patient outcomes. While surgical resection of malignant nodules is still the preferred treatment option, it may not be feasible for all patients. We aimed to discuss the advances in the treatment of pulmonary nodules, especially stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and interventional pulmonology technologies, and provide a range of recommendations based on our expertise and experience. Interventional pulmonology is an increasingly important approach for the management of pulmonary nodules. While more studies are needed to fully evaluate its long-term outcomes and benefits, the available evidence suggests that this technique can provide a minimally invasive and effective alternative for treating small malignancies in selected patients. We conducted a systematic literature review in PubMed, designed a framework to include the advances in surgery, SBRT, and interventional pulmonology for the treatment of pulmonary nodules, and provided a range of recommendations based on our expertise and experience. As such, alternative therapeutic options such as SBRT and ablation are becoming increasingly important and viable. With recent advancements in bronchoscopy techniques, ablation via bronchoscopy has emerged as a promising option for treating pulmonary nodules. This study reviewed the advances of interventional pulmonology in the treatment of peripheral lung cancer patients that are not surgical candidates. We also discussed the challenges and limitations associated with ablation, such as the risk of complications and the potential for incomplete nodule eradication. These advancements hold great promise for improving the efficacy and safety of interventional pulmonology in treating pulmonary nodules.",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,2024-,"Zhang Q, Wu X, Yang H, Luo P, Wei N, Wang S, Zhao X, Wang Z, Herth FJF, Zhang X",10,1807,pulmonology,2025-11-22

31927551,Clinical Use and Barriers of Thoracic Ultrasound: A Survey of Italian Pulmonologists.,"Thoracic ultrasound is accurate in the diagnosis of a wide range of respiratory diseases. Yet the extent of its use is unknown. Through a national survey, we aimed to explore the clinical use of thoracic ultrasound and the barriers to the diffusion of the technique in Italy. Accademia di Ecografia Toracica (AdET) developed a self-administered survey which was sent by email to Italian pulmonologists via national scientific societies and networks. Of the 2010 physicians invited, 514 completed the survey (26% response rate). According to 99% of responders, thoracic ultrasound had a relevant clinical role. Seventy-nine percent of the responders used thoracic ultrasound at least once a month. The main settings were: 53% pulmonology ward, 15% outpatient clinic, 15% interventional pulmonology room, 10% internal medicine ward, 4% respiratory intensive care units, and 9% other. Thoracic ultrasound was primarily used: (1) with both diagnostic and interventional aims (72%), (2) as diagnostic imaging (17%), and (3) as guidance for interventional procedures (11%). The main clinical applications were: (1) diagnosis and management of pleural effusion, (2) pneumothorax, (3) pneumonia, (4) cardiac failure, and (5) acute dyspnea. Twenty-one percent of the responders do not use thoracic ultrasound. The main reported bar-riers were: (1) availability of an ultrasound system (52%), (2) lack of protected time and training (22%), and (3) use of the technique by other specialists (15%). Thoracic ultrasound is widely used by Italian pulmonologists and considered a clinically relevant tool. The availability of dedicated ultrasound systems seems to be a major limit of the use of the technique.",Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,2020-,"Zanforlin A, Tursi F, Marchetti G, Pellegrino GM, Vigo B, Smargiassi A, Inchingolo R, Centanni S, Gasparini S, Blasi F, Soldati G, Sferrazza Papa GF",12,1694,pulmonology,2025-11-22

35869744,Hit-hard and early versus step-up treatment in severe sarcoidosis.,"The treatment of sarcoidosis remains uncertain, despite 70 years of study. The conventional approach is to initiate corticosteroids in individuals who require treatment. The position of more aggressive regimes is unknown. Recent recognition that many patients will require prolonged therapy, and the observation that corticosteroids lead to overt and insidious toxicities, have led to suggestions that steroid-sparing medications be used earlier in the management of sarcoidosis. Individuals with poor prognostic features, designated as 'high-risk' sarcoidosis may, especially benefit from a broader palette of therapeutic options in the initial treatment regimen. An even more aggressive approach, known as 'top-down' or 'hit-hard and early' therapy has emerged in the fields of gastroenterology and rheumatology in the past 15 years, on the premise that highly effective early control of inflammation leads to better outcomes. These regimens typically involve early initiation of biologic therapies. For certain subpopulations of sarcoidosis patients, 'top-down' therapy could be helpful. Severe pulmonary sarcoidosis, neurosarcoidosis, cardiac sarcoidosis and multiorgan sarcoidosis are phenotypes that may be most relevant for revised therapeutic algorithms. Precision medicine approaches and randomized trials will be necessary to confirm a role for top-down therapy in the routine management of sarcoidosis.",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,2022-Sep,"Vorselaars ADM, Culver DA",2,1413,pulmonology,2025-11-22
35858889,Mixed venous oxygen tension is a crucial prognostic factor in pulmonary hypertension: a retrospective cohort study.,"The prognostic value of mixed venous oxygen tension (PvO<sub>2</sub>) at pulmonary hypertension diagnosis treated with selective pulmonary vasodilators remains unclear. This study sought to investigate the association of PvO<sub>2</sub> with long-term prognosis in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and medically treated chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and to identify the distinct mechanisms influencing tissue hypoxia in patients with CTEPH or PAH. We retrospectively analyzed data from 138 (age: 50.2 ± 16.6 years, 81.9% women) and 268 (age: 57.4 ± 13.1 years, 72.8% women) patients with PAH and CTEPH, respectively, diagnosed at our institution from 1983 to 2018. We analyzed the survival rates of patients with/without tissue hypoxia (PvO<sub>2</sub> < 35 mmHg) and identified their prognostic factors based on the pulmonary hypertension risk stratification guidelines. Survival was significantly poorer in patients with tissue hypoxia than in those without it for PAH (P = 0.001) and CTEPH (P = 0.017) treated with selective pulmonary vasodilators. In patients with PAH, PvO<sub>2</sub> more strongly correlated with prognosis than other hemodynamic prognostic factors regardless of selective pulmonary vasodilators usage. PvO<sub>2</sub> was the only significant prognostic factor in patients with CTEPH treated with pulmonary hypertension medication. Patients with CTEPH experiencing tissue hypoxia exhibited significantly poorer survival than those in the intervention group (P < 0.001). PvO<sub>2</sub> more strongly correlated with the cardiac index (CI) than the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-aDO<sub>2</sub>) in PAH; whereas in CTEPH, PvO<sub>2</sub> was more strongly correlated with A-aDO<sub>2</sub> than with CI. PvO<sub>2</sub> may represent a crucial prognostic factor for pulmonary hypertension.

By adhering to stringent criteria for instrumental variable selection, the research aims to uncover metabolic pathways that may influence the risk and progression of pulmonary fibrosis, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets. Utilizing data from the OpenGWAS project, which includes a significant European cohort, and metabolite GWAS data from the Canadian Longitudinal Aging Study (CLSA), the study employs advanced statistical methods. These include inverse variance weighting (IVW), weighted median estimations, and comprehensive sensitivity analyses conducted using the R software environment to ensure the robustness of the causal inferences. The study identified 62 metabolites with significant causal relationships with pulmonary fibrosis, highlighting both risk-enhancing and protective metabolic factors. This extensive list of metabolites presents a broad spectrum of potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for early detection, underscoring the metabolic complexity underlying pulmonary fibrosis. The findings from this MR study significantly advance our understanding of the metabolic underpinnings of pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting that alterations in specific metabolites could influence the risk and progression of the disease.

The pathophysiology of EVALI is not well understood. However, it is speculated that certain substances such as Vitamin E Acetate (VEA), particularly in marijuana containing vape cartridges may result in lung injury and lead to respiratory dysfunction. EVALI is often seen in the absence of infections, but it has been found to be associated with both fungal and bacterial infections. Like EVALI, nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) pulmonary disease is also on the rise, but is primarily reported in immunocompromised individuals. Here, we present three immunocompetent individuals wherein pulmonary NTM infection co-occurred with vaping. Medical information including patient history, laboratory, and radiograph reports were abstracted from electronic medical records from participating institutions located in the Bronx, NY, Philadelphia, PA, and Lexington, KY. All three cases were otherwise immunocompetent individuals with a significant history of vaping either nicotine and/or marijuana containing products. The pathogens isolated include Mycobacterium avium complex, M. xenopi, and M. gordonae. All three patients were treated for NTM. There is little reported on the association between vaping and NTM.

The factors leading trainees to pursue a fellowship in pediatric pulmonology are unclear. <b>Objective:</b> To gain a better understanding of the decision-making process surrounding the choice to pursue a pediatric pulmonary fellowship and to provide informed recommendations to increase recruitment of new trainees. <b>Methods:</b> Informed by the Social Cognitive Career Theory, eight focus groups were held with pediatric residents and fellows attending the 2019 American Thoracic Society International Conference. Questions focused on personal background, learning experiences, self-efficacy and outcome expectations, interests, and goals. Transcripts were analyzed by conventional content analysis. <b>Results:</b> Fifty-six residents and fellows representing 42 different institutions participated.

Moreover, we investigated whether the learning-method-guided quantitative analysis approach adequately described mediastinal lymphadenopathies on endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) images. In total, 345 lymph nodes (LNs) from 345 EBUS images were used as source input datasets for the application group. The group consisted of 300 and 45 textural patterns as input and output variables, respectively. The input and output datasets were processed using MATLAB. All these datasets were utilized for the training and testing of the ANN. The best diagnostic accuracy was 82% of that obtained from the textural patterns of the LNs pattern (89% sensitivity, 72% specificity, and 78.2% area under the curve). The negative predictive values were 81% compared to the corresponding positive predictive values of 83%. Due to the application group's pattern-based evaluation, the LN pattern was statistically significant (<i>p</i> = .002). The proposed intelligent approach could be useful in making diagnoses. Further development is required to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the visual interpretation.",Current medical research and opinion,2020-Dec,"Ozcelik N, Ozcelik AE, Bulbul Y, Oztuna F, Ozlu T",5,1200,pulmonology,2025-11-22
31665560,Amphiregulin contributes to airway remodeling in chronic allograft dysfunction after lung transplantation.,"Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), a condition of excess matrix deposition and airways fibrosis, limits survival after lung transplantation. Amphiregulin (Areg) is an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand suggested to regulate airway injury and repair. We sought to determine whether Areg expression increases in CLAD, localize the cellular source of Areg induction in CLAD, and assess its effects on airway matrix deposition. Lung fluid Areg protein was quantified in patients with or without CLAD. In situ hybridization was performed to localize Areg and EGFR transcript in CLAD and normal lung tissue. Expression of hyaluronan, a matrix constituent that accumulates in CLAD, was measured in Areg-exposed bronchial epithelial cells in the presence or absence of an EGFR inhibitor. We demonstrated that lung fluid Areg protein was significantly increased in CLAD in a discovery and replication cohort. Areg and EGFR transcripts were abundantly expressed within CLAD tissue, localized to basally distributed airway epithelial cells overlying fibrotic regions. Areg-exposed bronchial epithelial cells increased hyaluronan and hyaluronan synthase expression in an EGFR-dependent manner. Collectively, these novel observations suggest that Areg contributes to airway remodeling and CLAD. Moreover these data implicate a role for EGFR signaling in CLAD pathogenesis, suggesting novel therapeutic targets.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,2020-Mar,"Todd JL, Kelly FL, Nagler A, Banner K, Pavlisko EN, Belperio JA, Brass D, Weigt SS, Palmer SM",9,1417,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Here we discuss a patient who presented with severe pHTN and was later found to be compound heterozygous for pathogenic variants in the NFU1 gene causing multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome 1 (MMDS1). Review of autopsy slides from an older sibling revealed the same diagnosis along with pulmonary findings consistent with a developmental lung disorder. In particular, these postmortem, autopsy findings have not been described previously in humans with this mitochondrial syndrome and suggest a possible developmental basis for the severe pHTN seen in this disease. Given the rarity of patients reported with MMDS1, we review the current state of knowledge of this disease and our novel management strategies for pHTN and MMDS1-associated complications in this population.",American journal of medical genetics.

36285979,ICS/Ultra LABA in the Treatment of Obstructive Airway Diseases: A Consensus of Indian Experts.,"Inhaled corticosteroid and ultra-long-acting beta-agonist (ICS/uLABA) combination is a recent advancement in the armamentarium against obstructive airways diseases (OADs). The combination of ICS/uLABA has several advantages, creating a favorable landscape for its utilization. Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol trifenatate (FF/Vi) is one such example of an ICS/uLABA. It offers several benefits from both drugs, such as a convenient once daily dosing schedule; high lipophilicity; high receptor affinity of fluticasone furoate along with high functional selectivity and a quick onset of action of vilanterol. However, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) as well as the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines do not clearly define the positioning of ICS/uLABA compared to conventional ICS/LABAs. There are a few areas of uncertainty especially around the appropriate reliever strategy with ICS/uLABA in Asthma. The current consensus was planned with a group of Indian pulmonology experts to provide more clarity on the potential use of FF/Vi in Asthma and COPD. The clinical statements highlighted in this consensus manuscript address crucial clinical questions revolving around the efficacy and safety of FF/Vi as compared to conventional ICS/LABAs and identify the ideal patient profile for its use. This consensus paper also sheds light upon the appropriate reliever to be used along with FF/Vi in Asthma and the utilization of FF/Vi-based triple therapy in OADs. Expert recommendations mentioned in this paper will serve as guidance to pulmonologists as well as consultant physicians who are involved in providing care to OAD patients and will help them weigh the various factors that need to be taken into account while prescribing ICS/uLABA combination.",Advances in respiratory medicine,2022-Sep,"Dhar R, Talwar D, James P, Mishra A, Vachaparambil J, Patil S, Khatri N, Bhagat S, Barkate H",9,1793,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Additionally, clinical evidence derived from currently available studies is limited. This expert panel survey intends to aid physicians in choosing the best therapeutic strategy for patients at intermediate risk despite ongoing oral therapy. An expert panel of 24 physicians, specialized in cardiology and/or pulmonology with expertise in handling all drugs available for the treatment of PAH participated in the survey. All potential therapeutic options for patients at intermediate risk were explored and analyzed to produce graded consensus statements regarding: the switch from endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) or phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor (PDE5i) to another oral drug of the same class; the addition of a drug targeting the prostacyclin pathway administered by different routes; the switch from PDE5i to riociguat.",Vascular pharmacology,2024-Dec,"Manzi G, Benza RL, Argiento P, Casu G, Corda M, Correale M, D'Alto M, Galgano G, Garascia A, Ghio S, Gomberg-Maitland M, Mulé M, Paciocco G, Papa S, Prati D, Preston IR, Raineri C, Romeo E, Scelsi L, Stolfo D, Vitulo P, White RJ, Badagliacca R, Vizza CD",24,1108,pulmonology,2025-11-22

It also aimed to contribute to the development of innovative strategies to improve care for individuals with COPD through the use of telemedical technologies. Materials and methods: An interdisciplinary and comprehensive pilot project in pulmonology was applied, dividing it into health, organizational, and tech-nological areas. The steps and data collection strategy were presented, enabling the implementation of telemedical solutions among COPD patients in Poland. Results: The implementation of telemedical solutions in COPD represented an innovative approach to improving care. Among the main goals of the project were to reduce patient waiting times, enhance disease progress monitoring, and provide access to specialized healthcare through the use of modern telemedical technologies. Various telemedical solutions were implemented, including remote monitoring of health parameters, online consultations with pulmonology specialists, and patient education on self-monitoring of symptoms. The fi nal summary of the materials collected within the described methodology allowed for a holistic view of the implementation of telemedicine in pulmonary healthcare in Poland, using the discussed pilot project as an example. Conclusions: The analysis of the pilot project implementing telemedical solutions in the fi eld of pulmonology in the Polish healthcare sector has shown that telemedicine can improve care for COPD patients. The project's outcomes indicate the potential for reducing patient waiting times and better monitoring of disease progression.

39012714,Radioproteomics stratifies molecular response to antifibrotic treatment in pulmonary fibrosis.,"Antifibrotic therapy with nintedanib is the clinical mainstay in the treatment of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (ILD). High-dimensional medical image analysis, known as radiomics, provides quantitative insights into organ-scale pathophysiology, generating digital disease fingerprints. Here, we performed an integrative analysis of radiomic and proteomic profiles (radioproteomics) to assess whether changes in radiomic signatures can stratify the degree of antifibrotic response to nintedanib in (experimental) fibrosing ILD. Unsupervised clustering of delta radiomic profiles revealed 2 distinct imaging phenotypes in mice treated with nintedanib, contrary to conventional densitometry readouts, which showed a more uniform response. Integrative analysis of delta radiomics and proteomics demonstrated that these phenotypes reflected different treatment response states, as further evidenced on transcriptional and cellular levels. Importantly, radioproteomics signatures paralleled disease- and drug-related biological pathway activity with high specificity, including extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, cell cycle activity, wound healing, and metabolic activity. Evaluation of the preclinical molecular response-defining features, particularly those linked to ECM remodeling, in a cohort of nintedanib-treated fibrosing patients with ILD, accurately stratified patients based on their extent of lung function decline. In conclusion, delta radiomics has great potential to serve as a noninvasive and readily accessible surrogate of molecular response phenotypes in fibrosing ILD. This could pave the way for personalized treatment strategies and improved patient outcomes.",JCI insight,2024-Jul,"Lauer D, Magnin CY, Kolly LR, Wang H, Brunner M, Chabria M, Cereghetti GM, Gabryś HS, Tanadini-Lang S, Uldry AC, Heller M, Verleden SE, Klein K, Sarbu AC, Funke-Chambour M, Ebner L, Distler O, Maurer B, Gote-Schniering J",19,1697,pulmonology,2025-11-22

A 63-year-old man with a history of dyslipidemia, Barret's esophagus, and coronary disease, who was taken to thoracoscopy and left inferior lobectomy due to the presence of a pulmonary mass. A primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma was diagnosed. On follow up a PET-CT was performed, in which a metabolically active lesion was described adjacent to the prior lobectomy, suggesting a local relapse. EBUS-TBNA was then performed, obtaining a sample from which histopathological pattern compatible with myospherulosis was obtained. Although it is a rare entity, myospherulosis has a well-defined morphological pattern. By not recognizing myospherulosis as a benign lesion, a patient's risk of invasive cancer can be overestimated. It is a phenomenon found with increasing frequency and has been reported in different tissues, however, this is the first report in the literature of myospherulosis of the lung.

38243291,Robotic versus Electromagnetic bronchoscopy for pulmonary LesIon AssessmeNT: the RELIANT pragmatic randomized trial.,"Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy has recently emerged as an alternative to electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy for the evaluation of peripheral pulmonary lesions. While robotic-assisted bronchoscopy is proposed to have several advantages, such as an easier learning curve, it is unclear if it has comparable diagnostic utility as electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy. Robotic versus Electromagnetic bronchoscopy for pulmonary LesIon AssessmeNT (RELIANT) is an investigator-initiated, single-center, open label, noninferiority, cluster randomized controlled trial conducted in two operating rooms at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Each operating room (OR) is assigned to either robotic-assisted or electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy each morning, with each OR day considered one cluster. All patients undergoing diagnostic bronchoscopy for evaluation of a peripheral pulmonary lesion in one of the two operating rooms are eligible. Schedulers, patients, and proceduralists are blinded to daily group allocations until randomization is revealed for each operating room each morning. The primary endpoint is the diagnostic yield defined as the proportion of cases yielding lesional tissue. Secondary and safety endpoints include procedure duration and procedural complications. Enrolment began on March 6, 2023, and will continue until 202 clusters have been accrued, with expected enrolment of approximately 400 patients by the time of completion in March of 2024. RELIANT is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial that will compare the diagnostic yield of the two most commonly used bronchoscopic approaches for sampling peripheral pulmonary lesions. This will be the first known cluster randomized pragmatic trial in the interventional pulmonology field and the first randomized controlled trial of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy.

35315363,CFTR-mediated monocyte/macrophage dysfunction revealed by cystic fibrosis proband-parent comparisons.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder caused by biallelic mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Converging evidence suggests that CF carriers with only 1 defective CFTR copy are at increased risk for CF-related conditions and pulmonary infections, but the molecular mechanisms underpinning this effect remain unknown. We performed transcriptomic profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of CF child-parent trios (proband, father, and mother) and healthy control (HC) PBMCs or THP-1 cells incubated with the plasma of these participants. Transcriptomic analyses revealed suppression of cytokine-enriched immune-related genes (IL-1β, CXCL8, CREM), implicating lipopolysaccharide tolerance in innate immune cells (monocytes) of CF probands and their parents. These data suggest that a homozygous as well as a heterozygous CFTR mutation can modulate the immune/inflammatory system. This conclusion is further supported by the finding of lower numbers of circulating monocytes in CF probands and their parents, compared with HCs, and the abundance of mononuclear phagocyte subsets, which correlated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, lung disease severity, and CF progression in the probands. This study provides insight into demonstrated CFTR-related innate immune dysfunction in individuals with CF and carriers of a CFTR mutation that may serve as a target for personalized therapy.",JCI insight,2022-Mar,"Zhang X, Moore CM, Harmacek LD, Domenico J, Rangaraj VR, Ideozu JE, Knapp JR, Woods KJ, Jump S, Jia S, Prokop JW, Bowler R, Hessner MJ, Gelfand EW, Levy H",15,1438,pulmonology,2025-11-22

More recently, CBCT has emerged as an important imaging tool for bronchoscopists, primarily used during transbronchial biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLS). For this application CBCT has proved useful in navigating devices to a target lesion, in confirming device tool-in-lesion, as well as during tissue acquisition. In addition, CBCT is poised to play an important role in trials evaluating bronchoscopic ablation by helping to determine the location of the ablative probe relative to the target lesion. Before adopting this technology, it is key for bronchoscopists to learn some basic concepts that will allow them to have a safer and more successful experience with CBCT. Hence, in the current manuscript, we will focus on both technical and practical aspects of CBCT imaging, ranging from systems considerations, image quality, radiation dose and dose-reduction strategies, procedure room set-up, and best practices for CBCT image acquisition.",Journal of thoracic disease,2020-Dec,"Setser R, Chintalapani G, Bhadra K, Casal RF",4,1106,pulmonology,2025-11-22

However, screening for early detection of pulmonary involvement especially interstitial lung disease (ILD) is not established in RA. We propose a non-invasive radiation-free approach to screen for interstitial lung involvement (ILI) by means of pulmonary function tests (PFT) and pleuro-pulmonary transthoracic ultrasound (LUS) with additional cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPET) with ECG, and echocardiography. We included patients with confirmed diagnosis of seropositive RA according to ACR criteria, but without symptoms for or known cardiopulmonary disease. ILD was suspected when significant LUS abnormalities and additional PFT changes were present. We included 67 consecutive patients (78% female, mean age 61 ± 12 years, 48% active or previous smokers), who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and gave written informed consent. We found 48% of patients with suspected changes in PFT with a diffusion capacity (DLCOc-SB) ≤ 80%, among them 7% with forced vital capacity (FVC) ≤ 80%. In 40% of patients, we found noticeable changes in LUS, 24% with an ILD compatible pattern. In 16% of cases, LUS abnormalities and additional PFT changes were present, and ILI was suspected. Additional findings included obstructive lung disease (n = 11), subpleural consolidation (n = 6) including one confirmed lung cancer, minimal pleural effusion (n = 6), and ischemic cardiac disease (n = 2). None of the patients showed signs of pulmonary vascular involvement. ILI was suspected in 16% of cases using a new radiation-free screening protocol in asymptomatic RA patients.

Bronchoscopy literature mainly focusing on technical aspects. However, data on patients satisfaction and bronchoscopy is rare. To evaluate levels and factors affecting patient satisfaction with flexible bronchoscopy (FB). This prospective study, conducted between June 2017 and May 2019 at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia), included all consecutive diagnostic bronchoscopies for adult patients. Patient willingness to return for another bronchoscopy (definitely not, probably not, unsure, probably would, or definitely would) was used as the indicator of satisfaction. Patients ranked their experiences with doctors, nurses, and process of care using a 5-choice scale (poor, fair, good, very good, or excellent). A total of 351 patients participated in this study. Overall, patients were highly satisfied with their doctors, nurses, and process of care. However, only 34.1% of patients indicated that they would return for another FB if necessary. Predictors of return for FB were younger age (<65 years), university education, use of midazolam and higher doses of fentanyl >100 mcg, and inpatient setting. Logistic regression demonstrated that younger age (P = 0.005) and inpatient setting (P = 0.02) were significantly linked to willingness to return for bronchoscopy. Patient satisfaction with bronchoscopy was lower in our study compared to other studies, despite high ratings of doctors' and nurses' skills. Elderly patients and patients with outpatient bronchoscopies were less likely to return and should therefore be approached with extra care. Physicians can improve FB-related patient experiences by decreasing discomfort during bronchoscope insertion and by improving topical anesthesia.",Nigerian journal of clinical practice,2023-Apr,Aljohaney AA,1,1816,pulmonology,2025-11-22
35420997,Sine oculis homeobox homolog 1 plays a critical role in pulmonary fibrosis.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease with limited treatment options. The role of the developmental transcription factor Sine oculis homeobox homolog 1 (SIX1) in the pathophysiology of lung fibrosis is not known. IPF lung tissue samples and IPF-derived alveolar type II cells (AT2) showed a significant increase in SIX1 mRNA and protein levels, and the SIX1 transcriptional coactivators EYA1 and EYA2 were elevated. Six1 was also upregulated in bleomycin-treated (BLM-treated) mice and in a model of spontaneous lung fibrosis driven by deletion of Telomeric Repeat Binding Factor 1 (Trf1) in AT2 cells. Conditional deletion of Six1 in AT2 cells prevented or halted BLM-induced lung fibrosis, as measured by a significant reduction in histological burden of fibrosis, reduced fibrotic mediator expression, and improved lung function. These effects were associated with increased macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in lung epithelial cells in vivo following SIX1 overexpression in BLM-induced fibrosis.

35509977,A survey of physicians' opinions about the treatment of subsegmental pulmonary embolism.,"The aim of this study was to survey the attitudes of internists, cardiologists, and pulmonologists regarding treatment or no treatment of isolated subsegmental pulmonary embolism (ISSPE) with anticoagulant drugs. Qualified physicians were asked to select their management options from a questionnaire that included a patient scenario with subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) and negative past medical history of thromboembolism. A total of 113 physicians responded to the survey. Of these, 8.8% preferred not to treat patients without further evaluation; 15% decided not to treat, but follow-up the patient with a serial lower-limb colour Doppler ultrasonography; 1.7% preferred anticoagulant treatment only during hospitalization and follow-up without medication; 5% preferred anticoagulant treatment for less than 3 months; and 34.5% chose a 3-6-month treatment with anticoagulation. Furthermore, 24% of physicians opted for anticoagulant treatment for more than 6 months, and 9.7% left the decision up to the patient. Opting not to treat was an option selected by more board-certified faculty members specialized in cardiology, internal medicine, and pulmonology compared with residents (<i>p</i> = 0.038). Willingness to provide anticoagulant therapy in the internal medicine, cardiology and pulmonology groups was 56.6%, 37.3% and 6%, respectively (<i>p</i> = 0.007).

37264374,Deep learning diagnostic and severity-stratification for interstitial lung diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in digital lung auscultations and ultrasonography: clinical protocol for an observational case-control study.,"Interstitial lung diseases (ILD), such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are severe, progressive pulmonary disorders with a poor prognosis. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is important to enable patients to receive appropriate care at the earliest possible stage to delay disease progression and prolong survival. Artificial intelligence-assisted lung auscultation and ultrasound (LUS) could constitute an alternative to conventional, subjective, operator-related methods for the accurate and earlier diagnosis of these diseases. This protocol describes the standardised collection of digitally-acquired lung sounds and LUS images of adult outpatients with IPF, NSIP or COPD and a deep learning diagnostic and severity-stratification approach. A total of 120 consecutive patients (≥ 18 years) meeting international criteria for IPF, NSIP or COPD and 40 age-matched controls will be recruited in a Swiss pulmonology outpatient clinic, starting from August 2022. At inclusion, demographic and clinical data will be collected. Lung auscultation will be recorded with a digital stethoscope at 10 thoracic sites in each patient and LUS images using a standard point-of-care device will be acquired at the same sites. A deep learning algorithm (DeepBreath) using convolutional neural networks, long short-term memory models, and transformer architectures will be trained on these audio recordings and LUS images to derive an automated diagnostic tool. The primary outcome is the diagnosis of ILD versus control subjects or COPD. Secondary outcomes are the clinical, functional and radiological characteristics of IPF, NSIP and COPD diagnosis. Quality of life will be measured with dedicated questionnaires. Based on previous work to distinguish normal and pathological lung sounds, we estimate to achieve convergence with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of > 80% using 40 patients in each category, yielding a sample size calculation of 80 ILD (40 IPF, 40 NSIP), 40 COPD, and 40 controls. This approach has a broad potential to better guide care management by exploring the synergistic value of several point-of-care-tests for the automated detection and differential diagnosis of ILD and COPD and to estimate severity.

Traditional bronchoscopy, while useful, has limitations in diagnosing peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) and carries a higher risk of complications such as pneumothorax. However, the field of interventional pulmonology has seen significant advancements, including the introduction of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RAB), cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), radial endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS), and rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE). These advancements have greatly improved the precision of diagnosing high-risk PPLs. This report presents the case of a 60-year-old female smoker with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and extensive centrilobular emphysema, who had a peripherally located high-risk pulmonary nodule. She was successfully diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma using an integrated approach, despite the challenging location of the lesion and high risk of pneumothorax.

39125480,Advancements in Interventional Pulmonology: Harnessing Ultrasound Techniques for Precision Diagnosis and Treatment.,"Medical ultrasound has emerged as an indispensable tool within interventional pulmonology, revolutionizing diagnostic and procedural practices through its non-invasive nature and real-time visualization capabilities. By harnessing the principles of sound waves and employing a variety of transducer types, ultrasound facilitates enhanced accuracy and safety in procedures such as transthoracic needle aspiration and pleural effusion drainage, consequently leading to improved patient outcomes. Understanding the fundamentals of ultrasound physics is paramount for clinicians, as it forms the basis for interpreting imaging results and optimizing interventions. Thoracic ultrasound plays a pivotal role in diagnosing conditions like pleural effusions and pneumothorax, while also optimizing procedures such as thoracentesis and biopsy by providing precise guidance. Advanced ultrasound techniques, including endobronchial ultrasound, has transformed the evaluation and biopsy of lymph nodes, bolstered by innovative features like elastography, which contribute to increased procedural efficacy and patient safety. Peripheral ultrasound techniques, notably radial endobronchial ultrasound (rEBUS), have become essential for assessing pulmonary nodules and evaluating airway structures, offering clinicians valuable insights into disease localization and severity. Neck ultrasound serves as a crucial tool in guiding supraclavicular lymph node biopsy and percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy procedures, ensuring safe placement and minimizing associated complications. Ultrasound technology is suited for further advancement through the integration of artificial intelligence, miniaturization, and the development of portable devices. These advancements hold the promise of not only improving diagnostic accuracy but also enhancing the accessibility of ultrasound imaging in diverse healthcare settings, ultimately expanding its utility and impact on patient care. Additionally, the integration of enhanced techniques such as contrast-enhanced ultrasound and 3D imaging is anticipated to revolutionize personalized medicine by providing clinicians with a more comprehensive understanding of anatomical structures and pathological processes. The transformative potential of medical ultrasound in interventional pulmonology extends beyond mere technological advancements; it represents a paradigm shift in healthcare delivery, empowering clinicians with unprecedented capabilities to diagnose and treat pulmonary conditions with precision and efficacy. By leveraging the latest innovations in ultrasound technology, clinicians can navigate complex anatomical structures with confidence, leading to more informed decision-making and ultimately improving patient outcomes. Moreover, the portability and versatility of modern ultrasound devices enable their deployment in various clinical settings, from traditional hospital environments to remote or resource-limited areas, thereby bridging gaps in healthcare access and equity.","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2024-Jul,"Nathani A, Keshishyan S, Cho RJ",3,3023,pulmonology,2025-11-22

PPHN is associated with diverse cardiopulmonary disorders and a high early mortality rate for infants with severe PPHN. Surviving infants with PPHN have an increased risk of long-term morbidities. PPHN physiology can be categorized by (1) maladaptation: pulmonary vessels have normal structure and number but have abnormal vasoreactivity; (2) excessive muscularization: increased smooth muscle cell thickness and increased distal extension of muscle to vessels that are usually not muscularized; and (3) underdevelopment: lung hypoplasia associated with decreased pulmonary artery number. Treatment involves adequate lung recruitment, optimization of cardiac output and left ventricular function, and pulmonary vasodilators such as inhaled nitric oxide.

Although EPAs have been piloted in some programs, their use for summative assessment of pediatric pulmonology fellows for graduation has not been studied. <b>Objective:</b> To determine the minimum level of supervision that pediatric pulmonary program directors (PDs) require of their fellows for graduation and compare it with the minimum level of supervision they expect for a practicing subspecialist for the five pediatric pulmonology EPAs. <b>Methods:</b> Using a modified Delphi approach, we developed supervision scales for the five pediatric pulmonology EPAs and conducted a national survey of pediatric pulmonary PDs in the United States through the Subspecialty Pediatric Investigators Network between April 2017 and August 2017. <b>Results:</b> Forty-six pediatric pulmonary PDs completed the survey, representing a response rate of 85%. The majority did not require fellows to be trusted to practice without supervision for graduation for any of the five EPAs (level 5); the <i>median minimum</i> level of supervision they required was 4, equating to indirect supervision for complex cases. The <i>minimum level for graduation</i>, defined by consensus as the level of supervision for which no more than 20% of PDs would want the level to be lower to allow a fellow to graduate, was 3, which corresponded to requiring supervision for both simple and complex cases. There was a statistically significant difference between the minimum level of supervision deemed necessary by PDs for graduation and for practice as a subspecialist for each of the EPAs. <b>Conclusion:</b> Most pediatric pulmonary PDs reported that they would graduate fellows who may still require indirect supervision for the five pediatric pulmonology EPAs.

34409418,COVID-19 Impact on Interventional Pulmonology Training.,"<b>Background:</b> The impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic extends beyond the realms of patient care and healthcare resource use to include medical education; however, the repercussions of COVID-19 on the quality of training and trainee perceptions have yet to be explored. <b>Objective:</b> The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of interventional pulmonology (IP) fellows' involvement in the care of COVID-19 and its impact on fellows' clinical education, procedure skills, and postgraduation employment search. <b>Methods:</b> An internet-based survey was validated and distributed among IP fellows in North American fellowship training programs. <b>Results:</b> Of 40 eligible fellows, 38 (95%) completed the survey. A majority of fellows (76%) reported involvement in the care of patients with COVID-19. Fellows training in the Northeast United States reported involvement in the care of a higher number of patients with COVID-19 than in other regions (median, 30 [interquartile range, 20-50] vs. 10 [5-13], respectively; <i>P</i> < 0.01). Fifty-two percent of fellows reported redeployment outside IP during COVID-19, mostly into intensive care units. IP procedure volume decreased by 21% during COVID-19 compared with pre-COVID-19 volume. This decrease was mainly accounted for by a reduction in bronchoscopies. A majority of fellows (82%) reported retainment of outpatient clinics during COVID-19 with the transition from face-to-face to telehealth-predominant format. Continuation of academic and research activities during COVID-19 was reported by 86% and 82% of fellows, respectively. After graduation, all fellows reported having secured employment positions. <b>Conclusion:</b> Although IP fellows were extensively involved in the care of patients with COVID-19, most IP programs retained educational activities through the COVID-19 outbreak.

We aimed to determine whether peripheral eosinophils upon COPD diagnosis could affect the frequency and severity of annual acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). This prospective study was conducted on 973 newly diagnosed COPD patients who were under 1-year follow-up in a pulmonology center in Iran. The Cox proportional model, polynomial regression, and receiver operator characteristic curves were conducted to evaluate the impact of the eosinophil levels on AECOPD. A linear regression model was conducted to evaluate the continuous association of eosinophilic count with AECOPDs. Patients with eosinophil >200 cells/microliter were higher pack-year smokers with more pulmonary hypertension prevalence compared to COPD patients with <200 cells/microliter. There was a positive correlation between the eosinophilic count and the frequency of AECOPDs. Eosinophil >900 cells/microliter and eosinophil >600 cells/microliter had a sensitivity of 71.1% and 64.3%, respectively, in predicting the occurrence of more than one AECOPD. Eosinophilic count cutoff of 800 cells/microliter had the highest Youden index with sensitivity and specificity of 80.2% and 76.6%, respectively, for incident AECOPD in newly diagnosed patients. Using a linear model, increasing 180 cells/microliter in serum eosinophils was associated with further exacerbation. Evaluating gender, BMI, smoking pack-year, FEV1/FVC, CAT score, GOLD score, pulmonary hypertension, annual influenza, pneumococcal vaccinations, leukocytosis, and blood eosinophils, only blood eosinophils (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.44; 95% confidence interval = 1.33-2.15; <i>p</i> value = 0.03) and GOLD score (HR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.30-1.52; <i>p</i> value = 0.03) were found as independent risk factors of AECOPD >3 episodes/year. Requirement for ICU admission, invasive ventilation, and mortality rate due to AECOPDs was similar between eosinophilic and noneosinophilic groups.

39315549,Fibroblast-derived extracellular vesicles contain SFRP1 and mediate pulmonary fibrosis.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal chronic lung disease characterized by aberrant intercellular communication, extracellular matrix deposition, and destruction of functional lung tissue. While extracellular vesicles (EVs) accumulate in the IPF lung, their cargo and biological effects remain unclear. We interrogated the proteome of EV and non-EV fractions during pulmonary fibrosis and characterized their contribution to fibrosis. EVs accumulated 14 days after bleomycin challenge, correlating with decreased lung function and initiated fibrogenesis in healthy precision-cut lung slices. Label-free proteomics of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid EVs (BALF-EVs) collected from mice challenged with bleomycin or control identified 107 proteins enriched in fibrotic vesicles. Multiomic analysis revealed fibroblasts as a major cellular source of BALF-EV cargo, which was enriched in secreted frizzled related protein 1 (SFRP1). Sfrp1 deficiency inhibited the activity of fibroblast-derived EVs to potentiate lung fibrosis in vivo. SFRP1 led to increased transitional cell markers, such as keratin 8, and WNT/β-catenin signaling in primary alveolar type 2 cells. SFRP1 was expressed within the IPF lung and localized at the surface of EVs from patient-derived fibroblasts and BALF.

This study was designed to provide an up-to-date snapshot of patient and disease characteristics, treatment pathways, and healthcare resource use (HRU) in COPD in real life, and comprehensively examine patients considering GOLD 2019 recommendations. This mixed design, observational, multicenter (14 pulmonology clinics) study included all patients with a documented COPD diagnosis (excluding asthma-COPD overlap [ACO]) for ≥12 months, aged ≥40 years at diagnosis who had a COPD-related hospital visit, spirometry test and blood eosinophil count (BEC) measurement under stable conditions within the 12 months before enrollment between February and December 2020. Data were collected cross-sectionally from patients and retrospectively from hospital medical records. This study included 522 patients (GOLD group A: 17.2%, B: 46.4%, C: 3.3%, D: 33.1%), of whom 79.5% were highly symptomatic and 36.2% had high risk of exacerbation. Exacerbations (n = 832; 46.6% moderate, 25.5% severe) were experienced by 57.5% of patients in the previous 12 months. Inter-rater agreement between investigators and patients regarding the reason for visit was low (κ coefficient: 0.338, p = 0.001). Inhaled treatment was modified in 88 patients at index, mainly due to symptomatic state (31.8%) and exacerbations (27.3%); treatment was escalated (57.9%, mainly switched to LABA+LAMA+ICS), inhaler device and/or active ingredient was changed (36.4%) or treatment was de-escalated (5.7%). 27% had ≥1 hospital overnight stay over 12 months. Emergency department visits and days with limitation of daily activities were higher in group D (p < 0.001). Despite being on-treatment, many patients with COPD experience persistent symptoms and exacerbations requiring hospital-related HRU.

We intend to investigate the association between serum albumin (SA) and lung function among U.S. adolescents. This cross-sectional study included 3,072 adolescents (aged 12 to 19) from 2007 to 2012National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). PFTs, including forced vital capacity (FVC)%predicted, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)%predicted, FEV1/FVC%predicted, and maximum mid-expiratory flow (FEF25-75) % predicted, were utilized to assess the association between serum albumin levels and lung function. To explore the potential associations between SA and pulmonary function, we employed multivariate linear regression, subgroup analysis, smoothing curve fitting and threshold effect. A positive correlation was observed between serum albumin levels and pulmonary function. In the model with a fully adjusted, each 1 g/dL serum albumin increase in SA corresponded to an increase of 2.69% in FVC%pred, 5.8% in FEV1%pred, 10.99% in FEF25-75%pred and 2.98% in FEV1/FVC%pred. This association between SA and FEV1%pred differed across gender subgroups. A non-linear relationship was observed between SA and FEV1/FVC%pred. Our results demonstrated a positive correlation between SA and lung function, suggesting a novel modality for evaluating pulmonary function, specifically in children.

32128790,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension: Heracles meets the Hydra.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease where the additional presence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) reduces survival. In particular, the presence of coexistent pulmonary vascular disease in patients with advanced lung parenchymal disease results in worse outcomes than either diagnosis alone. This is true with respect to the natural histories of these diseases, outcomes with medical therapies, and even outcomes following lung transplantation. Consequently, there is a striking need for improved treatments for PH in the setting of IPF. In this review, we summarize existing therapies from the perspective of molecular mechanisms underlying lung fibrosis and vasoconstriction/vascular remodelling and discuss potential future targets for pharmacotherapy.

Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine: Pulmonary Infections.,"The following is a concise review of the Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine Core reviewing pediatric pulmonary infections, diagnostic assays, and imaging techniques presented at the 2021 American Thoracic Society Core Curriculum. Molecular methods have revolutionized microbiology. We highlight the need to collect appropriate samples for detection of specific pathogens or for panels and understand the limitations of the assays. Considerable progress has been made in imaging modalities for detecting pediatric pulmonary infections. Specifically, lung ultrasound and lung magnetic resonance imaging are promising radiation-free diagnostic tools, with results comparable with their radiation-exposing counterparts, for the evaluation and management of pulmonary infections. Clinicians caring for children with pulmonary disease should ensure that patients at risk for nontuberculous mycobacteria disease are identified and receive appropriate nontuberculous mycobacteria screening, monitoring, and treatment. Children with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) typically present with mild symptoms, but some may develop severe disease. Treatment is mainly supportive care, and most patients make a full recovery. Anticipatory guidance and appropriate counseling from pediatricians on social distancing and diagnostic testing remain vital to curbing the pandemic. The pediatric immunocompromised patient is at risk for invasive and opportunistic pulmonary infections. Prompt recognition of predisposing risk factors, combined with knowledge of clinical characteristics of microbial pathogens, can assist in the diagnosis and treatment of specific bacterial, viral, or fungal diseases.",ATS scholar,2021-Sep,"Gross JE, McCown MY, Okorie CUA, Bishay LC, Dy FJ, Astudillo CL, Muhlebach MS, Abu-Nassar S, Chen DY, Hossain N, Wang R, Klouda T, Martiniano SL, Lenhart-Pendergrass P, Kirkby S, Ortenberg R, McSparron JI, Wang T, Hayes MM, Çoruh B",20,1671,pulmonology,2025-11-22
35242725,Biological Treatments and Target Therapies for Pediatric Respiratory Medicine: Not Only Asthma.,"We present a description of pediatric pneumology biological medications and other target therapies. The article aims at introducing the importance of a molecular approach to improve treatments. The first item treated was T2-High asthma and its current biological treatment and prescribing indications to propose a flow-chart to guide the clinical choice. Molecular rationales of such treatments are used to introduce a more general description of the biological and molecular approach to target therapies application. We introduce a general interpretation approach to neutrophilic asthma using the molecular plausibility one in order to propose possible future treatments mainly targeting interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-17, IL-12, and IL-23. Indeed, cytokines can be excellent targets for several biological treatments. Downregulation of specific cytokines can be crucial in treating autoinflammatory and rheumatological diseases with a pulmonary involvement. Such conditions, although rare, should be early recognized as they can involve significant improvement with a properly targeted therapy. We face these conditions in a cherry-picking fashion picturing SAVI (STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy), CANDLE (chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature), and COPA (coat proteins alpha syndrome) syndrome pulmonary involvement. Such examples are functional to introduce molecular-based approach for patients with rare conditions. Molecular plausibility can be highly valuable in treating patients with not-approved but possibly highly effective therapies. Due to the rarity of these conditions, we stress the concept of basket trials using the example of cytokinin-directed immunosuppressive treatment. Lastly, we provide an example of augmentative therapy using the alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency as a model. In summary, the article presents a collection of the most recent achievements and some possible future developments of target therapies for pediatric pulmonary conditions.",Frontiers in pediatrics,2022-,"Ghirardo S, Mazzolai M, Di Marco A, Petreschi F, Ullmann N, Ciofi Degli Atti ML, Cutrera R",7,2033,pulmonology,2025-11-22
35715334,Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) amylase and pepsin levels as potential biomarkers of aspiration pneumonia.,"There are currently no established markers for aspiration pneumonia. We hypothesized that bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) amylase and pepsin might be candidate biomarkers for aspiration pneumonia. This cross-sectional study reviewed consenting adults who underwent clinically-indicated bronchoscopy at Aizu Medical Center. BAL samples were obtained using standardized methods. Amylase levels were measured in our clinical laboratory, and pepsin levels were assessed by ELISA. Aspiration pneumonia was clinically diagnosed based on the guidelines of the Japanese Respiratory Society in 48 of the 327 participants. Median BAL salivary amylase and pepsin levels in this group were 702.0 U/L and 12.7 ng/ml respectively, which were significantly higher than in non-aspiration pneumonia patients. BAL amylase ≥204 U/L had 77.1% sensitivity and 84.2% specificity as a diagnostic index, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.859 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.803-0.915). Similarly, BAL pepsin levels of ≥7.45 ng/ml had 87.2% sensitivity and 59.9% specificity for identifying aspiration, and the area under the ROC curve was 0.757 (95% CI, 0.688-0.826). Multivariate regression demonstrated that BAL amylase ≥204 U/L and BAL pepsin ≥7.45 ng/ml were associated with significantly higher odds for aspiration pneumonia (odds ratio (OR) 10.0, 95% CI, 4.51-22.2, and OR 8.81 95% CI, 3.32-23.4, respectively). There were no significant associations between risk factors for aspiration pneumonia and BAL amylase and pepsin levels. BAL amylase and pepsin might be useful biomarkers for suggesting aspiration pneumonia, and could be objective markers without relying on known risk factors for aspiration.",Pulmonology,2023-,"Suzuki T, Saitou M, Utano Y, Utano K, Niitsuma K",5,1724,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Europe had 97 respondents from 22 countries. There were 8 respondents from Australia, 7 from Africa (3 countries) and 7 from 4 countries in South America (SA). North America (NA) had 72 respondents from 3 countries. Asia had 78 respondents from 14 countries. For stent placements 15% [41] used fiberoptic bronchoscope (FB) only. Rigid bronchoscopy (RB) was solely utilized by 38% [102]. Forty-six percent [123] used a combination of RB and FB (P value <0.00001). For stent extraction 13% [19] used FB alone, 57% [85] used RB, and 36% [54] used a combination of RB and FB (P value <0.00001). Placement of stents were 50.5% [135] only by direct visualization. Twenty-three percent [61] always used fluoroscopic guidance. Twenty-six-point-five percent [71] used fluoroscopy in certain cases (P value <0.00001). Sixty percent [162] decided stent sizing by measurements of stenotic and non-stenotic areas on radiology. Twelve percent [32] respondents used sizing devices. Sixty-five percent [177] used a ruler and bronchoscope to measure stenotic areas. Thirty-eight percent [104] used visual estimation and experience. Seven percent [19] used serial balloon dilatation size. To prevent clogging of stents, 22% [59] prescribed mucolytics. Seventy-three percent [195] nebulized saline, 26% [70] had Mucomyst Nebulization, 24% [65] Nebulized bronchodilators and other methods 11% [30] were advised.

38964802,Bronchoscopy with and without needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy for peripheral lung nodule diagnosis: protocol for a multicentre randomised controlled trial (CLEVER trial).,"Despite many technological advances, the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopic peripheral lung nodule analysis remains limited due to frequent mispositioning. Needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (nCLE) enables real-time microscopic feedback on needle positioning, potentially improving the sampling location and diagnostic yield. Previous studies have defined and validated nCLE criteria for malignancy, airway and lung parenchyma. Larger studies demonstrating the effect of nCLE on diagnostic yield are lacking. We aim to investigate if nCLE-imaging integrated with conventional bronchoscopy results in a higher diagnostic yield compared with conventional bronchoscopy without nCLE. This is a parallel-group randomised controlled trial. Recruitment is performed at pulmonology outpatient clinics in universities and general hospitals in six different European countries and one hospital in the USA. Consecutive patients with a for malignancy suspected peripheral lung nodule (10-30 mm) with an indication for diagnostic bronchoscopy will be screened, and 208 patients will be included. Web-based randomisation (1:1) between the two procedures will be performed. The primary outcome is diagnostic yield. Secondary outcomes include diagnostic sensitivity for malignancy, needle repositionings, procedure and fluoroscopy duration, and complications. Pathologists will be blinded to procedure type; patients and endoscopists will not. Primary approval by the Ethics Committee of the Amsterdam University Medical Center.

36675338,The Influence of Methods for Cardiac Output Determination on the Diagnosis of Precapillary Pulmonary Hypertension: A Mathematical Model.,"Background: precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH, PcPH) is now defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) > 20 mmHg, a pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) ≤ 15 mmHg and a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) > 2 WU. For PVR calculation, the measurement of cardiac output (CO) is necessary. It is generally measured using thermodilution. However, recent data showed that the agreement with direct Fick method, historically the gold standard, is less than previously reported. We aimed to create a mathematical model that calculated the probability of being classified differently (PcPH or unclassified PH) if CO measured by direct Fick was used instead of thermodilution for any individual patients with a mPAP > 20 mmHg and a PAWP ≤ 15 mmHg. Methods: The model is based on Bland and Altman analysis with a normally distributed difference of cardiac output, fixed 1.96 standard deviation of bias, bias and physiological cardiac output limits. Results: Following a literature review of the studies comparing CO measured with direct Fick and thermodilution, we fixed the 1.96 standard deviation of bias at 2 L/min, bias at 0 L/min and physiological resting CO limits between 1.3 L/min and 10.2 L/min. Conclusions: This model can help the clinician to evaluate the potential benefit of measuring CO using direct Fick during the diagnostic work-up and its utility in confirming or ruling out a diagnosis of PcPH in any given patient with a mPAP > 20 mmHg and a PAWP ≤ 15 mmHg.",Journal of clinical medicine,2023-Jan,"Genecand L, Simian G, Desponds R, Wacker J, Ulrich S, Lechartier B, Fellrath JM, Sitbon O, Beghetti M, Lador F",10,1484,pulmonology,2025-11-22
32518088,Local Effects of Two Intravenous Formulations of Pulmonary Vasodilators on Airway Epithelium.,"Intravenous formulations of epoprostenol are frequently delivered via nebulizer to treat pulmonary hypertension in acutely ill patients. Although their efficacy as pulmonary vasodilators has been shown to be comparable to inhaled nitric oxide, the local effects of these formulations within the airways have not been determined. We hypothesized that the alkaline diluents of these compounds would lead to increased airway epithelial cell death and ciliary cessation. Human bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to epoprostenol in glycine and arginine diluents or control fluid. Ciliary beat frequency, lactate dehydrogenase, and total RNA levels were measured before and after exposure. Results were compared between exposure and control groups. Ciliary beat frequency ceased immediately after exposure to epoprostenol with both diluents. Lactate dehydrogenase levels increased by 200% after exposure to epoprostenol and glycine diluent (<i>P</i> = .002). Total RNA levels were undetectable after exposure to epoprostenol and arginine, indicating complete cell death and lysis (<i>P</i> = .015). Ciliary beat frequency ceased after 30 s of exposure to epoprostenol and glycine (<i>P</i> = .008). There was no difference between cells exposed to epoprostenol and those exposed only to diluent. Exposure to intravenous formulations of epoprostenol in glycine and arginine caused increased cell death and ciliary cessation in bronchial epithelial cells. These findings suggest that undesired local effects may occur when these compounds are delivered as inhaled aerosols to patients.",Respiratory care,2020-Oct,"Kuch BA, Linssen R, Yoshikawa H, Smallwood CD, Davis MD",5,1582,pulmonology,2025-11-22
34067607,Increased Incidence and Associated Risk Factors of Aspergillosis in Patients with Bronchiectasis.,"There are insufficient data regarding the relationship between non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and incident aspergillosis. We performed a population-based, matched cohort study using data from the Korean National Health Insurance database between 2003 and 2013. The incidence of aspergillosis was 50/100,000 person-years in the bronchiectasis cohort and 11/100,000 person-years in the matched cohort (subdistribution hazard ratio, 4.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.25-6.32). Among the bronchiectasis cohort, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (adjusted HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.07-3.57), previous pulmonary tuberculosis (adjusted HR, 3.67; 95% CI, 2.03-6.64), and non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (adjusted HR, 11.25; 95% CI, 1.49-85.18) increased the risk of incident aspergillosis. The incidence of aspergillosis in patients with bronchiectasis was approximately 4.5-fold that in those without bronchiectasis. Comorbid pulmonary diseases-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous pulmonary tuberculosis, and non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease-significantly increased the risk of aspergillosis in patients with bronchiectasis.

Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) presents as a large mediastinal mass, posing risks to the cardiopulmonary safety of patients and challenging the routine approach to diagnosis. We describe a case of a 23-year-old male sailor who presented to sick call on his ship while in port with shortness of breath, night sweats, 50-pound weight loss, and pruritic punched-out lesions on all extremities. An initial chest X-ray showed a large consolidation. After being seen in the pulmonary medicine clinic 5 weeks after his initial presentation, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit after computed tomography of his chest revealed a mediastinal mass, causing compression of both the right bronchus and superior vena cava with a large pericardial effusion. Empiric high-dose dexamethasone was initiated before a formal diagnosis due to his significant risk for cardiopulmonary compromise. Following diagnosis and two cycles of chemotherapy, the patient was transferred to a medical oncology facility in the continental USA.

35902671,Effect of hyperhomocysteinemia on a murine model of smoke-induced pulmonary emphysema.,"Hyperhomocysteinemia was reported to enhance endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and subsequent apoptosis in several cells. However, the precise mechanisms of smoking susceptibility associated with hyperhomocysteinemia has not been fully elucidated. This study included 7- to 9-week-old C57BL6 male mice induced with hyperhomocysteinemia and were exposed to cigarette smoke (CS). A549 cells (human alveolar epithelial cell line) were cultured with homocysteine and were exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) to observe cell viability and expression of proteins related to the ER stress. After 6 months of CS exposure, pulmonary emphysema was more severely induced in the group under the condition of hyperhomocysteinemia compared to that in the control group. The apoptotic A549 cells increased as homocysteine concentration increased and that was enhanced by CSE. Protein expression levels of ER stress markers were significantly increased after simultaneous stimulation. Notably, vitamin B12 and folate supplementation improved ER stress after simultaneous stimulation of A549 cells. In this study, we showed that hyperhomocysteinemia exacerbates CS exposure-induced emphysema in mice, suggesting that hyperhomocysteinemia and CS stimulation enhance ER stress and subsequent induced apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells. It was suggested that there is a synergistic effect between homocysteine and CS.",Scientific reports,2022-Jul,"Nakano H, Inoue S, Minegishi Y, Igarashi A, Tokairin Y, Yamauchi K, Kimura T, Nishiwaki M, Nemoto T, Otaki Y, Sato M, Sato K, Machida H, Yang S, Murano H, Watanabe M, Shibata Y",17,1406,pulmonology,2025-11-22

38034137,Oscillometry in Lung Function Assessment: A Comprehensive Review of Current Insights and Challenges.,"Oscillometry, a non-invasive technique for assessing lung function, has gained significant recognition and importance in modern pulmonary medicine. This comprehensive review thoroughly explores its principles, applications, advantages, limitations, recent innovations, and future directions. Oscillometry's primary strength lies in its ability to offer a holistic assessment of lung mechanics. Unlike traditional spirometry, oscillometry captures the natural airflow during quiet breathing, making it suitable for patients of all ages and those with severe respiratory conditions. It provides a comprehensive evaluation of airway resistance, reactance, and compliance, offering insights into lung function that were previously challenging to obtain. In clinical practice, oscillometry finds extensive application in diagnosing and managing respiratory diseases. It plays a pivotal role in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and interstitial lung diseases. By detecting subtle changes in lung function before symptoms manifest, oscillometry facilitates early interventions, improving disease management and patient outcomes. Oscillometry's non-invasive and patient-friendly nature is precious in pediatric care, where traditional spirometry may be challenging for young patients. It aids in diagnosing and monitoring pediatric respiratory disorders, ensuring that children receive the care they need from an early age. Despite its many advantages, oscillometry faces challenges, such as the need for standardized protocols and the complexity of data interpretation. However, ongoing efforts to establish global standards and provide education and training for healthcare professionals aim to address these issues. Looking ahead, oscillometry holds great promise in the field of personalized medicine. With its ability to tailor treatment plans based on individualized lung function data, healthcare providers can optimize therapy selection and dosing, ultimately improving patient care and quality of life. In conclusion, oscillometry is poised to play an increasingly pivotal role in modern pulmonary medicine. As standardization efforts continue and technology evolves, it is an indispensable tool in the clinician's arsenal for diagnosing, managing, and personalizing respiratory care, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and better respiratory health.",Cureus,2023-Oct,"Sarkar S, Jadhav U, Ghewade B, Sarkar S, Wagh P",5,2385,pulmonology,2025-11-22
33473377,Pediatric Resident Education in Pulmonary (PREP): A Subspecialty Preparatory Boot Camp Curriculum for Pediatric Residents.,"Medical errors can occur any time resident physicians transition between rotations, especially to unfamiliar areas such as subspecialty pediatrics. To combat this, we created and implemented the pediatric resident education in pulmonary (PREP) boot camp using Kern's six-step approach to curriculum development. PREP was a 5-hour session with multiple high-yield components held on the first day of each new rotation, aimed to prepare residents to care for complex pulmonary inpatients, including those with tracheostomy and ventilator dependence, asthma, and cystic fibrosis. The curriculum was evaluated at multiple time points through surveys of residents and faculty and two formal resident focus group sessions. PREP was successfully implemented in July 2018 with continued monthly sessions held. Thirty-five residents participated in the first year. Resident perceived preparedness and confidence in taking call duties increased significantly following PREP. All residents rated PREP as <i>extremely helpful</i> or <i>very helpful</i>, the highest ratings possible. Overall, residents preferred active learning strategies. All qualitative data revealed positive effects of PREP. Clinical faculty in the pulmonology division found PREP similarly helpful and felt that PREP better prepared residents to provide care to pulmonary inpatients than our previous model. Our monthly preparatory boot camp on the first day of residents' inpatient pulmonary rotation has improved resident experience, preparedness, and ability to care for complex pulmonary patients. The curriculum was adjusted in response to feedback to increase hands-on time and interactive sessions. Protected time for residents and active learning strategies were key to success of PREP.",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,2021-Jan,"Khan EK, Liptzin DR, Baker J, Meier M, Baker CD, Lockspeiser TM",6,1755,pulmonology,2025-11-22
34409415,"Understanding the ""Social"" in ""Social Media"". An Analysis of Twitter Engagement of Pulmonary and Critical Care Fellowship Programs.","<b>Background:</b> Social media is ubiquitous as a tool for collaboration, networking, and dissemination. However, little is known about use of social media platforms by pulmonary and critical care medicine fellowship programs. <b>Objective:</b> We identify and characterize pulmonary and critical care fellowship programs using Twitter and Instagram, as well as the posting behaviors of their social media accounts. <b>Methods:</b> We identified all adult and pediatric pulmonary, critical care medicine (CCM), and combined pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM) programs in the United States using the Electronic Residency Application Service. We searched for Twitter profiles for each program between January 1, 2018, and September 30, 2018. Tweets and Twitter interactions were classified into the following three types: social, clinical, or medical education (MedEd) related. We collected data about content enhancements of tweets, including the use of pictures, graphics interchange format or videos, hashtags, links, and tagging other accounts. The types of tweets, content enhancement characteristics, and measures of engagement were analyzed for association with number of followers. <b>Results:</b> We assessed 341 programs, including 163 PCCM, 36 adult CCM, 20 adult pulmonary, 67 pediatric CCM, and 55 pediatric pulmonary programs. Thirty-three (10%) programs had Twitter accounts. Of 1,903 tweets by 33 of the 341 programs with Twitter accounts, 476 (25%) were MedEd related, 733 (39%) were clinical, and 694 (36%) were social. The median rate of tweets per month was 1.65 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.4-6.65), with 55% programs tweeting more than monthly. Accounts tweeting more often had significantly more followers than those tweeting less frequently (median, 240 followers; 25-75% IQR, 164-388 vs. median, 107 followers; 25-75% IQR, 13-188; <i>P</i> = 0.006). Higher engagement with clinical and social Twitter interactions (tweets, retweets, likes, and comments) was associated with more followers but not for the MedEd-related Twitter interactions. All types of content enhancements (pictures, graphics interchange format/videos, links, and tagging) were associated with a higher number of followers, except for hashtags. <b>Conclusion:</b> Despite the steadily increasing use of social media in medicine, only 10% of the pulmonary and critical care fellowship programs in the United States have Twitter accounts. Social and clinical content appears to gain traction online; however, additional evaluation is needed on how to effectively engage audiences with MedEd content.",ATS scholar,2021-Jun,"Gandotra S, Stewart NH, Khateeb D, Garcha P, Carlos WG, Carroll CL, Kaul V",7,2600,pulmonology,2025-11-22
33666365,Chronic respiratory failure in bronchopulmonary dysplasia.,"Although survival has improved dramatically for extremely preterm infants, those with the most severe forms of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) fail to improve in the neonatal period and go on to develop chronic respiratory failure. When careful weaning of respiratory support is not tolerated, the difficult decision of whether or not to pursue chronic ventilation via tracheostomy must be made. This requires shared decision-making with an interdisciplinary medical team and the child's family. Although they suffer from increased morbidity and mortality, the majority of these children will survive to tolerate ventilator liberation and tracheostomy decannulation. Care coordination for the technology-dependent preterm infant is complex, but there is a growing consensus that chronic ventilation can best support neurodevelopmental progress and improve long-term outcomes.",Pediatric pulmonology,2021-Nov,Baker CD,1,876,pulmonology,2025-11-22
37942820,Bronchoscopic interventions for chronic bronchitis.,"Chronic bronchitis is a phenotype of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), characterized by chronic cough and sputum production, associated with an increased rate of COPD exacerbations and hospital admissions, a more rapid decline in lung function and reduced life expectancy. Despite optimal medical therapy, chronic bronchitis remains difficult to treat. Interventional bronchoscopic procedures offer novel therapeutic approaches to this highly symptomatic condition. A characteristic feature of chronic bronchitis is the presence of an abnormal epithelium with excessive mucus producing cells, parasympathetic overactivity, and airway inflammation. Metered cryospray and bronchial rheoplasty are designed to target this abnormal epithelium to reduce mucus production and inflammation. Targeted lung denervation aims to reduce parasympathetic overactivity, which may drive mucus hypersecretion. Here, we review the available evidence to determine the safety and efficacy across the bronchoscopic interventions. Interventional bronchoscopy is a rapidly expanding field and its application in the treatment of chronic bronchitis has been recognized by the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD). The outcomes from the latest clinical trials will guide future treatment approaches in patients with difficult to treat chronic bronchitis.",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,2024-Jan,"Tana A, Zhang C, DiBardino D, Orton CM, Shah PL",5,1366,pulmonology,2025-11-22
36786105,Identification and management of connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease: evidence-based Japanese consensus statements.,"Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common complication of connective tissue diseases (CTD), but there are few clinical trials to guide disease management. We aimed to develop expert consensus statements and an algorithm for CTD-ILD management. Based on a targeted literature review, we developed 109 statements on managing CTD-ILD across six domains. We used a modified Delphi process to survey 22 physicians in Japan involved in managing CTD-ILD (specialists in pulmonology, rheumatology, pathology, and radiology). These panelists participated in two rounds of web-based survey to establish consensus statements, which were used to define an algorithm. Consensus was defined as a mean value ≥70 on a scale of 0 (strong disagreement) to 100 (strong agreement). Between May-August 2022, consensus was reached on 93 statements on CTD-ILD management. The most important consensus statements included screening CTD patients for ILD (typically with high-resolution computed tomography), using imaging, pulmonary function testing and serum biomarkers for diagnosis and severity assessment, regularly following up patients, and multidisciplinary management of CTD-ILD. Consensus statements were interpreted into an algorithm for clinical guidance. Using the Delphi process, we have developed consensus statements and an algorithm to guide clinical decision-making for CTD-ILD.",Expert review of respiratory medicine,2023-Jan,"Kuwana M, Bando M, Kawahito Y, Sato S, Suda T, Kondoh Y",6,1372,pulmonology,2025-11-22
37961357,Pulmonary Ventilation Analysis Using <sup>1</sup>H Ultra-Short Echo Time (UTE) Lung MRI: A Reproducibility Study.,"To evaluate methods for quantification of pulmonary ventilation with ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI. We performed a reproducibility study, acquiring two free-breathing <sup>1</sup>H UTE lung MRIs on the same day for six healthy volunteers. The 1) 3D + t cyclic b-spline and 2) symmetric image normalization (SyN) methods for image registration were applied after respiratory phase-resolved image reconstruction. Ventilation maps were calculated using 1) Jacobian determinant of the deformation fields minus one, termed regional ventilation, and 2) intensity percentage difference between the registered and fixed image, termed specific ventilation. We compared the reproducibility of all four method combinations via statistical analysis. Split violin plots and Bland-Altman plots are shown for whole lungs and lung sections. The cyclic b-spline registration and Jacobian determinant regional ventilation quantification provide total ventilation volumes that match the segmentation tidal volume, smooth and uniform ventilation maps. The cyclic b-spline registration and specific ventilation combination yields the smallest standard deviation in the Bland-Altman plot. Cyclic registration performs better than SyN for respiratory phase-resolved <sup>1</sup>H UTE MRI ventilation quantification. Regional ventilation correlates better with segmentation lung volume, while specific ventilation is more reproducible.",bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023-Oct,"Tan F, Zhu X, Chan M, Deveshwar N, Willmering MM, Lustig M, Larson PEZ",7,1412,pulmonology,2025-11-22
33974362,Sleep in children with cystic fibrosis: More under the covers.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic multisystem disease with manifestations from birth. It involves the entire respiratory system, with increased cough, and recurrent pulmonary infections, and it also leads to intestinal malabsorption, all of which can have an impact on sleep. In this review, we summarize the available literature on the various sleep disturbances in children with CF. Sleep quality and sleep efficiency are often impaired in children with CF. They may be accompanied by symptoms associated with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), and objective findings, such as nocturnal hypoxemia. Importantly, a strong association has been shown between SDB and the severity of lung disease, and some studies have reported a similar association for sleep quality. Further research is needed to better characterize the association of sleep disturbances with respiratory outcomes and the impact of treatment of sleep disorders on pulmonary status in children with CF.",Pediatric pulmonology,2022-Aug,"Reiter J, Breuer O, Cohen-Cymberknoh M, Forno E, Gileles-Hillel A",5,967,pulmonology,2025-11-22
32500120,CRISPRi-mediated functional analysis of lung disease-associated loci at non-coding regions.,"Genome-wide association studies have identified lung disease-associated loci; however, the functions of such loci are not well understood in part because the majority of such loci are located at non-coding regions. Hi-C, ChIP-seq and eQTL data predict potential roles (e.g. enhancer) of such loci; however, they do not elucidate the molecular function. To determine whether these loci function as gene-regulatory regions, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi; CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB) has been recently used. Here, we applied CRISPRi along with Hi-C, ChIP-seq and eQTL to determine the functional roles of loci established as highly associated with asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Notably, Hi-C, ChIP-seq and eQTL predicted that non-coding regions located at chromosome 19q13 or chromosome 17q21 harboring single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to asthma/CF/COPD and chromosome 11p15 harboring an SNP linked to IPF interact with nearby genes and function as enhancers; however, CRISPRi indicated that the regions with rs1800469, rs2241712, rs12603332 and rs35705950, but not others, regulate the expression of nearby genes (single or multiple genes).

37795123,Pediatric Pulmonary Fellowship Program Size Effect on Recruitment and Workforce Distribution.,"Concerns about the pediatric pulmonology workforce suggest a need to improve fellowship recruitment. Program size is related to the financial health and recruitment success of pediatric subspecialty education programs, but there are few data on how program size impacts recruitment and workforce in pediatric pulmonology. Assess the impact of program size in pediatric pulmonology through examination of the distribution of applicants matching into pediatric pulmonology training programs over time and relationships to workforce distribution. Data from the National Residency Match Program from 2010 to 2022 were extracted from published documents. Positions offered, positioned filled, and match rates were calculated for each appointment year. Statewide statistics for the number of fellows matched were analyzed relative to the number of pediatric pulmonologists per capita using data from the American Board of Pediatrics. From 2010 to 2018, the size and distribution of programs in pediatric pulmonology were stable, with most fellows (82.4%) matching into programs with one or two positions per cycle. Starting in 2019, programs offering three or more positions steadily increased in number and aggregate positions offered. This change was associated with an increase in total filled positions (38.9 ± 7.3 in 2010-2018 vs. 50.5 ± 8.7 in 2019-2022; <i>P</i> < 0.03) and an increased fraction who matched into larger programs (17.6% in 2010-2018 vs. 36.9% in 2019-2022; <i>P</i> < 0.001). Among states with fellowship programs, the number of fellows matched over the past 5 years correlated with the number of practicing pediatric pulmonologists per capita (<i>r</i> = 0.78; <i>P</i> < 0.001). The period 2019-2022 saw a marked shift of pediatric pulmonary trainees matching into a relatively small number of larger programs. This shift was associated with overall growth in the number of trainees but may have implications on geographical distribution of practicing pediatric pulmonologists.",ATS scholar,2023-Sep,"Esther CR, Rama JA, Nelson BA",3,1997,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Currently, there is no cure for pulmonary fibrosis, and limited therapeutic options are available due to an inadequate understanding of the disease pathogenesis. The absence of advanced <i>in vitro</i> models replicating dynamic temporal changes observed in the tissue with the progression of the disease is a significant impediment in the development of novel antifibrotic treatments, which has motivated research on tissue-mimetic three-dimensional (3D) models. In this review, we summarize emerging trends in preparing advanced lung models to recapitulate biochemical and biomechanical processes associated with lung fibrogenesis. We begin by describing the importance of <i>in vivo</i> studies and highlighting the often poor correlation between preclinical research and clinical outcomes and the limitations of conventional cell culture in accurately simulating the 3D tissue microenvironment. Rapid advancement in biomaterials, biofabrication, biomicrofluidics, and related bioengineering techniques are enabling the preparation of <i>in vitro</i> models to reproduce the epithelium structure and operate as reliable drug screening strategies for precise prediction. Improving and understanding these model systems is necessary to find the cross-talks between growing cells and the stage at which myofibroblasts differentiate. These advanced models allow us to utilize the knowledge and identify, characterize, and hand pick medicines beneficial to the human community.

37128354,Automated quantification of the pulmonary vasculature in pulmonary embolism and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.,"The shape and distribution of vascular lesions in pulmonary embolism (PE) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) are different. We investigated whether automated quantification of pulmonary vascular morphology and densitometry in arteries and veins imaged by computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) could distinguish PE from CTEPH. We analyzed CTPA images from a cohort of 16 PE patients, 6 CTEPH patients, and 15 controls. Pulmonary vessels were extracted with a graph-cut method, and separated into arteries and veins using deep-learning classification. Vascular morphology was quantified by the slope (α) and intercept (β) of the vessel radii distribution. To quantify lung perfusion defects, the median pulmonary vascular density was calculated. By combining these measurements with densities measured in parenchymal areas, pulmonary trunk, and descending aorta, a static perfusion curve was constructed. All separate quantifications were compared between the three groups. No vascular morphology differences were detected in contrast to vascular density values. The median vascular density (interquartile range) was -567 (113), -452 (95), and -470 (323) HU, for the control, PE, and CTEPH group. The static perfusion curves showed different patterns between groups, with a statistically significant difference in aorta-pulmonary trunk gradient between the PE and CTEPH groups (<i>p</i> = 0.008). In this proof of concept study, not vasculature morphology but densities differentiated between patients of three groups. Further technical improvements are needed to allow for accurate differentiation between PE and CTEPH, which in this study was only possible statistically by measuring the density gradient between aorta and pulmonary trunk.",Pulmonary circulation,2023-Apr,"Zhai Z, Boon GJAM, Staring M, van Dam LF, Kroft LJM, Hernández Girón I, Ninaber MK, Bogaard HJ, Meijboom LJ, Vonk Noordegraaf A, Huisman MV, Klok FA, Stoel BC",13,1774,pulmonology,2025-11-22

We performed exome sequencing and validated variant pathogenicity by whole-blood RNA and protein expression analysis in both families. Further RNA sequencing of preserved lung tissue was performed to investigate the consequences on selected genes that are involved in angiogenesis, proliferation, and apoptosis. We identified 2 rare biallelic variants in <i>CAPNS1</i>, encoding the regulatory subunit of calpain. The variants cosegregated with PAH in the families. Both variants lead to loss of function (LoF), which is demonstrated by aberrant splicing resulting in the complete absence of the CAPNS1 protein in affected patients. No other LoF <i>CAPNS1</i> variant was identified in the genome data of more than 1000 patients with unresolved PAH. The calpain holoenzyme was previously linked to pulmonary vascular development and progression of PAH in patients. We demonstrated that biallelic LoF variants in <i>CAPNS1</i> can cause idiopathic PAH by the complete absence of CAPNS1 protein.

Previous breathlessness episodes may influence the perception of subsequent episodes because of psycho-traumatic consequences. In post-traumatic stress disorder, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is the therapy of choice. We explored the hypothesis that EMDR in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and previous severe breathlessness episodes, improves breathlessness mastery by decreasing the anxiety component. As we found no literature on previous research on this subject, we undertook a qualitative case series on four patients with COPD GOLD 4/D and refractory breathlessness who wished to undergo EMDR for psychotraumatic breathlessness episodes. Amongst others, we used the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ) before and after EMDR, and semi-structured, face-to-face, in-depth interviews. All patients had between three and five EMDR sessions. On CRQ, subset mastery, three patients had a large improvement and one patient a moderate improvement. On subset emotional functioning, three patients showed a large improvement and one showed no change. All patients made a distinction between 'regular' breathlessness and breathlessness intertwined with anxiety. They all stated that the anxiety component of their breathlessness diminished or disappeared. All four would recommend EMDR for other COPD patients.

IPF is a rare disease, where the lungs become more and more scarred, with breathing and oxygen uptake becoming increasingly difficult. This trial looked at the medication BI 1015550 as a potential treatment for IPF. It compared BI 1015550 to placebo (a dummy drug that does not contain any active ingredients) to investigate the effectiveness of the drug in treating people with IPF. The study also looked at the additional medical issues (referred to as adverse events) reported during the study. Some participants took approved treatments to reduce scarring (nintedanib or pirfenidone), and some did not. Overall, 147 people with IPF from 22 countries took part in the trial. The results showed that BI 1015550 prevented lung function from decreasing in people with IPF. There was no difference in the percentage of patients with medical issues rated as severe by the study physician with BI 1015550 or placebo. However, more people treated with BI 1015550 had diarrhoea. Among those treated with BI 1015550, 13 participants stopped their treatment due to medical issues, whereas treatment was not stopped due to medical issues for any participants treated with placebo. These results provide evidence that BI 1015550 prevents lung function from worsening in people with IPF.

Methods Individuals who agreed to participate in the Yamagata-Takahata study during medical checkups in Takahata (Yamagata Prefecture, Japan) in 2011 were examined. We interviewed 669 participants (49.0% men; mean age, 67.7 years old) regarding their respiratory symptoms and smoking habits and performed pulmonary function tests during the study. Results Based on pulmonary function test results, 141 participants had pulmonary dysfunction, and 115 had obstructive pulmonary dysfunction. The risk of respiratory dysfunction, particularly obstructive respiratory dysfunction, was examined by referring to a questionnaire tool for an early COPD diagnosis. The associations between age, the smoking history, respiratory symptoms, and obstructive respiratory dysfunction were evaluated. Obstructive respiratory dysfunction was found in 17.6% of participants ≥50 years old and 19.5% ≥60 years old, 30.3% had a smoking history, and 32.8% had respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, the participants with multiple factors had a higher probability of obstructive respiratory dysfunction. Conclusion Subjects with obstructive pulmonary dysfunction are expected to be efficiently identified by extracting individuals by age and smoking habit and through a respiratory symptom questionnaire, although pulmonary function tests cannot be performed for all individuals during health checkups.","Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2024-Apr,"Inoue S, Shibata Y, Miyazaki O, Hanawa T, Minegishi Y, Murano H, Sato K, Kobayashi M, Sato M, Nemoto T, Nishiwaki M, Igarashi A, Ichikawa K, Watanabe T, Watanabe M",15,1645,pulmonology,2025-11-22
36494786,Stratification of COPD patients towards personalized medicine: reproduction and formation of clusters.,"The global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) 2020 emphasizes that there is only a weak correlation between FEV<sub>1</sub>, symptoms and impairment of the health status of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Various studies aimed to identify COPD phenotypes by cluster analyses, but behavioral aspects besides smoking were rarely included. The aims of the study were to investigate whether (i) clustering analyses are in line with the classification into GOLD ABCD groups; (ii) clustering according to Burgel et al. (Eur Respir J. 36(3):531-9, 2010) can be reproduced in a real-world COPD cohort; and (iii) addition of new behavioral variables alters the clustering outcome. Principal component and hierarchical cluster analyses were applied to real-world clinical data of COPD patients newly referred to secondary care (n = 155). We investigated if the obtained clusters paralleled GOLD ABCD subgroups and determined the impact of adding several variables, including quality of life (QOL), fatigue, satisfaction relationship, air trapping, steps per day and activities of daily living, on clustering. Using the appropriate corresponding variables, we identified clusters that largely reflected the GOLD ABCD groups, but we could not reproduce Burgel's clinical phenotypes. Adding six new variables resulted in the formation of four new clusters that mainly differed from each other in the following parameters: number of steps per day, activities of daily living and QOL. We could not reproduce previously identified clinical COPD phenotypes in an independent population of COPD patients.

An extensive literature review was completed to allow for comprehensive evaluation of several monogenic IEI. This review includes a description of the classic clinical features, common infections, characteristic laboratory findings, specific diagnostic methods (when applicable), and genetic basis of disease of each syndrome. A comprehensive flow diagram was created to assist them in the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with elevated IgE levels who may require evaluation for an IEI. IEI should be considered in patients with elevated IgE levels, especially if they have recurrent infections, eczematous dermatitis, malignancy, lymphoproliferation, autoimmunity, or connective tissue abnormalities.","Annals of allergy, asthma & immunology : official publication of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology",2022-Nov,"Khan YW, Williams KW",2,1079,pulmonology,2025-11-22

However, it is unclear which patients may benefit from it and when it is the best time to start treatment. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) is a noninvasive method for assessing lung mechanics that proved sensitive to airway obstruction reversibility in children and adults. FOT does not need patient cooperation, which is ideal for infants. Bedside tools for applying FOT in infants during spontaneous breathing and different respiratory support modes are becoming available. This case report illustrates for the first time that FOT has potential value in assessing airway obstruction reversibility in preterm infants, informing which infants may manifest a clinical benefit from the treatment with bronchodilators.",Pediatric pulmonology,2022-Apr,"Rigotti C, Zannin E, Abdelfattah AS, Ventura ML, Dellacà RL",5,838,pulmonology,2025-11-22

36454643,Culture impact on the transcriptomic programs of primary and iPSC-derived human alveolar type 2 cells.,"Dysfunction of alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AEC2s), the facultative progenitors of lung alveoli, is implicated in pulmonary disease pathogenesis, highlighting the importance of human in vitro models. However, AEC2-like cells in culture have yet to be directly compared to their in vivo counterparts at single-cell resolution. Here, we performed head-to-head comparisons among the transcriptomes of primary (1°) adult human AEC2s, their cultured progeny, and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived AEC2s (iAEC2s). We found each population occupied a distinct transcriptomic space with cultured AEC2s (1° and iAEC2s) exhibiting similarities to and differences from freshly purified 1° cells. Across each cell type, we found an inverse relationship between proliferative and maturation states, with preculture 1° AEC2s being most quiescent/mature and iAEC2s being most proliferative/least mature. Cultures of either type of human AEC2s did not generate detectable alveolar type 1 cells in these defined conditions; however, a subset of iAEC2s cocultured with fibroblasts acquired a transitional cell state described in mice and humans to arise during fibrosis or following injury. Hence, we provide direct comparisons of the transcriptomic programs of 1° and engineered AEC2s, 2 in vitro models that can be harnessed to study human lung health and disease.",JCI insight,2023-Jan,"Alysandratos KD, Garcia-de-Alba C, Yao C, Pessina P, Huang J, Villacorta-Martin C, Hix OT, Minakin K, Burgess CL, Bawa P, Murthy A, Konda B, Beers MF, Stripp BR, Kim CF, Kotton DN",16,1363,pulmonology,2025-11-22

37082705,Prevalence of malnutrition in pediatric pulmonary hypertension cohort and role for registered dietitian involvement.,"Pediatric pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious condition with increased risk for malnutrition due to increased caloric needs and reduced energy intake. This combination of disease and dynamic elements make it particularly challenging to meet expected growth patterns. Pediatric PH patients require close monitoring and individualized nutrition interventions to best meet nutrient needs. The prevalence of malnutrition and effective nutrition interventions in pediatric PH has not been studied. Using our electronic medical record (EMR) patient care dashboard, malnutrition prevalence was assessed by reviewing the active problem list of all active PH patients at our center. A chart review compared patients with diagnosed malnutrition in the EMR to those with malnutrition identified by a registered dietitian (RD) using a standardized tool. Chart reviews also assessed outcomes of RD interventions. 195 patients were identified as active PH patients followed by our PH center during the study period (November 2021 to January 2023). Of these, 5% (10/195) had an ICD-10 code for malnutrition listed in their chart. However, upon further chart review of the remaining 185 patients, 22% (41/185) had malnutrition identified by a RD using Texas Children's Malnutrition Tool, totaling 51/195 (26%) malnourished patients. The PH RD saw 25/51 (49%) patients during PH clinic visits in the study period. At follow up visits (3-4 months after initial assessment), 56% (14/25) patients seen by the PH RD either improved or resolved their malnutrition status by <i>z</i>-score assessment. Malnutrition is present in pediatric PH, although underappreciated and underdiagnosed. Managing malnutrition in pediatric PH requires close monitoring, multidisciplinary involvement, and individualized nutrition recommendations. This is best achieved by a dedicated PH RD who is familiar with the unique needs of this population and available to provide consistent nutritional assessments and interventions to reduce malnutrition in this population.",Frontiers in pediatrics,2023-,"Crowell PR, Frederick MR, Fombin RA, Varghese NP, Ruiz FE",5,2033,pulmonology,2025-11-22
32474057,The effects of hidden female smokers on the association between smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Korean adults.,"Smoking is an important causative factor of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and females are considered more susceptible to the effects of smoking than males. However, in previous Korean studies, the effects of sex differences on the association between smoking and COPD have been controversial. In this study, the effects of sex differences on the association between smoking and COPD and the effects of female hidden smokers on that association in Korean adults were investigated. Data were acquired from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that self-reported smoking status for ex-smoker and current smoker correlated with COPD (odds ratio, OR: 1.67 and OR: 2.41, respectively). Self-reported smoking status for ex-smoker and current smoker correlated with COPD in men (OR: 1.61, OR: 2.43, respectively). Female self-reported current smoking status correlated with COPD (OR: 2.52), but female ex-smoker status was not significantly correlated with COPD. The ratios of cotinine-verified to self-reported smoking rates were 1.95 for women and 1.07 for men. The results of this study were that sex differences might affect the association between COPD and smoking and that female hidden smoking might affect the association between smoking and COPD in Korean adults.",Pulmonology,2021-,"Ock HS, Hwang SW, Lee HJ, Kim CH, Kim SH, Kim TH, Lee JH, Lee JS",8,1367,pulmonology,2025-11-22

It is essential to adequately support the family caregivers of these children to optimize outcomes; however, there is no literature describing interventions for caregivers in this population. This study described a novel behavioral health program and examined its impact on family caregiver engagement and psychological distress on a pediatric inpatient chronic ventilator unit. Electronic chart review was completed with retrospective and prospective participant enrollment for the purposes of longitudinal evaluation of caregiver engagement. For analytic purposes, participants were grouped into three categories: (1) preprogram, (2) postprogram, and (3) postprogram with completion of psychotherapy. The behavioral health program was associated with increased caregiver participation in rounds, t = 7.76, p = < .001. Parents who completed a course of psychotherapy within the behavioral health program demonstrated reduced time to training completion (F = 5.89; p < .01), higher staff-rated caregiver engagement (F = 3.69; p < .05), and significantly reduced levels of caregiver distress (t = 2.09; p < .05).",Pediatric pulmonology,2021-Jun,"Borschuk AP, Williams SE, McClure JM, Kendall M, Mack L, Coleman M, Gurbani N, Benscoter D, Amin R, Stark LJ",10,1193,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Among viral pathogens, coronaviruses have been described to play a role. This study aims to investigate the role of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination on exacerbation reduction in patients with COPD. Patients diagnosed with COPD prior to the study date were considered the study population. Exacerbations of COPD before and after the COVID-19 vaccination were recorded. Patients with influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccination were excluded from the study due to their known role in reducing exacerbations of COPD. The study included 152 patients with a mean age of 67.5 ± 9.7 years. Most patients were classified under Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stages 2 and 3. In fully vaccinated patients, COPD exacerbation was observed to be higher than in those without full vaccination (70.5% vs. 55.3%, respectively). Total risk status and vaccination status, however, were seen to be in a positive correlation, with higher risk and complete vaccination status presenting with a higher count of COPD exacerbation. Although it is known that the administration of COVID-19 vaccines in patients in risk groups reduces the risk of disease, there is no study showing a positive effect on COPD exacerbations alone. In our study, it was observed that only the COVID-19 vaccine was ineffective in attacks without influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.",Cureus,2022-Dec,"Sahin Ozdemirel T, Zenbilli E, Ensarioglu K, Hosgun D, Balkay Babaev B, Ak Ayaroglu M, Ertugrul C, Akıncı Özyürek B",8,1547,pulmonology,2025-11-22
34136443,Predictors of Diffusing Capacity in Children With Sickle Cell Disease: A Longitudinal Study.,"<b>Background:</b> Gas exchange abnormalities in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) may represent cardiopulmonary deterioration. Identifying predictors of these abnormalities in children with SCD (C-SCD) may help us understand disease progression and develop informed management decisions. <b>Objectives:</b> To identify pulmonary function tests (PFT) estimates and biomarkers of disease severity that are associated with and predict abnormal diffusing capacity (DLCO) in C-SCD. <b>Methods:</b> We obtained PFT data from 51 C-SCD (median age:12.4 years, male: female = 29:22) (115 observations) and 22 controls (median age:11.1 years, male: female = 8:14), formulated a rank list of DLCO predictors based on machine learning algorithms (XGBoost) or linear mixed-effect models, and compared estimated DLCO to the measured values. Finally, we evaluated the association between measured or estimated DLCO and clinical outcomes, including SCD crises, pulmonary hypertension, and nocturnal desaturation. <b>Results:</b> Hemoglobin-adjusted DLCO (%) and several PFT indices were diminished in C-SCD compared to controls. Both statistical approaches ranked FVC (%), neutrophils (%), and FEF<sub>25-75</sub> (%) as the top three predictors of DLCO. XGBoost had superior performance compared to the linear model. Both measured and estimated DLCO demonstrated a significant association with SCD severity: higher DLCO, estimated by XGBoost, was associated with fewer SCD crises [beta = -0.084 (95%CI: -0.13, -0.033)] and lower TRJV [beta = -0.009 (-0.017, -0.001)], but not with nocturnal desaturation (<i>p</i> = 0.12). <b>Conclusions:</b> In this cohort of C-CSD, DLCO was associated with PFT estimates representing restrictive lung disease (FVC, TLC), airflow obstruction (FEF<sub>25-75</sub>, FEV1/FVC, R5), and inflammation (neutrophilia). We used these indices to estimate DLCO, and show association with disease outcomes, underscoring the prediction models' clinical relevance.",Frontiers in pediatrics,2021-,"Mondal P, Midya V, Khokhar A, Sathianathan S, Forno E",5,1964,pulmonology,2025-11-22
34051779,Pulmonary Nocardia infection in a child with idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis.,"Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) encompasses a rare and agnogenic group of diffuse alveolar capillary hemorrhagic diseases. Corticosteroid treatment is the globally preferred therapeutic strategy for IPH; however, it can cause immunodeficiency. Nocardia infection often occurs in immunocompromised patients and primarily involves the pleura and lungs. Herein, we describe a case of pediatric pulmonary Nocardia infection after the corticosteroid treatment of IPH. A 7-year-old girl presented with chief complaints of pale complexion persisting for 1 year and a cough for 20 days. Abundant hemosiderin-laden macrophages were detected in the gastric juice, which supported the diagnosis of IPH. Uninterrupted doses of corticosteroids were administered during the last hospitalization. After nearly 2 months of corticosteroids therapy, the patient began to cough and produce a purulent sputum. Next-generation sequencing of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed Nocardia abscessus (N. abscessus) DNA. Linezolid was administered with good response, and the patient was discharged after 18 days of hospitalization. Her symptoms and pulmonary lesions had recovered, and the IPH appeared to be well-controlled with low dose of corticosteroids in follow-up. Nocardia infection should be considered in the differential diagnoses for IPH patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, especially in patients with poor response to conventional empirical antibiotic therapy. Next-generation sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid may be used to quickly identify the Nocardia. Sulfonamides or linezolid are effective for pediatric pulmonary Nocardia infection.",BMC pulmonary medicine,2021-May,"Qin L, Zhang FZ, Yang TY, Tao XF, Tang LF",5,1659,pulmonology,2025-11-22
32561352,Translating Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis guidelines into clinical practice.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive fibrotic interstitial lung disease of unknown cause, which predominantly manifests in older males. IPF diagnosis is a complex, multi-step process and delay in diagnosis cause a negative impact on patient survival. Additionally, a multidisciplinary team of pulmonologists, radiologists and pathologists is necessary for an accurate IPF diagnosis. The present study aims to assess how diagnosis and treatment of IPF are followed in Portugal, as well as the knowledge and implementation of therapeutic guidelines adopted by the Portuguese Society of Pulmonology. Seventy-eight practicing pulmonologists were enrolled (May-August 2019) in a survey developed by IPF expert pulmonologists comprised of one round of 31 questions structured in three parts. The first part was related to participant professional profile, the second part assessed participant level of knowledge and practice agreement with national consensus and international guidelines for IPF as well as their access to radiology and pathology for IPF diagnosis, and the third part was a self-evaluation of the guidelines adherence for diagnosis and treatment in their daily practice. Participants represented a wide spectrum of pulmonologists from 14 districts of Portugal and autonomous regions of Azores and Madeira. The majority were female (65%), with 5-19 years of experience (71%) and working in a public clinical center (83%). Importantly, the majority of pulmonologists follow their IPF patients (n=45) themselves, while 26% referred IPF patients to ILD experts in the same hospital and 22% to another center. Almost all pulmonologists (98%) agreed or absolutely agreed that multidisciplinary discussion is recommended to accurately diagnose IPF. No pulmonologists considered pulmonary biopsy as absolutely required to establish an IPF diagnosis. However, 87% agreed or absolutely agree with considering biopsy in a possible/probable UIP context. If a biopsy is necessary, 96% of pulmonologists absolutely agree or agree with considering criobiopsy as an option for IPF diagnosis. Regarding IPF treatment, 98% absolutely agreed or agreed that antifibrotic therapy should be started once the IPF diagnosis is established. Finally, 76% stated that 6 months is the recommended time for follow-up visit in IPF patients.

33687013,Expert recommendations on the role of macrolides in chronic respiratory diseases.,"India contributes to 32% of the total global disability-adjusted life years, due to chronic respiratory diseases. This has led to a high rate of health loss from these diseases. Antibiotics are commonly used in the management of respiratory disorders. With excellent tissue penetration, prolonged tissue persistence, and favorable side effect profile, macrolides are one of the best treatment options being recommended for respiratory, urogenital, dermal, and other bacterial infections. Still, there is a lack of clinical trial data on the use of macrolides in the management of respiratory chronic disease, and hence, there is a need for clinical guidance on their use in Indian setting. A systematic review of the literature was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar. Existing guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs, landmark studies, and key-cited articles were selected. Recommendations were based on available evidence and expert panel's logical empiricism and consensus. This article discusses evidence-based and clinical practice based management of chronic respiratory conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, bronchiectasis, diffusive panbronchiolitis, and organizing pneumonia.

Patients with pulmonary diseases in the COVID-19 pandemic period were analyzed. Non-COVID-19 cases who were hospitalized in the pulmonology clinic, outpatients, and patients who applied to the non-COVID-19 emergency service and requested a pulmonology consultation in the period from March 16, 2020 to May 15, 2020 and in the same period of the previous year (i.e., from March 16, 2019 to May 15, 2019) were included in this study. In the pandemic period, it was found that there was an 84% decrease in outpatient admissions, a 43% decrease in inpatients, and a 75% decrease in emergency services. During the pandemic period, in outpatient setting, male and younger case admissions increased, admissions with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and interstitial lung diseases decreased, whereas the frequency of admission to asthma, pneumonia, and pulmonary thromboembolism increased. In the period of the pandemic, patients with asthma, COPD, and lung cancer were less hospitalized, whereas patients with pulmonary thromboembolism, pneumonia, and pleural effusion were hospitalized more. In non-COVID-19 patient treatments during the pandemic period, usage of a metered dose inhaler increased. During the COVID-19 pandemic, non-COVID pulmonary pathologies decreased significantly, and there was a change in the profile of the patients.

33108351,Neutrophilic inflammation during lung development disrupts elastin assembly and predisposes adult mice to COPD.,"Emerging evidence indicates that early life events can increase the risk for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Using an inducible transgenic mouse model for NF-κB activation in the airway epithelium, we found that a brief period of inflammation during the saccular stage (P3-P5) but not alveolar stage (P10-P12) of lung development disrupted elastic fiber assembly, resulting in permanent reduction in lung function and development of a COPD-like lung phenotype that progressed through 24 months of age. Neutrophil depletion prevented disruption of elastic fiber assembly and restored normal lung development. Mechanistic studies uncovered a role for neutrophil elastase (NE) in downregulating expression of critical elastic fiber assembly components, particularly fibulin-5 and elastin. Further, purified human NE and NE-containing exosomes from tracheal aspirates of premature infants with lung inflammation downregulated elastin and fibulin-5 expression by saccular-stage mouse lung fibroblasts. Together, our studies define a critical developmental window for assembling the elastin scaffold in the distal lung, which is required to support lung structure and function throughout the lifespan. Although neutrophils play a well-recognized role in COPD development in adults, neutrophilic inflammation may also contribute to early-life predisposition to COPD.",The Journal of clinical investigation,2021-Jan,"Benjamin JT, Plosa EJ, Sucre JM, van der Meer R, Dave S, Gutor S, Nichols DS, Gulleman PM, Jetter CS, Han W, Xin M, Dinella PC, Catanzarite A, Kook S, Dolma K, Lal CV, Gaggar A, Blalock JE, Newcomb DC, Richmond BW, Kropski JA, Young LR, Guttentag SH, Blackwell TS",24,1384,pulmonology,2025-11-22

35619955,High Prevalence of Nutritional Risk Among Pulmonary Patients Living on the Tibetan Plateau.,"Nutritional risk is associated with adverse clinical outcomes and is more prevalent among pulmonology patients than among patients in other departments. High-altitude environments can affect patients with chronic respiratory diseases, but evidence of the prevalence of nutritional risk among hospitalized patients with respiratory diseases in high-altitude areas is limited. This study aimed to investigate the nutritional risk and status of inpatients with different major respiratory diagnoses permanently living on the Tibetan Plateau (≥3,000 m above sea level). In this cross-sectional study, we consecutively recruited inpatients admitted to the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine at the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Hospital of Lhasa between November 2020 and May 2021. We used the Nutrition Risk Screening (NRS) 2002 tool to assess nutritional risk among these patients. An NRS 2002 score ≥3 points indicates nutritional risk; a score ≥5 indicates high nutritional risk. According to NRS-2002 scores, patients were divided into three groups (NRS-2002 0-2, 3-4, and ≥5). The differences in age, sex, major respiratory diagnoses, comorbidities, body mass index, and laboratory findings among the groups were analyzed. A total of 289 eligible Tibetan patients were enrolled in the study, and 46.1% (133/246) of them were at nutritional risk (NRS-2002 score ≥3). Twenty-one (7.3%) patients were at high nutritional risk (NRS-2002 score ≥5). The proportions of patients at nutritional risk were relatively high among patients with lung cancer (58.8%), interstitial lung disease (58.3%), pulmonary embolism (52.9%), and tuberculosis (50.0%). Laboratory findings showed that patients with NRS-2002 scores of 3-4 and ≥5 had lower red blood cell counts, serum albumin and hemoglobin levels, and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels than those with NRS-2002 scores < 3. The prevalence of nutritional risk was high among pulmonology department inpatients permanently living on the Tibetan Plateau. Patients with lung cancer, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary embolism or tuberculosis were more likely to have nutritional risk than patients with other diagnoses. The nutritional risk of inpatients in the respiratory department in the plateau area should not be ignored, and patients at high nutritional risk should receive timely intervention.",Frontiers in nutrition,2022-,"Quncuo C, Liang Y, Li Q, She X, Cuo BM, Qiongda B, ChuTso M, Sun Y",8,2366,pulmonology,2025-11-22
37388398,Bronchoalveolar Lavage in Diagnostic Evaluation of Pulmonary Diseases- An Institutional Experience.,"Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a widely accepted investigative tool for the diagnosis of pulmonary lesions. This study was done to find out the usefulness of BAL in diagnosis of pulmonary lesions from central Indian patient population. A cross-sectional prospective study was performed over a period of three years. All the BAL specimens of patients presenting to Department of Pulmonary Medicine and Tuberculosis during a period of January 2017 to December 2019 were included in the study. Cyto-histopathologic correlation was done, wherever available. Of total 277 cases, there were 178 (64.5%) males and 99 (35.5%) females. The age of patients ranged from 4 years to 82 years. In 92 (33%) cases, specific infective etiology could be identified on BAL cytology, the most common being tuberculosis (26%) followed by fungal infections (2%). Rarely, infections like nocardia, actinomycosis, and hydatidosis were also identified. Eight cases (3%) of malignancy were identified which included two cases of adenocarcinoma, one case of small cell carcinoma, three cases of poorly differentiated carcinoma, and two cases suspicious for malignancy. Some rare diagnoses like diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis, and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis could be identified on BAL. BAL is useful in primary diagnosis of infections and malignancies of lower respiratory tract. BAL may aid in diagnostic workup of diffuse lung diseases. A combination of clinical information, high-resolution computed tomography, and BAL analysis may furnish an assured diagnosis to the clinician and obviate need for invasive procedures.",Journal of cytology,2023-,"Siddiqui SS, Sharma T, Khurana AK, Goyal A, Joshi D, Goel G, Khurana U, Kapoor N",8,1628,pulmonology,2025-11-22

34042316,"Prematurity, the diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and maturation of ventilatory control.","Infants born before 32 weeks gestational age and receiving respiratory support at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) are diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This label suggests that their need for supplemental oxygen (O<sub>2</sub> ) is primarily due to acquired dysplasia of airways and airspaces, and that the supplemental O<sub>2</sub> is treating residual parenchymal lung disease. However, emerging evidence suggests that immature ventilatory control may also contribute to the need for supplemental O<sub>2</sub> at 36 weeks PMA. In all newborns, maturation of ventilatory control continues ex utero and is a plastic process. Among premature infants, supplemental O<sub>2</sub> mitigates the hypoxemic effects of delayed maturation of ventilatory control, as well as reduces the duration and frequency of periodic breathing events. Nevertheless, prematurity is associated with altered and occasionally aberrant maturation of ventilatory control. Infants born prematurely, with or without a diagnosis of BPD, are more prone to long-lasting effects of dysfunctional ventilatory control. This review addresses normal and abnormal maturation of ventilatory control and suggests how aberrant maturation complicates assigning the diagnosis of BPD. Greater awareness of the interaction between parenchymal lung disease and delayed maturation of ventilatory control is essential to understanding why a given premature infant requires and is benefitting from supplemental O<sub>2</sub> at 36 weeks PMA.",Pediatric pulmonology,2021-Nov,"Mammel D, Kemp J",2,1510,pulmonology,2025-11-22

36474462,Advances in bronchoscopic optical coherence tomography and confocal laser endomicroscopy in pulmonary diseases.,"Imaging techniques play a crucial role in the diagnostic work-up of pulmonary diseases but generally lack detailed information on a microscopic level. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) are imaging techniques which provide microscopic images in vivo during bronchoscopy. The purpose of this review is to describe recent advancements in the use of bronchoscopic OCT- and CLE-imaging in pulmonary medicine. In recent years, OCT- and CLE-imaging have been evaluated in a wide variety of pulmonary diseases and demonstrated to be complementary to bronchoscopy for real-time, near-histological imaging. Several pulmonary compartments were visualized and characteristic patterns for disease were identified. In thoracic malignancy, OCT- and CLE-imaging can provide characterization of malignant tissue with the ability to identify the optimal sampling area. In interstitial lung disease (ILD), fibrotic patterns were detected by both (PS-) OCT and CLE, complementary to current HRCT-imaging. For obstructive lung diseases, (PS-) OCT enables to detect airway wall structures and remodelling, including changes in the airway smooth muscle and extracellular matrix. Bronchoscopic OCT- and CLE-imaging allow high resolution imaging of airways, lung parenchyma, pleura, lung tumours and mediastinal lymph nodes. Although investigational at the moment, promising clinical applications are on the horizon.",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,2023-Jan,"Kramer T, Wijsman PC, Kalverda KA, Bonta PI, Annema JT",5,1432,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Drawing upon examples from pulmonary medicine, this article describes how bias can be introduced in the physical aspects of the technology design, via unrepresentative data, or by conflation of biological with social determinants of health. It then can be perpetuated by inadequate evaluation and regulatory standards. Research demonstrates that pulse oximeters perform differently depending on patient race and ethnicity. Pulmonary function testing and algorithms used to predict healthcare needs are two additional examples of medical technologies with racial and ethnic biases that may perpetuate health disparities.",Annual review of medicine,2023-Jan,"Sjoding MW, Ansari S, Valley TS",3,814,pulmonology,2025-11-22
32187180,Prevalence of respiratory symptoms and spirometric changes among non-smoker male wood workers.,"To assess the effects of workplace exposure to hardwood dust on lung function and determine a prevalence of respiratory symptoms among wood workers. Cross-sectional observational study. Tertiary referral center. Two hundred seventy-six, non-smoker male wood workers and equal number of non-smoker male office workers, referred to pulmonology clinic included in this study. Evaluation of study participants included completion of a questionnaire regarding respiratory symptoms and baseline spirometry was measured according to the actual recommendations. Respiratory symptoms including cough, phlegm, chest tightness, and wheezing were significantly higher in wood workers than office workers (40.2% versus 29.3% for cough, p = 0.0073; 40.6% versus 23.6% for phlegm, p<0.0001; 38.0% versus 23.1% for chest tightness, p = 0.0001; 25.3% versus 14.5% for wheezing, p = 0.0014). No statistically significant differences were observed for Dyspnea, and upper respiratory tract symptoms among wood workers compared to office workers. While wood workers were more likely to require spirometry test than office workers (21.4% versus 5.4%, p<0.001) the obstructive changes were more prevalent on spirometry test in wood workers (71.4% obstructive pattern versus 28.6% restrictive pattern). Spirometry test revealed the mean values of FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio were significantly lower in the wood workers, compared to their mean values in the control group. Respiratory symptoms associated with work, are more prevalent among wood workers than office workers. Our data revealed that workplace exposure to hardwood dust may compromise respiratory function, indicating the importance and the need for optimizing preventive measures in workplace to protect the respiratory health among exposed workers. Obstructive changes on pulmonary function test is a dominant pathologic pattern in pulmonary function test among wood workers. Further investigation is required by current available tools such as nasal cytology to detect influence of wood dust exposure on the upper respiratory airway.",PloS one,2020-,"K Hosseini D, Malekshahi Nejad V, Sun H, K Hosseini H, Adeli SH, Wang T",6,2072,pulmonology,2025-11-22
33582124,Assisted mobilisation in critical patients with COVID-19.,"The therapeutic value of early physiotherapeutic treatment in critical respiratory settings has already been clearly outlined in the last fifteen years by several authors. However, there is still a controversial perception of mobilisation by healthcare professions. In-bed cycling has attracted increasing attention having been demonstrated as a feasible and safe intervention in critical settings. Patients with respiratory diseases are typically prone to fatigue and exertional dyspnoea, as we observe in COVID-19 pandemic; in fact, these patients manifest respiratory and motor damage that can even be associated with cognitive and mental limitations. COVID-19 is at risk of becoming a chronic disease if the clinical sequelae such as pulmonary fibrosis are confirmed as permanent outcomes by further analysis, particularly in those cases with overlapping pre-existent pulmonary alterations. In the present article, we propose a practical analysis of the effects of in-bed cycling, and further discuss its potential advantages if used in critical patients with COVID-19 in intensive care settings.",Pulmonology,2024-,"Polastri M, Daniele F, Tagariello F",3,1100,pulmonology,2025-11-22

This was a retrospective analysis of all <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET/CT examinations performed for the investigation of a solitary pulmonary nodule between May 2016 and May 2017. We reviewed medical records and PET/CT images to collect the data necessary to calculate the pre-test probability of malignancy using the Swensen model and the Herder model. The probability of malignancy was classified as low if < 5%, intermediate if 5-65%, and high if > 65%. Cases classified as intermediate in the Swensen model were reclassified by the Herder model. We reviewed the records for 33 patients, of whom 17 (51.5%) were male. The mean age was 68.63 ± 12.20 years. According to the Swensen model, the probability of malignancy was intermediate in 23 cases (69.7%). Among those, the application of the Herder model resulted in the probability of malignancy being reclassified as low in 6 (26.1%) and as high in 8 (34.8%). <sup>18</sup>F-FDG-PET/CT was able to modify the probability of malignancy classification of a solitary pulmonary nodule in more than 50% of the cases evaluated.",Radiologia brasileira,2020-,"Mourato FA, Brito AET, Romão MSC, Santos RGG, de Almeida CA, de Almeida Filho PJ, Leal ALG",7,1226,pulmonology,2025-11-22
36437445,Obstructive sleep apnea and nocturnal hypoxemia in adult patients with cystic fibrosis.,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), nocturnal hypoxemia and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) are common comorbidities in people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF). Most of the data showing this originates from children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to collect data on sleep parameters, EDS and pulmonary function from a large cohort of adult pwCF. Full overnight polysomnography (PSG) was performed. EDS was determined using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Demographic and clinical data (body mass index [BMI], pulmonary function, capillary blood gases) were collected. A total of 52 adult pwCF were included (mean age 30.7 ± 8.0 years, mean percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s [ppFEV<sub>1</sub>] of 52.1 ± 14.8). Overall AHI was in the normal range (4.5 ± 4.0/h); 21/52 pwCF (40%) had an apnea-hypopnea index > 5/h. Nocturnal hypoxemia was found in 25% of participants and this was associated with ppFEV<sub>1</sub> (p = 0.014), awake oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>; p = 0.021) and awake partial pressure of oxygen (pO<sub>2</sub>; p = 0.003); there were no significant differences in age, lung function and BMI were found for pwCF with versus without OSA (all p > 0.05). Eight pwCF (15%) had an ESS score > 10 (indicating EDS). OSA was best predicted by awake pO<sub>2</sub> (area under the curve [AUC] 0.66, p = 0.048), while nocturnal hypoxemia was best predicted by ppFEV<sub>1</sub> (AUC 0.74, p = 0.009), awake pO<sub>2</sub> (AUC 0.76, p = 0.006) and awake SpO<sub>2</sub> (AUC 0.71; p = 0.025). OSA, nocturnal hypoxemia and EDS were common in adult pwCF, but no strong predictors were identified.

Despite the known synergy between DM and TB, the importance of atypical clinical, radiological presentation and DM as a risk factor for TB is largely unknown. This study was undertaken to know the effect of glycemic control on TB manifestations as it will contribute to the opportunities for detection and treatment of both disease conditions appropriately. This cross-sectional study included 50 patients attending the pulmonary medicine department in Ispat General Hospital with pulmonary TB and DM during 6 months' period. Clinical data, chest-X ray, HbA1c values were obtained and the effect of glycemic control studied and analyzed. Five patients had good glycemic control (HbA1c ≤7%), 45 patients had poor glycemic control (HbA1c >7%). Cough was present in all patients. Weight loss and night sweats were present in poor glycemic group and sputum smear grade was higher in higher HbA1c patients and both were statistically significant. None of the good glycemic group had lower zone lesion. The commonest type of lesion was nonhomogenous opacity, followed by cavities in both poor and good glycemic groups. Cavities were usually present in lower zones. Size and number of cavities were more as the glycemic control is poor. So, that glycemic control did have an effect on pulmonary TB manifestations, hence achieving and maintaining glycemic control is necessary for DM with pulmonary TB.",International journal of mycobacteriology,2021-,"Saalai KM, Mohanty A",2,1550,pulmonology,2025-11-22

However, evidence and guidance on management is sparse. The aim of this international survey was to assess differences in prevention, diagnostic and treatment strategies for AE-IPF in specialised and non-specialised ILD centres worldwide. <b>Material and Methods:</b> Pulmonologists working in specialised and non-specialised ILD centres were invited to participate in a survey designed by an international expert panel. Responses were evaluated in respect to the physicians' institutions. <b>Results:</b> Three hundred and two (65%) of the respondents worked in a specialised ILD centre, 134 (29%) in a non-specialised pulmonology centre. Similarities were frequent with regards to diagnostic methods including radiology and screening for infection, treatment with corticosteroids, use of high-flow oxygen and non-invasive ventilation in critical ill patients and palliative strategies. However, differences were significant in terms of the use of KL-6 and pathogen testing in urine, treatments with cyclosporine and recombinant thrombomodulin, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in critical ill patients as well as antacid medication and anaesthesia measures as preventive methods. <b>Conclusion:</b> Despite the absence of recommendations, approaches to the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of AE-IPF are comparable in specialised and non-specialised ILD centres, yet certain differences in the managements of AE-IPF exist.

31830755,Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: Best Practice in Monitoring and Managing a Relentless Fibrotic Disease.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibrosing interstitial lung disease that is, by definition, progressive. Progression of IPF is reflected by a decline in lung function, worsening of dyspnea and exercise capacity, and deterioration in health-related quality of life. In the short term, the course of disease for an individual patient is impossible to predict. A period of relative stability in forced vital capacity (FVC) does not mean that FVC will remain stable in the near future. Frequent monitoring using multiple assessments, not limited to pulmonary function tests, is important to evaluate disease progression in individual patients and ensure that patients are offered appropriate care.

However, some patients may not be able either to comprehend or obtain adequate information. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of the clinical pharmacist approach to refining disease-specific knowledge in patients with COPD treated in a tertiary care hospital. A prospective observational longitudinal study was carried out in adult COPD patients for 9 months in the tertiary care hospital of Pune. At the time of enrolment, disease-specific knowledge of patients with COPD was assessed using the Bristol COPD Knowledge Questionnaire (BCKQ). After the assessment, patients were educated, counselled verbally and provided with a validated COPD information leaflet. The patients' knowledge was reassessed 1 month and 3 months after enrolment. Pre and post scores of BCKQ were compared by ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test. The difference in the proportions was calculated using the χ<sup>2</sup> test. Of 75 patients, the majority were men (53.33%), aged >60 years (72%), employed (62.67%) and had obtained secondary education (37.33%). The mean baseline BCKQ overall score of the patients was 25.87, which increased after education to 42.43 on the first visit (1 month) and to 45.62 on the second visit (3 months) (p<0.0001). At baseline, the topics 'vaccination', 'inhaled steroids' and 'antibiotics' returned the lowest mean scores of 0.37, 0.38 and 0.60, which were increased to 2.30, 2.70 and 2.72, respectively, after follow-up.

39883493,Ultrathin bronchoscopy-guided small airway biopsy for diagnosing sarcoidosis: A prospective study.,"New ultrathin bronchoscopes (UTBs) enable the inspection and biopsy of small airways, potentially offering diagnostic advantages in sarcoidosis. In this prospective study, patients with suspected sarcoidosis underwent airway inspection with a UTB. Observed airway abnormalities were categorised into six predefined patterns. UTB-directed small airway biopsies (SABs) were collected from the upper lobes following a standardised procedure. We evaluated the prevalence and patterns of SAAs, as well as the diagnostic yield of UTB-directed SAB. Among 79 participants, 65 (82.3%) were diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Small airway abnormalities were identified in 26/65 (40%) patients, predominantly in those with parenchymal involvement on CT compared to those with lymphadenopathy only (58.1% VS. 23.5%, <i>P</i> = 0.005). The diagnostic yield of SABs for detecting granulomas was significantly higher in patients with SAAs than in those without (65.4% VS. 23.1%, <i>P</i> = 0.001) and in patients with parenchymal disease on CT compared to those without (54.8% VS. 26.5%, <i>P</i> = 0.02). Notably, random biopsies taken under direct visualisation from small airway carinas revealed peribronchiolar parenchyma in 23% of the patients. Small airway abnormalities are prevalent in sarcoidosis patients with parenchymal involvement, and biopsying these abnormalities yields a high rate of granuloma detection.",Pulmonology,2025-Dec,"Trisolini R, Sotgiu G, Cancellieri A, Pasciuto G, Livi V, Flore MC, Viscuso M, Magnini D, Leoncini F, Zhang Q, Puci M, Richeldi L",12,1399,pulmonology,2025-11-22

32108594,Rigid bronchoscopic interventions for central airway obstruction - An observational study.,"Central airway obstruction (CAO) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with thoracic malignancies. In this prospective study, we describe the role of rigid bronchoscopy (RB) in the multimodality management of CAO. Prospective description of different rigid bronchoscopic techniques used for CAO between July 2016 and July 2019. A total of 152 procedures (124 therapeutic/palliative and 28 diagnostics) in 111 adults and 10 pediatric patients were performed. The mean age in 111 adults (66 males) and 10 pediatric (5 males) patients were 45.4 ± 15.8 (range 16-80) and 5.4 ± 3.6 (range 1-10) years, respectively. Palliation of the airway obstruction (48.8%) and establishment of diagnosis (23.2%) were the main indications of RB in our study. Mechanical debulking in 53 (57%) and airway dilatation in 40 (43%) patients were the most utilized interventions during the palliative or therapeutic RB. There was a significant decrease in mean (modified Medical Research Council) dyspnea scale from 3.9 ± 1.0 to 1.42 ± 0.63 and increase in mean Visual Analogue Scale from 2.06 ± 0.74 to 8.7 ± 0.54 after the procedure (P < 0.0001). Additional therapy was undertaken in 38 (31.4%) of 121 patients, and surgical excision was the primary form of definitive treatment in 17 patients Moderate bleeding was encountered in 13.3% of the procedures mainly in the diagnostic RB. The mean procedure duration was 28.4 (range, 11-49) min and 13.2 (7-22) min in the adults and pediatric patients, respectively. A total of 31 patients succumbed to the illness due to the progressive nature of their disease. An individualized approach to interventional procedures is safe and effective way to achieve and maintain palliation of CAO.

Pulmonary cavitation can occur in severe cases of TB, particularly in patients with DM. From 1 May 2014 through 30 June 2019, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 1,658 smear- or culture-confirmed pulmonary TB (PTB) patients at the Second Department of Pulmonary Medicine and Tuberculosis, Shenzhen, China. A total of 861 participants who satisfied the criteria (chest CT scan for cavitation, interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), diagnosis of diabetes mellitus), with the median age of 36.7 years, 63.6% of male, 79.7% IGRA positive, 13.8% with diabetes, and 40.8% with pulmonary cavitation, were included in the study. The association between diabetes and pulmonary cavitation was confirmed in these TB patients (adjusted OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.66-3.94; <i>p</i> < 0.001). No associations were observed between diabetes and IGRA, as well as between lung cavitary and IGRA. Based on the criteria of IGRA+/-, pulmonary cavitation+/-, and DM+/-, the further analysis with univariate and multivariate logistic regression were conducted in six subgroups. The significant association between diabetes and pulmonary cavitation was further confirmed in the IGRA+ subgroup (adjusted OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.86-5.16; <i>p</i> < 0.001) but not observed in IGRA- individuals.

36695624,Miscalibration of lung allocation models leads to inaccurate waitlist mortality predictions.,"The importance of waitlist (WL) mortality risk estimates will increase with the adoption of the US Composite Allocation Score (CAS) system. Calibration is rarely assessed in clinical prediction models, yet it is a key factor in determining access to lung transplant. We assessed the calibration of the WL-lung allocation score (LAS)/CAS models and developed alternative models to minimize miscalibration. Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data from 2015 to 2020 were used to assess the calibration of the WL model and for subgroups (age, sex, diagnosis, and race/ethnicity). Three recalibrated models were developed and compared: (1) simple recalibration model (SRM), (2) weighted recalibration model 1 (WRM1), and (3) weighted recalibration model 2 (WRM2). The current WL-LAS/CAS model underestimated risk for 78% of individuals (predicted mortality risk, <42%) and overpredicted risk for 22% of individuals (predicted mortality risk, ≥42%), with divergent results among subgroups. Error measures improved in SRM, WRM1, and WRM2. SRM generally preserved candidate rankings, whereas WRM1 and WRM2 led to changes in ranking by age and diagnosis. Differential miscalibration occurred in the WL-LAS/CAS model, which improved with recalibration measures. Further inquiry is needed to develop mortality models in which risk predictions approximate observed data to ensure accurate ranking and timely access to transplant. IMPACT: With changes to the lung transplant allocation system planned in 2023, evaluation of the accuracy and precision of survival models used to rank candidates for lung transplant is important. The waitlist model underpredicts risk for 78% of US transplant candidates with an unequal distribution of miscalibration across subgroups leading to inaccurate ranking of transplant candidates. This work will serve to inform future efforts to improve modeling efforts in the US lung transplant allocation system.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,2023-Jan,"Dalton JE, Lehr CJ, Gunsalus PR, Mourany L, Valapour M",5,1937,pulmonology,2025-11-22
35113810,Maladaptive functional changes in alveolar fibroblasts due to perinatal hyperoxia impair epithelial differentiation.,"Infants born prematurely worldwide have up to a 50% chance of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a clinical morbidity characterized by dysregulated lung alveolarization and microvascular development. It is known that PDGFR alpha-positive (PDGFRA+) fibroblasts are critical for alveolarization and that PDGFRA+ fibroblasts are reduced in BPD. A better understanding of fibroblast heterogeneity and functional activation status during pathogenesis is required to develop mesenchymal population-targeted therapies for BPD. In this study, we utilized a neonatal hyperoxia mouse model (90% O2 postnatal days 0-7, PN0-PN7) and performed studies on sorted PDGFRA+ cells during injury and room air recovery. After hyperoxia injury, PDGFRA+ matrix and myofibroblasts decreased and PDGFRA+ lipofibroblasts increased by transcriptional signature and population size. PDGFRA+ matrix and myofibroblasts recovered during repair (PN10). After 7 days of in vivo hyperoxia, PDGFRA+ sorted fibroblasts had reduced contractility in vitro, reflecting loss of myofibroblast commitment. Organoids made with PN7 PDGFRA+ fibroblasts from hyperoxia in mice exhibited reduced alveolar type 1 cell differentiation, suggesting reduced alveolar niche-supporting PDGFRA+ matrix fibroblast function. Pathway analysis predicted reduced WNT signaling in hyperoxia fibroblasts. In alveolar organoids from hyperoxia-exposed fibroblasts, WNT activation by CHIR increased the size and number of alveolar organoids and enhanced alveolar type 2 cell differentiation.",JCI insight,2022-Mar,"Riccetti MR, Ushakumary MG, Waltamath M, Green J, Snowball J, Dautel SE, Endale M, Lami B, Woods J, Ahlfeld SK, Perl AT",11,1537,pulmonology,2025-11-22
36300190,Advancements in navigational bronchoscopy for peripheral pulmonary lesions: A review with special focus on virtual bronchoscopic navigation.,"Lung cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening has increased the incidence of peripheral pulmonary lesions. Surveillance and early detection of these lesions at risk of developing cancer are critical for improving patient survival. Because these lesions are usually distal to the lobar and segmental bronchi, they are not directly visible with standard flexible bronchoscopes resulting in low diagnostic yield for small lesions <2 cm. The past 30 years have seen several paradigm shifts in diagnostic bronchoscopy. Recent technological advances in navigation bronchoscopy combined with other modalities have enabled sampling lesions beyond central airways. However, smaller peripheral lesions remain challenging for bronchoscopic biopsy. This review provides an overview of recent advances in interventional bronchoscopy in the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of peripheral pulmonary lesions, with a particular focus on virtual bronchoscopic navigation.",Frontiers in medicine,2022-,"Giri M, Dai H, Puri A, Liao J, Guo S",5,1077,pulmonology,2025-11-22

This study is aimed at investigating the effects of a 12-month partially supervised exercise program on attributes of health-related and motor performance fitness, lung function (ppFEV1), BMI, and habitual physical activity (HPA, steps/day) in adults with CF. Attributes of health-related and motor performance fitness were examined at the beginning (T0), after 6 (T1), and 12 months (T2) on the basis of five test items: forward bend (FB), bent knee hip extension (HE), plank leg raise (PLR), standing long jump (SLJ), and standing on one leg (OLS). Additionally, we recorded HPA by accelerometry, peak exercise performance (<i>W</i> <sub>peak</sub>) by an incremental cycle test, ppFEV1, and BMI. During the first six months, there was close supervision by an experienced sport therapist. 26 CF patients (8 female, mean age 26.5 ± 7.9 years; ppFEV1 53.7 ± 21.0) completed the exercise program. Significant improvements were recorded from T0 to T1 (FB: <i>p</i> ≤ 0.05; PLR, OLS: <i>p</i> ≤ 0.01) and from T0 to T2 (FB, PLR: <i>p</i> ≤ 0.01 and HE, OLS: <i>p</i> ≤ 0.05). <i>W</i> <sub>peak</sub>, ppFEV1, BMI, and HPA showed no significant improvement between the single test points and over the entire study period (all <i>p</i> > 0.05). Our results show trainability of adults with CF in aspects of health-related and motor performance fitness during a partially supervised exercise program. Close supervision positively influences the results. Using a simple test setup seems to be a promising tool for evaluating the effects of exercise programs in CF and could serve as an additional outcome parameter in future clinical trials.

Based on the severity of COPD, moderate group (MOD, n = 12) and more mild group (MLD, n = 12) underwent central hemodynamic assessments pre- and post-peak exercise. In the entire cohort (n = 24), central diastolic blood pressure (cDBP) was associated with pulmonary function. Post-exercise, cDBP remained elevated (p < 0.01), however, peripheral diastolic blood pressure (pDBP) was reduced (p = 0.02). Prior to exercise, the MOD showed higher cDBP and heart rate (HR) than the MLD (p = 0.02 and p = 0.01, respectively), but no difference in central aortic/arterial stiffness (p > 0.05). These findings remained similar post-exercise. Central diastolic blood pressure is linked to pulmonary function in COPD and it is elevated after exercise-induced reductions in pDBP. Central diastolic blood pressure is higher in the MOD than the MLD, however, there was no difference in central aortic/arterial stiffness between groups.",Pulmonology,2021-,"Behnia M, Wheatley-Guy CM, Johnson BD, Avolio A, Kim CH",5,1072,pulmonology,2025-11-22
38869166,"Initiatives to improve lung and sleep health in children: Delphi consensus from the pediatrics, pulmonary, and sleep conference.","The lung and sleep health of adults is heavily influenced by early factors, both genetic and environmental; therefore, optimizing respiratory health begins in childhood. Multiple barriers impede improvements in lung and sleep health for children. First, the traditional siloing between general pediatric care in the community, pediatric pulmonary and sleep subspecialty care, and the research community limits the translation of knowledge into practice. Additionally, identifying and addressing health disparities remains a challenge. The 2021 NHLBI-sponsored workshop ""Defining and Promoting Pediatric Pulmonary Health (DAP<sup>3</sup>H)"" was a first step in defining critical gaps in our current healthcare system in identifying and optimizing lung and sleep health in children. The workshop identified key opportunities including measuring pulmonary function in young children, sleep-focused outcomes, developing biomarkers, and longitudinal research cohorts. To expand on the work of DAP<sup>3</sup>H and continue initiatives to improve childhood lung and sleep health, the Pediatrics & Pulmonary Network: Improving Health Together conference was held in 2023.

36739401,Epidemiology and comorbidities in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a nationwide cohort study.,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is frequently accompanied by comorbidities, with the management of these comorbidities crucial for clinical outcomes. This study investigated the prevalence, incidence, changes over time, and clinical impact of comorbidities in IPF patients, based on nationwide claims data in South Korea. This retrospective cohort study utilised nationwide health claim data in South Korea between 2011 and 2019. Patients with IPF were defined as those with ICD-10 code J84.1 and Rare Intractable Disease code V236 who made at least one claim per year. Patients were classified by sex, age, pirfenidone use and burden of comorbidities, and differences among groups were determined. The yearly prevalence rate of IPF increased from 7.50 to 23.20 per 100,000 people, and the yearly incidence rate increased from 3.56 to 7.91 per 100,000 person-years over time. The most common respiratory comorbidity was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (37.34%), followed by lung cancer (3.34%), whereas the most common non-respiratory comorbidities were gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (70.83%), dyslipidaemia (62.93%) and hypertension (59.04%). The proportion of some comorbidities differed by sex, age and use of pirfenidone. The proportion of lung cancer was higher in patients treated with pirfenidone, whereas the proportion of anxiety and depression were lower in patients not treated with pirfenidone. Charlson comorbidity index ≥ 4 was associated with increases in hospitalisations and total medical costs. The yearly prevalence and incidence of IPF and comorbidities in Korea increased over time.

37410546,α7nAChR activation in AT2 cells promotes alveolar regeneration through WNT7B signaling in acute lung injury.,"Reducing inflammatory damage and improving alveolar epithelium regeneration are two key approaches to promoting lung repair in acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). Stimulation of cholinergic α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR, coded by Chrna7) signaling could dampen lung inflammatory injury. However, whether activation of α7nAChR in alveolar type II (AT2) cells promotes alveolar epithelial injury repair and underlying mechanisms is elusive. Here, we found that α7nAChR was expressed on AT2 cells and was upregulated in response to LPS-induced ALI. Meanwhile, deletion of Chrna7 in AT2 cells impeded lung repair process and worsened lung inflammation in ALI. Using in vivo AT2 lineage-labeled mice and ex vivo AT2 cell-derived alveolar organoids, we demonstrated that activation of α7nAChR expressed on AT2 cells improved alveolar regeneration by promoting AT2 cells to proliferate and subsequently differentiate toward alveolar type I cells. Then, we screened out the WNT7B signaling pathway by the RNA-Seq analysis of in vivo AT2 lineage-labeled cells and further confirmed its indispensability for α7nAChR activation-mediated alveolar epithelial proliferation and differentiation. Thus, we have identified a potentially unrecognized pathway in which cholinergic α7nAChR signaling determines alveolar regeneration and repair, which might provide us a novel therapeutic target for combating ALI.",JCI insight,2023-Aug,"Chen X, Zhang C, Wei T, Chen J, Pan T, Li M, Wang L, Song J, Chen C, Zhang Y, Song Y, Su X",12,1438,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Although the limitlessness of BAL fluid is debated, it remains one of the best matrices for studying the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis. Natural killer (NK) cells have been described in BAL fluid from sarcoidosis patients. Elevated NK cells in BAL fluid from sarcoidosis patients have been found to be associated with poor outcomes. in this study, NK cells were evaluated in BAL samples from sarcoidosis patients at the time of diagnosis and associated with clinical characteristics in order to evaluate their prognostic role. Of the 276 patients suspected to have sarcoidosis on the basis of clinical and radiological findings, 248 had a final diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Clinical parameters, scadding stage, and extrapulmonary localization were collected in a database. it resulted in fibrotic sarcoidosis patients being associated with an increase in lymphocyte percentages in BAL samples, particularly NK cells when compared with other groups. From ROC analysis, NK cell percentages in BAL samples resulted as being the best predictive markers in discriminating stage 4 of sarcoidosis from other RX stages (AUC=0.85, <i>p</i><0.0001). Furthermore, after the stratification of patients on the basis of the number of extrapulmonary localizations, patients with an higher number of extrapulmonary localizations also showed higher percentages of NK cells in BAL fluid. in conclusion, NK cell percentages in BAL fluid can be considered a good prognostic marker of fibrotic phenotypes of sarcoidosis and involvement of other organs, although their diagnostic utility was poor.",Pulmonology,2025-Dec,"Bergantini L, Spalletti M, d'Alessandro M, Genovese M, Masotto E, Cameli P, Prasse A, Bargagli E",8,1695,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Recorded nocturnal oximetry provides an objective assessment of hypoxemia; however, it is unknown if it identifies clinically undetected hypoxemia in the home setting. Our objective was to determine if nocturnal oximetry can identify unreported hypoxemia in infants with BPD who appear ready to wean from supplemental oxygen. We conducted a retrospective chart review of infants born <32 weeks gestation with BPD who were discharged to home receiving supplemental oxygen and completed recorded nocturnal oximetry in room air during an 18-month period. Abnormal oximetry was defined as >5 min with SpO<sub>2</sub>  < 90% and/or an oxyhemoglobin desaturation index (ODI4) >5. Comparative analysis of patients with normal and abnormal overnight oximetry was performed using Fisher Exact and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Thirty-five former premature infants completed nocturnal oximetry at 5.8 (3.4-8.3) months corrected age. Nocturnal oximetry was abnormal as defined in 67% of the cohort (n = 21). Five percent of patients were hypoxemic, 52% had frequent desaturation events, and 43% had both. No significant differences existed in neonatal characteristics between patients with normal and abnormal studies. Nocturnal oximetry was abnormal in the majority of infants with BPD who were otherwise clinically ready to wean from oxygen support, suggesting that recorded home oximetry could be a feasible and useful tool to evaluate for otherwise clinically unapparent nocturnal hypoxemia in patients with BPD.",Pediatric pulmonology,2022-Nov,"House M, Klein S, Parham D, Hysinger EB, Brady JM",5,1691,pulmonology,2025-11-22

The aim of the present study is to overview the clinical significance of genetics in IPF. It is fascinating to realize the so-far underestimated but dynamically increasing impact that genetics has on aspects related to the pathophysiology, accurate and early diagnosis, and treatment and prevention of this devastating disease. Genetics in IPF have contributed as no other in unchaining the disease from the dogma of a ""a sporadic entity of the elderly, limited to the lungs"" and allowed all scientists, but mostly clinicians, all over the world to consider its many aspects and ""faces"" in all age groups, including its co-existence with several extra pulmonary conditions from cutaneous albinism to bone-marrow and liver failure. By providing additional evidence for unsuspected characteristics such as immunodeficiency, impaired mucus, and surfactant and telomere maintenance that very often co-exist through the interaction of common and rare genetic variants in the same patient, genetics have created a generous and pluralistic yet unifying platform that could lead to the understanding of the injurious and pro-fibrotic effects of many seemingly unrelated extrinsic and intrinsic offending factors.

32131782,Lung transplant referral practice patterns: a survey of cystic fibrosis physicians and general pulmonologists.,"Many individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) die from respiratory failure without referral for lung transplant. Physician practices that may expedite, delay, or preclude referral, are poorly understood. Two parallel, web-based surveys focusing on lung transplant referral triggers and barriers, as well as pre-referral evaluation, were emailed to pulmonologists practicing in the New England region. One questionnaire was sent to CF providers (n = 61), and the second to general pulmonary providers practicing at the same institutions (n = 61). There were 43 (70%) responses to the CF provider survey, and 25 (41%) responses to the general pulmonary ('non-CF') provider survey. Primary reasons for CF providers to refer their patients included: rapidly declining lung function (91%) and a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) below 30% predicted (74%). The greatest barriers to referral for both CF and non-CF providers included active tobacco use (65 and 96%, respectively, would not refer), and active alcohol or other substance use or dependence (63 and 80%). Furthermore, up to 42% of CF providers would potentially delay their referral if triple-combination therapy or other promising new, disease-specific therapy were anticipated. In general, non-CF providers perform a more robust pre-referral medical work-up, while CF providers complete a psychosocial evaluation in higher numbers. Across both groups, communication with lung transplant programs was reported to be inadequate. Physician-level barriers to timely lung transplant referral exist and need to be addressed.

Materials and methods Our study included 73 patients. The general characteristics, radiological features, spirometric tests, PET/CT findings, and laboratory parameters of the patients were recorded. Results Relapse and parenchymal fibrosis were not associated with metabolic parameters, such as LMR and SII. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels were lower in the relapsed group than in the non-relapse group. However, the patients' PET/CT images indicated that 18F-FDG parenchym maximum standard uptake value (SUV max), lymph node SUV max, lymph node short axis dimension, SII, and LMR were similar between all patients, relapsed or not. Conclusion Although found to be significant in other inflammatory diseases, we found that SII and LMR alone did not indicate disease prognosis in sarcoidosis due to the small number of patients and the lack of homogeneity between the groups in our study. The usefulness of these markers for clinical use should be investigated by studies that include those with extrapulmonary sarcoidosis, and that calculate these markers at the time of disease diagnosis and during the post-treatment period.",Cureus,2023-Mar,"Sahin Ozdemirel T, Akıncı Özyürek B, Tatci E, Ertan O, Akkurt ES, Senturk A, Ozmen O",7,1540,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Here, we present a case of AKI from both AIN and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) following cocaine insufflation. The purpose of this article is to review the rare but significant association of AIN associated with cocaine use. The nature of the treatment of cocaine-related kidney disease may differ from other causes of acute kidney insult. Prompt recognition of the underlying cause of renal dysfunction is vital for this group of patients to prevent the rapid deterioration of renal function.",Cureus,2021-Nov,"Jahir T, Hossain SMS, Risal R, Schmidt M, Enriquez D, Bagum M",6,933,pulmonology,2025-11-22
36755997,Uncommon Presentation of Undiagnosed B-Cell Lymphoproliferative Disorder as Nodular Pulmonary Amyloidosis.,"B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders are characterized by the accumulation of mature B lymphocytes in the bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, and/or peripheral blood. They can cause amyloid deposits in the lungs. In rare cases, lung nodules can be the first sign of this disorder. We present the case of an 89-year-old woman with stable shortness of breath and lung nodules on imaging. A positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan showed the most intense hypermetabolic nodule in the patient's lung, which was 1.5 × 1.4 cm. A biopsy of this nodule showed amyloid material with trapped plasma cell infiltrate on microscopy. Congo red stain under polarizing microscopy showed apple-green birefringence, which is diagnostic for amyloidosis. Immunohistochemistry showed a mixture of kappa-positive and lambda-positive cells. B-cell gene rearrangement-clonal gene rearrangements were detected in the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene and the kappa light chain (IGK). These findings suggest a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, such as a plasmacytoma or a marginal cell lymphoma with plasma cell differentiation. The patient was diagnosed with a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder and pulmonary amyloidosis. Isolated amyloidosis in the lungs usually has a good prognosis, but it can be a sign of autoimmune diseases or B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, as in this case. Early diagnosis of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder can lead to successful treatment and prevents complications.",Journal of medical cases,2023-Jan,"Patel H, Sheikh A, Medarametla GD, Selvam SA, Mahmood SN, Johal G, Arunachalam J, Radhakrishnan H, Shah V, Vallath AL, Patel D, Palasamudram Shekar S, Patel U, Changawala N",14,1505,pulmonology,2025-11-22
38665718,A Rare Case of Idiopathic Pleuro-Parenchymal Fibroelastosis Presenting With Bilateral Spontaneous Pneumothoraces.,"Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) is a rare interstitial lung disease (ILD), characterized by predominantly upper lobe pleural and subjacent sub-pleural parenchymal fibrosis. Its name refers to a combination of fibrosis involving the visceral pleura with fibroelastotic changes, predominantly in the subpleural lung parenchyma. We describe the case of a 67-year-old lady who presented to the accident and emergency department of Weston General Hospital with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) and cachexia of six to eight months' duration. The initial imaging studies showed bilateral spontaneous pneumothoraces on a background of pleural-based consolidation and fibrotic changes. A subsequent high-resolution CT (HRCT) chest showed evidence of pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis in the background. She was not considered for anti-fibrotic medications due to the advanced stage of the disease and was managed with supportive measures, including oxygen support, oral steroids and antibiotics to cover for any infections. After initial management of symptoms and long discussions with the patient, family and the palliative team, she was discharged home with community follow-up.",Cureus,2024-Mar,"Kumar P, Hashmi S, Birbeck M, Seklani M, Subramanian N",5,1182,pulmonology,2025-11-22

However, pulmonary side effects have only been reported rarely in paediatric cases, despite nitrofurantoin being a first line prophylactic treatment of recurrent childhood urinary tract infection. A 6-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital with dyspnea, general fatigue, loss of appetite and need for nasal oxygen treatment after long-term nitrofurantoin treatment. A computed tomography scan of the chest showed lung fibrosis. A biopsy confirmed this diagnosis. We suspected the fibrosis to be caused by the nitrofurantoin treatment. Thorough examinations reveal no other explanations. Nitrofurantoin was discontinued and the girl was treated with methylprednisolone. After 17 month a new scan and lung function test showed total regression of the lung fibrosis. This case underlines that risk of severe side effects should be taken in to account before initiation of long-term nitrofurantoin treatment in children.",BMC pulmonary medicine,2020-Nov,"Mikkelsen LF, Rubak S",2,1106,pulmonology,2025-11-22
39123152,Impact of serum chitotriosidase activity on tuberculosis treatment response: single center study from Serbia.,"The aim of our study was to investigate serum chitotriosidase level in tuberculosis patients, its relationship with microbiological and clinical parameters, and response to treatment. This longitudinal panel study included 149 patients with confirmed TB disease. Serum chitotriosidase activity was measured at the beginning and the end of treatment. Factors associated with chitotriosidase activity were explored using univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Out of 149 study participants, 71(47.7%) were female. The mean age was 53.0 (SD = 18.2). Majority of cases were new 118(79.2), predominantly 145 (97.3%) having pulmonary tuberculosis. More than half of the patients were sputum smear positive 91 (61.1%) while culture positive in 146 (98%) of them. According to radiological findings, cavitary lesions were found in 92 (63.4%) patients. Anti TB treatment was associated with significant decrease in serum chitotriosidase level (< 0.001). New TB treatment (OR = 4.41%;95% CI = 1.20-9.89), and cavitary lesions (OR = 3.86;95%CI = 0,59-26.57) were found to be significantly associated with decrease of chitotriosidase activity. The results of our study showed that serum chitotriosidase values are strong biomarkers for starting anti TB treatment and for treatment monitoring, since decrease in serum chitotriosidase level can predict favorable treatment response in patients with tuberculosis. Further studies are needed to explore these, and other factors associated with chitotriosidase activity among tuberculosis patients.",BMC pulmonary medicine,2024-Aug,"Adzic-Vukicevic T, Stosic M, Sumarac Z, Cvetkovic A, Markovic O, Maric D",6,1551,pulmonology,2025-11-22

34362949,Automatic airway segmentation from computed tomography using robust and efficient 3-D convolutional neural networks.,"This paper presents a fully automatic and end-to-end optimised airway segmentation method for thoracic computed tomography, based on the U-Net architecture. We use a simple and low-memory 3D U-Net as backbone, which allows the method to process large 3D image patches, often comprising full lungs, in a single pass through the network. This makes the method simple, robust and efficient. We validated the proposed method on three datasets with very different characteristics and various airway abnormalities: (1) a dataset of pediatric patients including subjects with cystic fibrosis, (2) a subset of the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial, including subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and (3) the EXACT'09 public dataset. We compared our method with other state-of-the-art airway segmentation methods, including relevant learning-based methods in the literature evaluated on the EXACT'09 data. We show that our method can extract highly complete airway trees with few false positive errors, on scans from both healthy and diseased subjects, and also that the method generalizes well across different datasets. On the EXACT'09 test set, our method achieved the second highest sensitivity score among all methods that reported good specificity.",Scientific reports,2021-Aug,"Garcia-Uceda A, Selvan R, Saghir Z, Tiddens HAWM, de Bruijne M",5,1262,pulmonology,2025-11-22
33598532,Cardiopulmonary Arrest and Resuscitation in the Prone Patient: An Adult Simulation Case for Internal Medicine Residents.,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is present in approximately 10% of ICU admissions and is associated with great morbidity and mortality. Prone ventilation has been shown to improve refractory hypoxemia and mortality in patients with ARDS. In this simulation, a 70-year-old male had been transferred to the ICU for ARDS and was undergoing scheduled prone ventilation as part of his care when he experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest secondary to a tension pneumothorax. Learners demonstrated how to manage cardiac arrest in a prone patient and subsequently identified and treated the tension pneumothorax that was the cause of his initial arrest. This single-session simulation for internal medicine residents (PGY 1-PGY 4) utilized a prone mannequin connected to a ventilator in a high-fidelity simulation center. Following the simulation, facilitators led a team debriefing and reviewed key learning objectives. A total of 103 internal medicine residents participated in this simulation. Of those, 43 responded to a postsimulation survey. Forty-two of 43 agreed or strongly agreed that all learning objectives were met, that the simulation was appropriate for their level of training, and that their participation would be useful for their future practice. We designed this simulation to improve learners' familiarity with prone cardiopulmonary resuscitation and to enhance overall comfort with cardiac arrest management. Postsimulation survey results and debriefings revealed that the simulation was a valuable education opportunity, and learners felt that their participation in this simulation would be helpful in their future practice.",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,2021-Feb,"Sinha T, Stinehart K, Moorer C, Spitzer C",4,1649,pulmonology,2025-11-22

A review of emerging literature demonstrates that the use of digital health technologies, particularly pulse oximeters, remote spirometers, accelerometers, and Electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes, has surged in both pulmonary practice and clinical trials. Lessons learned from their use can help researchers to design the next generation of clinical trials leveraging digital outcomes to improve health. In pulmonary diseases, digital health technologies provide validated, reliable, and usable data on patients in real-world environments. More broadly, digital endpoints have accelerated innovation in clinical trial design, improved clinical trial efficiency, and centered patients. As investigators adopt digital health technologies, it is important to follow a framework informed by both the opportunities and challenges of digitization.

38037018,Lung isolation-a personalized and clinically adapted approach to control bronchoscopy-associated acute massive airway hemorrhage.,"The current concept of bronchoscopy-associated massive airway hemorrhage is not accurate enough, and the amount of bleeding as the only evaluation criterion cannot comprehensively evaluate magnitude of the effects and the severity. To propose the concept of bronchoscopy-associated acute massive airway hemorrhage, analyze its impact on patients and highlight the treatment approach of acute massive airway hemorrhage without ECMO support. A retrospective cohort study. Include all patients who received bronchoscopy intervention therapy at Interventional Pulmonology Center of Emergency General Hospital from 2004 to December 2021. 223 patients met the inclusion criteria. Patients were divided into two groups: acute massive airway hemorrhage group (n = 29) and non-acute massive airway hemorrhage group (n = 194). Perioperative adverse events between two groups were the main outcome. Secondary outcome was the impact of lung isolation on patient in group Acute. The incidence of acute massive airway hemorrhage was 0.11%, and the incidence of non-acute massive airway hemorrhage was 0.76% in this study. There were significant differences in the incidence of intraoperative hypoxemia, lowest SpO<sub>2</sub>, hemorrhagic shock, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intraoperative mortality, and transfer to ICU between acute group and non-acute group (P<0.05, respectively). Lung isolation was used in 12 patients with acute massive airway hemorrhage, and only 2 patients died during the operation. Bronchoscopy-associated acute massive airway hemorrhage had more serious impact on patients due to rapid bleeding, blurred vision of bronchoscopy, inability to stop bleeding quickly, blood filling alveoli, and serious impact on oxygenation of the lung lobes. Polyvinyl chloride single-lumen endotracheal intubation for lung isolation, with its characteristics of low difficulty, wide applicability and available in most hospitals, may reduce the intraoperative mortality of patients with bronchoscopy-associated acute massive airway hemorrhage.

There are significant changes in the structure and conformation of the central airway during the last half of gestation, and premature birth disrupts this natural developmental process. The arrest of maturation results in a smaller airway that is more compliant, easier to deform, and more susceptible to damage. Consequently, neonates with BPD are prone to developing central airway pathology, particularly for patients who require intubation and positive pressure ventilation. Central airway disease can be divided into dynamic and fixed airway obstruction and results in increased respiratory morbidity in neonates with chronic lung disease of prematurity.",Pediatric pulmonology,2021-Nov,Hysinger EB,1,1026,pulmonology,2025-11-22
32875098,Using Near-Peer Teaching to Address Concepts of Cystic Fibrosis in Undergraduate Medical Learners.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a high-yield undergraduate medical education topic that lends itself to adaptability of content. We used a CF case paired with activities to deliver content in a near-peer teaching session. First-year (M1) and second-year (M2) medical students contributed acquired knowledge of protein structure and obstructive lung disease, respectively, to generate a concept map and address discussion questions. Combined groups of M1 and M2 students reviewed a CF case and a concept map prompt. For 30 minutes, they created a concept map describing connections between molecular biology and clinical manifestations. We summarized by reviewing concept maps and discussion questions. The efficacy of the session was determined by comparing exam performance of class attenders and nonattenders (M2) and performance on questions related and unrelated to the exercise (M1). We also determined students' perception of the session and incorporation of additional core competencies. M2 students' performance was 3.8% higher (<i>p</i> = .296) and M1 students' performance was 1.8% higher (<i>p</i> = .286) than their respective controls. Students commented positively on the exercise and perceived more than one core competency as part of the session.

38375433,A new variant in the <i>ZCCHC8</i> gene: diverse clinical phenotypes and expression in the lung.,"Pulmonary fibrosis is a severe disease which can be familial. A genetic cause can only be found in ∼40% of families. Searching for shared novel genetic variants may aid the discovery of new genetic causes of disease. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in 152 unrelated patients with a suspected genetic cause of pulmonary fibrosis from the St Antonius interstitial lung disease biobank. Variants of interest were selected by filtering for novel, potentially deleterious variants that were present in at least three unrelated pulmonary fibrosis patients. The novel c.586G>A p.(E196K) variant in the <i>ZCCHC8</i> gene was observed in three unrelated patients: two familial patients and one sporadic patient, who was later genealogically linked to one of the families. The variant was identified in nine additional relatives with pulmonary fibrosis and other telomere-related phenotypes, such as pulmonary arterial venous malformations, emphysema, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukaemia and dyskeratosis congenita. One family showed incomplete segregation, with absence of the variant in one pulmonary fibrosis patient who carried a <i>PARN</i> variant. The majority of <i>ZCCHC8</i> variant carriers showed short telomeres in blood. ZCCHC8 protein was located in different lung cell types, including alveolar type 2 (AT2) pneumocytes, the culprit cells in pulmonary fibrosis. AT2 cells showed telomere shortening and increased DNA damage, which was comparable to patients with sporadic pulmonary fibrosis and those with pulmonary fibrosis carrying a telomere-related gene variant, respectively. The <i>ZCCHC8</i> c.586G>A variant confirms the involvement of ZCCHC8 in pulmonary fibrosis and short-telomere syndromes and underlines the importance of including the <i>ZCCHC8</i> gene in diagnostic gene panels for these diseases.",ERJ open research,2024-Jan,"Groen K, van der Vis JJ, van Batenburg AA, Kazemier KM, de Bruijn MJW, Stadhouders R, Arp P, Verkerk AJMH, Schoemaker AE, de Bie CI, Massink MPG, van Beek FT, Grutters JC, Vergouw LJM, van Moorsel CHM",15,1839,pulmonology,2025-11-22

We aimed to develop a nomogram to predict the FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio and the presence of COPD. We retrospectively reviewed the data of 4241 adult patients who underwent spirometry between 2013 and 2019. By linear regression analysis, variables associated with FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC were identified in the training cohort (n = 2969). Using the variables as predictors, a nomogram was created to predict the FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio and validated in the test cohort (n = 1272). Older age (β coefficient [95% CI], - 0.153 [- 0.183, - 0.122]), male sex (- 1.904 [- 2.749, - 1.056]), current or past smoking history (- 3.324 [- 4.200, - 2.453]), and the presence of dyspnea (- 2.453 [- 3.612, - 1.291]) or overweight (0.894 [0.191, 1.598]) were significantly associated with the FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio. In the final testing, the developed nomogram showed a mean absolute error of 8.2% between the predicted and actual FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratios. The overall performance was best when FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC < 70% was used as a diagnostic criterion for COPD; the sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy were 82.3%, 68.6%, and 75.5%, respectively.

34968334,Discharge Plan to Promote Patient Safety and Shared Decision Making by a Multidisciplinary Team of Healthcare Professionals in a Respiratory Unit.,"Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often require frequent hospitalization due to worsening symptoms. Preventing prolonged hospital stays and readmission becomes a challenge for healthcare professionals treating patients with COPD. Although the integration of health and social care supports greater collaboration and enhanced patient care, organizational structure and poor leadership may hinder the implementation of patient-oriented goals. This paper presents a case of a 64-year-old chronic smoker with severe COPD who was to be discharged on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT). It also highlights the healthcare decisions made to ensure the patient's safety at home and further provides a long-lasting solution to the existing medical and social needs. The goal was accomplished through a discharge plan that reflects multidisciplinary working, efficient leadership, and change management using Havelock's theory. While COPD is characterized by frequent exacerbation and hospital readmission, it was emphasized that most failed discharges could be attributed to bureaucratic organizational workflow which might not be in the patient's best interest. It was further demonstrated that healthcare professionals are likely to miss the window of opportunity to apply innovative and long-lasting solutions to the patient's health condition in an attempt to remedy the immediate symptoms of COPD.","Nursing reports (Pavia, Italy)",2021-Jul,"Nnate DA, Barber D, Abaraogu UO",3,1414,pulmonology,2025-11-22

34649974,ERS clinical practice guidelines: high-flow nasal cannula in acute respiratory failure.,"High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has become a frequently used noninvasive form of respiratory support in acute settings; however, evidence supporting its use has only recently emerged. These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the use of HFNC alongside other noninvasive forms of respiratory support in adults with acute respiratory failure (ARF). The European Respiratory Society task force panel included expert clinicians and methodologists in pulmonology and intensive care medicine. The task force used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods to summarise evidence and develop clinical recommendations for the use of HFNC alongside conventional oxygen therapy (COT) and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) for the management of adults in acute settings with ARF. The task force developed eight conditional recommendations, suggesting the use of 1) HFNC over COT in hypoxaemic ARF; 2) HFNC over NIV in hypoxaemic ARF; 3) HFNC over COT during breaks from NIV; 4) either HFNC or COT in post-operative patients at low risk of pulmonary complications; 5) either HFNC or NIV in post-operative patients at high risk of pulmonary complications; 6) HFNC over COT in nonsurgical patients at low risk of extubation failure; 7) NIV over HFNC for patients at high risk of extubation failure unless there are relative or absolute contraindications to NIV; and 8) trialling NIV prior to use of HFNC in patients with COPD and hypercapnic ARF. HFNC is a valuable intervention in adults with ARF. These conditional recommendations can assist clinicians in choosing the most appropriate form of noninvasive respiratory support to provide to patients in different acute settings.",The European respiratory journal,2022-Apr,"Oczkowski S, Ergan B, Bos L, Chatwin M, Ferrer M, Gregoretti C, Heunks L, Frat JP, Longhini F, Nava S, Navalesi P, Ozsancak Uğurlu A, Pisani L, Renda T, Thille AW, Winck JC, Windisch W, Tonia T, Boyd J, Sotgiu G, Scala R",21,1721,pulmonology,2025-11-22
36852622,Congenital lobar emphysema: A rare cause of respiratory failure in neonates.,"Congenital lobar overinflation, also known as congenital lobar emphysema (CLE), is an uncommon (1/20,000-30,000 live births) abnormality characterized by hyperinflation of one or more pulmonary lobes, usually with contralateral displacement of the mediastinum. While the etiology of most cases of CLE is poorly understood and labeled idiopathic, some cases are thought to be due to an intrinsic or extrinsic bronchial wall abnormality causing a ball valve mechanism with resultant hyperinflation of the affected lobe. CLE tends to have a predilection for males presenting insidiously in the first 6 months of life and have respiratory distress and progressive failure, with 50% of cases being asymptomatic at birth. Acquired forms of lobar emphysema are similar but are secondary to prolonged exposure to oxygen and positive pressure ventilation in premature infants. Clinical presentation is variable, ranging from wheezing, increased respiratory effort, cyanosis, feeding difficulties, and reflux or respiratory failure. Chest radiography (CXR) is the initial imaging obtained for any neonate with respiratory distress, which can aid in diagnosis showing overinflation, while computerized tomography (CT) remains the gold standard for confirmatory diagnosis. Treatment is variable and based on clinical severity. Some cases can be managed conservatively, while more severe cases require surgical intervention with lobectomy. Here, we present a case of a neonate in respiratory distress soon after birth, had initial improvement with supportive care, and was found to be secondary to CLE.",Pediatric pulmonology,2023-Jun,"Rose P, Rana S, Abbey C, Deskins S, Al-Qatarneh S",5,1589,pulmonology,2025-11-22
35081017,Role of CC Chemokine Ligand 17 in Mouse Models of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,"Lung function deterioration is significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We previously reported that CC chemokine ligand 17/thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (CCL17/TARC) could be a predictive factor of lung function decline in patients with COPD. However, the role of CCL17 in the pathogenesis of COPD is unclear. Here we examined the role of CCL17 in lung inflammation using mouse COPD models. Exposure to cigarette smoking induced CCL17 production in bronchial epithelial cells and accumulation of alveolar macrophages in the lungs. Intranasal administration of recombinant CCL17 further enhanced cigarette smoke-induced macrophage accumulation and also aggravated elastase-induced pulmonary emphysema. We confirmed that cigarette smoke (CS) extract as well as hydrogen peroxide upregulated CCL17 in BAES-2B cells. Of note, macrophages of both M1 and M2 surface markers were accumulated by cigarette smoke. Both alveolar macrophage accumulation via exposure to cigarette smoking and emphysematous changes induced by elastase administration were significantly reduced in CCL17-deficient mice. We further demonstrated that CCL17 strongly induced the expression of CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), a chemoattractant for macrophages, in RAW264.7 cells, and its production was inhibited by knockdown of CCR4, the receptor of CCL17. Collectively, the present results demonstrate that CCL17 is produced by lung epithelial cells upon CS exposure. Furthermore, CCL17 is involved in CS-induced accumulation of alveolar macrophages and development of elastase-induced pulmonary emphysema, possibly through CCL17-induced production of CCL2 by macrophages. Our findings may provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of COPD.",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,2022-Apr,"Machida H, Inoue S, Igarashi A, Saitoh S, Yamauchi K, Nishiwaki M, Nemoto T, Otaki Y, Sato M, Sato K, Nakano H, Yang S, Furuyama K, Murano H, Ishibashi Y, Ota T, Nakayama T, Shibata Y, Watanabe M",19,1787,pulmonology,2025-11-22
34625183,A 58-Year-Old Woman With a History of Cardiac Myxoma Presents With Pulmonary Nodules.,"A 58-year-old woman presented to a pulmonology clinic for evaluation of bilateral pulmonary nodules. Two years previously, she had presented with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. During evaluation for her tachyarrhythmia, transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a large, homogenous, highly mobile right atrial and ventricular mass. She underwent electrophysiologic ablation, tricuspid valve annular ring replacement, and resection of the mass, which pathology confirmed to be a myxoma. Now, a recent abdomen and pelvis CT study obtained for history of nephrolithiasis incidentally noted bilateral lower lobe pulmonary nodules. Follow-up noncontrast chest CT confirmed bilateral peribronchovascular solid pulmonary nodules up to 8 mm in diameter throughout all lobes. The nodules appeared contiguous with the segmental and subsegmental bronchovascular bundles, and many occurred at branch points. There was no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. To evaluate the pulmonary nodules, she was referred to a pulmonology clinic. She reported only stable, nonlimiting dyspnea on exertion. She did not have a cough. She denied a history of fevers, weight loss, or night sweats. She had no rash or skin changes, visual changes, joint pain or swelling, or palpitations. She had no history of oropharyngeal or genital ulcerations. Social history was notable for a 40-pack-year smoking history, with quit date 2 years prior. She had no risk factors for TB exposure and no exposures to sandblasting, stone cutting, or other environmental risk factors for silicosis.

Symptoms such as a cough, dyspnea, and fever are common to a large number of inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic it is essential to limit the use of hospital services and inappropriate diagnostic techniques. A particular radiological pattern can orient the clinical and laboratory scenario and guide the diagnostic workup. A 58-year-old woman was admitted to our COVID-19 unit for suspected coronavirus infection. She was complaining of worsening dyspnea, tachycardia, and low grade fever. A chest X-ray showed diffuse, alveolar, and interstitial lung involvement with micronodules tending to coalescence. This radiographic pattern known as ""galaxy sign"", consistent with diffuse, coalescing nodular miliary pulmonary involvement, simulating a non-specific alveolar opacification of the lungs is typical of a few pneumological differential diagnoses, represented by sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis, and metastatic lesions, and virtually excludes an interstitial viral pneumonitis.

34969648,Severity of precapillary pulmonary hypertension: Predictive factor.,"Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) require risk assessments for prognosis and appropriate therapy. These assessments need to be improved by incorporating clinical and laboratory data such as the analysis of the right ventricle. We aim to establish echocardiographic morphometric data of the right ventricle and its relationship with the left ventricle, to estimate the hemodynamic severity of precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PHprecapillary). This cohort, prospective, observational, and cross-sectional study included 41 consecutive patients with PHprecapillary using echocardiographic study and cardiac catheterization. Patients' mean age was 44.0±16.4 years, and 37 were women (90.2%). Idiopathic PAH was diagnosed in 18 patients (43.9%). The World Health Organization/New York Association functional class was III or IV in 31 patients (75.6%). The ratio of the right to left ventricles (RV/LV) echocardiographic diastolic diameters was associated with pulmonary arterial pressures in cardiac catheterization, with the best cutoff per receiver operating characteristic curve being 0.8 for systolic pressure (sensitivity 90.0%, specificity 78.3%, area under the curve [AUC] 0.882) and mean pressure (sensitivity 60.0%, specificity 95.7%, AUC 0.823). Spearman's correlation (R) of RV/LV echocardiographic ratio and the hemodynamic variables was significant for systolic pressure (R = 0.7015, p < 0.0001), mean pressure (R = 0.6332, p < 0.0001), transpulmonary pressure gradient (R = 0.6524, p < 0.0001), pulmonary vascular resistance (R = 0.6076, p = 0.0021), and pulmonary vascular resistance index (R = 0.6229, p = 0.0014).

39883497,Assessment of the underreporting of rhinitis in patients with asthma: A MASK-air® real-world study.,"Rhinitis is a common comorbidity in patients with asthma. However, the frequency of underreported rhinitis in asthma is not known. In this study, we aimed to assess the characteristics of patients with self-reported asthma and no self-reported rhinitis, as well as the extent of the underreporting of rhinitis. We performed a cross-sectional study of all MASK-air<sup>Ⓡ</sup> users (2015-2022, 27 countries), comparing reported symptoms and medication use in patients with (i) self-reported asthma without rhinitis (""asthma alone""), (ii) self-reported rhinitis+asthma and (iii) self-reported rhinitis without asthma (""rhinitis alone""). In patients reporting asthma alone and providing MASK-air<sup>Ⓡ</sup> data in at least three different months, a cluster analysis was performed to potentially identify groups of patients underreporting rhinitis and/or undertreated for rhinitis. We assessed 35,251 users (529,751 days): 671 (1.9%) reporting asthma alone 25,882 (73.4%) reporting rhinitis alone and 8698 (24.7%) reporting rhinitis+asthma. Overall, 27% of the patients reporting asthma alone were treated with rhinitis medications. Patients reporting asthma alone displayed a lower frequency of days under rhinitis medication and less severe nasal symptoms than those reporting rhinitis+asthma. Among patients reporting asthma alone, three clusters of patients were identified: (A; 22.2%) severe rhinitis symptoms and low frequency of rhinitis medication use, (B, 41.0%) moderate rhinitis symptoms and high frequency of rhinitis medication use (41.0%), and (C, 36.8%) mild or no rhinitis symptoms and almost no rhinitis medication use.

The authors retrospectively analysed the clinical and computed tomography (CT) data of 121 patients with lung nodules, submitted to percutaneous CT-guided transthoracic biopsy, between 2014 and 2015. Multiple logistic regression was used to screen independent predictors for malignancy and to establish a clinical prediction model to evaluate the probability of malignancy. From a total of 121 patients, 75 (62%) were men and with a mean age of 64.7 years old. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified six independent predictors of malignancy: age, gender, smoking status, current extra-pulmonary cancer, air bronchogram and nodule size (p<0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.8573.

34490307,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Is Associated With Decreased Quality of Life in Bronchiectasis Patients: Findings From the KMBARC Registry.,"Most studies have evaluated the impact of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (hereafter referred to as bronchiectasis) on quality of life (QoL) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using COPD cohorts. Accordingly, the impact of COPD on QoL in patients with bronchiectasis is not well-elucidated. We used the Korean Multicenter Bronchiectasis Audit and Research Collaboration (KMBARC) registry between August 2018 and December 2019, a prospective observational cohort that enrolled patients with bronchiectasis in Korea. We evaluated co-occurrence exposure to COPD in bronchiectasis patients, and the primary outcome was QoL according to the Bronchiectasis Health Questionnaire (BHQ). We also investigated factors associated with decreased QoL, defined as the lowest quartile of the total BHQ score. Of 598 patients with bronchiectasis, 372 (62.2%) had COPD. Bronchiectasis patients with COPD had a significantly lower total BHQ score compared with those without COPD [median = 63.1 (interquartile range: 54.8-68.6) vs. 64.8 (57.4-70.8), <i>p</i> = 0.020]. Multivariable analysis revealed that dyspnea [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.21-8.60], depression (aOR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.16-1.44), and fatigue (aOR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.01-1.09) were significantly associated with decreased QoL in bronchiectasis patients with COPD. In conclusion, bronchiectasis patients with COPD had significantly decreased QoL than patients without COPD.

35404239,Six-Week Hospital-Based Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Covid Pneumonia ICU Survivors: Experience from a Tertiary Care Center in Central India.,"There is very limited data on the usefulness of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with coronavirus pneumonia who have survived intensive care unit care. The primary aim was to explore the feasibility of conducting a pulmonary rehabilitation program in patients with coronavirus disease-19 pneumonia surviving intensive care. The secondary aim was to study the impact of a hospital-based 6-week pulmonary rehabilitation program on exercise capacity, quality of life, and psychological parameters in these patients. This study was conducted at the Center for Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Department of Pulmonary Medicine of the institute. A total of 27 patients were enrolled. Among them, 14 patients who completed the desired 12 sessions over 6 weeks constituted the pulmonary rehabilitation group and 13 patients who either did not consent or defaulted within the first 2 weeks were considered as controls. Both groups had assessments at 0 and 6 weeks that included a 6-Minute Walk Test, Incremental Shuttle Walk Test, mMRC Dyspnea Scale, Baseline Dyspnea Index, and Transitional Dyspnea Index, Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire score, and Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 score. Significant improvement in dyspnea by mMRC (P = .01) and exercise capacity as measured by 6-Minute Walk Test (P <.001) and Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (P = .025) was seen in the pulmonary rehabilitation group as compared to the control group. There was no significant improvement in quality of life and psychological parameters (Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale 21 score) after 6 weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation program as measured in our study.

36220705,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Diagnosis, biomarkers and newer treatment protocols.","Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive lung condition marked by lung scarring that progresses over time and with usual interstitial pneumonia histology (UIP). It is linked to a worsening cough, dyspnea, and a worse quality of life. Around 3 million persons worldwide suffer from IPF, and the prevalence rises sharply with advancing age. The detection of the UIP pattern, generally using high-resolution CT; lung biopsy may be necessary in certain individuals; the diagnostic approach also includes the elimination of other interstitial lung illnesses or overlapping problems. The UIP pattern is mostly bilateral, peripheral, and basal, with clusters of subpleural cystic airspaces and reticular alterations linked to traction bronchiectasis. Although there are still many uncertainties about how to define susceptibility, it is believed that the molecular mechanisms causing IPF reflect an abnormal reparative response to repeated alveolar epithelial damage in an aging genetically sensitive individual. With the availability of two pharmacotherapeutic drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, that slow physiological advancement and potentially increase progression-free survival, significant progress has been made in our knowledge of the clinical treatment of IPF.

The aim of this study was to identify the characteristics that distinguish chronic bronchitis (CB) from non-CB. In addition, the features of mild CB versus severe CB were compared and a cut-off level was defined according to CAT1 and CAT2 scores. This study was based on the Korea COPD Subgroup Study (KOCOSS) database, constructed in a multicenter COPD cohort study that recruited patients from 54 centers. CB was defined as CAT1 and CAT2 scores ≥ 3; severe CB was defined as CAT1 and CAT2 scores ≥ 4, while mild CB was defined as either a CAT1 or a CAT2 score < 4. Baseline characteristics, 1-year exacerbation rate, and 3-year FEV<sub>1</sub> decline were compared in non-CB versus CB patients and in patients with mild CB versus severe CB. Among the 2162 patients enrolled in this study, 497 (23%) had CB. These patients were more likely than non-CB patients to be current smokers; they also had higher symptom and depression/anxiety scores. Lung function tests showed lower FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, and DLco values in CB patients. Among CB patients, 67.6% had mild disease. Symptom and depression/anxiety scores were worse in patients with severe CB than in patients with mild CB. There were no significant differences in the lung function tests of the two groups. Analysis of 1-year exacerbation rates in CB patients and non-CB patients revealed that patients with CB more frequently had moderate-to-severe exacerbations (OR = 1.46, p < 0.01). More severe exacerbation was also present in patients with severe CB than in patients with mild CB (OR = 2.52, p = 0.01). The difference in annual FEV<sub>1</sub> decline rate did not significantly differ either between CB patients and non-CB patients or between patients with severe CB and patients with mild CB.

Participants underwent comprehensive assessments that included demographic data collection, the use of the ABCD assessment tool to evaluate disease severity, the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) for quality of life measurement, and assessments for adherence to inhaler therapy and inhaler technique proficiency. The primary focus was on determining the prevalence of suboptimal PIFR and identifying associated demographic and clinical factors. The results indicated that 45% of the patients exhibited suboptimal PIFR, which is critical for effective medication delivery in COPD management. Analysis revealed several significant predictors of suboptimal PIFR: female gender, lower CAT scores, the type of inhaler device used, and a Modified Medical Research Council grade of ≥2, which indicates increased levels of breathlessness. These findings underscore the importance of assessing PIFR in COPD patients to ensure effective drug delivery. The study suggests that personalized inhaler device prescriptions tailored to individual PIFR can enhance treatment efficacy and improve overall management outcomes for COPD patients. By addressing factors contributing to suboptimal PIFR, healthcare providers can optimize inhalation therapy and ultimately improve patient quality of life.",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,2024-Dec,"Mohapatra MM, Vemuri MB, Saka VK, Upadhya P, Govindharaj V",5,1715,pulmonology,2025-11-22

Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed ground-glass opacity bilaterally in the lungs. Upon performing a transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB), organizing pneumonia was diagnosed. His electrocardiogram revealed low voltage, and the cardiac ultrasound revealed hypertrophy of the interventricular septum. The patient had bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, and amyloidosis was suspected. Congo red stain was added to the lung biopsy specimen. Amyloid deposition of transthyretin (ATTR) was positive, mutations with amino acid changes were not observed in the TTR gene. Wild-type ATTR Amyloidosis (ATTRwt amyloidosis) was diagnosed using a TBLB. Chest CT after treatment with steroids revealed diffuse alveolar-septal amyloidosis.","Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2022-,"Ishida M, Enomoto M, Hata T, Tanaka T, Sakaguchi C, Tamiya N, Tsuchiya M, Nagasaka Y",8,795,pulmonology,2025-11-22
39883495,Histopathology of the small airways: Similarities and differences between ageing and COPD.,"Age-related lung function decline is associated with small airway closure and gas trapping. The mechanisms which cause these changes are not fully understood. It has been suggested that COPD is caused by accelerated ageing. We have investigated pathological changes in the small airways during ageing, and evaluated whether the same or different processes exist in COPD. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry were used to examine small airway remodelling in healthy ageing, and then compare to age matched COPD patients. Ageing was associated with reduced alveolar attachment numbers (rho= -0.4 p = 0.049), increased epithelial area (rho = 0.5 p = 0.01), greater luminal narrowing due to epithelial expansion (rho = 0.5 p = 0.04) and increased alveolar septal neutrophils (rho = 0.6 p = 0.005). Compared to age matched controls, COPD small airways had 31% less alveolar attachments per airway (p = 0.02) and significantly more alveoalr septal neutrophils (p = 0.0007). Increased airway wall thickness was a feature of COPD but was not related to ageing in non-smokers. Alveolar attachment loss, accompanied by alveolar septum neutrophilic inflammation, and increased luminal narrowing due to epithelial expansion are major features of small airway remodelling during ageing. These features can explain the increased small airway narrowing and closure during ageing. Alveolar attachment loss is accelerated in COPD, likely due to increased neutrophilic inflammation.",Pulmonology,2025-Dec,"Higham A, Booth S, Dungwa J, Singh D",4,1467,pulmonology,2025-11-22
33941141,Effectiveness of pirfenidone in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis according to the autoantibody status: a retrospective cohort study.,"Pirfenidone is an anti-fibrotic agent shown to slow the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, its effectiveness in association with serological autoimmune features in IPF remains unclear. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with IPF treated at a tertiary care hospital in South Korea. The autoantibody status was defined as positive if we detected autoantibodies meeting the serological domain criteria for interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features or anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. We included 142 patients with IPF treated with pirfenidone for over six months (93 were autoantibody-positive and 49 were autoantibody-negative). The mean age was 69.5 ± 7.3 years, and 77.5% of the patients were male. The adjusted mean changes over one year were - 34.4 and - 112.2 mL (p = 0.168) in forced vital capacity (FVC), and - 0.53 and - 0.72 mL/mmHg/min (p = 0.356) in the lungs diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DL<sub>CO</sub>) in the autoantibody-negative and autoantibody-positive groups, respectively. Reductions in FVC and DL<sub>CO</sub> were similar in autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative patients with IPF treated with pirfenidone.

32636229,Giant cervicomediastinal thymic cyst in an elderly: diagnosis by multimodality imaging and fine-needle aspiration cytology with immunocytochemistry.,"A 65-year-old woman, a non-smoker, presented to the pulmonary medicine outpatient department with chest pain, mild dyspnoea, right side neck swelling and mild facial puffiness. The cervical swelling was soft, non-tender and fluctuant on palpation. Multimodality imaging revealed a large, thin-walled cervicomediastinal cystic lesion with septations, haemorrhage, septal calcification and without any solid component. Image-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology from the septa with immunocytochemistry helped to establish the thymic origin and benign nature of the cyst preoperatively and differentiate it from cystic thymoma, lymphangioma, thymic carcinoma or lymphoma with confidence. As the haemorrhage resolved, the size of the swelling was significantly reduced, and the patient became asymptomatic due to which she deferred surgery but remained on close follow-up and was doing well. Thymic cysts can occur in a cervicomediastinal location, rare in elderly age, usually asymptomatic and clinically apparent when intracystic haemorrhage leads to an increase in size and chest pain.",BMJ case reports,2020-Jul,"Mohakud S, Sethy M, Naik S, Mohapatra PR",4,1086,pulmonology,2025-11-22
33579770,Safety and feasibility of lung biopsy in diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a type of acute respiratory failure characterised by non-cardiac pulmonary oedema caused by various underlying conditions. ARDS is often pathologically characterised by diffuse alveolar damage, and its pathological findings have been reported to be associated with prognosis, although the adverse effects of lung biopsies to obtain pathological findings are still unclear. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to reveal the safety and feasibility of lung biopsy in the diagnosis of ARDS. We will include studies that were published in MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until 1 June 2020. We will include the reports for critically ill patients in an intensive care unit or emergency department who undergo lung biopsy and require a mechanical ventilation. Two review authors will independently scan titles and abstracts of all identified studies. Furthermore, these two authors will read and assess the full text of study reports to identify trials that appeared broadly to address the subject of the review. We will perform a risk of bias assessment using the McMaster Quality Assessment Scale of Harms. This study will be based on the published data, therefore, it does not require ethical approval.

35068085,Benefit of pulmonary subspecialty care for children with sickle cell disease and asthma.,"Asthma is a recognized comorbidity in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). It increases the risk of acute chest syndrome (ACS), vaso-occlusive episodes, and early mortality. We aim to determine whether evaluation and management of children with SCD and asthma by a pulmonologist reduce rate of asthma exacerbation and ACS. The study included 192 patients with SCD (0-21 years) followed at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Hematology between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2018, with a diagnosis of asthma, wheeze, or cough. Patients were placed in two groups: those evaluated by a pulmonologist (SCD-A-P) and those not (SCD-A). Rates of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for asthma exacerbation and ACS were compared between groups and over time. SCD-A-P patients (n = 70) were predominantly SCD type SS with lower hemoglobin and hematocrit compared to SCD-A patients (n = 122). SCD-A-P started with a higher average rate of hospital visits for asthma exacerbation and ACS per year (2.69 [1.02-4.37]) compared to SCD-A (0.43 [0.24-0.63]), (p < 0.001). For SCD-A-P patients with at least one hospital visit (n = 48), the average rate decreased from 3.93 (1.57-6.29) to 0.85 (0.48-1.23) following pulmonary consultation (p = 0.014) and was comparable to the SCD-A rate by study end. SCD-A-P was mainly SCD type SS and had higher ED/hospitalization rates for asthma exacerbation and ACS compared to SCD-A, but the rates significantly decreased following pulmonology consultation. These findings support the pulmonologist's role in the multidisciplinary care of SCD patients and highlight the need for evidence-based asthma guidelines for children with SCD.",Pediatric pulmonology,2022-Apr,"Saxena S, Afolabi-Brown O, Ballester L, Schmucker N, Smith-Whitley K, Allen J, Bhandari A",7,1683,pulmonology,2025-11-22
35715333,Impact of acute exacerbations of COPD on patients' health status beyond pulmonary function: A scoping review.,"This scoping review summarized the evidence regarding the impact of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) on patients' health status beyond pulmonary function. PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched. Prospective cohort studies assessing the health status of patients with COPD in a stable phase of the disease and after a follow-up period (where at least one AECOPD occurred) were included. An integrated assessment framework of health status (i.e., physiological functioning, complaints, functional impairment, quality of life) was used. Twenty-two studies were included. AECOPD acutely affected exercise tolerance, quadriceps muscle strength, physical activity levels, symptoms of dyspnoea and fatigue, and impact of the disease. Long-term effects on quadriceps muscle strength, symptoms of dyspnoea and depression, and quality of life were found. Repeated exacerbations negatively impacted the fat-free mass, levels of dyspnoea, impact of the disease and quality of life. Conflicting evidence was found regarding the impact of repeated exacerbations on exercise tolerance and physical activity levels. AECOPD have well-established acute and long-term adverse effects on health status beyond pulmonary function; nevertheless, the recovery trajectory and the impact of repeated exacerbations are still poorly studied. Further prospective research is recommended to draw firm conclusions on these aspects.",Pulmonology,2023-,"Machado A, Barusso M, De Brandt J, Quadflieg K, Haesevoets S, Daenen M, Thomeer M, Ruttens D, Marques A, Burtin C",10,1414,pulmonology,2025-11-22
33218322,Role of fibrocytes and endothelial progenitor cells among low-differentiated CD34+ cells in the progression of lung sarcoidosis.,"Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disease with still unknown etiology. Our previous studies showed a significantly higher percentage of CD34 + cells in the peripheral blood in patients with sarcoidosis (SA) compared to the control group. The objective of the present study was to characterized of the CD34 + cell population in peripheral blood in patients with SA with reference to the control group. Moreover in patients with SA, fibrocytes and endothelial cells were analysed and their relationship to the fibrosis process based on assessment of diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Data from patients diagnosed with SA at Military Institute of Medicine (Warsaw, Poland) between January 2018 and December 2019 were collected and analysed ongoing basis. Peripheral blood was collected from 26 patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary SA and 16 healthy subjects. The immunomagnetic method and flow cytometry were used. Among the CD34+ progenitor cells were assessed: low-differentiated cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells and endothelial progenitor cells. The Statistica 12.0 software was used for a statistical analysis. We observed a significantly higher percentage of low-differentiated cells (13.8 vs. 2.3, P = 0.001) and endothelial cells (0.3 vs. 0.0, P = 0.001) in patients with SA compared to the control group. In the study group the median proportion of fibrocytes was 1.877% (0.983-2.340) in patients with DLCO< 80%, while in patients with DLCO> 80% was 0.795% (0.139-1.951) (P = 0.72). The median proportion of endothelial progenitor cells was higher in patients with DLCO< 80%: 0.889% (0.391-1.741), than in patients with DLCO> 80%: 0.451% (0.177-0.857) (P = 0.44). In conclusion we demonstrated for the first time the immunophenotype of peripheral CD34 + cells with the degree of their differentiation.

37228285,Azithromycin alters spatial and temporal dynamics of airway microbiota in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,"High bacterial burden in the lung microbiota predicts progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Azithromycin (AZT) is a macrolide antibiotic known to alter the lung microbiota in several chronic pulmonary diseases, and observational studies have shown a positive effect of AZT on mortality and hospitalisation rate in IPF. However, the effect of AZT on the lung microbiota in IPF remains unknown. We sought to determine the impact of a 3-month course of AZT on the lung microbiota in IPF. We assessed sputum and oropharyngeal swab specimens from 24 adults with IPF included in a randomised controlled crossover trial of oral AZT 500 mg 3 times per week. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR) were performed to assess bacterial communities. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were assessed using real-time qPCR. AZT significantly decreased community diversity with a stronger and more persistent effect in the lower airways (sputum). AZT treatment altered the temporal kinetics of the upper (oropharyngeal swab) and lower airway microbiota, increasing community similarity between the two sites for 1 month after macrolide cessation. Patients with an increase in ARG carriage had lower bacterial density and enrichment of the genus <i>Streptococcus</i>. In contrast, patients with more stable ARG carriage had higher bacterial density and enrichment in <i>Prevotella</i>. AZT caused sustained changes in the diversity and composition of the upper and lower airway microbiota in IPF, with effects on the temporal and spatial dynamics between the two sites.",ERJ open research,2023-May,"Gijs PJ, Daccord C, Bernasconi E, Brutsche M, Clarenbach CF, Hostettler K, Guler SA, Mercier L, Ubags N, Funke-Chambour M, von Garnier C",11,1588,pulmonology,2025-11-22
36639329,"Effect of 5 weeks of oral acetazolamide on patients with pulmonary vascular disease: A randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial.","The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide stimulates ventilation through metabolic acidosis mediated by renal bicarbonate excretion. In animal models, acetazolamide attenuates acute hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH), but its efficacy in treating patients with PH due to pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) is unknown. 28 PVD patients (15 pulmonary arterial hypertension, 13 distal chronic thromboembolic PH), 13 women, mean±SD age 61.6±15.0 years stable on PVD medications, were randomised in a double-blind crossover protocol to 5 weeks acetazolamide (250mg b.i.d) or placebo separated by a ≥2 week washout period. Primary endpoint was the change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at 5 weeks. Additional endpoints included safety, tolerability, WHO functional class, quality of life, arterial blood gases, and hemodynamics (by echocardiography). Acetazolamide had no effect on 6MWD compared to placebo (treatment effect: mean change [95%CI] -18 [-40 to 4]m, p=0.102) but increased arterial blood oxygenation through hyperventilation induced by metabolic acidosis. Other measures including pulmonary hemodynamics were unchanged. No severe adverse effects occurred, side effects that occurred significantly more frequently with acetazolamide vs. placebo were change in taste (22/0%), paraesthesia (37/4%) and mild dyspnea (26/4%). In patients with PVD, acetazolamide did not change 6MWD compared to placebo despite improved blood oxygenation. Some patients reported a tolerable increase in dyspnoea during acetazolamide treatment, related to hyperventilation, induced by the mild drug-induced metabolic acidosis. Our findings do not support the use of acetazolamide to improve exercise in patients with PVD at this dosing.

32185913,Recent Advances in Molecular Basis of Lung Aging and Its Associated Diseases.,"Aging is often viewed as a progressive decline in fitness due to cumulative deleterious alterations of biological functions in the living system. Recently, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying aging biology has significantly advanced. Interestingly, many of the pivotal molecular features of aging biology are also found to contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic lung disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, for which advanced age is the most crucial risk factor. Thus, an enhanced understanding of how molecular features of aging biology are intertwined with the pathobiology of these aging-related lung disorders has paramount significance and may provide an opportunity for the development of novel therapeutics for these major unmet medical needs. To serve the purpose of integrating molecular understanding of aging biology with pulmonary medicine, in this review, recent findings obtained from the studies of aging-associated lung disorders are summarized and interpreted through the perspective of molecular biology of aging.",Tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,2020-Apr,Kang MJ,1,1106,pulmonology,2025-11-22
37069600,GRADE-ADOLOPMENT of clinical practice guidelines and creation of clinical pathways for the primary care management of chronic respiratory conditions in Pakistan.,"In Pakistan, chronic respiratory conditions contribute a large burden of morbidity and mortality. A major reason for this is the lack of availability of local evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (EBCPGs) in Pakistan, particularly at the primary care level. Thus, we developed EBCPGs and created clinical diagnosis and referral pathways for the primary care management of chronic respiratory conditions in Pakistan. The source guidelines were selected by two local expert pulmonologists after a thorough literature review on PubMed and Google Scholar from 2010 to December 2021. The source guidelines covered idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders, and bronchiectasis. The GRADE-ADOLOPMENT process consists of three key elements: adoption (using recommendations as is or with minor changes), adaptation (effective context-specific changes to recommendations) or additions (including new recommendations to fill a gap in the EBCPG). We employed the GRADE-ADOLOPMENT process to adopt, adapt, adopt with minor changes, or exclude recommendations from a source guideline. Additional recommendations were added to the clinical pathways based on a best-evidence review process. 46 recommendations were excluded mainly due to the unavailability of recommended management in Pakistan and scope beyond the practice of general physicians. Clinical diagnosis and referral pathways were designed for the four chronic respiratory conditions, explicitly delineating the role of primary care practitioners in the diagnosis, basic management, and timely referral of patients. Across the four conditions, 18 recommendations were added (seven for IPF, three for bronchiectasis, four for COPD, and four for asthma). The widespread use of the newly created EBCPGs and clinical pathways in the primary healthcare system of Pakistan can help alleviate the morbidity and mortality related to chronic respiratory conditions disease in the country.",BMC pulmonary medicine,2023-Apr,"Martins RS, Hussain H, Chaudry M, Rizvi NA, Mustafa MA, Ayub B, Aamdani SS, Rehman AA, Pervez A, Nadeem S, Khalid R, Ali AS, Shahid S, Zubairi ABS, Haider AH, Irfan M",16,1970,pulmonology,2025-11-22

36371212,Association of Underlying Comorbidities and Sites of tuberculosis: an analysis using surveillance data.,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly heterogeneous disease that can affect any organ. Extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) is more difficult to diagnose due to various clinical presentations. Depending on the characteristics of the patient, the involved site of TB may vary. However, data on clinical characteristics of EPTB are inconsistent and insufficient. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of patients with pulmonary TB (PTB) and EPTB and describe characteristic differences for each involved site. We systemically collected data of TB patients included in the national surveillance system in South Korea from July 2018 to June 2019 and compared the characteristics of patients with EPTB with that of PTB. A total of 7674 patients with a mean age of 60.9 years were included. Among them, 6038 (78.7%) patients were diagnosed with PTB and 1636 (21.3%) with EPTB. In PTB group, the mean age (61.7 ± 18.7 vs. 57.8 ± 19.9) and proportion of male sex (63.3% vs. 50.1%) were higher, but the body mass index was lower (21.2 ± 3.4 vs. 22.7 ± 3.5) than that of the EPTB group. Prevalence of diabetes (20.5% vs. 16.9%) and chronic lung disease (5.1% vs. 2.9%) were higher in PTB group, meanwhile, those of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (2.7% vs. 5.4%) and long-term steroid use (0.4% vs. 1.0%) were higher in EPTB group. Abdominal TB was more prevalent in patients with chronic liver disease (odds ratio [OR]: 2.69, 95% CI: 1.52-4.74), and urogenital TB was more prevalent in patients with CKD (OR: 2.75, 95% CI: 1.08-6.99).
