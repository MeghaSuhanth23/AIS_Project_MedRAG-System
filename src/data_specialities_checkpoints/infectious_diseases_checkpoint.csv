33803407,The Interplay between the Gut Microbiome and the Immune System in the Context of Infectious Diseases throughout Life and the Role of Nutrition in Optimizing Treatment Strategies.,"Infectious diseases and infections remain a leading cause of death in low-income countries and a major risk to vulnerable groups, such as infants and the elderly. The immune system plays a crucial role in the susceptibility, persistence, and clearance of these infections. With 70-80% of immune cells being present in the gut, there is an intricate interplay between the intestinal microbiota, the intestinal epithelial layer, and the local mucosal immune system. In addition to the local mucosal immune responses in the gut, it is increasingly recognized that the gut microbiome also affects systemic immunity. Clinicians are more and more using the increased knowledge about these complex interactions between the immune system, the gut microbiome, and human pathogens. The now well-recognized impact of nutrition on the composition of the gut microbiota and the immune system elucidates the role nutrition can play in improving health. This review describes the mechanisms involved in maintaining the intricate balance between the microbiota, gut health, the local immune response, and systemic immunity, linking this to infectious diseases throughout life, and highlights the impact of nutrition in infectious disease prevention and treatment.",Nutrients,2021-Mar,"Wiertsema SP, van Bergenhenegouwen J, Garssen J, Knippels LMJ",4,1247,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
38070863,Vaccine development: Current trends and technologies.,"Despite the effectiveness of vaccination in reducing or eradicating diseases caused by pathogens, there remain certain diseases and emerging infections for which developing effective vaccines is inherently challenging. Additionally, developing vaccines for individuals with compromised immune systems or underlying medical conditions presents significant difficulties. As well as traditional vaccine different methods such as inactivated or live attenuated vaccines, viral vector vaccines, and subunit vaccines, emerging non-viral vaccine technologies, including viral-like particle and nanoparticle vaccines, DNA/RNA vaccines, and rational vaccine design, offer new strategies to address the existing challenges in vaccine development. These advancements have also greatly enhanced our understanding of vaccine immunology, which will guide future vaccine development for a broad range of diseases, including rapidly emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19 and diseases that have historically proven resistant to vaccination. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of emerging non-viral vaccine production methods and their application in addressing the fundamental and current challenges in vaccine development.",Life sciences,2024-Jan,"Poria R, Kala D, Nagraik R, Dhir Y, Dhir S, Singh B, Kaushik NK, Noorani MS, Kaushal A, Gupta S",10,1224,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34676194,Emerging and Re-emerging Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases and the Challenges for Control: A Review.,"Vector-borne emerging and re-emerging diseases pose considerable public health problem worldwide. Some of these diseases are emerging and/or re-emerging at increasing rates and appeared in new regions in the past two decades. Studies emphasized that the interactions among pathogens, hosts, and the environment play a key role for the emergence or re-emergence of these diseases. Furthermore, social and demographic factors such as human population growth, urbanization, globalization, trade exchange and travel and close interactions with livestock have significantly been linked with the emergence and/or re-emergence of vector-borne diseases. Other studies emphasize the ongoing evolution of pathogens, proliferation of reservoir populations, and antimicrobial drug use to be the principal exacerbating forces for emergence and re-emergence of vector-borne infectious diseases. Still other studies equivocally claim that climate change has been associated with appearance and resurgence of vector-borne infectious diseases. Despite the fact that many important emerging and re-emerging vector-borne infectious diseases are becoming better controlled, our success in stopping the many new appearing and resurging vector-borne infectious diseases that may happen in the future seems to be uncertain. Hence, this paper reviews and synthesizes the existing literature to explore global patterns of emerging and re-emerging vector-borne infections and the challenges for their control. It also attempts to give insights to the epidemiological profile of major vector-borne diseases including Zika fever, dengue, West Nile fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Chikungunya, Yellow fever, and Rift Valley fever.",Frontiers in public health,2021-,"Chala B, Hamde F",2,1709,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Among them, some have been prevented and eradicated, but few are still threatening the modern era since their origin. The majority of these infectious diseases are poverty-driven, hence highly prevalent in the lower-income and mid-income countries of Africa and Asia. The world's deadliest infections, including Tuberculosis, Malaria and HIV/AIDS, have been considered as the ""Big Three"" infectious diseases (BTIDs). With leading infections and deaths every year, the BTIDs have been recognized as the world's greatest pandemics.

35215994,mRNA Vaccine Development for Emerging Animal and Zoonotic Diseases.,"In the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, mRNA vaccines hold great promise because of their low risk of insertional mutagenesis, high potency, accelerated development cycles, and potential for low-cost manufacture. In past years, several mRNA vaccines have entered clinical trials and have shown promise for offering solutions to combat emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases such as rabies, Zika, and influenza. Recently, the successful application of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 has further validated the platform and opened the floodgates to mRNA vaccine's potential in infectious disease prevention, especially in the veterinary field. In this review, we describe our current understanding of the mRNA vaccines and the technologies used for mRNA vaccine development.

37909789,MicroRNAs in infectious diseases: potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are conserved, short, non-coding RNAs that play a crucial role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. They have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer and neurological, cardiovascular, and autoimmune diseases. Several recent studies have suggested that miRNAs are key players in regulating the differentiation, maturation, and activation of immune cells, thereby influencing the host immune response to infection. The resultant upregulation or downregulation of miRNAs from infection influences the protein expression of genes responsible for the immune response and can determine the risk of disease progression. Recently, miRNAs have been explored as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in various infectious diseases. This review summarizes our current understanding of the role of miRNAs during viral, fungal, bacterial, and parasitic infections from a clinical perspective, including critical functional mechanisms and implications for their potential use as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Clinical microbiology reviews,2023-Dec,"Kimura M, Kothari S, Gohir W, Camargo JF, Husain S",5,1055,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

32846157,Emerging Pandemic Diseases: How We Got to COVID-19.,"Infectious diseases prevalent in humans and animals are caused by pathogens that once emerged from other animal hosts. In addition to these established infections, new infectious diseases periodically emerge. In extreme cases they may cause pandemics such as COVID-19; in other cases, dead-end infections or smaller epidemics result. Established diseases may also re-emerge, for example by extending geographically or by becoming more transmissible or more pathogenic. Disease emergence reflects dynamic balances and imbalances, within complex globally distributed ecosystems comprising humans, animals, pathogens, and the environment. Understanding these variables is a necessary step in controlling future devastating disease emergences.",Cell,2020-Sep,"Morens DM, Fauci AS",2,739,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
35287183,Surveillance of emerging infectious diseases for biosecurity.,"Emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, continue to pose significant threats to human beings and their surroundings. In addition, biological warfare, bioterrorism, biological accidents, and harmful consequences arising from dual-use biotechnology also pose a challenge for global biosecurity. Improving the early surveillance capabilities is necessary for building a common biosecurity shield for the global community of health for all. Furthermore, surveillance could provide early warning and situational awareness of biosecurity risks. However, current surveillance systems face enormous challenges, including technical shortages, fragmented management, and limited international cooperation. Detecting emerging biological risks caused by unknown or novel pathogens is of particular concern. Surveillance systems must be enhanced to effectively mitigate biosecurity risks. Thus, a global strategy of meaningful cooperation based on efficient integration of surveillance at all levels, including interdisciplinary integration of techniques and interdepartmental integration for effective management, is urgently needed. In this paper, we review the biosecurity risks by analyzing potential factors at all levels globally. In addition to describing biosecurity risks and their impact on global security, we also focus on analyzing the challenges to traditional surveillance and propose suggestions on how to integrate current technologies and resources to conduct effective global surveillance.",Science China.

39256346,Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases: global trends and new strategies for their prevention and control.,"To adequately prepare for potential hazards caused by emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, the WHO has issued a list of high-priority pathogens that are likely to cause future outbreaks and for which research and development (R&D) efforts are dedicated, known as paramount R&D blueprints. Within R&D efforts, the goal is to obtain effective prophylactic and therapeutic approaches, which depends on a comprehensive knowledge of the etiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of these diseases. In this process, the accessibility of animal models is a priority bottleneck because it plays a key role in bridging the gap between in-depth understanding and control efforts for infectious diseases. Here, we reviewed preclinical animal models for high priority disease in terms of their ability to simulate human infections, including both natural susceptibility models, artificially engineered models, and surrogate models. In addition, we have thoroughly reviewed the current landscape of vaccines, antibodies, and small molecule drugs, particularly hopeful candidates in the advanced stages of these infectious diseases. More importantly, focusing on global trends and novel technologies, several aspects of the prevention and control of infectious disease were discussed in detail, including but not limited to gaps in currently available animal models and medical responses, better immune correlates of protection established in animal models and humans, further understanding of disease mechanisms, and the role of artificial intelligence in guiding or supplementing the development of animal models, vaccines, and drugs. Overall, this review described pioneering approaches and sophisticated techniques involved in the study of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and clinical theatment of WHO high-priority pathogens and proposed potential directions. Technological advances in these aspects would consolidate the line of defense, thus ensuring a timely response to WHO high priority pathogens.",Signal transduction and targeted therapy,2024-Sep,"Wang S, Li W, Wang Z, Yang W, Li E, Xia X, Yan F, Chiu S",8,2012,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Emerging infectious diseases and outbreaks pose new challenges for vaccine development, requiring the rapid design and production of safe and effective vaccines against diseases with limited resources. Here, we focus on the development of vaccines in broad fields ranging from conventional prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases to therapeutic vaccines against chronic diseases and cancer providing a comprehensive overview of recent advances in eight different vaccine forms (live attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines, polysaccharide and polysaccharide conjugate vaccines, recombinant subunit vaccines, virus-like particle and nanoparticle vaccines, polypeptide vaccines, DNA vaccines, and mRNA vaccines) and the therapeutic vaccines against five solid tumors (lung cancer breast cancer colorectal cancer liver cancer and gastric cancer), three infectious diseases (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus and human papillomavirus-induced diseases) and three common chronic diseases (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia). We aim to provide new insights into vaccine technologies, platforms, applications and understanding of potential next-generation preventive and therapeutic vaccine technologies paving the way for the vaccines design in the future.",Science China.

33573529,Protection against severe infectious disease in the past.,"Before the 20<sup>th</sup> century many deaths in England, and most likely a majority, were caused by infectious diseases. The focus here is on the biggest killers, plague, typhus, smallpox, tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid, dysentery, childhood infections, pneumonia, and influenza. Many other infectious diseases including puerperal fever, relapsing fever, malaria, syphilis, meningitis, tetanus and gangrene caused thousands of deaths. This review of preventive measures, public health interventions and changes in behavior that reduced the risk of severe infections puts the response to recent epidemic challenges in historical perspective. Two new respiratory viruses have recently caused pandemics: an H1N1 influenza virus genetically related to pig viruses, and a bat-derived coronavirus causing COVID-19. Studies of infectious diseases emerging in human populations in recent decades indicate that the majority were zoonotic, and many of the causal pathogens had a wildlife origin. As hunter-gatherers, humans contracted pathogens from other species, and then from domesticated animals and rodents when they began to live in settled communities based on agriculture. In the modern world of large inter-connected urban populations and rapid transport, the risk of global transmission of new infectious diseases is high. Past and recent experience indicates that surveillance, prevention and control of infectious diseases are critical for global health. Effective interventions are required to control activities that risk dangerous pathogens transferring to humans from wild animals and those reared for food.",Pathogens and global health,2021-May,Mercer A,1,1615,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
38767202,"Climate change, its impact on emerging infectious diseases and new technologies to combat the challenge.","<b>ABSTRACT</b>Improved sanitation, increased access to health care, and advances in preventive and clinical medicine have reduced the mortality and morbidity rates of several infectious diseases. However, recent outbreaks of several emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have caused substantial mortality and morbidity, and the frequency of these outbreaks is likely to increase due to pathogen, environmental, and population effects driven by climate change. Extreme or persistent changes in temperature, precipitation, humidity, and air pollution associated with climate change can, for example, expand the size of EID reservoirs, increase host-pathogen and cross-species host contacts to promote transmission or spillover events, and degrade the overall health of susceptible host populations leading to new EID outbreaks. It is therefore vital to establish global strategies to track and model potential responses of candidate EIDs to project their future behaviour and guide research efforts on early detection and diagnosis technologies and vaccine development efforts for these targets. Multi-disciplinary collaborations are demanding to develop effective inter-continental surveillance and modelling platforms that employ artificial intelligence to mitigate climate change effects on EID outbreaks. In this review, we discuss how climate change has increased the risk of EIDs and describe novel approaches to improve surveillance of emerging pathogens that pose the risk for EID outbreaks, new and existing measures that could be used to contain or reduce the risk of future EID outbreaks, and new methods to improve EID tracking during further outbreaks to limit disease transmission.",Emerging microbes & infections,2024-Dec,"Liao H, Lyon CJ, Ying B, Hu T",4,1692,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

It summarizes relevant findings from the national infectious disease surveillance system. The data contained in this article come from the reports collected by the State Sanitary Inspection on cases of notifiable infectious diseases notified by clinicians and/or laboratories. These are supplemented by mortality data published by the Statistics Poland. The epidemiology of infectious diseases was highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. There were 1,306,983 cases notified in 2020 and 41,451 deaths attributed to COVID-19 (according to Statistics Poland). The reported incidence of other infections decreased by 10-98%. We noted especially high decreases in the incidence of viral gastrointestinal infections (by over 70%). The incidence of influenza and influenza-like infections decreased by 34% and tuberculosis by 36% as compared to 2019. However, important decreases were also noted for other diseases under surveillance, which could point to disruption of diagnosis services and reporting due to lockdowns and high workload on the public health services.",Przeglad epidemiologiczny,2022-,"Rosińska M, Czarkowski MP, Sadkowska-Todys M",3,1163,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

35867217,Infectious diseases and cognition: do we have to worry?,"Age-related physiological changes, particularly immune system decline, may contribute to greater vulnerability to infectious diseases in older individuals. A growing body of evidence shows that both, acute, and chronic infections may be accompanied by cognitive disturbances as part of their manifestations. Given the importance of cognition in aging trajectories, the objective of this article was to review current knowledge on cognitive outcomes of infectious diseases in older adults, and to emphasize the importance of considering cognition as a domain of interest in its own rights in these diseases. A MEDLINE/PubMed database search was conducted to identify articles reporting cognitive impairment associated with various severe acute infections and specific chronic infectious conditions such as human immune deficiency virus, the herpes virus family, hepatitis C virus, Lyme borreliosis, Helicobacter pylori, periodontitis, and emerging pathogens like SARS-CoV-2, as well as potentially preventive strategies like vaccination. Taken together, the studies examined in the present review emphasize that numerous acute and chronic infectious diseases share mechanisms that, when added to specific risk factors frequently found in older persons, contribute to considerably increase the risk of cognitive outcomes such as cognitive decline and dementia.

This study seeks to elucidate the causal linkages between depression, specifically Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and infectious diseases. Nevertheless, the causative nature of the association between MDD and infectious diseases remains elusive. Two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses was executed utilizing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly connected with MDD and infectious diseases as instrumental variables (IVs). A series of sensitivity analyses were subsequently conducted. Genetic variants linked to MDD were employed as instrumental variables sourced from a genome-wide meta-analyses comprising 500,199 individuals. Summary-level data on five infectious diseases, including candidiasis, pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), and urinary tract infections (UTI), were acquired from the UK Biobank and FinnGen study. Our findings evinced that genetically predicted MDD exhibited a heightened risk of candidiasis (OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.06-2.17; P = 2.38E-02), pneumonia (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.29; P = 3.16E-02), URTI (OR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.12-1.36; P = 3.71E-05), and UTI (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.12-1.42; P = 8.90E-05). Additionally, we identified bidirectional causal relationships between UTI and MDD. The associations between MDD and the risk of URTI and UTI remained consistent in multivariable MR analyses, accounting for genetically predicted smoking and body mass index. In conclusion, this investigation ascertained a causal connection between MDD and the susceptibility to infectious diseases, particularly URTI and UTI.",Translational psychiatry,2024-Jun,"Shi L, Ren J, Jin K, Li J",4,1721,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

In the literature, economic crises have been found to increase the risk of infectious disease outbreaks. Presumably, sanctions can increase the risk of infectious disease spreads, indirectly. However, non-economic factors can fuel the adverse impact of sanctions, including political consequences of sanctions and civil war. We performed a systematic literature review of articles in Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and the grey literature to assess empirically the impact of economic sanctions on the spread of infectious diseases within and beyond the borders of sanctioned countries. Our review did not identify any study meeting our inclusion criteria. Most of the studies did not control for major socio-political events, particularly armed conflicts in the sanctioned countries. This discovery underscores a notable gap in the examination of the impact of economic sanctions on the propagation of infectious diseases, presenting a threat to global health. Using the social-ecological model, we hypothesize how the economic crisis resulting from economic sanctions affects determinants of health, increases the risk of the spread of infectious diseases and hinders the response capacity of health systems.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2023-Dec,"Aloosh M, Aloosh A",2,1326,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

32031431,Companion and complementary diagnostics for infectious diseases.,"Companion diagnostics (CDx) are important in oncology therapeutic decision-making, but specific regulatory-approved CDx for infectious disease treatment are officially lacking. While not approved as CDx, several ID diagnostics are used as CDx. The diagnostics community, manufacturers, and regulatory agencies have made major efforts to ensure that diagnostics for new antimicrobials are available at or near release of new agents. This review highlights the status of Complementary and companion diagnostic (c/CDx) in the infectious disease literature, with a focus on genotypic antimicrobial resistance testing against pathogens as a class of diagnostic tests. CRISPR, sepsis markers, and narrow spectrum antimicrobials, in addition to current and emerging technologies, present opportunities for infectious disease c/CDx. Challenges include slow guideline revision, high costs for regulatory approval, lengthy buy in by agencies, discordant pharmaceutical/diagnostic partnerships, and higher treatment costs.

39386170,Aptamers: precision tools for diagnosing and treating infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases represent a significant global health challenge, with bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasitic protozoa being significant causative agents. The shared symptoms among diseases and the emergence of new pathogen variations make diagnosis and treatment complex. Conventional diagnostic methods are laborious and intricate, underscoring the need for rapid, accurate techniques. Aptamer-based technologies offer a promising solution, as they are cost-effective, sensitive, specific, and convenient for molecular disease diagnosis. Aptamers, which are single-stranded RNA or DNA sequences, serve as nucleotide equivalents of monoclonal antibodies, displaying high specificity and affinity for target molecules. They are structurally robust, allowing for long-term storage without substantial activity loss. Aptamers find applications in diverse fields such as drug screening, material science, and environmental monitoring. In biomedicine, they are extensively studied for biomarker detection, diagnostics, imaging, and targeted therapy. This comprehensive review focuses on the utility of aptamers in managing infectious diseases, particularly in the realms of diagnostics and therapeutics.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2024-,"Sujith S, Naresh R, Srivisanth BU, Sajeevan A, Rajaramon S, David H, Solomon AP",7,1203,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

It is now possible to determine the sequences of antibodies or T-cell receptors produced by individual B and T cells in a sample. This capability, termed immunosequencing, has transformed the study of both infectious and non-infectious diseases by allowing the tracking of dynamic changes in B and T cell clonal populations over time. This has improved our understanding of the pathology of cancers, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases. However, to date there has been only limited clinical adoption of the technology. Advances over the last decade and on the horizon that reduce costs and improve interpretability could enable widespread clinical use. Many clinical applications have been proposed and, while most are still undergoing research and development, some methods relying on immunosequencing data have been implemented, the most widespread of which is the detection of measurable residual disease.

However, the perceived infection risk can preclude traditional, invasive, complete diagnostic autopsy. Post-mortem examination is especially important in emerging infectious diseases with potentially unknown infection risks, but rapid acquisition of good quality tissue samples is needed as part of the scientific and public health response. Needle biopsy post-mortem is a minimally invasive, rapid, closed-body autopsy technique that was originally developed to minimise the infection risk to practitioners. Since its inception, needle biopsy post-mortem has also been used as a technique to support complete diagnostic autopsy provision in poorly resourced regions and to facilitate post-mortem examinations in communities that might have religious or cultural objections to an invasive autopsy. This Review analyses the evolution and applicability of needle biopsy post-mortem in investigating endemic and emerging infectious diseases.",The Lancet.

35073468,Diagnostic delays in infectious diseases.,"Diagnostic delays are a major source of morbidity and mortality. Despite the adverse outcomes associated with diagnostic delays, few studies have examined the incidence and factors that influence diagnostic delays for different infectious diseases. The objective of this study was to understand the relative frequency of diagnostic delays for six infectious diseases commonly seen by infectious diseases (ID) consultants and to examine contributing factors for these delays. A 25-item survey to examine diagnostic delays in six infectious diseases was sent to all infectious diseases physicians in the Emerging Infections Network (EIN) who provide care to adult patients. Diseases included (1) tuberculosis, (2) non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections, (3) syphilis, (4) epidural abscess, (5) infective endocarditis, and (6) endemic fungal infections (e.g., histoplasmosis, blastomycosis). A total of 533 of 1,323 (40%) EIN members responded to the survey. Respondents perceived the diagnosis not being considered initially and the appropriate test not being ordered as the two most important contributors to diagnostic delays. Unusual clinical presentations and not consulting ID physicians early enough were also reported as a contributing factor to delays. Responses recorded in open-text fields also indicated errors related to testing as a likely cause of delays; specifically, test-related errors included ordering the wrong laboratory test, laboratory delays (specialized labs not available at the facility), and lab processing delays. Diagnostic delays commonly occur for the infectious diseases we considered. The contributing factors we identified are potential targets for future interventions to decrease diagnostic delays.","Diagnosis (Berlin, Germany)",2022-Aug,"Suneja M, Beekmann SE, Dhaliwal G, Miller AC, Polgreen PM",5,1736,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
32187985,Infectious Diseases and the Lymphoid Extracellular Matrix Remodeling: A Focus on Conduit System.,"The conduit system was described in lymphoid organs as a tubular and reticular set of structures compounded by collagen, laminin, perlecan, and heparin sulfate proteoglycan wrapped by reticular fibroblasts. This tubular system is capable of rapidly transport small molecules such as viruses, antigens, chemokines, cytokines, and immunoglobulins through lymphoid organs. This structure plays an important role in guiding the cells to their particular niches, therefore participating in cell cooperation, antigen presentation, and cellular activation. The remodeling of conduits has been described in chronic inflammation and infectious diseases to improve the transport of antigens to specific T and B cells in lymphoid tissue. However, malnutrition and infectious agents may induce extracellular matrix remodeling directly or indirectly, leading to the microarchitecture disorganization of secondary lymphoid organs and their conduit system. In this process, the fibers and cells that compound the conduit system may also be altered, which affects the development of a specific immune response. This review aims to discuss the extracellular matrix remodeling during infectious diseases with an emphasis on the alterations of molecules from the conduit system, which damages the cellular and molecular transit in secondary lymphoid organs compromising the immune response.",Cells,2020-Mar,"Morgado FN, da Silva AVA, Porrozzi R",3,1371,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Traditional laboratory-based diagnostic methods face challenges such as high costs, time consumption, and a lack of trained personnel in resource-poor settings. Diagnostic biosensors have gained momentum as a potential solution, offering advantages such as low cost, high sensitivity, ease of use, and portability. Nanobiosensors are a promising tool for detecting and diagnosing infectious diseases such as coronavirus disease, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis. These sensors use nanostructured carbon nanotubes, graphene, and nanoparticles to detect specific biomarkers or pathogens. They operate through mechanisms like the lateral flow test platform, where a sample containing the biomarker or pathogen is applied to a test strip. If present, the sample binds to specific recognition probes on the strip, indicating a positive result. This binding event is visualized through a colored line.

36722677,Application of nano-antibiotics in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Thus, nanotechnology provides an excellent opportunity to treat drug-resistant microbial infections. Numerous antibiotics have been used to inhibit the growth and kill of microbes, but the development of resistance and the emergence of side effects have severely limited the use of these agents. Due to the development of the nanotechnology, nanoparticles are widely used as antimicrobials. Silver and chitosan nanoparticles have antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial properties, and many studies confirm the antifungal properties of silver nanoparticles. Nowadays, the use of nanoparticles in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases has developed due to less side effects and also the help of these particles in effective drug delivery to the target tissue. Liposomes are also used as carriers of drug delivery, genes, and modeling of cell membranes in both animals and humans. The ability of these liposomes to encapsulate large amounts of drugs, minimize unwanted side effects, high effectiveness and low toxicity has attracted the interest of researchers.

Up to 75% of EIDs and REIDs have zoonotic origin. Several factors such as the destruction of natural habitats leading humans and animals to live in close proximity, ecological changes due to natural disasters, population migration resulting from war or conflict, interruption or decrease in disease prevention programs, and insufficient vector control applications and sanitation are involved in disease emergence and distribution. War and natural disasters have a great impact on the emergence/re-emergence of diseases in the population. According to a World Bank estimation, two billion people are living in poverty and fragility situations. Wars destroy health systems and infrastructure, curtail existing disease control programs, and cause population movement leading to an increase in exposure to health risks and favor the emergence of infectious diseases. A total of 432 catastrophic cases associated with natural disasters were recorded globally in 2021. Natural disasters increase the risk of EID and REID outbreaks by damaging infrastructure and leading to displacement of populations.

They have pioneered disease prevention from the Crusades to the World Wars and continue to do so today. Predeployment vaccinations and chemoprophylaxis are effective in preventing communicable disease, as is reliable vector destruction and bite prevention, especially in the era of multidrug resistant organisms. These measures are unlikely to be fully possible in disasters, but reactive vaccination and efforts to reduce exposure to communicable disease should be a priority. Communicable diseases can be challenging to diagnose-the UK Defence Medical Services have become familiar with tools such as multiplex PCR and mass spectrometry. These have the potential to accurately identify organisms and sensitivity patterns in austere environments. Management of communicable diseases depends on accurate diagnosis and has a largely well-established evidence base but can be limited by a lack of resources and skills in an austere setting, therefore telemedicine can assist diagnosis and treatment of infections by projecting specialist skill. Systems such as EpiNATO2 are useful in monitoring diseases and identifying trends in order to establish control measures. Many of these tools and techniques are effective in austere environments and offer learning opportunities for those providing care in similar settings.

33435521,Magnesium in Infectious Diseases in Older People.,"Reduced magnesium (Mg) intake is a frequent cause of deficiency with age together with reduced absorption, renal wasting, and polypharmacotherapy. Chronic Mg deficiency may result in increased oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation, which may be linked to several age-related diseases, including higher predisposition to infectious diseases. Mg might play a role in the immune response being a cofactor for immunoglobulin synthesis and other processes strictly associated with the function of T and B cells. Mg is necessary for the biosynthesis, transport, and activation of vitamin D, another key factor in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. The regulation of cytosolic free Mg in immune cells involves Mg transport systems, such as the melastatin-like transient receptor potential 7 channel, the solute carrier family, and the magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1). The functional importance of Mg transport in immunity was unknown until the description of the primary immunodeficiency XMEN (X-linked immunodeficiency with Mg defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and neoplasia) due to a genetic deficiency of MAGT1 characterized by chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection. This and other research reporting associations of Mg deficit with viral and bacterial infections indicate a possible role of Mg deficit in the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its complications.

Its devastating effects have included not only a burgeoning overdose crisis but also multiple converging infectious diseases epidemics. The use of both opioids and other substances through intravenous (IV) administration places individuals at increased risks of infectious diseases ranging from invasive bacterial and fungal infections to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and viral hepatitis. In 2012, there were 530,000 opioid use disorder (OUD)-related hospitalizations in the United States (US), with $700 million in costs associated with OUD-related infections. The scale of the crisis has continued to increase since that time, with hospitalizations for injection drug use-related infective endocarditis (IDU-IE) increasing by as much as 12-fold from 2010 to 2015. Deaths from IDU-IE alone are estimated to result in over 7,260,000 years of potential life lost over the next 10 years. There have been high-profile injection-related HIV outbreaks, and injection drug use (IDU) is now the most common risk factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV). As this epidemic continues to grow, clinicians in all aspects of medical care are increasingly confronted with infectious complications of IDU.

33148705,SHERLOCK and DETECTR: CRISPR-Cas Systems as Potential Rapid Diagnostic Tools for Emerging Infectious Diseases.,"Infectious diseases are one of the most intimidating threats to human race, responsible for an immense burden of disabilities and deaths. Rapid diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases offers a better understanding of their pathogenesis. According to the World Health Organization, the ideal approach for detecting foreign pathogens should be rapid, specific, sensitive, instrument-free, and cost-effective. Nucleic acid pathogen detection methods, typically PCR, have numerous limitations, such as highly sophisticated equipment requirements, reagents, and trained personnel relying on well-established laboratories, besides being time-consuming. Thus, there is a crucial need to develop novel nucleic acid detection tools that are rapid, specific, sensitive, and cost-effective, particularly ones that can be used for versatile point-of-care diagnostic applications. Two new methods exploit unpredicted <i>in vitro</i> properties of CRISPR-Cas effectors, turning activated nucleases into basic amplifiers of a specific nucleic acid binding event. These effectors can be attached to a diversity of reporters and utilized in tandem with isothermal amplification approaches to create sensitive identification in multiple deployable field formats. Although still in their beginning, SHERLOCK and DETECTR technologies are potential methods for rapid detection and identification of infectious diseases, with ultrasensitive tests that do not require complicated processing. This review describes SHERLOCK and DETECTR technologies and assesses their properties, functions, and prospective to become the ultimate diagnostic tools for diagnosing infectious diseases and curbing disease outbreaks.",Journal of clinical microbiology,2021-Feb,"Mustafa MI, Makhawi AM",2,1695,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This study aims to explore the spatial and temporal evolutionary characteristics of the incidence of Class B notifiable infectious diseases in China from 2007 to 2020, and to forecast the trend of it as well. Hopefully, it will provide a reference for the formulation of infectious disease prevention and control strategies. Data on the incidence rates of Class B notifiable infectious diseases in 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China from 2007 to 2020 were collected for the prediction of the spatio-temporal evolution and spatial correlation as well as the incidence of Class B notifiable infectious diseases in China based on global spatial autocorrelation and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). From 2007 to 2020, the national incidence rate of Class B notifiable infectious diseases (from 272.37 per 100,000 in 2007 to 190.35 per 100,000 in 2020) decreases year by year, and the spatial distribution shows an ""east-central-west"" stepwise increase. From 2007 to 2020, the spatial clustering of the incidence of Class B notifiable infectious diseases is significant and increasing year by year (Moran's I index values range from 0.189 to 0.332, p < 0.05). The forecasted incidence rates of Class B notifiable infectious diseases nationwide from 2021 to 2024 (205.26/100,000, 199.95/100,000, 194.74/100,000 and 189.62/100,000) as well as the forecasted values for most regions show a downward trend, with only some regions (Guangdong, Hunan, Hainan, Tibet, Guangxi and Guizhou) showing an increasing trend year by year. The current study found that since there were significant regional disparities in the prevention and control of infectious diseases in China between 2007 and 2020, the reduction of the incidence of Class B notifiable infectious diseases requires the joint efforts of the surrounding provinces. Besides, special attention should be paid to provinces with an increasing trend in the incidence of Class B notifiable infectious diseases to prevent the re-emergence of certain traditional infectious diseases in a particular province or even the whole country, as well as the outbreak and spread of emerging infectious diseases.",BMC public health,2022-Jun,"Wang RN, Zhang YC, Yu BT, He YT, Li B, Zhang YL",6,2420,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
32781952,Emerging infectious disease and the challenges of social distancing in human and non-human animals.,"The 'social distancing' that occurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in humans provides a powerful illustration of the intimate relationship between infectious disease and social behaviour in animals. Indeed, directly transmitted pathogens have long been considered a major cost of group living in humans and other social animals, as well as a driver of the evolution of group size and social behaviour. As the risk and frequency of emerging infectious diseases rise, the ability of social taxa to respond appropriately to changing infectious disease pressures could mean the difference between persistence and extinction. Here, we examine changes in the social behaviour of humans and wildlife in response to infectious diseases and compare these responses to theoretical expectations. We consider constraints on altering social behaviour in the face of emerging diseases, including the lack of behavioural plasticity, environmental limitations and conflicting pressures from the many benefits of group living. We also explore the ways that social animals can minimize the costs of disease-induced changes to sociality and the unique advantages that humans may have in maintaining the benefits of sociality despite social distancing.",Proceedings.

32462426,The human genetic determinism of life-threatening infectious diseases: genetic heterogeneity and physiological homogeneity?,"Multicellular eukaryotes emerged late in evolution from an ocean of viruses, bacteria, archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes. These macroorganisms are exposed to and infected by a tremendous diversity of microorganisms. Those that are large enough can even be infected by multicellular fungi and parasites. Each interaction is unique, if only because it operates between two unique living organisms, in an infinite diversity of circumstances. This is neatly illustrated by the extraordinarily high level of interindividual clinical variability in human infections, even for a given pathogen, ranging from a total absence of clinical manifestations to death. We discuss here the idea that the determinism of human life-threatening infectious diseases can be governed by single-gene inborn errors of immunity, which are rarely Mendelian and frequently display incomplete penetrance. We briefly review the evidence in support of this notion obtained over the last two decades, referring to a number of focused and thorough reviews published by eminent colleagues in this issue of Human Genetics. It seems that almost any life-threatening infectious disease can be driven by at least one, and, perhaps, a great many diverse monogenic inborn errors, which may nonetheless be immunologically related. While the proportions of monogenic cases remain unknown, a picture in which genetic heterogeneity is combined with physiological homogeneity is emerging from these studies.

The structural studies revealed that the scavenger receptor consists of short cytosolic domains, two transmembrane domains, and a large ectodomain. The ectodomain serves as a receptor for a diverse number of endogenous and exogenous ligands. The CD36-specific ligands are involved in regulating the immune response during infectious and non-infectious diseases in the host. The role of CD36 in regulating the innate immune response during Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, Malaria, Leishmaniasis, HIV, and Sepsis in a ligand- mediated fashion. Apart from infectious diseases, it is also considered to be involved in metabolic disorders such as Atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's, cancer, and Diabetes. The ligand binding to scavenger receptor modulates the CD36 down-stream innate immune response, and it can be exploited to design suitable immuno-modulators. Hence, the current review focused on the role of the CD36 in innate immune response and therapeutic potentials of novel heterocyclic compounds as CD36 ligands during infectious and non-infectious diseases.",Current drug discovery technologies,2020-,"Banesh S, Trivedi V",2,1201,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

34970269,PANoptosis: A New Insight Into Oral Infectious Diseases.,"The oral microbiome, one of the most complex and intensive microbial ecosystems in the human body, comprises bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. Dysbiosis of the oral microbiome is the initiating factor that leads to oral infectious diseases. Infection is a sophisticated biological process involving interplay between the pathogen and the host, which often leads to activation of programmed cell death. Studies suggest that pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis are involved in multiple oral infectious diseases. Further understanding of crosstalk between cell death pathways has led to pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis being integrated into a single term: PANoptosis. PANoptosis is a multifaceted agent of the immune response that has important pathophysiological relevance to infectious diseases, autoimmunity, and cancer. As such, it plays an important role in innate immune cells that detect and eliminate intracellular pathogens. In addition to the classical model of influenza virus-infected and <i>Yersinia</i>-infected macrophages, other studies have expanded the scope of PANoptosis to include other microorganisms, as well as potential roles in cell types other than macrophages. In this review, we will summarize the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying inflammation and tissue destruction caused by oral pathogens. We present an overview of different pathogens that may induce activation of PANoptosis, along with the functional consequences of PANoptosis in the context of oral infectious diseases. To advance our understanding of immunology, we also explore the strategies used by microbes that enable immune evasion and replication within host cells. Improved understanding of the interplay between the host and pathogen through PANoptosis will direct development of therapeutic strategies that target oral infectious diseases.",Frontiers in immunology,2021-,"Jiang W, Deng Z, Dai X, Zhao W",4,1867,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

A good deal of knowledge about the drivers of infectious disease emergence has been developed based on numerous examples from the recent past. Sharing of diagnostic resources across human and animal health sectors, sharing of human and animal health surveillance data, development of skills in the interpretation of that data and awareness of issues related to the validation and interpretation of diagnostic test data are necessary prerequisites for an effective endemic disease surveillance system.

33393066,CRISPR-based strategies in infectious disease diagnosis and therapy.,"CRISPR gene-editing technology has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, but most clinicians are unaware of its broad applicability. Derived from an ancient microbial defence system, these so-called ""molecular scissors"" enable precise gene editing with a low error rate. However, CRISPR systems can also be targeted against pathogenic DNA or RNA sequences. This potential is being combined with innovative delivery systems to develop new therapeutic approaches to infectious diseases. We searched Pubmed and Google Scholar for CRISPR-based strategies in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. Reference lists were reviewed and synthesized for narrative review. CRISPR-based strategies represent a novel approach to many challenging infectious diseases. CRISPR technologies can be harnessed to create rapid, low-cost diagnostic systems, as well as to identify drug-resistance genes. Therapeutic strategies, such as CRISPR systems that cleave integrated viral genomes or that target resistant bacteria, are in development. CRISPR-based therapies for emerging viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, have also been proposed. Finally, CRISPR systems can be used to reprogram human B cells to produce neutralizing antibodies. The risks of CRISPR-based therapies include off-target and on-target modifications. Strategies to control these risks are being developed and a phase 1 clinical trials of CRISPR-based therapies for cancer and monogenic diseases are already underway.

32604457,Post-travel screening of symptomatic and asymptomatic travelers.,"Until last year, terrorism, economic instability, poverty and natural disasters were considered the major threats to humans globally. Infectious diseases were seen as a minor problem. This, however, changed in 2020 when the global COVID-19 pandemic broke out and a new danger emerged. The latest events generated a lot of discussion on health hazards associated with international tourism and uncontrolled spread of pathogens across the borders. The major health problems of travelers to developing countries with harsh environmental conditions and endemic infectious diseases include gastrointestinal disorders, dermatoses, respiratory infections and fevers of unknown origin. A medical interview by an experienced physician is the foundation of the post-travel screening process both in symptomatic and asymptomatic travelers; the interview should focus on identifying exposure to risk factors (endemic infectious diseases, failure to adopt disease prevention measures, consumption of food or water from unsafe sources, insect bites, animal bites, travelling in large groups, unsafe sex with casual partners). While physical examination (identification of abnormalities) and diagnostic tests (identification of pathogens) can be useful for detecting illnesses and asymptomatic infections as well as assessing the general health condition of a patient, including his immune system. The aim of the article is to provide information on the post-travel screening process in symptomatic and asymptomatic travelers who have returned from areas with harsh climate conditions and low sanitation standards.",International maritime health,2020-,Korzeniewski K,1,1599,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

However, systematic reviews of the spatiotemporal patterns of communicable diseases are rare. Using bibliometric analysis, combined with content analysis, this study aimed to summarize the number of publications and trends, the spectrum of infectious diseases, major research directions and data-methodological-theoretical characteristics, and academic communities in this field. Based on 851 relevant publications from the Web of Science core database, from January 1991 to September 2021, the study found that the increasing number of publications and the changes in the disease spectrum have been accompanied by serious outbreaks and pandemics over the past 30 years. Owing to the current pandemic of new, infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19) and the ravages of old infectious diseases (e.g., dengue and influenza), illustrated by the disease spectrum, the number of publications in this field would continue to rise. Three logically rigorous research directions-the detection of spatiotemporal patterns, identification of potential influencing factors, and risk prediction and simulation-support the research paradigm framework in this field. The role of human mobility in the transmission of insect-borne infectious diseases (e.g., dengue) and scale effects must be extensively studied in the future. Developed countries, such as the USA and England, have stronger leadership in the field. Therefore, much more effort must be made by developing countries, such as China, to improve their contribution and role in international academic collaborations.",Frontiers in public health,2022-,"Lu W, Ren H",2,1808,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

In response to this ongoing threat, significant efforts are underway to develop vaccines and antimicrobial agents. However, pathogens evolve resistance mechanisms, complicating their control. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the limitations of focusing solely on the pathogen-killing strategies of immunology and microbiology to address complex, multisystemic infectious diseases. This highlights the urgent need for practical advancements, such as microbiome therapeutics, that address these limitations while complementing traditional approaches. Our review emphasizes key outcomes in the field, including evidence of probiotics reducing disease severity and insights into host-microbiome crosstalk that have informed novel therapeutic strategies. These findings underscore the potential of microbiome-based interventions to promote physiological function alongside existing strategies aimed at enhancing host immune responses and pathogen destruction. This narrative review explores microbiome therapeutics as next-generation treatments for infectious diseases, focusing on the application of probiotics and their role in host-microbiome interactions. While offering a novel perspective grounded in a cooperative defense system, this review also addresses the practical challenges and limitations in translating these advancements into clinical settings.",Cells,2024-Dec,"Seo H, Kim S, Beck S, Song HY",4,1531,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

For many life-threatening global infectious diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, malaria and influenza, effective vaccinations are still lacking. There are numerous roadblocks to developing new vaccines, including a limited understanding of immune correlates of protection to these global infections. To induce a reproducible, strong immune response against difficult pathogens, sophisticated nanovaccine technologies are under investigation. In contrast to conventional vaccines, nanovaccines provide improved access to lymph nodes, optimal packing and presentation of antigens, and induction of a persistent immune response. This Review provides a perspective on the global trends in emerging nanoscale vaccines for infectious diseases and describes the biological, experimental and logistical problems associated with their development, and how immunoengineering can be leveraged to overcome these challenges.",Nature nanotechnology,2021-Jan,Singh A,1,1166,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

39684660,Stress Granules in Infectious Disease: Cellular Principles and Dynamic Roles in Immunity and Organelles.,"Stress granules (SGs) are membrane-less aggregates that form in response to various cellular stimuli through a process called liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Stimuli such as heat shock, osmotic stress, oxidative stress, and infections can induce the formation of SGs, which play crucial roles in regulating gene expression to help cells adapt to stress conditions. Various mRNAs and proteins are aggregated into SGs, particularly those associated with the protein translation machinery, which are frequently found in SGs. When induced by infections, SGs modulate immune cell activity, supporting the cellular response against infection. The roles of SGs differ in viral versus microbial infections, and depending on the type of immune cell involved, SGs function differently in response to infection. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the implication of SGs in immunity and cellular organelles in the context of infectious diseases. Importantly, we explore insights into the regulatory functions of SGs in the context of host cells under infection.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024-Dec,"Kim J, Song CH",2,1079,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This existential threat forces us to recognise that our existence is completely dependent upon well-functioning ecosystems that sustain the diversity of life on our planet, including that required for human health. By synthesising data on the ecology, epidemiology and evolutionary biology of various pathogens, we are gaining a better understanding of factors that underlie disease emergence and spread. However, our knowledge remains rudimentary with limited insight into the complex feedback loops that underlie ecological stability, which are at risk of rapidly unravelling once certain tipping points are breached. In this paper, we consider the impact of climate change and biodiversity collapse on the ever-present risk of infectious disease emergence and spread. We review historical and contemporaneous infectious diseases that have been influenced by human environmental manipulation, including zoonoses and vector- and water-borne diseases, alongside an evaluation of the impact of migration, urbanisation and human density on transmissible diseases.

This paper explored the significance of mathematical modeling in epidemic control efforts, focusing on the interplay between vaccination strategies, disease transmission rates, and population immunity. To facilitate meaningful comparisons of vaccination strategies, we maintained a consistent framework by fixing the vaccination capacity to vary from 10 to 100% of the total population. As an example, at a 50% vaccination capacity, the pulse strategy averted approximately 45.61% of deaths, while continuous and hybrid strategies averted around 45.18 and 45.69%, respectively. Sensitivity analysis further indicated that continuous vaccination has a more direct impact on reducing the basic reproduction number $ R_0 $ compared to pulse vaccination. By analyzing key parameters such as $ R_0 $, pulse vaccination coefficients, and continuous vaccination parameters, the study underscores the value of mathematical modeling in shaping public health policies and guiding decision-making during disease outbreaks.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2024-Sep,"Bolatova D, Kadyrov S, Kashkynbayev A",3,1197,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
37232312,Surveillance and risk assessment for early detection of emerging infectious diseases in livestock.,"Those who work in the area of surveillance and prevention of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) face a challenge in accurately predicting where infection will occur and who (or what) it will affect. Establishing surveillance and control programmes for EIDs requires substantial and long-term commitment of resources that are limited in nature. This contrasts with the unquantifiable number of possible zoonotic and non-zoonotic infectious diseases that may emerge, even when the focus is restricted to diseases involving livestock. Such diseases may emerge from many combinations of, and changes in, host species, production systems, environments/habitats and pathogen types. Given these multiple elements, risk prioritisation frameworks should be used more widely to support decision-making and resource allocation for surveillance. In this paper, the authors use recent examples of EID events in livestock to review surveillance approaches for the early detection of EIDs, and highlight the need for surveillance programmes to be informed and prioritised by regularly updated risk assessment frameworks. They conclude by discussing some unmet needs in risk assessment practices for EIDs, and the need for improved coordination in global infectious disease surveillance.",Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),2023-May,"Drewe JA, Snary EL, Crotta M, Alarcon P, Guitian J",5,1272,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The recognition of specific microbial ligands by TLRs triggers an innate immune response and also promotes adaptive immunity, which is necessary for the efficient elimination of invading pathogens. Successful pathogens have therefore evolved strategies to subvert and/or manipulate TLR signaling. Both the impairment and uncontrolled activation of TLR signaling can harm the host, causing tissue destruction and allowing pathogens to proliferate, thus favoring disease progression. In this context, microbial proteases are key virulence factors that modify components of the TLR signaling pathway.

We discuss currently available and investigational therapeutics that have the potential to modify the microbiome to prevent or treat infections among children. Finally, we review the accumulating evidence that the gut microbiome influences vaccine-elicited immune responses among children. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have led to an explosion of studies associating the human microbiome with the risk and severity of infectious diseases.

34721380,Gene-Specific Sex Effects on Susceptibility to Infectious Diseases.,"Inflammation is an integral part of defense against most infectious diseases. These pathogen-induced immune responses are in very many instances strongly influenced by host's sex. As a consequence, sexual dimorphisms were observed in susceptibility to many infectious diseases. They are pathogen dose-dependent, and their outcomes depend on pathogen and even on its species or subspecies. Sex may differentially affect pathology of various organs and its influence is modified by interaction of host's hormonal status and genotype: sex chromosomes X and Y, as well as autosomal genes. In this Mini Review we summarize the major influences of sex in human infections and subsequently focus on 22 autosomal genes/loci that modify in a sex-dependent way the response to infectious diseases in mouse models. These genes have been observed to influence susceptibility to viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi and worms. Some sex-dependent genes/loci affect susceptibility only in females or only in males, affect both sexes, but have stronger effect in one sex; still other genes were shown to affect the disease in both sexes, but with opposite direction of effect in females and males.

Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of the NLRP3 inflammasome in infectious diseases, focusing on its two-sided effects. As an essential part of host defense with a protective impact, abnormal NLRP3 inflammasome activation, however, result in a systemic high inflammatory response, leading to subsequent damage. In addition, scientific evidence of small molecules, biologics, and phytochemicals acting on the NLRP3 inflammasome has been reviewed. We believe that the NLRP3 inflammasome helps us understand the pathological mechanism of different stages of infectious diseases and that inhibitors targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome will become a new and valuable research direction for the treatment of infectious diseases.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2024-Aug,"Li Y, Qiang R, Cao Z, Wu Q, Wang J, Lyu W",6,1116,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

We used machine learning to analyze how such variables influence pathogen incidence for multihost pathogen assemblages, including one of direct transmission (coronaviruses and bats) and two vector-borne systems (West Nile Virus [WNV] and birds, and malaria and birds). Here we show that this methodology is able to provide reliable global spatial susceptibility predictions for the studied host-pathogen systems, even when using a small amount of incidence information (i.e., [Formula: see text] of information in a database). We found that avian malaria was mostly affected by environmental factors and by an interaction between phylogeny and geography, and WNV susceptibility was mostly influenced by phylogeny and by the interaction between geographic and environmental distances, whereas coronavirus susceptibility was mostly affected by geography.

Many viruses have existed in their natural reservoirs for a very long time, and the spillover of viruses from natural hosts to humans via interspecies transmission serves as the main source of emerging infectious diseases. Widely existing viruses capable of utilizing human receptors to infect human cells in animals signal the possible outbreak of another viral infection in the near future. Extensive and close collaborative surveillance across nations, more effective wildlife trade legislation, and robust investment into applied and basic research will help to combat the possible pandemics of new emerging infectious diseases in the future.",Bioscience trends,2023-Jul,"Yang Y, Guo L, Lu H",3,828,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33491541,Drivers of Infectious Disease Seasonality: Potential Implications for COVID-19.,"Not 1 year has passed since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its emergence, great uncertainty has surrounded the potential for COVID-19 to establish as a seasonally recurrent disease. Many infectious diseases, including endemic human coronaviruses, vary across the year. They show a wide range of seasonal waveforms, timing (phase), and amplitudes, which differ depending on the geographical region. Drivers of such patterns are predominantly studied from an epidemiological perspective with a focus on weather and behavior, but complementary insights emerge from physiological studies of seasonality in animals, including humans. Thus, we take a multidisciplinary approach to integrate knowledge from usually distinct fields. First, we review epidemiological evidence of environmental and behavioral drivers of infectious disease seasonality. Subsequently, we take a chronobiological perspective and discuss within-host changes that may affect susceptibility, morbidity, and mortality from infectious diseases. Based on photoperiodic, circannual, and comparative human data, we not only identify promising future avenues but also highlight the need for further studies in animal models. Our preliminary assessment is that host immune seasonality warrants evaluation alongside weather and human behavior as factors that may contribute to COVID-19 seasonality, and that the relative importance of these drivers requires further investigation. A major challenge to predicting seasonality of infectious diseases are rapid, human-induced changes in the hitherto predictable seasonality of our planet, whose influence we review in a final outlook section. We conclude that a proactive multidisciplinary approach is warranted to predict, mitigate, and prevent seasonal infectious diseases in our complex, changing human-earth system.",Journal of biological rhythms,2021-Feb,"Kronfeld-Schor N, Stevenson TJ, Nickbakhsh S, Schernhammer ES, Dopico XC, Dayan T, Martinez M, Helm B",8,1939,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39094447,Detection strategies of infectious diseases via peptide-based electrochemical biosensors.,"Infectious diseases have threatened human life for as long as humankind has existed. One of the most crucial aspects of fighting against these infections is diagnosis to prevent disease spread. However, traditional diagnostic methods prove insufficient and time-consuming in the face of a pandemic. Therefore, studies focusing on detecting viruses causing these diseases have increased, with a particular emphasis on developing rapid, accurate, specific, user-friendly, and portable electrochemical biosensor systems. Peptides are used integral components in biosensor fabrication for several reasons, including various and adaptable synthesis protocols, long-term stability, and specificity. Here, we discuss peptide-based electrochemical biosensor systems that have been developed over the last decade for the detection of infectious diseases. In contrast to other reports on peptide-based biosensors, we have emphasized the following points i) the synthesis methods of peptides for biosensor applications, ii) biosensor fabrication approaches of peptide-based electrochemical biosensor systems, iii) the comparison of electrochemical biosensors with other peptide-based biosensor systems and the advantages and limitations of electrochemical biosensors, iv) the pros and cons of peptides compared to other biorecognition molecules in the detection of infectious diseases, v) different perspectives for future studies with the shortcomings of the systems developed in the past decade.","Bioelectrochemistry (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2024-Dec,"Balaban Hanoglu S, Harmanci D, Evran S, Timur S",4,1486,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33276141,Patterns of diseases in health students abroad: A systematic review.,"Different health risks are associated with international electives among medical students, including the transmission of infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases. This review aims to summarise the evidence for illnesses associated with travel in medical students taking part in electives abroad. Articles were identified through a literature search in two databases (until 30 July 2020) - PubMed and Web of Science. Sixteen articles were included in the systematic review. The results were classified into two broad categories: communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases. Gastrointestinal infections including travellers' diarrhoea were the most common infectious diseases reported by medical students abroad, followed by respiratory tract infections and skin infections. Blood-borne and sexually transmitted infection and systemic febrile infections due to vector-borne pathogens were rarely reported. Only six of the 16 studies addressed microbial carriage. The acquisition of resistant bacteria appeared to be frequent. Traffic accidents and mental health problems were also reported. One of the lessons learned from this review is the requirement for large-scale epidemiological studies to evaluate the burden of infectious diseases such as gastrointestinal, respiratory and blood-borne infections with microbiological documentation. In particular, the emergence of the acquisition of resistant bacteria may lead to a theoretical risk of spread to the community and hospitals. Studies addressing mental health issues in the context of medical electives abroad are also needed.",Travel medicine and infectious disease,2021-,"Dao TL, Gautret P",2,1598,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

36790888,Domestic Animals as Potential Reservoirs of Zoonotic Viral Diseases.,"Zoonoses are diseases and infections naturally transmitted between humans and vertebrate animals. Over the years, zoonoses have become increasingly significant threats to global health. They form the dominant group of diseases among the emerging infectious diseases (EID) and currently account for 73% of EID. Approximately 25% of zoonoses originate in domestic animals. The etiological agents of zoonoses include different pathogens, with viruses accounting for approximately 30% of all zoonotic infections. Zoonotic diseases can be transmitted directly or indirectly, by contact, via aerosols, through a vector, or vertically in utero. Zoonotic diseases are found in every continent except Antarctica. Numerous factors associated with the pathogen, human activities, and the environment play significant roles in the transmission and emergence of zoonotic diseases.

33907162,Serum leptin level as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in infectious diseases and sepsis: A comprehensive literature review.,"Infections and sepsis are common causes of morbidity and mortality, with an increasing incidence worldwide. Leptin is involved in the inflammatory process and may modulate the cytokine production, immune cell proliferation and endothelial function. There are conflicting results regarding alterations of leptin levels in infectious diseases and the outcome from sepsis.The aim of the current article is to provide an overview of the medical literature on the correlations between variations of leptin levels and infectious diseases and sepsis. We performed an extensive literature search in PubMed and Google Scholar databases, using keywords to identify articles related to leptin in infectious diseases and sepsis. Searches were referenced using medical subject headings that included ""leptin,"" ""adipokines,"" ""sepsis,"" ""infectious diseases,"" ""leptin deficiency,"" ""leptin resistance"" or ""hyperleptinemia."" The language of publication, journal, or country were not included as limitation criteria.Articles or abstracts containing adequate information, such as age, sex, anthropometric indices, clinical presentation, comorbidities, and management were included in the study, whereas articles with insufficient clinical and demographic data were excluded. We assessed the quality of the studies selected.The final review of all databases was conducted on June 18, 2020. We find the results from the current review to be of great importance due to the possible therapeutic role of leptin analogs in states of leptin deficiency associated with infectious diseases or sepsis.In hyperleptinemia, a therapeutic plan for obtaining leptin neutralization also needs further investigations. This could lead to the reduction of proinflammatory responses.There is a need for further studies to demonstrate the specificity and sensitivity of leptin in the early diagnosis of sepsis and the need to measure serum leptin levels in routine evaluation of the critical patient. The multiple effects of leptin are of growing interest, but further studies are needed to elucidate the role of leptin signalling in infectious diseases and sepsis. Because very few human studies are reported, we recommend the need for further research.Better understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis and the implication of circulating total leptin in this process could help physicians in managing this life-threatening condition.",Medicine,2021-Apr,"Birlutiu V, Boicean LC",2,2397,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Two reviewers independently determined inclusion and exclusion. Of 2,887 articles identified, 354 studies met inclusion criteria, the majority of which were application papers. Studies of airborne diseases were dominant, followed by vector-borne diseases. Most research used aggregated data instead of point data, and a significant proportion of articles used a repetition of a spatial clustering method, instead of using a ""true"" space-time detection approach, potentially leading to the detection of false positives. Noticeably, most articles did not make their data available, limiting replicability. This review underlines recent trends in the application of space-time clustering methods to the field of infectious disease, with a rapid increase during the COVID-19 pandemic.",Spatial and spatio-temporal epidemiology,2023-Feb,"Lan Y, Delmelle E",2,1132,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The climate is changing, and the impacts are complex, with multifaceted effects. In addition to connecting climate change and infectious diseases, we aim to draw attention to the challenges of working across multiple disciplines. Doing this requires concentrated efforts in a variety of areas to advance the technological state of the art and at the same time implement ideas and explain to the everyday citizen what is happening. The world's experience with COVID-19 has revealed many gaps in our past approaches to anticipating emerging infectious diseases. Most approaches to predicting outbreaks and identifying emerging microbes of major consequence have been with those causing high morbidity and mortality in humans and animals. These lagging indicators offer limited ability to prevent disease spillover and amplifications in new hosts. Leading indicators and novel approaches are more valuable and now feasible, with multidisciplinary approaches also within our grasp to provide links to disease predictions through holistic monitoring of micro and macro ecological changes.

Branded drug manufacturers face few barriers to exorbitant pricing of drugs with exclusivity-as in the cases of Sovaldi, Zyvox, and Truvada. Furthermore, albendazole, pyrimethamine, and penicillin demonstrate that generic medications without patent exclusivity are not guaranteed to have durably low costs, especially where manufacturer competition is lacking.

37405992,Injuries and medical emergencies among international travellers.,"Tropical infectious diseases and vaccine-preventable emergencies are the mainstay of pre-travel consultations. However, non-communicable diseases, injuries and accidents that occur during travel are not emphasized enough in these settings. We performed a narrative review based on a literature search of PubMed, Google Scholar, UpToDate, DynaMed and LiSSa and on reference textbooks and medical journals dedicated to travel, emergency and wilderness medicine. Relevant secondary references were extracted. We also aimed to discuss newer or neglected issues, such as medical tourism, Coronavirus Disease 2019, exacerbations of co-morbidities associated with international travel, insurance coverage, health care seeking abroad, medical evacuation or repatriation and tips for different types of travellers' emergency medical kits (personal, group, physician handled). All sources reviewed led to the selection of >170 references. Among epidemiological data on morbidity and deaths while abroad, only retrospective data are available. Deaths are estimated to occur in 1 in 100 000 travellers, with 40% caused by trauma and 60% by diseases, and <3% linked to infectious diseases. Trauma and other injuries acquired during travel, such as traffic accidents and drowning, can be reduced by up to 85% with simple preventive recommendations such as avoiding simultaneous alcohol intake. In-flight emergencies occur on 1 in 604 flights on average. Thrombosis risk is two to three times greater for travellers than for non-travellers. Fever during or after travel can occur in 2-4% of travellers, but in up to 25-30% in tertiary centres. Traveller's diarrhoea, although rarely severe, is the most common disease associated with travel. Autochthonous emergencies (acute appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, dental abscess) can also occur.

34024014,Transdermal drug delivery systems for fighting common viral infectious diseases.,"Transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) have many advantages and represent an excellent alternative to oral delivery and hypodermic injections. TDDS are more convenient and less invasive tools for disease and viral infection treatment, prevention, detection, and surveillance. The emerging development of microneedles for TDDS has facilitated improved skin barrier penetration for the delivery of macromolecules or hydrophilic drugs. Microneedle TDDS patches can be fabricated to deliver virus vaccines and potentially provide a viable alternative vaccine modality that offers improved immunogenicity, thermostability, simplicity, safety, and compliance as well as sharp-waste reduction, increased cost-effectiveness, and the capacity for self-administration, which could improve vaccine distribution. These advantages make TDDS-based vaccine delivery an especially well-suited option for treatment of widespread viral infectious diseases including pandemics. Because microneedle-based bioassays employ transdermal extraction of interstitial fluid or blood, they can be used as a minimally invasive approach for surveying disease markers and providing point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. For cutaneous viral infections, TDDS can provide localized treatment with high specificity and less systemic toxicity. In summary, TDDS, especially those that employ microneedles, possess special attributes that can be leveraged to reduce morbidity and mortality from viral infectious diseases. In this regard, they may have considerable positive impact as a modality for improving global health. In this article, we introduce the possible role and summarize the current literature regarding TDDS applications for fighting common cutaneous or systemic viral infectious diseases, including herpes simplex, varicella or herpes zoster, warts, influenza, measles, and COVID-19.",Drug delivery and translational research,2021-Aug,"Wang FY, Chen Y, Huang YY, Cheng CM",4,1859,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This protein is susceptible to cleavage of its linker-peptides by several proteases, and the resulting cleaved forms, N-terminal carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and C-terminal CRD, bind to various glycans. It has been suggested that full-length (FL)-Gal-9 and the truncated (Tr)-Gal-9s could exert different functions from one another via their different glycan-binding activities. We propose that FL-Gal-9 regulates the pathogenesis of infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, HIV co-infected with opportunistic infection (HIV/OI), dengue, malaria, leptospirosis, and tuberculosis (TB). We also suggest that the blood levels of FL-Gal-9 reflect the severity of dengue, malaria, and HIV/OI, and those of Tr-Gal-9 markedly reflect the severity of HIV/OI. Recently, matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) was suggested to be an indicator of respiratory failure from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as useful for differentiating pulmonary from extrapulmonary TB. The protease cleavage of FL-Gal-9 may lead to uncontrolled hyper-immune activation, including a cytokine storm.

However, infection sources and drivers for outbreaks of airborne viral EIDs remain unknown. Here, we aim to explore the driving mechanisms of outbreaks based on the one health perspective. Outbreak information for 20 types of airborne viral EIDs was collected from the Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network database and a systematic literature review. Four statistically significant and high-risk spatiotemporal clusters for airborne viral EID outbreaks were identified globally using multivariate scan statistic tests. There were 112 outbreaks with clear infection sources, and zoonotic spillover was the most common source (95.54%, 107/112). Since 1970, the majority of outbreaks occurred in healthcare facilities (24.82%), followed by schools (17.93%) and animal-related settings (15.93%). Significant associations were detected between the number of earthquakes, storms, duration of floods, and airborne viral EIDs' outbreaks using a case-crossover study design and multivariable conditional logistic regression. These findings implied that zoonotic spillover and extreme weather events are driving global outbreaks of airborne viral EIDs, and targeted prevention and control measures should be made to reduce the airborne viral EIDs burden.",Journal of medical virology,2024-Jun,"Wang Z, Pei S, Cui H, Zhang J, Jia Z",5,1434,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
32070807,Infectious diseases occurring in the context of substance use disorders: A concise review.,"Prevalence of infectious diseases is substantially higher among patients with substance use disorders (SUD). Factors associated with drug use including sharing needles and injecting supplies, presence of contaminants in drugs and drug use related paraphernalia, risky behaviors associated with drug use, immune suppression secondary to chronic drug use, poverty and homelessness all increase the risk of infections. Persons with SUD have low rates of health care utilization and may miss opportunities for early diagnosis and care of infectious complications of substance use. When infectious diseases are comorbid with drug use, they are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and result in significant healthcare costs. Patients with SUD may be rescued from an overdose, detoxified or treated for a SUD but facilities and clinicians are often reluctant to assume responsibility for evaluation and treatment of concurrent infectious or medical diseases. Increased screening for these disorders, utilizing vaccinations and other preventative strategies including clean supplies and safe injecting sites and providing comprehensive substance use and infectious disease treatment have the potential to significantly improve patient related outcomes and enhance public health. In this paper we review the prevalence of various common infectious diseases among persons who use drugs, their clinical presentation, mode of transmission, screening and diagnosis. We detail some of the common mechanisms by which persons who use drugs are at increased risk of contracting infections.

These diseases are considered potentially epidemic, due to the nature of tropical climate and high humidity of Indonesia's area. Several factors contribute to the emergence of these diseases: in conjunction with human behavior. Most of these diseases are zoonotic, specifically spread by viruses. The latest emerging infectious disease in Indonesia is monkeypox. Controlling the management of EID-REIDs presents a major obstacle for international health initiatives, particularly in Indonesia because of its extensive population, varied geographical landscape, and constrained resources. Overcoming these obstacles demands tactics like prioritizing Indonesian policies, bolstering disease monitoring systems, upgrading diagnostic capacities, fortifying public health facilities, fostering community involvement and education, and executing efficient prevention and management protocols.

These dramatic changes in human social evolution significantly increased opportunities for the spread of zoonotic infectious diseases in denser human communities with increased sanitation challenges. In light of a growing body of research that indicates that anthropogenic air pollution causes numerous threats to health and is taking a far greater toll on human life and wellbeing than had been reported, this paper proposes the possibility that air pollution is now the primary driver of infectious disease syndemics. In support of this assertion, this paper reviews the growth and health impacts of air pollution, the relationship of air pollution to the development and spread of infectious diseases, and reported cases of air pollution-driven infectious disease syndemics, and presents public health recommendations for leveraging the biosocial insight of syndemic theory in responding to infectious disease.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2024-Apr,Singer M,1,1186,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

31284037,Profiling infectious diseases in Turkey after the influx of 3.5 million Syrian refugees.,"Since 2011, the conflict in Syria has led to over five million refugees. Turkey hosts the highest number of Syrian refugees in the world. By February 2019 over 3.6 million people had fled to Turkey to seek safety. Only 6.1% of Syrian refugees live in temporary shelters. Owing to the disrupted healthcare services, many children coming from the conflict zones are less likely to have received vaccination. In temporary shelters immunization coverage is >95% and the refugee population is receptive to vaccination. The objective of this study was to review the infectious diseases situation among Syrian refugees in Turkey. We have reviewed the reports and studies provided by the governmental and non-governmental organizations and obtained more detailed data from the Ministry of Health in Turkey. Between 2012 and 2016, 1 299 209 cases of respiratory tract infection and 158 058 episodes of diarrhoea with 59 bloody diarrhoeas were reported; 1354 hepatitis A cases and 108 active tuberculosis cases were detected and treated in the temporary shelters for Syrian refugees. Overall in Turkey, 7794 cutaneous leishmaniasis have been reported. Since the influx of Syrian refugees, there has been an increase in cases of leishmaniasis and measles. No significant increase was detected for tuberculosis, other vector-borne infections, and healthcare associated or sexually transmitted infections. The Syrian refugees can be considered as a vulnerable group in Turkey due to their living and working conditions. Based on available data and our detailed analysis, the numbers show a stable situation regarding infectious diseases.",Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,2020-Mar,"Ergönül Ö, Tülek N, Kayı I, Irmak H, Erdem O, Dara M",6,1624,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33667294,The State of Microbiome Science at the Intersection of Infectious Diseases and Antimicrobial Resistance.,"Along with the rise in modern chronic diseases, ranging from diabetes to asthma, there are challenges posed by increasing antibiotic resistance, which results in difficult-to-treat infections, as well as sepsis. An emerging and unifying theme in the pathogenesis of these diverse public health threats is changes in the microbial communities that inhabit multiple body sites. Although there is great promise in exploring the role of these microbial communities in chronic disease pathogenesis, the shorter timeframe of most infectious disease pathogenesis may allow early translation of our basic scientific understanding of microbial ecology and host-microbiota-pathogen interactions. Likely translation avenues include development of preventive strategies, diagnostics, and therapeutics. For example, as basic research related to microbial pathogenesis continues to progress, Clostridioides difficile infection is already being addressed clinically through at least 2 of these 3 avenues: targeted antibiotic stewardship and treatment of recurrent disease through fecal microbiota transplantation.",The Journal of infectious diseases,2021-Jun,"Ranallo RT, McDonald LC, Halpin AL, Hiltke T, Young VB",5,1098,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

38780294,Applying lessons of COVID-19 and other emerging infectious diseases to future outbreaks.,"Infectious diseases are emerging and re-emerging far more frequently than many appreciate. In the past two decades alone, there have been numerous outbreaks (e.g., Ebola, chikungunya, Zika, and Mpox) and pandemics (i.e., swine flu and coronavirus disease 2019) with profound effects to public health, the economy, and society at large. Rather than view these in isolation, there are important lessons pertaining to how best to contend with future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. Those lessons span definition (i.e., what constitutes a pandemic), through deficiencies in surveillance, data collection and reporting, the execution of research in a rapidly changing environment, the nuances of study design and hierarchy of clinical evidence, triage according to clinical need as supply chains become overwhelmed, and the challenges surrounding forecasting of outbreaks. Understanding those lessons and drawing on both the successes and failures of the past are imperative if we are to overcome the challenges of outbreak/pandemic responsiveness.",mBio,2024-Jun,"Bloch EM, Sullivan DJ, Casadevall A, Shoham S, Tobian AAR, Gebo K",6,1054,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
37919210,Leveraging Donor Populations to Study the Epidemiology and Pathogenesis of Transfusion-Transmitted and Emerging Infectious Diseases.,"The tragedy of transfusion-associated hepatitis and HIV spurred a decades-long overhaul of the regulatory oversight and practice of blood transfusion. Consequent to improved donor selection, testing, process control, clinical transfusion practice and post-transfusion surveillance, transfusion in the United States and other high-income countries is now a very safe medical procedure. Nonetheless, pathogens continue to emerge and threaten the blood supply, highlighting the need for a proactive approach to blood transfusion safety. Blood donor populations and the global transfusion infrastructure are under-utilized resources for the study of infectious diseases. Blood donors are large, demographically diverse subsets of general populations for whom cross-sectional and longitudinal samples are readily accessible for serological and molecular testing. Blood donor collection networks span diverse geographies, including in low- and middle-income countries, where agents, especially zoonotic pathogens, are able to emerge and spread, given limited tools for recognition, surveillance and control. Routine laboratory storage and transportation, coupled with data capture, afford access to rich epidemiological data to assess the epidemiology and pathogenesis of established and emerging infections. Subsequent to the State of the Science in Transfusion Medicine symposium in 2022, our working group (WG), ""Emerging Infections: Impact on Blood Science, the Blood Supply, Blood Safety, and Public Health"" elected to focus on ""leveraging donor populations to study the epidemiology and pathogenesis of transfusion-transmitted and emerging infectious diseases."" The 5 landmark studies span (1) the implication of hepatitis C virus in post-transfusion hepatitis, (2) longitudinal evaluation of plasma donors with incident infections, thus informing the development of a widely used staging system for acute HIV infection, (3) explication of the dynamics of early West Nile Virus infection, (4) the deployment of combined molecular and serological donor screening for Babesia microti, to characterize its epidemiology and infectivity and facilitate routine donor screening, and (5) national serosurveillance for SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Initial items on five constructs of the Health Belief Model were derived through focus group interviews and a literature review. These items were revised and supplemented through expert consultation to verify content validity. Data were collected from June 27, 2021, to July 5, 2021. We used the data of 201 adults aged 19-65 years for item analysis and assessment of construct, convergent, and discriminant validities and reliability. The final Health Belief in Emerging Infectious Respiratory Disease Preventive Behaviors' Scale (HB-EIRD Preventive Behaviors' Scale) included 23 items on five factors, and cumulative explanatory variation was 63.0%. The fit indices were acceptable. Cronbach's α was 0.77. The scale can be scored 23-92; a higher score indicates stronger preventive behaviors. The HB-EIRD Preventive Behaviors' Scale can be used to evaluate patients' health beliefs and predict preventive behaviors against emerging respiratory infectious diseases.

32923353,Neglected Tropical Diseases and Other Infectious Diseases Affecting the Heart. The NET-Heart Project: Rationale and Design.,"Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of infections that are prevalent in many of the tropical and sub-tropical developing countries where poverty is rampant. NTDs have remained largely unnoticed in the global health agenda. There is a substantial gap between the burden of disease for NTDs in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and research devoted to the affected populations. We created a Latin-American initiative with emerging leaders (EL) from the Interamerican Society of Cardiology (IASC) with the objective to perform multiple systematic reviews of NTDs and other infectious diseases affecting the heart: The NET-Heart Project. To describe the rationale and design considerations of the NET-Heart project. The NET-Heart Project is a collaborative work of the IASC EL program. The main objective of the NET-Heart project is to systematically evaluate the available evidence of NTDs and other infectious diseases and their cardiovascular involvement. As a secondary objective, this initiative aims to offer recommendations and potential diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms that can aid the management of cardiovascular complications of these infectious diseases. After an expert discussion 17 initial infectious diseases were selected, for each disease we created one working group. The project was structured in different phases: Systematic review, brainstorming workshops, analysis and results, manuscript writing and recommendations and evaluation of clinical implications. The NET-Heart project is an innovative collaborative initiative created to assess burden and impact of NTDs and other infectious diseases in CVD. NTDs can no longer be ignored and must be prioritised on the health and research agenda. This project aims to review in depth the evidence regarding cardiac compromise of these serious conditions and to propose strategies to overcome barriers for efficient diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular complications.",Global heart,2020-Sep,"Burgos LM, Farina J, Liendro MC, Saldarriaga C, Liprandi AS, Wyss F, Mendoza I, Baranchuk A",8,1949,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

31734357,Sniffing animals as a diagnostic tool in infectious diseases.,"Scents and odours characterize some microbes when grown in the laboratory, and experienced clinicians can diagnose patients with some infectious diseases based on their smell. Animal sniffing is an innate behaviour, and animals' olfactory acuity is used for detecting people, weapons, bombs, narcotics and food. We briefly summarized current knowledge regarding the use of sniffing animals to diagnose some infectious diseases and the potential use of scent-based diagnostic instruments in microbiology. Information was sought through PubMed and extracted from peer-reviewed literature published between January 2000 and September 2019 and from reliable online news. The search terms 'odour', 'scent', 'bacteria', 'diagnostics', 'tuberculosis', 'malaria' and 'volatile compounds' were used. Four major areas of using sniffing animals are summarized. Dogs have been used to reliably detect stool associated with toxigenic Clostridioides difficile and for surveillance. Dogs showed high sensitivity and moderate specificity for detecting urinary tract infections in comparison to culture, especially for Escherichia coli. African giant pouched rats showed superiority for diagnosing tuberculosis over microscopy, but inferiority to culture/molecular methods. Several approaches for detecting malaria by analysing host skin odour or exhaled breath have been explored successfully. Some microbial infections produce specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can be analysed by spectrometry, metabolomics or other analytical approaches to replace animal sniffing. The results of sniffing animal studies are fascinating, and animal sniffing can provide intermediate diagnostic solutions for some infectious diseases. Lack of reproducibility, and cost of animal training and housing are major drawbacks for wider implementation of sniffing animals. The ultimate goal is to understand the biological background of this animal ability and to characterize the specific VOCs that animals are recognizing. VOC identification, improvement of odour sampling methods and development of point-of-care instruments could allow implementation of scent-based tests for major human pathogens.",Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,2020-Apr,"Cambau E, Poljak M",2,2179,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

34594332,Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-Like Receptors in Regulating the Immune Response in Infectious Diseases: A Window of Opportunity to Pathogen Persistence and a Sound Target in Therapeutics.,"Immunoregulatory receptors are essential for orchestrating an immune response as well as appropriate inflammation in infectious and non-communicable diseases. Among them, leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs) consist of activating and inhibitory receptors that play an important role in regulating immune responses modulating the course of disease progression. On the one hand, inhibitory LILRs constitute a safe-guard system that mitigates the inflammatory response, allowing a prompt return to immune homeostasis. On the other hand, because of their unique capacity to attenuate immune responses, pathogens use inhibitory LILRs to evade immune recognition, thus facilitating their persistence within the host. Conversely, the engagement of activating LILRs triggers immune responses and the production of inflammatory mediators to fight microbes. However, their heightened activation could lead to an exacerbated immune response and persistent inflammation with major consequences on disease outcome and autoimmune disorders. Here, we review the genetic organisation, structure and ligands of LILRs as well as their role in regulating the immune response and inflammation. We also discuss the LILR-based strategies that pathogens use to evade immune responses. A better understanding of the contribution of LILRs to host-pathogen interactions is essential to define appropriate treatments to counteract the severity and/or persistence of pathogens in acute and chronic infectious diseases lacking efficient treatments.",Frontiers in immunology,2021-,"Abdallah F, Coindre S, Gardet M, Meurisse F, Naji A, Suganuma N, Abi-Rached L, Lambotte O, Favier B",9,1530,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Due to geographic, political, social, behavioral, and genomic differences, some populations are more vulnerable to infectious disease spread than others. The purpose of this article is to present a framework for research and practice response to emergent infectious diseases that addresses multiple transdisciplinary actions to limit exposure or mitigate adverse outcomes for individuals and communities. Recent experience with new strains of emergent infectious diseases reinforces the importance of intervening at multiple levels, from genomics to political messaging to create multipronged, transdisciplinary interventions to contain the threat. In particular, incorporation of genomics into public health nursing practice of infectious diseases management can enhance existing regional-, community-, and individual-level health promotion and protection efforts, thus impacting long-term health outcomes.","Public health nursing (Boston, Mass.)",2023-Jan,"Prescott S, Schminkey D, Abukhalaf D, DeGuzman P, Dreisbach C",5,1061,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33897683,Modulatory Effects of Probiotics During Pathogenic Infections With Emphasis on Immune Regulation.,"In order to inhibit pathogenic complications and to enhance animal and poultry growth, antibiotics have been extensively used for many years. Antibiotics applications not only affect target pathogens but also intestinal beneficially microbes, inducing long-lasting changes in intestinal microbiota associated with diseases. The application of antibiotics also has many other side effects like, intestinal barrier dysfunction, antibiotics residues in foodstuffs, nephropathy, allergy, bone marrow toxicity, mutagenicity, reproductive disorders, hepatotoxicity carcinogenicity, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which greatly compromise the efficacy of antibiotics. Thus, the development of new antibiotics is necessary, while the search for antibiotic alternatives continues. Probiotics are considered the ideal antibiotic substitute; in recent years, probiotic research concerning their application during pathogenic infections in humans, aquaculture, poultry, and livestock industry, with emphasis on modulating the immune system of the host, has been attracting considerable interest. Hence, the adverse effects of antibiotics and remedial effects of probiotics during infectious diseases have become central points of focus among researchers. Probiotics are live microorganisms, and when given in adequate quantities, confer good health effects to the host through different mechanisms. Among them, the regulation of host immune response during pathogenic infections is one of the most important mechanisms. A number of studies have investigated different aspects of probiotics. In this review, we mainly summarize recent discoveries and discuss two important aspects: (1) the application of probiotics during pathogenic infections; and (2) their modulatory effects on the immune response of the host during infectious and non-infectious diseases.",Frontiers in immunology,2021-,"Raheem A, Liang L, Zhang G, Cui S",4,1851,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The COVID-19 pandemic response leveraged these innovations to enable rapid development of candidate vaccines within weeks of the viral genetic sequence being made available. The development of vaccines to tackle emerging infectious diseases is a priority for the World Health Organization and other global entities. More than 70% of emerging infectious diseases are acquired from animals, with some causing illness and death in both humans and the respective animal host. Yet the study of critical host-pathogen interactions and the underlying immune mechanisms to inform the development of vaccines for their control is traditionally done in medical and veterinary immunology 'silos'.

China and the USA-due to their unparalleled resources, widespread engagement in activities driving emerging infectious diseases and national as well as geopolitical imperatives to contribute to global health security-play an essential role in our understanding of pandemic threats. Critical to efforts to mitigate risk is building upon existing investments in global capacity to develop training and research focused on the ecological factors driving infectious disease spillover from animals to humans. International cooperation, particularly between China and the USA, is essential to fully engage the resources and scientific strengths necessary to add this ecological emphasis to the pandemic preparedness strategy.

39407144,Association of modifiable risk factors and infectious diseases among individuals with hypertension: a prospective cohort study.,"A comprehensive assessment of combined modifiable risk factors in relation to infectious diseases among individuals with hypertension is lacking, and the potential mechanisms of these associations remain unclear. To investigate the prospective associations of a combination of lifestyle behaviors and cardiometabolic factors with the risk of infectious diseases among individuals with hypertension and to estimate whether and to what extent blood biomarkers mediate these associations. This cohort study included 147,188 participants with hypertension and complete data on modifiable risk factors from the UK Biobank. Health score was constructed from eight modifiable risk factors, including four lifestyle behaviors (diet, physical activity, smoking, and sleep duration) and four cardiometabolic factors (body mass index, blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the health score and infectious diseases. The mediation analysis was performed to assess the potential intermediation effects of blood biomarkers. Over a median follow-up of 12.5 years, 27,398 participants with infectious diseases were documented, with 960 respiratory infectious diseases and 7940 digestive infectious diseases. After adjusting for potential confounders, the HR (95% CI) for the highest versus the lowest quartile of health score was 0.64 (0.62, 0.66) for infectious diseases, 0.72 (0.60, 0.86) for respiratory infectious diseases, and 0.66 (0.62, 0.71) for digestive infectious diseases. Stratified factors including duration of hypertension did not modify the associations between the health score and infectious diseases. In addition, biomarkers including inflammation and renal function collectively explained 46.60% of the associations between the combined lifestyle factors and infectious disease risk among individuals with hypertension. Ideal management of combined modifiable risk factors was associated with lower risks of infectious diseases and might produce profound changes in blood biomarkers among individuals with hypertension. Additionally, specific biomarkers appeared to serve as an intermediate between combined lifestyle factors and infectious diseases. These insights highlighted the important role of a combination of healthy lifestyle and favorable cardiometabolic status in reducing disease burden and facilitated the understanding of biological mechanisms underlying modifiable risk factors with infectious diseases.",BMC infectious diseases,2024-Oct,"Hu N, Ai B, Wang Y, Ren Y, Chen H, Chen Z, Li W",7,2559,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The first step towards improved livestock health and productivity is to map the presence of livestock diseases. The objective of this review was to summarize studies conducted on such diseases in an emerging economy, Vietnam, and thereby identifying knowledge gaps that may inform the design of surveillance and control programs. Few studies were found to evaluate the distribution of infectious livestock diseases other than avian influenza. Also, many regions with dense livestock populations had received little attention in terms of disease investigation. A large proportion of the studies dealt with zoonoses and food-borne infections which might be due to funding agencies priorities. On the contrary, studies targeting infections that affect livestock and their productivity were few. We think that this limitation in scientific reports on infectious diseases that only affect livestock productivity is a common phenomenon in low and lower middle income countries. More science-based data on such diseases would help policymakers to prioritize which livestock diseases should be subject to animal health programs aimed to support rural livelihoods and economic development.",Animal health research reviews,2021-Jun,"Rajala E, Lee HS, Nam NH, Huong CTT, Son HM, Wieland B, Magnusson U",7,1316,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The identification of research themes and global contributions offers valuable insights. This manuscript aims to analyse and map scientific research on POCT in the context of infectious diseases. The study employed a comprehensive search strategy using terms related to POCT and infectious diseases. The search was conducted on the Scopus database, refining results based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The dataset of 1719 research articles was then subjected to descriptive analysis and mapping using VOSviewer. The research findings indicate an exponential growth in POCT-related publications, with 46.8% published post the COVID-19 pandemic. Plos One journal led in publication frequency, and Biosensors and Bioelectronics received the highest citations per article. North America and Western Europe dominated contributions, with notable participation from China, South Africa, and India. The research landscape revealed the following research themes: detection technologies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis, antibiotic optimisation, and schistosomiasis. Clinical trials focused on antibiotic prescribing, HIV, STIs, and specific infections. The findings suggest a shifting landscape towards POCT, emphasising the need for future planning and investment in healthcare systems. The research identifies areas for future exploration, such as the impact of POCT on antibiotic prescribing and its role in combating infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries. Implementation of POCT has the potential to revolutionise infectious disease management, improve patient outcomes, and reduce the global burden of diseases. Better public awareness, healthcare team management, and planning for POCT at entry points are crucial for societal benefit.

36707203,Exploring the role of secretory proteins in the human infectious diseases diagnosis and therapeutics.,"Secretory proteins are playing important role during the host-pathogen interaction to develop the infection or protection into the cell. Pathogens developing infectious disease to human being are taken up by host macrophages or number of immune cells, play an important role in physiological, developmental and immunological function. At the same time, infectious agents are also secreting various proteins to neutralize the resistance caused by host cells and also helping the pathogens to develop the infection. Secretory proteins (secretome) are only developed at the time of host-pathogen interaction, therefore they become very important to develop the targeted and potential therapeutic strategies. Pathogen specific secretory proteins released during interaction with host cell provide opportunity to develop point of care and rapid diagnostic kits. Proteins secreted by pathogens at the time of interaction with host cell have also been found as immunogenic in nature and numbers of vaccines have been developed to control the spread of human infectious diseases.

38827746,Single domain antibodies from camelids in the treatment of microbial infections.,"Infectious diseases continue to pose significant global health challenges. In addition to the enduring burdens of ailments like malaria and HIV, the emergence of nosocomial outbreaks driven by antibiotic-resistant pathogens underscores the ongoing threats. Furthermore, recent infectious disease crises, exemplified by the Ebola and SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, have intensified the pursuit of more effective and efficient diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. Among the promising options, antibodies have garnered significant attention due to their favorable structural characteristics and versatile applications. Notably, nanobodies (Nbs), the smallest functional single-domain antibodies of heavy-chain only antibodies produced by camelids, exhibit remarkable capabilities in stable antigen binding. They offer unique advantages such as ease of expression and modification and enhanced stability, as well as improved hydrophilicity compared to conventional antibody fragments (antigen-binding fragments (Fab) or single-chain variable fragments (scFv)) that can aggregate due to their low solubility. Nanobodies directly target antigen epitopes or can be engineered into multivalent Nbs and Nb-fusion proteins, expanding their therapeutic potential. This review is dedicated to charting the progress in Nb research, particularly those derived from camelids, and highlighting their diverse applications in treating infectious diseases, spanning both human and animal contexts.",Frontiers in immunology,2024-,"De Greve H, Fioravanti A",2,1470,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
32045342,"Relationship between Child Sexual Abuse, Psychiatric Disorders and Infectious Diseases: A Matched-Cohort Study.","Child sexual abuse (CSA) has been strongly associated with a range of psychological and physical problems in childhood and adulthood, such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and infectious diseases. Despite the strength of these associations, no studies to date have investigated psychobiological processes that might underlie the relationship between CSA and physical health problems occurring during childhood, such as infectious diseases. The goal of the current study is to evaluate PTSD as a potential mediator between CSA and the occurrence of infectious diseases among children and adolescents. Furthermore, we postulate that PTSD plays a specific role as an indicator of chronic stress during childhood, in comparison to other mental disorders, such as anxious and non-anxious disorders (e.g., depression). Via a prospective matched-cohort design, administrative data were used to document PTSD, anxious and non-anxious disorders, and infectious diseases.

38771414,Nanobodies in the fight against infectious diseases: repurposing nature's tiny weapons.,"Nanobodies are the smallest known antigen-binding molecules to date. Their small size, good tissue penetration, high stability and solubility, ease of expression, refolding ability, and negligible immunogenicity in the human body have granted them excellence over conventional antibodies. Those exceptional attributes of nanobodies make them promising candidates for various applications in biotechnology, medicine, protein engineering, structural biology, food, and agriculture. This review presents an overview of their structure, development methods, advantages, possible challenges, and applications with special emphasis on infectious diseases-related ones. A showcase of how nanobodies can be harnessed for applications including neutralization of viruses and combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria is detailed. Overall, the impact of nanobodies in vaccine design, rapid diagnostics, and targeted therapies, besides exploring their role in deciphering microbial structures and virulence mechanisms are highlighted. Indeed, nanobodies are reshaping the future of infectious disease prevention and treatment.",World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,2024-May,"Rizk SS, Moustafa DM, ElBanna SA, Nour El-Din HT, Attia AS",5,1113,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33357052,The use of molecular xenomonitoring for surveillance of mosquito-borne diseases.,"The scientific community recognizes that molecular xenomonitoring (MX) can allow infected mosquitoes to serve as a proxy for human infection in vector-borne disease surveillance, but developing reliable MX systems for programmatic use has been challenging. The primary aim of this article is to examine the available evidence to recommend how MX can best be used for various purposes. Although much of the literature published within the last 20 years focuses on using MX for lymphatic filariasis elimination, a growing body of evidence supports its use in early warning systems for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). An MX system design must consider the goal and target (e.g. diseases targeted for elimination versus EIDs), mosquito and pathogen characteristics, and context (e.g. setting and health system). MX is currently used as a 'supplement' to human surveillance and will not be considered as a 'replacement' until the correlation between pathogen-infection rates in human and mosquito populations is better understood. Establishing such relationships may not be feasible in elimination scenarios, due to increasingly dwindling human infection prevalence after successful control, but may still be possible for EIDs and in integrated disease surveillance systems.

These proteins exert a notable influence on the progression and outcomes of infectious diseases. Within the realm of host cell-autonomous immunity against pathogens, GBPs have been identified as the regulators of pyroptosis through canonical and noncanonical inflammasome activation pathways. In this review, we summarize the structure and evolution of GBP family members, the canonical and noncanonical inflammasome activation pathways, the roles of GBPs in regulating inflammasome activation, and the mechanisms of GBPs affecting infections induced by different pathogens.

Although diverse solutions have been proposed, one viable solution could be the use of immune system modulators. The induction of the immune response can be increased by histone deacetylase inhibitors (iHDAC), which in turn modulate the chromatin and increase the activation of different cellular pathways and nuclear factors such as STAT3, HIF-1α NF-kB, C/EBPα and, AP-1. These pathways are capable to promote several immune response-related molecules including those with antimicrobial properties such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that lead to the elimination of pathogens including multi drug-resistant strains.",Peptides,2021-Jun,"Rodríguez-Carlos A, Jacobo-Delgado YM, Santos-Mena AO, Rivas-Santiago B",4,795,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33804605,Infectious Diseases Seeker (IDS): An Innovative Tool for Prompt Identification of Infectious Diseases during Outbreaks.,"Several technologies for rapid molecular identification of pathogens are currently available; jointly with monitoring tools (i.e., web-based surveillance tools, infectious diseases modelers, and epidemic intelligence methods), they represent important components for timely outbreak detection and identification of the involved pathogen. The application of these approaches is usually feasible and effective when performed by healthcare professionals with specific expertise and skills and when data and resources are easily accessible. Contrariwise, in the field situation where healthcare workers or first responders from heterogeneous competences can be asked to investigate an outbreak of unknown origin, a simple and suitable tool for rapid agent identification and appropriate outbreak management is highly needed. Most especially when time is limited, available data are incomplete, and accessible infrastructure and resources are inadequate. The use of a prompt, user-friendly, and accessible tool able to rapidly recognize an infectious disease outbreak and with high sensitivity and precision may be a game-changer to support emergency response and public health investigations. This paper presents the work performed to implement and test an innovative tool for prompt identification of infectious diseases during outbreaks, called Infectious Diseases Seeker (IDS). IDS is a standalone software that runs on the most common operative systems. It has been built by integrating a database containing an interim set of 60 different disease causative agents and COVID-19 data and is able to work in an off-line mode without requiring a network connection. IDS has been applied in a real and complex scenario in terms of concomitant infectious diseases (yellow fever, COVID-19, and Lassa fever), as can be in the second part of 2020 in Nigeria. The outcomes have allowed inferring that yellow fever (YF), and not Lassa fever, was affecting the area under investigation. Our result suggests that a tool like IDS could be valuable for the quick and easy identification and discrimination of infectious disease outbreaks even when concurrent outbreaks occur, like for the case study of YF and COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021-Mar,"Baldassi F, Carestia M, Moramarco S, Malizia A, Gaudio P",5,2225,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
35020724,Incidence of common infectious diseases in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Recent reports indicate that respiratory infectious diseases were suppressed during the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 led to behavioral changes aimed to control droplet transmission or contact transmission. In this study, we examined the incidence of common infectious diseases in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 data were extracted from the national data based on the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NESID). Common infectious diseases were selected from notifiable infectious diseases under the NESID. The epidemic activity of the diseases during 2015-2020 was evaluated based on the Infectious Disease Weekly Reports published by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. Each disease was then categorized according to the route of transmission. Many Japanese people had adopted hygienic activities, such as wearing masks and hand washing, even before the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the correlation between the time-series of disease counts of common infectious diseases and COVID-19 over time using cross-correlation analysis. The weekly number of cases of measles, rotavirus, and several infections transmitted by droplet spread, was negatively correlated with the weekly number of cases of COVID-19 for up to 20 weeks in the past. According to the difference-in-differences analysis, the activity of influenza and rubella was significantly lower starting from the second week in 2020 than that in 2015-2019. Only legionellosis was more frequent throughout the year than in 2015-2019. Lower activity was also observed in some contact transmitted, airborne-transmitted, and fecal-oral transmitted diseases. However, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, exanthema subitum, showed the same trend as that over the previous 5 years. In conclusion, our study shows that public health interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic may have effectively prevented the transmission of most droplet-transmitted diseases and those transmitted through other routes.",PloS one,2022-,"Hibiya K, Iwata H, Kinjo T, Shinzato A, Tateyama M, Ueda S, Fujita J",7,2037,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

We develop a tractable static model of two regions from a short-run perspective. The model shows that the externalities can be both negative and positive, depending on regional asymmetry. Thus, even when infectious diseases are widespread, travel restrictions do not necessarily reduce infections and do not necessarily improve social welfare. A formula for the optimal policy intervention is derived and shown to be the weighted average of four types of externalities defined by the direction of travel and the epidemiological status of a traveler.",Health economics,2025-Jan,"Doi N, Yamazaki S",2,655,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

There is growing evidence that estrogens as female sex hormone can modulate multiple biological functions outside of the reproductive system, such as in brain and cardiovascular system. However, it is largely unknown about the roles and mechanisms of estrogens/estrogen receptors in immune health and infection disease. Thence, by reading a lot of literature, we summarized the regulatory mechanisms of estrogens/estrogen receptors in immune cells and their roles in certain infectious diseases with gender differences. Therefore, estrogens may have therapeutic potentials to prevent and treat these infectious diseases, which needs further clinical investigation.",Steroids,2024-Jul,"Chen L, Xu T, Lou J, Zhang T, Wu S, Xie R, Xu J",7,868,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39978973,Exploring immunotherapy to control human infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases continue to pose significant challenges to global health, especially with the rise of antibiotic resistance and emerging pathogens. Traditional treatments, while effective, are often limited in the face of rapidly evolving pathogens. Immunotherapy, which harnesses and enhances the body's immune response, offers a promising alternative to conventional approaches for the treatment of infectious diseases. By employing use of monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, cytokine therapies, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, immunotherapy has demonstrated considerable potential in overcoming treatment resistance and improving patient outcomes. Key innovations, including the development of mRNA vaccines, use of immune modulators, adoptive cell transfer, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy are paving the way for more targeted pathogen clearance. Further, combining immunotherapy with conventional antibiotic treatment has demonstrated effectiveness against drug-resistant strains, but this chapter explores the evolving field of immunotherapy for the treatment of bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections. The chapter also explores the recent breakthroughs and ongoing clinical trials in infectious disease immunotherapy.",Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology,2025-,"Rai P, Mehrotra S, Prajapati VK",3,1258,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34328626,The Potential Role of Clinical Metagenomics in Infectious Diseases: Therapeutic Perspectives.,"Clinical metagenomics (CMg) is the process of sequencing nucleic acid of clinical samples to obtain clinically relevant information such as the identification of microorganisms and their susceptibility to antimicrobials. Over the last decades, sequencing and bioinformatic solutions supporting CMg have much evolved and an increasing number of case reports and series covering various infectious diseases have been published. Metagenomics is a new approach to infectious disease diagnosis that is currently being developed and is certainly one of the most promising for the coming years. However, most CMg studies are retrospective, and few address the potential impact CMg could have on patient management, including initiation, adaptation, or cessation of antimicrobials. In this narrative review, we have discussed the potential role of CMg in bacteriology, virology, mycology, and parasitology. Several reports and case-series confirm that CMg is an innovative tool with which one can (i) identify more microorganisms than with conventional methods in a single test, (ii) obtain results within hours, and (iii) tailor the antimicrobial regimen of patients. However, the cost-efficiency of CMg and its real impact on patient management are still to be determined.",Drugs,2021-Sep,"d'Humières C, Salmona M, Dellière S, Leo S, Rodriguez C, Angebault C, Alanio A, Fourati S, Lazarevic V, Woerther PL, Schrenzel J, Ruppé E",12,1266,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
35389523,Great ape health watch: Enhancing surveillance for emerging infectious diseases in great apes.,"Infectious diseases have the potential to extirpate populations of great apes. As the interface between humans and great apes expands, zoonoses pose an increasingly severe threat to already endangered great ape populations. Despite recognition of the threat posed by human pathogens to great apes, health monitoring is only conducted for a small fraction of the world's wild great apes (and mostly those that are habituated) meaning that outbreaks of disease often go unrecognized and therefore unmitigated. This lack of surveillance (even in sites where capacity to conduct surveillance is present) is the most significant limiting factor in our ability to quickly detect and respond to emerging infectious diseases in great apes when they first appear. Accordingly, we must create a surveillance system that links disease outbreaks in humans and great apes in time and space, and enables veterinarians, clinicians, conservation managers, national decision makers, and the global health community to respond quickly to these events. Here, we review existing great ape health surveillance programs in African range habitats to identify successes, gaps, and challenges. We use these findings to argue that standardization of surveillance across sites and geographic scales, that monitors primate health in real-time and generates early warnings of disease outbreaks, is an efficient, low-cost step to conserve great ape populations. Such a surveillance program, which we call ""Great Ape Health Watch"" would lead to long-term improvements in outbreak preparedness, prevention, detection, and response, while generating valuable data for epidemiological research and sustainable conservation planning. Standardized monitoring of great apes would also make it easier to integrate with human surveillance activities. This approach would empower local stakeholders to link wildlife and human health, allowing for near real-time, bidirectional surveillance at the great ape-human interface.",American journal of primatology,2022-May,"Zimmerman DM, Mitchell SL, Wolf TM, Deere JR, Noheri JB, Takahashi E, Cranfield MR, Travis DA, Hassell JM",9,1983,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Mapping the research outputs of epidemiological modelling studies concerned with transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and public health interventions in Africa will help to identify the areas with substantial levels of research activities, areas with gaps, and research output trends. A scoping review of applied epidemiological models of infectious disease studies that involved first or last authors affiliated to African institutions was conducted. Eligible studies were those concerned with the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and public health interventions. The review was consistent with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews. Four electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed publications up to the end of April 2020. Of the 5927 publications identified, 181 met the inclusion criteria. The review identified 143 publications with first authors having an African institutional affiliation (AIA), while 81 had both first and last authors with an AIA. The publication authors were found to be predominantly affiliated with institutions based in South Africa and Kenya. Furthermore, human immunodeficiency virus, malaria, tuberculosis, and Ebola virus disease were found to be the most researched infectious diseases. There has been a gradual increase in research productivity across Africa especially in the last ten years, with several collaborative efforts spread both within and beyond Africa. Research productivity in applied epidemiological modelling studies of infectious diseases may have increased, but there remains an under-representation of African researchers as leading authors.

39537185,Synergy between pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages and self-renewing macrophages: Envisioning a promising avenue for the modelling and cell therapy of infectious diseases.,"As crucial phagocytes of the innate immune system, macrophages (Mϕs) protect mammalian hosts, maintain tissue homeostasis and influence disease pathogenesis. Nonetheless, Mϕs are susceptible to various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses and parasites, which cause various infectious diseases, necessitating a deeper understanding of pathogen-Mϕ interactions and therapeutic insights. Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) have been efficiently differentiated into PSC-derived Mϕs (PSCdMϕs) resembling primary Mϕs, advancing the modelling and cell therapy of infectious diseases. However, the mass production of PSCdMϕs, which lack proliferative capacity, relies on large-scale expansions of PSCs, thereby increasing both costs and culture cycles. Notably, Mϕs deficient in the MafB/c-Maf genes have been reported to re-enter the cell cycle with the stimulation of specific growth factor cocktails, turning into self-renewing Mϕs (SRMϕs). This review summarizes the applications of PSCdMϕs in the modelling and cell therapy of infectious diseases and strategies for establishing SRMϕs. Most importantly, we innovatively propose that PSCs can serve as a gene editing platform to creating PSC-derived SRMϕs (termed PSRMϕs), addressing the resistance of Mϕs against genetic manipulation. We discuss the challenges and possible solutions in creating PSRMϕs. In conclusion, this review provides novel insights into the development of physiologically relevant and expandable Mϕ models, highlighting the enormous potential of PSRMϕs as a promising avenue for the modelling and cell therapy of infectious diseases.",Cell proliferation,2025-Feb,"Peng D, Li M, Yu Z, Yan T, Yao M, Li S, Liu Z, Li LF, Qiu HJ",9,1601,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

37963966,Emerging infectious disease surveillance using a hierarchical diagnosis model and the Knox algorithm.,"Emerging infectious diseases are a critical public health challenge in the twenty-first century. The recent proliferation of such diseases has raised major social and economic concerns. Therefore, early detection of emerging infectious diseases is essential. Subjects from five medical institutions in Beijing, China, which met the spatial-specific requirements, were analyzed. A quality control process was used to select 37,422 medical records of infectious diseases and 56,133 cases of non-infectious diseases. An emerging infectious disease detection model (EIDDM), a two-layer model that divides the problem into two sub-problems, i.e., whether a case is an infectious disease, and if so, whether it is a known infectious disease, was proposed. The first layer model adopts the binary classification model TextCNN-Attention. The second layer is a multi-classification model of LightGBM based on the one-vs-rest strategy. Based on the experimental results, a threshold of 0.5 is selected. The model results were compared with those of other models such as XGBoost and Random Forest using the following evaluation indicators: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The prediction performance of the first-layer TextCNN is better than that of other comparison models. Its average specificity for non-infectious diseases is 97.57%, with an average negative predictive value of 82.63%, indicating a low risk of misdiagnosing non-infectious diseases as infectious (i.e., a low false positive rate). Its average positive predictive value for eight selected infectious diseases is 95.07%, demonstrating the model's ability to avoid misdiagnoses. The overall average accuracy of the model is 86.11%. The average prediction accuracy of the second-layer LightGBM model for emerging infectious diseases reaches 90.44%. Furthermore, the response time of a single online reasoning using the LightGBM model is approximately 27 ms, which makes it suitable for analyzing clinical records in real time. Using the Knox method, we found that all the infectious diseases were within 2000 m in our case, and a clustering feature of spatiotemporal interactions (P < 0.05) was observed as well. Performance testing and model comparison results indicated that the EIDDM is fast and accurate and can be used to monitor the onset/outbreak of emerging infectious diseases in real-world hospitals.",Scientific reports,2023-Nov,"Wang M, Yang B, Liu Y, Yang Y, Ji H, Yang C",6,2428,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Infectious diseases maintained by domestic species may impact threatened species such as Asian bovids, as they share natural resources and habitats. To predict the population impact of infectious diseases with different traits, we used stochastic mathematical models to simulate the population dynamics over 100 years for 100 times in a model gaur (<i>Bos gaurus</i>) population with and without disease. We simulated repeated introductions from a reservoir, such as domestic cattle. We selected six bovine infectious diseases; anthrax, bovine tuberculosis, haemorrhagic septicaemia, lumpy skin disease, foot and mouth disease and brucellosis, all of which have caused outbreaks in wildlife populations. From a starting population of 300, the disease-free population increased by an average of 228% over 100 years. Brucellosis with frequency-dependent transmission showed the highest average population declines (-97%), with population extinction occurring 16% of the time. Foot and mouth disease with frequency-dependent transmission showed the lowest impact, with an average population increase of 200%. Overall, acute infections with very high or low fatality had the lowest impact, whereas chronic infections produced the greatest population decline. These results may help disease management and surveillance strategies support wildlife conservation.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2024-Jul,"Horpiencharoen W, Marshall JC, Muylaert RL, John RS, Hayman DTS",5,1451,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39718814,Impact of psychological fear and media on infectious diseases induced by carriers.,"To manage risks and mitigate the transmission of infectious diseases, individuals often adopt strategies aimed at reducing interpersonal contact by implementing precautionary measures within their daily routines. These behavioral adjustments reduce the disease transmission rates. In this study, we present a novel mathematical model delineating diseases induced by carriers, incorporating multifaceted factors, such as psychological fear, media impact, and sanitation interventions. We analyze the system's dynamics using analytical as well as numerical methods. We find that rapid dissemination of information through social media can lead to oscillations, mitigated by introducing a sufficient baseline number of advertisements. The system undergoes a transition from the disease-free to endemic states via a transcritical bifurcation, occurring when the basic reproduction number surpasses unity. Through a Hopf bifurcation, the system shifts from a stable state to limit cycle oscillations once the growth rate of advertisements is above a critical value. Heightened levels of fear attenuate these oscillations, thereby stabilizing the system at an endemic state. Moreover, the system experiences periodic, higher-periodic, and chaotic oscillations when the growth rate of advertisements varies seasonally. Overall, our findings underscore the significant role of psychological fear, media influence, and sanitation measures in suppressing the prevalence of diseases induced by carriers from the targeted population.","Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2024-Dec,"Pal KK, Rai RK, Tiwari PK",3,1521,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This article critically demonstrates how the story of the CPT highlights the resilience of communal actors as well as the possibilities and limitations of the Maoist ideal of self-reliance.",Bulletin of the history of medicine,2024-,Yi JC,1,881,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33918325,Recent Advances of Field-Effect Transistor Technology for Infectious Diseases.,"Field-effect transistor (FET) biosensors have been intensively researched toward label-free biomolecule sensing for different disease screening applications. High sensitivity, incredible miniaturization capability, promising extremely low minimum limit of detection (LoD) at the molecular level, integration with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology and last but not least label-free operation were amongst the predominant motives for highlighting these sensors in the biosensor community. Although there are various diseases targeted by FET sensors for detection, infectious diseases are still the most demanding sector that needs higher precision in detection and integration for the realization of the diagnosis at the point of care (PoC). The COVID-19 pandemic, nevertheless, was an example of the escalated situation in terms of worldwide desperate need for fast, specific and reliable home test PoC devices for the timely screening of huge numbers of people to restrict the disease from further spread. This need spawned a wave of innovative approaches for early detection of COVID-19 antibodies in human swab or blood amongst which the FET biosensing gained much more attention due to their extraordinary LoD down to femtomolar (fM) with the comparatively faster response time. As the FET sensors are promising novel PoC devices with application in early diagnosis of various diseases and especially infectious diseases, in this research, we have reviewed the recent progress on developing FET sensors for infectious diseases diagnosis accompanied with a thorough discussion on the structure of Chem/BioFET sensors and the readout circuitry for output signal processing. This approach would help engineers and biologists to gain enough knowledge to initiate their design for accelerated innovations in response to the need for more efficient management of infectious diseases like COVID-19.",Biosensors,2021-Apr,"Panahi A, Sadighbayan D, Forouhi S, Ghafar-Zadeh E",4,1918,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The impact reflects three aspects, such as climate variables, selected infectious diseases, and infectious disease components. This study demonstrates how vulnerable people are to any ill consequences that climate change may have on their health. Humans can actively influence controllable correlated health impacts by taking proactive measures, such as increasing our understanding of the detrimental effects associated with specific diseases and the patterns in climate change. We can also carefully distribute technology and resources, encouraging exercise and public awareness. It is advised to take the following adaption measures: Considering how infectious diseases and climate change are not the only things that science has discovered and create locally efficient early warning systems for those effects to produce more scientific justifications and go beyond scientific reports.

36642212,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology of other communicable diseases in Japan.,"To elucidate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology of other infectious diseases. We investigated the epidemiology of 36 communicable diseases during 2015-2021 in Japan and compared the number of cases in each disease between the prepandemic (2015-2019) and intrapandemic (2020-2021) periods. Relationships between the incidence of the infectious diseases and the COVID-19 pandemic were also investigated. Of 36 communicable diseases, the number of cases in the 27 diseases (75%) mainly caused by pathogens transmitted by droplet or contact was lower intrapandemic than prepandemic, and the cases of 21 diseases (58%) continued to decrease intrapandemic. The number of cases of six diseases (17%) was higher intrapandemic than prepandemic, and the cases of two diseases (5.6%), Japanese spotted fever and syphilis, continued to increase intrapandemic. Time trend analyses revealed a positive correlation between case numbers of communicable diseases and the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the case numbers of hand-foot-and-mouth disease and respiratory syncytial virus infection rebounded in 2021 after decreasing in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted the epidemiology of communicable diseases, suggesting that countermeasures against COVID-19 and lifestyle changes might be involved in these epidemiological changes.",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2023-Mar,"Hirae K, Hoshina T, Koga H",3,1344,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

35904943,The Case for Integrating Health Systems to Manage Noncommunicable and Infectious Diseases in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Lessons Learned From Zambia.,"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death in the world, and 80% of all NCD deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that patients with NCDs are at increased risk of becoming severely ill from the virus. Disproportionate investment in vertical health programs can result in health systems vulnerable to collapse when resources are strained, such as during pandemics. Although NCDs are largely preventable, globally there is underinvestment in efforts to address them. Integrating health systems to collectively address NCDs and infectious diseases through a wide range of services in a comprehensive manner reduces the economic burden of healthcare and strengthens the healthcare system. Health system resiliency is essential for health security. In this article, we provide an economically sound approach to incorporating NCDs into routine healthcare services in LMICs through improved alignment of institutions that support prevention and control of both NCDs and infectious diseases. Examples from Zambia's multisector interventions to develop and support a national NCD action plan can inform and encourage LMIC countries to invest in systems integration to reduce the social and economic burden of NCDs and infectious diseases.",Health security,2022-,"Richter P, Aslam M, Kostova D, Lasu AAR, Vliet GV, Courtney LP, Chisenga T",7,1308,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Emerging findings suggest that non-communicable diseases are linked to early and chronic environmental exposures. However, the rapid globalisation in developing countries, environmental change and the emergence, spread, persistence and severity of infectious diseases are not yet well understood. The aim of this study is to understand which environmental toxicants are commonly associated with infectious diseases in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). A total of four electronic databases, MEDLINE through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) be searched to identify relevant studies and will be screened by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool for randomised control trials (RCTs) and ROB assessment tool for non-randomised studies for non-RCTs will be used to assess the ROB. A meta-analysis will be used to determine the pooled effect if we find out the included articles have similar environmental exposure, participant groups, study design and outcome measures. A narrative synthesis of the findings will be provided, along with summaries of the intervention effect. Heterogeneity between the studies will be assessed, and sensitivity analysis will be conducted based on study quality. Findings will be summarised in a single manuscript. This review attempts to explore the pivotal role of environmental toxicants in predisposing, developing, persistent and severity of infectious diseases in LMICs. Findings from this study will highlight the effects of individual environmental toxicants' role on infectious disease outcomes for the early prevention and limit toxic exposure to guide individual, community, and occupational health policy for future strategies.

33472748,Progress of public health policy regarding global infectious diseases over the past decade in Japan.,"This article aims to examine progress of public health policy regarding global infectious diseases over the past decade in Japan. A narrative review was conducted, overviewing items of the Infectious Disease Committee and the Tuberculosis Committee of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare between 2010 and 2019. The mean value of items discussed in each meeting were 9.7 items. Among these items, these committees have discussed about countermeasures in terms of reduced burden of indigenous infectious diseases such as measles, rubella and pertussis, and increased risk of imported infectious diseases such as Ebola virus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, plague, avian influenza, pandemic influenza and tuberculosis. These changes regarding infectious diseases lead to loss of target population, difficulty of early detection, and market failure in old and new antibiotics and others, which requires challenge to scattered at-risk targets, effort to training and awareness, and creation of novel public health policy for research and development as well as production and supply. Over the past decade, public health policy regarding global infectious diseases have been one of the key targets under the triangle of global infectious disease, and recent experience of Coronavirus disease 2019 will further prioritize it in Japan. However, the principles of public health policy are globally vulnerable in the Post-Corona era, which can lead to the collapse of democratic way.

Insights by comparison with other infectious and non-infectious diseases.,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has an impact on all aspects of patient care. Serum ferritin generally represents a biomarker of choice when iron deficiency is suspected. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase-protein exhibiting elevated serum concentration in various inflammatory diseases. Here we focus on the role of serum ferritin for diagnostic and clinical management of patients with COVID-19 in comparison with other infectious and non-infectious diseases. We examined scientific articles listed in PubMed reporting on ferritin in various infectious and non-infectious diseases. We then compared these results with nine current COVID-19 ferritin reports published in 2020. Several non-infectious, as well as non-COVID-19 infectious diseases, are characterised by a partly dramatic elevation of serum ferritin levels. All COVID-19 studies published between February and May 2020, which documented laboratory serum ferritin, indicate ferritin as a biomarker of COVID-19 severity in hospitalised patients. Serum ferritin may be considered both a prognostic and stratifying biomarker that can also contribute to therapeutic decision-making concerning patients with COVID-19. It should be emphasised, however, that most scientific reports refer to cohorts in the Asian region. Further validation in other cohorts is urgently required.","Biomarkers : biochemical indicators of exposure, response, and susceptibility to chemicals",2020-Dec,"Kappert K, Jahić A, Tauber R",3,1379,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

However, based on current knowledge about drivers of disease emergence, we show that High Asia is rapidly developing conditions that favor increased emergence of infectious diseases and zoonoses. This is because of the existing prevalence of potentially serious pathogens in the system; intensifying environmental degradation; rapid changes in local ecological, socio-ecological, and socio-economic factors; and global risk intensifiers such as climate change and globalization.

Although most professionals were confident with the current capacity of CDCs to cope with outbreaks, nearly all indicated more funding was required to meet future challenges. Responses indicated that Yunnan Province faced more challenges than Anhui, Henan and Liaoning Provinces in being completely prepared and able to deal with outbreaks. Participants aged 20-39 years were more likely than those aged 40 and over to believe strategies such as interdisciplinary and international collaborations for disease surveillance and control, would assist capacity building.

35860922,"How sex and gender matter in infectious diseases - outcomes of the first Polish conference ""A woman in an infectious diseases circle"".","Occurrence of infectious disease in a woman is an interdisciplinary area of medicine. The common problem of lower recruitment of women to clinical trials leads to the necessity to rely in clinical practice on the exchange of practical experiences, specialist consultations and individualization of treatment. As the COVID-19 pandemic shows, there is a close relationship between infectious diseases and civilization diseases. People suffering from chronic diseases are both more susceptible to infection and the more severe course of an infectious disease. On the other hand, infection may accelerate or initiate the onset of a noncommunicable disease. Women, especially those living with HIV, are a group with an underestimated risk of high blood pressure or some cancers. Therefore, one of the main goals of the conference is to break the stereotypes of thinking about health, in which gender is the main determinant of some screening tests. Late presentation of women to medical care is a significant problem that is of great importance in the diagnosis and treatment of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Women put family and professional responsibilities in the first place, and they are known to downplay their own health problems. It leads to the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases or cancer at the stage of advanced changes, limiting the possibilities of effective therapy. Understanding gender attributed differences in the etiology and epidemiology of diseases allows for the improvement of patient care, as well as determines the right direction of reforms in the area of healthcare. It is essential to build models of care based on an interdisciplinary and patient-centered approach, with broad support from both stakeholders and NGOs.

Recent advancements in three-dimensional tissue cultures, or ""organoids"", have revolutionized the development of in vitro models for infectious diseases. Our study conducts a bibliometric analysis on the use of organoids in modeling infectious diseases, offering an in-depth overview of this field's current landscape. We examined scientific contributions from 2009 onward that focused on organoids in host‒pathogen interactions using the Web of Science Core Collection and OpenAlex database. Our analysis included temporal trends, reference aging, author, and institutional productivity, collaborative networks, citation metrics, keyword cluster dynamics, and disruptiveness of organoid models. VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Python facilitated this analytical assessment. The findings reveal significant growth and advancements in organoid-based infectious disease research. Analysis of keywords and impactful publications identified three distinct developmental phases in this area that were significantly influenced by outbreaks of Zika and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The research also highlights the synergistic efforts between academia and publishers in tackling global pandemic challenges. Through mostly consolidating research efforts, organoids are proving to be a promising tool in infectious disease research for both human and animal infectious disease. Their integration into the field necessitates methodological refinements for better physiological emulation and the establishment of extensive organoid biobanks.

Drawing upon the principles laid out by Link and Phelan in their landmark paper on social conditions (J Health Soc Behav. 1995;(spec no.):80-94), we offer an explication of potential pathways through which structural disadvantage (e.g., racism, sexism, and economic deprivation) operates to produce infectious disease inequities. Specifically, we describe how the social environment affects an individual's risk of infectious disease by 1) increasing exposure to infectious pathogens and 2) increasing susceptibility to infection. This framework will facilitate both the systematic examination of the ways in which structural disadvantage shapes the burden of infectious disease and the design of interventions that can disrupt these pathways.",American journal of epidemiology,2023-Feb,"Noppert GA, Hegde ST, Kubale JT",3,1231,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34849837,The quantitative genetics of the prevalence of infectious diseases: hidden genetic variation due to indirect genetic effects dominates heritable variation and response to selection.,"Infectious diseases have profound effects on life, both in nature and agriculture. However, a quantitative genetic theory of the host population for the endemic prevalence of infectious diseases is almost entirely lacking. While several studies have demonstrated the relevance of transmission of infections for heritable variation and response to selection, current quantitative genetics ignores transmission. Thus, we lack concepts of breeding value and heritable variation for endemic prevalence, and poorly understand response of endemic prevalence to selection. Here, we integrate quantitative genetics and epidemiology, and propose a quantitative genetic theory for the basic reproduction number R0 and for the endemic prevalence of an infection. We first identify the genetic factors that determine the prevalence. Subsequently, we investigate the population-level consequences of individual genetic variation, for both R0 and the endemic prevalence. Next, we present expressions for the breeding value and heritable variation, for endemic prevalence and individual binary disease status, and show that these depend strongly on the prevalence. Results show that heritable variation for endemic prevalence is substantially greater than currently believed, and increases strongly when prevalence decreases, while heritability of disease status approaches zero. As a consequence, response of the endemic prevalence to selection for lower disease status accelerates considerably when prevalence decreases, in contrast to classical predictions. Finally, we show that most heritable variation for the endemic prevalence is hidden in indirect genetic effects, suggesting a key role for kin-group selection in the evolutionary history of current populations and for genetic improvement in animals and plants.",Genetics,2022-Jan,"Bijma P, Hulst AD, de Jong MCM",3,1806,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

38632143,Identification of Early Warning Signals of Infectious Diseases in Hospitals by Integrating Clinical Treatment and Disease Prevention.,"The global incidence of infectious diseases has increased in recent years, posing a significant threat to human health. Hospitals typically serve as frontline institutions for detecting infectious diseases. However, accurately identifying warning signals of infectious diseases in a timely manner, especially emerging infectious diseases, can be challenging. Consequently, there is a pressing need to integrate treatment and disease prevention data to conduct comprehensive analyses aimed at preventing and controlling infectious diseases within hospitals. This paper examines the role of medical data in the early identification of infectious diseases, explores early warning technologies for infectious disease recognition, and assesses monitoring and early warning mechanisms for infectious diseases. We propose that hospitals adopt novel multidimensional early warning technologies to mine and analyze medical data from various systems, in compliance with national strategies to integrate clinical treatment and disease prevention. Furthermore, hospitals should establish institution-specific, clinical-based early warning models for infectious diseases to actively monitor early signals and enhance preparedness for infectious disease prevention and control.",Current medical science,2024-Apr,"Zhang L, Li MY, Zhi C, Zhu M, Ma H",5,1263,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34663839,Modelling infectious diseases with herd immunity in a randomly mixed population.,"The conventional susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model tends to magnify the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, and thus the estimated total infections and immunized population may be higher than the threshold required for infection control and eradication. The study developed a new SIR framework that allows the transmission rate of infectious diseases to decline along with the reduced risk of contact infection to overcome the limitations of the conventional SIR model. Two new SIR models were formulated to mimic the declining transmission rate of infectious diseases at different stages of transmission. Model A utilized the declining transmission rate along with the reduced risk of contact infection following infection, while Model B incorporated the declining transmission rate following recovery. Both new models and the conventional SIR model were then used to simulate an infectious disease with a basic reproduction number (r<sub>0</sub>) of 3.0 and a herd immunity threshold (HIT) of 0.667 with and without vaccination. Outcomes of simulations were assessed at the time when the total immunized population reached the level predicted by the HIT, and at the end of simulations. Further, all three models were used to simulate the transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza in the United States and disease burdens were projected and compared with estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the simulated infectious disease, in the initial phase of the outbreak, all three models performed expectedly when the sizes of infectious and recovered populations were relatively small. As the infectious population increased, the conventional SIR model appeared to overestimate the infections even when the HIT was achieved in all scenarios with and without vaccination. For the same scenario, Model A appeared to attain the level predicted by the HIT and in comparison, Model B projected the infectious disease to be controlled at the level predicted by the HIT only at high vaccination rates. For infectious diseases with high r<sub>0</sub>, and at low vaccination rates, the level at which the infectious disease was controlled cannot be accurately predicted by the current theorem. Transmission dynamics of infectious diseases with herd immunity can be accurately modelled by allowing the transmission rate of infectious diseases to decline along with the reduction of contact infection risk after recovery or vaccination. Model B provides a credible framework for modelling infectious diseases with herd immunity in a randomly mixed population.",Scientific reports,2021-Oct,"Law KB, M Peariasamy K, Mohd Ibrahim H, Abdullah NH",4,2597,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
38924448,Current status of diagnostic assays for emerging zoonotic viruses: Nipah and Hendra.,"Nipah and Hendra viruses belong to the Paramyxoviridae family, which pose a significant threat to human health, with sporadic outbreaks causing severe morbidity and mortality. Early symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and headache, which offer little in terms of differential diagnosis. There are no specific therapeutics and vaccines for these viruses. This review comprehensively covers a spectrum of diagnostic techniques for Nipah and Hendra virus infections, discussed in conjunction with appropriate type of samples during the progression of infection. Serological assays, reverse transcriptase Real-Time PCR assays, and isothermal amplification assays are discussed in detail, along with a listing of few commercially available detection kits. Patents protecting inventions in Nipah and Hendra virus detection are also covered. Despite several outbreaks of Nipah and Hendra infections in the past decade, in-depth research into their pathogenesis, Point-of-Care diagnostics, specific therapies, and human vaccines is lacking. A prompt and accurate diagnosis is pivotal for efficient outbreak management, patient treatment, and the adoption of preventative measures. The emergence of rapid point-of-care tests holds promise in enhancing diagnostic capabilities in real-world settings.

There are ample opportunities for innovation in surveillance, prevention, and management, with the ultimate goal of improving survival. This review discusses the current status in the use and development of innovative strategies for pediatric infectious diseases in LMICs by focusing on surveillance, diagnosis, prevention, and management. Topics covered are: Minimally Invasive Tissue Sampling as a technique to accurately ascertain the cause of death; Genetic Surveillance to trace the pathogen genomic diversity and emergence of resistance; Artificial Intelligence as a multidisciplinary tool; Portable noninvasive imaging methods; and Prognostic Biomarkers to triage and risk stratify pediatric patients. To overcome the specific hurdles in child health for LMICs, some innovative strategies appear at the forefront of research. If the development of these next-generation tools remains focused on accessibility, sustainability and capacity building, reshaping epidemiological surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment in LMICs, can become a reality and result in a significant public health impact.

37268063,One Health: The Role of Pathology as it Pertains to Diagnosis of Zoonoses and Discovery of Emerging Infections.,"Pathologists are an integral part of One Health as they are a critical component of the multidisciplinary team that diagnoses zoonotic diseases and discovers emerging pathogens. Both human and veterinary pathologists are uniquely positioned to identify clusters or trends in patient populations that can be caused by an infectious agent and preface emerging outbreaks. The repository of tissue samples available to pathologists is an invaluable resource that can be used to investigate a variety of pathogens. One Health is an encompassing approach that focuses on optimizing the health of humans, animals (domesticated and sylvatic), and the ecosystem, including plants, water, and vectors. In this integrated and balanced approach, multiple disciplines and sectors from local and global communities work together to promote overall well-being of the 3 components and address threats such as emerging infectious diseases and zoonoses. Zoonoses are defined as infectious diseases that are spread between animals and humans through different mechanisms, including direct contact, food, water, vectors, or fomites. This review highlights examples in which human and veterinary pathologists were an integral part of the multisectoral team that identified uncommon etiologic agents or pathologies that had not been elucidated clinically. As the team discovers an emerging infectious disease, pathologists develop and validate tests for epidemiologic and clinical use and provide surveillance data on these diseases. They define the pathogenesis and pathology that these new diseases cause. This review also presents examples that demonstrate the crucial role pathologists play in diagnosing zoonoses that have an impact on the food supply and the economy.","Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",2023-Aug,"Guarner J, Jean S",2,1751,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34734569,Emerging infectious diseases of amphibians in Poland: distribution and environmental drivers.,"Emerging infectious diseases are a threat to biodiversity and have taken a large toll on amphibian populations worldwide. The chytrid fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and B. salamandrivorans (Bsal), and the iridovirus Ranavirus (Rv), are of concern as all have contributed to amphibian declines. In central and eastern Europe, their geographical and host distributions and main environmental drivers determining prevalence are poorly known. We screened over 1000 amphibians from natural and captive populations in Poland for the presence of Bd, Bsal and Rv. In wild amphibian populations, we found that Bd is widespread, present in 46 out of 115 sampled localities as well as 2 captive colonies, and relatively common with overall prevalence at 14.4% in 9 species. We found lower prevalence of Rv at 2.4%, present in 11 out of 92 sampling sites, with a taxonomic breadth of 8 different amphibian species. Bsal infection was not detected in any individuals. In natural populations, Pelophylax esculentus and Bombina variegata accounted for 75% of all Bd infections, suggesting a major role for these 2 species as pathogen reservoirs in Central European freshwater habitats. General linear models showed that climatic as well as landscape features are associated with Bd infection in Poland. We found that higher average annual temperature constrains Bd infection, while landscapes with numerous water bodies or artificial elements (a surrogate for urbanization) increase the chances of infection. Our results show that a combination of climatic and landscape variables may drive regional and local pathogen emergence.",Diseases of aquatic organisms,2021-Nov,"Palomar G, Jakóbik J, Bosch J, Kolenda K, Kaczmarski M, Jośko P, Roces-Díaz JV, Stachyra P, Thumsová B, Zieliński P, Pabijan M",11,1625,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

32499776,From Beef to Bees: High-Throughput Kinome Analysis to Understand Host Responses of Livestock Species to Infectious Diseases and Industry-Associated Stress.,"Within human health research, the remarkable utility of kinase inhibitors as therapeutics has motivated efforts to understand biology at the level of global cellular kinase activity (the kinome). In contrast, the diminished potential for using kinase inhibitors in food animals has dampened efforts to translate this research approach to livestock species. This, in our opinion, was a lost opportunity for livestock researchers given the unique potential of kinome analysis to offer insight into complex biology. To remedy this situation, our lab developed user-friendly, cost-effective approaches for kinome analysis that can be readily incorporated into most research programs but with a specific priority to enable the technology to livestock researchers. These contributions include the development of custom software programs for the creation of species-specific kinome arrays as well as comprehensive deconvolution and analysis of kinome array data. Presented in this review are examples of the application of kinome analysis to highlight the utility of the technology to further our understanding of two key complex biological events of priority to the livestock industry: host immune responses to infectious diseases and animal stress responses. These advances and examples of application aim to provide both mechanisms and motivation for researchers, particularly livestock researchers, to incorporate kinome analysis into their research programs.",Frontiers in immunology,2020-,"Facciuolo A, Denomy C, Lipsit S, Kusalik A, Napper S",5,1456,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34106977,Enlightenment on oscillatory properties of 23 class B notifiable infectious diseases in the mainland of China from 2004 to 2020.,"A variety of infectious diseases occur in mainland China every year. Cyclic oscillation is a widespread attribute of most viral human infections. Understanding the outbreak cycle of infectious diseases can be conducive for public health management and disease surveillance. In this study, we collected time-series data for 23 class B notifiable infectious diseases from 2004 to 2020 using public datasets from the National Health Commission of China. Oscillatory properties were explored using power spectrum analysis. We found that the 23 class B diseases from the dataset have obvious oscillatory patterns (seasonal or sporadic), which could be divided into three categories according to their oscillatory power in different frequencies each year. These diseases were found to have different preferred outbreak months and infection selectivity. Diseases that break out in autumn and winter are more selective. Furthermore, we calculated the oscillation power and the average number of infected cases of all 23 diseases in the first eight years (2004 to 2012) and the next eight years (2012 to 2020) since the update of the surveillance system. A strong positive correlation was found between the change of oscillation power and the change in the number of infected cases, which was consistent with the simulation results using a conceptual hybrid model. The establishment of reliable and effective analytical methods contributes to a better understanding of infectious diseases' oscillation cycle characteristics. Our research has certain guiding significance for the effective prevention and control of class B infectious diseases.",PloS one,2021-,"Han C, Li M, Haihambo N, Cao Y, Zhao X",5,1634,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The aim of our study was to investigate a potential temporal association between measures against COVID-19 in February-April 2020 and incidence of other infectious diseases reported to MSIS. We compared the number of disease cases reported to MSIS during weeks 6-14 in 2020 with the median of cases reported in corresponding weeks during three previous years (2017-2019). Compared to the median of cases reported during corresponding weeks in three previous years, physicians and laboratories reported 47 % fewer cases (159 vs. 301) in week 12, 50 % fewer cases (131 vs. 261) in week 13, and 69 % fewer cases (77 vs. 252) in week 14. There was a reduction in the number of notifications of all included disease groups. The observed decline in reporting of diseases other than COVID-19 may indicate a reduced risk of communicable diseases due to comprehensive advice and the requirement for social distancing. However, it is also possible that the sensitivity of the surveillance system was affected by increased resource use on COVID-19 cases management.","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",2020-Jun,"Stefanoff P, Løvlie AL, Elstrøm P, Macdonald EA",4,1256,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39178134,The Role of High-Level Isolation Units in Response to High-Consequence and Emerging Infectious Diseases: Experience of the German STAKOB Network.,"This case study describes the experience of the German Permanent Working Group of Competence and Treatment Centers for High Consequence Infectious Diseases, known as STAKOB (<i>Ständiger Arbeitskreis der Kompetenz- und Behandlungszentren für Krankheiten durch hochpathogene Erreger</i>). STAKOB brings together public health authorities (competence centers) and high-level isolation units (treatment centers) to collaborate on the clinical management of high-consequence infectious diseases (HCIDs) and emerging infectious diseases. The network is coordinated by the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's federal public health institute. The main tasks of STAKOB are to strengthen HCID clinical and public health management and increase expert knowledge on HCID and non-HCID emerging infectious diseases in Germany. STAKOB enables the exchange of knowledge and experiences; development of guidelines on infection prevention and control measures, clinical management, and therapy; and support for the World Health Organization and other outbreak responses internationally. The past years have shown how important the STAKOB network is for Germany-not only in providing critical care for HCID cases but also increasing capacity to support public health and clinical management of emerging infectious disease cases. However, maintaining several high-level isolation units in Germany requires a high commitment of financial, material, and human resources. Due to the rarity of HCID and emerging infectious disease events, maintaining the appropriate level of preparedness and ensuring sufficient investments is an ongoing struggle. Nevertheless, it is essential to have a network ready to react to HCID and non-HCID emerging infectious diseases in times of a changing biosecurity and infectious landscape.",Health security,2024-Sep,"Niebank M, Brockmann SO, Feldt T, Jensen BO, Jurke A, Mikolajewska A, Rothfuss K, Schauer J, Schmiedel S, Stegemann M, Tinnemann P, Uhrig A, Wolf T",13,1796,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

37818307,Study on the regional risk classification method for the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases based on directed graph theory.,"Emerging infectious diseases are a class of diseases that are spreading rapidly and are highly contagious. It seriously affects social stability and poses a significant threat to human health, requiring urgent measures to deal with them. Its outbreak will very easily lead to the large-scale spread of the virus, causing social problems such as work stoppages and traffic control, thereby causing social panic and psychological unrest, affecting human activities and social stability, and even endangering lives. It is essential to prevent and control the spread of infectious diseases effectively. We aim to propose an effective method to classify the risk level of a new epidemic region by using graph theory and risk classification methods to provide a theoretical reference for the comprehensive evaluation and determination of epidemic prevention and control, as well as risk level classification. Using the graph theory method, we first define the network structure of social groups and construct the risk transmission network of the new epidemic region. Then, combined with the risk classification method, the classification of high, medium, and low risk levels of the new epidemic region is discussed from two cases with common and looped graph nodes, respectively. Finally, the reasonableness of the classification method is verified by simulation data. The directed weighted scale-free network can better describe the transmission law of an epidemic. Moreover, the proposed method of classifying the risk level of a region by using the correlation function between two regions and the risk value of the regional nodes can effectively evaluate the risk level of different regions in the new epidemic region. The experiments show that the number of medium and high risk nodes shows no increasing trend. The number of high-risk regions is relatively small compared to medium-risk regions, and the number of low-risk regions is the largest. It is necessary to distinguish scientifically between the risk level of the epidemic area and the neighboring regions so that the constructed social network model of the epidemic region's spread risk can better describe the spread of the epidemic risk in the social network relations.",Frontiers in public health,2023-,"Liu Y, Wang X, Zhang C",3,2231,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This descriptive study aimed to quantify the disease burden leading to hospital-based care, repatriation or death in Dutch travelers during a stay in a foreign country, including Europe. Retrospective study of demographic and clinical data from three medical assistance centers (MACs) and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Dutch travelers receiving hospital-based care or who died abroad in the years 2010-2014. Diagnoses were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and classified using the Global Burden of Disease tool. Data was available for 77,741 travelers' incidents: 75,385 medical consultations and 2,356 deaths. Four in five travelers received inpatient care, of which 36% concerned older travelers (65+) who had significantly longer hospital stays. Overall the top three diagnoses were: injuries (29%), infectious diseases (17%), and cardiovascular diseases (17%). Mental illness was reported in nearly 1.5% of the travelers. Incidence proportions were highest in South-Eastern Asia, with enteric infections as most common diagnosis. Injuries and communicable diseases occurred most often in South-Eastern Asia, while non-communicable diseases were mostly reported in South America. One in five travelers who consulted a physician was repatriated back home, mostly on a scheduled flight with or without medical escort. Cardiovascular diseases and injuries were the leading causes of death. Not only communicable diseases, but also injuries and chronic diseases (in particular cardiovascular diseases) frequently affected travelers' health while staying abroad and frequently necessitated hospital-based care.

39251705,Evaluating information management system in epidemic infectious diseases in Iran.,"Health information management is a vital and constructive component of the health system, refers to the process of producing and collecting, organising and storing, analysing, disseminating and using information. The aim of this study was to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the information management system in epidemic infectious diseases in Iran, specifically focusing on the registration, reporting, quality, confidentiality, and security of infectious disease data. This assessment was conducted from the perspective of policymakers and experts responsible for data registration and reporting. After examining the processes of registering and reporting infectious disease data and interviewing experts, a researcher-designed questionnaire was prepared to evaluate the infectious disease information management system. To assess the content validity of the Content Validity Index and Content Validity Ratio Index, a questionnaire was utilized. The reliability of the questionnaire was confirmed using Cronbach's alpha. By employing purposeful sampling and adhering to the inclusion criteria, 150 participants were included in the study. Questionnaires were distributed via email, WhatsApp, or Telegram to employees at various levels of Iran's health and treatment systems who were responsible for registering and reporting infectious disease data. The study encompassed 100 participants who successfully concluded the research. The results highlight that the key strength of healthcare data registration lies in its ability to ""depict the epidemic curve during outbreaks of infectious diseases."" Conversely, a notable weakness was the ""insufficient collaboration from non-academic sectors (e.g., clinics, private laboratories) in registering and reporting infectious diseases. The present study's findings suggest that the issue lies not in the framework itself, but rather in the execution and functionality of the strategies.

The World Health Organization reports that about 60% of emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses, originating from spillover events. Although the mechanisms behind spillover events remain unclear, mathematical modeling offers a way to understand the intricate interactions among pathogens, wildlife, humans, and their shared environment. Aiming at gaining insights into the dynamics of spillover events and the outcome of an eventual disease outbreak in a population, we propose a continuous time stochastic modeling framework. This framework links the dynamics of animal reservoirs and human hosts to simulate cross-species disease transmission. We conduct a thorough analysis of the model followed by numerical experiments that explore various spillover scenarios. The results suggest that although most epidemic outbreaks caused by novel zoonotic pathogens do not persist in the human population, the rising number of spillover events can avoid long-lasting extinction and lead to unexpected large outbreaks. Hence, global efforts to reduce the impacts of emerging diseases should not only address post-emergence outbreak control but also need to prevent pandemics before they are established.",Scientific reports,2024-Apr,"Saldaña F, Stollenwerk N, Van Dierdonck JB, Aguiar M",4,1301,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

33309629,Epidemiological trends of imported infectious diseases in Japan: Analysis of imported 2-year infectious disease registry data.,"The epidemiology of infectious diseases in Japan remains undefined despite the increasing tourism. GeoSentinel, an epidemiological surveillance system for reporting imported infectious diseases, has only two participating facilities in Japan. Although the number of infectious diseases is reported by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, there is no detailed clinical information about these cases. Therefore, we established J-RIDA (Japan Registry for Infectious Diseases from Abroad) to clarify the status of imported infectious diseases in Japan and provide detailed information. J-RIDA was started as a registry of imported infectious diseases. Case registration began in October 2017. Between October 2017 and September 2019, 15 medical institutions participated in this clinical study. The registry collected information about the patient's age, sex, nationality, chief complaint, consultation date, date of onset, whether visit was made to a travel clinic before travel, blood test results (if samples were collected), travel history, and final diagnosis. Of the 3046 cases included in this study, 46.7% to Southeast Asia, 13.0% to Africa, 13.7% to East Asia, 11.5% to South Asia, 7.5% to Europe, 3.8% to Central and South America, 4.6% to North America, 3.9% to Oceania, and 2.8% to Central and west Asia. More than 85% of chief complaints were fever and general symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory symptoms, or dermatologic problems.

29959178,Case reports on dangerous infectious diseases: a review of patient consent.,"Case reports are commonly used to describe new infectious diseases. In the past 20 years, there have been an increasing number of emerging infectious diseases that could constitute a major threat to global health security (through naturally occurring pandemics or deliberate release of infectious agents). It is vitally important that case reports related to infectious diseases are written up according to the highest possible standards and that guidelines regarding patient consent to publish are followed. So, do case reports that relate to dangerous infectious diseases follow guidance related to patient consent? To help find the answer to this question, I looked at a sample of case reports published on PubMed between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016. I searched for freely available full-text reports of infections that affected humans. The search was conducted for case reports on infectious diseases that pose the greatest risk to global health-infections that have been classified as Tier 1 agents by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An assessment was carried out as to whether the identified case reports satisfied the criteria related to consent as outlined in the CARE guidelines. In total, 71 case reports were found. These were related to Ebola, Botulism, Yersinia and Tularaemia. The authors stated that they had obtained consent to publish in 17 of these case reports. Only a minority of published case reports on extremely dangerous pathogens contain documented evidence that consent was obtained from the patient in question. In this sample, 24% of case reports contained such evidence regarding consent.",BMJ military health,2020-Jun,Walsh K,1,1642,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
35240551,iNKT cell agonists as vaccine adjuvants to combat infectious diseases.,"iNKT cells are a special type of T cell that acts as a link between the innate and adaptive immune systems, with the capacity to stimulate a wide range of cell types. The glycolipid α-galactosylceramide (αGC) is a robust agonist of iNKT cells and induces the secretion of Th1- and Th2-type cytokines. αGC and its analogs are widely used as adjuvants to enhance immune responses against viral, parasitic, and bacterial pathogens. This review first discusses the challenges of using free αGC as a vaccine adjuvant to treat infectious diseases. We next present strategies to realize the potential of the adjuvant effect of iNKT cell glycolipids, including (1) the use of Th1- or Th2-biasing αGC analogs, (2) covalent conjugation of glycolipid with antigen, (3) particulate vehicle-assisted delivery of glycolipid, (4) glycolipid-loaded cellular systems, (5) glycolipid combination with other immunostimulants, and (6) usage as mucosal adjuvants. Finally, we discuss future approaches for the development of iNKT cell agonists used as vaccine adjuvants against infectious diseases.",Carbohydrate research,2022-Mar,"Li YQ, Yan C, Luo R, Liu Z",4,1077,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The various clinical manifestations, and the several radiology and laboratory data combined with the misleading test results for identifying the virus, are responsible for certain misdiagnoses, especially for suspected cases that visit the emergency department and require urgent management and further treatment. The major challenges for emerging infectious diseases' molecular diagnosis are being described here on a great scale, and, finally, strategies for a precise and on-the-spot molecular diagnosis are thoroughly discussed. Related literature was searched using the PubMed, Science Direct, and EMBASE databases published until May 2022 on the general information for viral infections and relevant false test results. Emerging diseases' molecular diagnosis via current common diagnostic assays seems to be extremely tricky, and front-line physicians and other senior care facilities should be able to recognize some falsely diagnosed cases or even prevent their existence. Further biotechnologic revolution concerning viral molecular diagnostics will be evident in the near future, thus new methods' limitations should be highlighted to physicians from the very beginning of their performances and wide utilization.",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,2022-Sep,Mouliou DS,1,1404,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39689884,The potential of remote sensing for improved infectious disease ecology research and practice.,"Outbreaks of COVID-19 in humans, Dutch elm disease in forests, and highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds and poultry highlight the disruptive impacts of infectious diseases on public health, ecosystems and economies. Infectious disease dynamics often depend on environmental conditions that drive occurrence, transmission and outbreaks. Remote sensing can contribute to infectious disease research and management by providing standardized environmental data across broad spatial and temporal extents, often at no cost to the user. Here, we (i) conduct a review of primary literature to quantify current uses of remote sensing in disease ecology; and (ii) synthesize qualitative information to identify opportunities for further integration of remote sensing into disease ecology. We identify that modern advances in airborne remote sensing are enabling early detection of forest pathogens and that satellite data are most commonly used to study geographically widespread human diseases. Opportunities remain for increased use of data products that characterize vegetation, surface water and soil; provide data at high spatio-temporal and spectral resolutions; and quantify uncertainty in measurements. Additionally, combining remote sensing with animal telemetry can support decision-making for disease management by providing insights into wildlife disease dynamics. Integrating these opportunities will advance both research and management of infectious diseases.",Proceedings.

37232315,Assessing the quality of data for drivers of disease emergence.,"Drivers are factors that have the potential to directly or indirectly influence the likelihood of infectious diseases emerging or re-emerging. It is likely that an emerging infectious disease (EID) rarely occurs as the result of only one driver; rather, a network of sub-drivers (factors that can influence a driver) are likely to provide conditions that allow a pathogen to (re-)emerge and become established. Data on sub-drivers have therefore been used by modellers to identify hotspots where EIDs may next occur, or to estimate which sub-drivers have the greatest influence on the likelihood of their occurrence. To minimise error and bias when modelling how sub-drivers interact, and thus aid in predicting the likelihood of infectious disease emergence, researchers need good-quality data to describe these sub-drivers. This study assesses the quality of the available data on sub-drivers of West Nile virus against various criteria as a case study. The data were found to be of varying quality with regard to fulfilling the criteria. The characteristic with the lowest score was completeness, i.e. where sufficient data are available to fulfil all the requirements for the model. This is an important characteristic as an incomplete data set could lead to erroneous conclusions being drawn from modelling studies. Thus, the availability of good-quality data is essential to reduce uncertainty when estimating the likelihood of where EID outbreaks may occur and identifying the points on the risk pathway where preventive measures may be taken.",Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),2023-May,"Horigan V, Kelly L, Papa A, Koopmans MPG, Sikkema RS, Koren LGH, Snary EL",7,1550,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The negative consequences of the occupation of southern Iran, the health and healthcare system of this part of Iran suffered problems in various forms of shortage of medicines, equipment, and treatment staff, especially the spread of various infectious and communicable diseases. The article aims to examine the effects of World War II on the southern, southwestern, and eastern regions of Iran from 1939 to 1945 and its consequences in the spread of infectious diseases in these regions. The research with an analytical-historical method relies on the library method and is based on the study of the data of unpublished documents from the archives of the National Archives and Library Organization, medical and economic social publications, and various local and public newspapers of Iran during this period. The study of documents and publications shows that due to Allied restrictive policies and successive waves of famine and widespread malnutrition, epidemic diseases, and drug monopoly, these areas experienced a period of severe decline in public health and spread of various infectious diseases.",Archives of Iranian medicine,2024-Jul,Chamankar MJ,1,1404,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Limited research has examined the role of built environments in relation to Indigenous health in remote Australia. This study engaged stakeholders to understand their perceptions of the influence of built environmental factors on chronic and infectious diseases in remote Northern Territory (NT) communities. A preliminary set of 1120 built environmental indicators were systematically identified and classified using an Indigenous Indicator Classification System. The public and environmental health workforce was engaged to consolidate the classified indicators (<i>n</i> = 84), and then sort and rate the consolidated indicators based on their experience with living and working in remote NT communities. Sorting of the indicators resulted in a concept map with nine built environmental domains. Essential services and Facilities for health/safety were the highest ranked domains for both chronic and infectious diseases. Within these domains, adequate housing infrastructure, water supply, drainage system, reliable sewerage and power infrastructure, and access to health services were identified as the most important contributors to the development of these diseases. The findings highlight the features of community environments amenable to public health and social policy actions that could be targeted to help reduce prevalence of chronic and infectious diseases.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021-May,"Chakraborty A, Howard NJ, Daniel M, Chong A, Slavin N, Brown A, Cargo M",7,1522,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Acute respiratory viral diseases claim over 4 million deaths and cause millions of hospitalizations in developing countries every year. Emerging viruses, especially the RNA viruses, are more pathogenic since most people have no herd immunity. The RNA viruses can adapt to the rapidly changing global and local environment due to the high error rate of their polymerases that replicate their genomes. Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is determined as an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan.

Each year approximately 200 IAC arrive in Denmark. These are at increased risk of infectious diseases rarely seen in Danish children. Studies from the 1990s showed that 60% of IAC had infectious diseases and that the majority of these were undetected without screening. The study is a prospective study of medical records from children seen in the adoption clinic at Copenhagen University Hospital in the period 2009-2013. Screening was done for hepatitis A (HAV), B (HBV) and C (HCV), syphilis, HIV, tuberculosis (TB) and intestinal parasites. In 245 IAC tested, 2% had evidence of recent HAV infection, 3% with HBV and one child with HCV, and no cases of HIV were found. One child had antibodies against syphilis (anti-Trpa AB positivity), and 2% were latently infected with tuberculosis. We found 30% infected with pathogenic intestinal parasites. Only 46% had serologic evidence of immunisation against HBV. The prevalence of infections in IAC was lower than previously reported but compared to the general population, a higher prevalence of intestinal parasites, hepatitis and tuberculosis was found. We recommend that IAC are offered screening shortly after arrival.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",2020-May,"Nielsen AV, Kjaergaard J, Pedersen TM, Helmuth IG, Nygaard U, Nielsen HW, Christensen VB, Kurtzhals JAL, Poulsen A",9,1284,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

39647578,The Sudan conflict: A catalyst for the spread of infectious diseases in displaced populations.,"The Sudan conflict has created a severe humanitarian crisis, displacing millions and crippling the healthcare system, leading to a resurgence of infectious diseases such as malaria, cholera, and measles. Overcrowded refugee camps with poor sanitation and limited resources have fueled outbreaks, exacerbated by disrupted immunization programs and seasonal rains. Malaria is spreading rapidly due to inadequate mosquito control, while cholera outbreaks, linked to unsafe water and poor sanitation, have overwhelmed health facilities. Measles outbreaks are escalating due to low vaccination coverage, leaving vulnerable populations unprotected. The regional and global impacts are significant, as displaced populations crossing borders risk spreading diseases. Addressing this crisis requires urgent international collaboration to restore healthcare services, improve living conditions in camps, resume vaccination programs, and strengthen regional disease surveillance. Timely, coordinated responses are essential to mitigate health risks and protect global health security.

38863350,Early-stage loss of ecological integrity drives the risk of zoonotic disease emergence.,"Anthropogenic pressures have increasingly disrupted the integrity of ecosystems worldwide, jeopardizing their capacity to provide essential contributions to human well-being. Recently, the role of natural ecosystems in reducing disease emergence risk has gained prominence in decision-making processes, as scientific evidence indicates that human-driven pressure, such as habitat destruction and deforestation, can trigger the emergence of zoonotic infectious diseases. However, the intricate relationship between biodiversity and emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) remains only partially understood. Here, we updated the most comprehensive zoonotic EID event database with the latest reported events to analyse the relationship between EIDs of wildlife origin (zoonoses) and various facets of ecological integrity. We found EID risk was strongly predicted by structural integrity metrics such as human footprint and ecoregion intactness, in addition to environmental variables such as tropical rainforest density and mammal species richness. EID events were more likely to occur in areas with intermediate levels of compositional and structural integrity, underscoring the risk posed by human encroachment into pristine, undisturbed lands. Our study highlights the need to identify novel indicators and targets that can effectively address EID risk alongside other pressing global challenges in sustainable development, ultimately informing strategies for preserving both human and environmental health.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2024-Jun,"Marcolin L, Tonelli A, Di Marco M",3,1505,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The generalized cure rate model is based on bounded cumulative hazard function, which is a non-mixture model, and is developed using a two-parameter Weibull distribution as the baseline distribution, to estimate the cure rate using maximum likelihood method and real data with R and STATA software. The results showed that the cure rate of tuberculosis (TB) patients was 26.3%, which was higher than that of TB patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; 23.1%). The non-parametric median survival time of TB patients was 51 months, while that of TB patients co-infected with HIV was 33 months. Moreover, no risk factors were associated with TB patients co-infected with HIV, while age was a significant risk factor for TB patients among the suspected risk factors considered. Furthermore, the bounded cumulative hazard function was extended to accommodate infectious diseases with co-infections by deriving an appropriate probability density function, determining the distribution, and using real data.

Bats have been associated with recent zoonoses, but our bibliometric analysis of coauthor relationships identified a separation of bat ecologists and infectious disease researchers with few cross-disciplinary relationships. Of 5,645 papers, true interdisciplinary collaborations occurred primarily in research focused on White Nose Syndrome (WNS). This finding is important because it illustrates how research with outcomes favoring both bat conservation and disease mitigation promotes domain integration and network connectivity. We advocate for increased engagement between ecology and infectious researchers to address such common causes and suggest that efforts focus on leveraging existing activities, building interdisciplinary projects, and networking individuals and networks to integrate domains and coordinate resources.

31740558,Antimicrobial Therapy in the Context of the Damage-Response Framework: the Prospect of Optimizing Therapy by Reducing Host Damage.,"By design, antimicrobial agents act directly on microbial targets. These drugs aim to eliminate microbes and are remarkably effective against susceptible organisms. Nonetheless, some patients succumb to infectious diseases despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Today, with very few exceptions, physicians select antimicrobial therapy based on its activity against the targeted organism without consideration of how the regimen affects patients' immune responses. An important concept to emerge in the past few decades is that immune responses to microbes can be detrimental by enhancing host damage, which can translate into clinical disease. A central tenet of the damage-response framework (DRF) of microbial pathogenesis is that the relevant outcome of host-microbe interaction is the damage that occurs in the host, which can be due to microbial factors, host factors, or both. Given that host damage can make patients sick, reducing it should be a goal of treating infectious diseases. Inflammation and damage that stem from the host response to an infectious disease can increase during therapy with some antimicrobial agents and decrease during therapy with others. When a patient cannot eliminate a microbe with their own immune response, antimicrobial therapy is essential for microbial elimination, and yet it can affect the inflammatory response. In this essay, we discuss antimicrobial therapy in the context of the DRF and propose that consideration of the DRF may help tailor therapy to a patient's need to augment or reduce inflammation.",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2020-Jan,"Pirofski LA, Casadevall A",2,1557,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

After an outbreak, an animal model for an emerging infectious disease is urgently needed for studying the etiology, host immune mechanisms and pathology of the disease, evaluating the efficiency of vaccines or drugs against infection, and minimizing the time available for animal model development, which is usually hindered by the nonsusceptibility of common laboratory animals to human pathogens. Thus, we summarize the technologies and methods that induce animal susceptibility to human pathogens, which include viral receptor humanization, pathogen-targeted tissue humanization, immunodeficiency induction and screening for naturally susceptible animal species. Furthermore, the advantages and deficiencies of animal models developed using each method were analyzed, and these will guide the selection of susceptible animals and potentially reduce the time needed to develop animal models during epidemics.",Emerging microbes & infections,2023-Dec,"Rong N, Liu J",2,1040,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

It is now possible to construct realistic models of infectious disease dynamics for the purposes of understanding global-scale epidemics. Nevertheless, a remaining unanswered question is how best to leverage the new data to parameterize models of movement, and whether one's choice of movement model impacts modeled disease outcomes. We adapt three well-studied models of infectious disease dynamics, the susceptible-infected-recovered model, the susceptible-infected-susceptible model, and the Ross-Macdonald model, to incorporate either of two candidate movement models. We describe the effect that the choice of movement model has on each disease model's results, finding that in all cases, there are parameter regimes where choosing one movement model instead of another has a profound impact on epidemiological outcomes. We further demonstrate the importance of choosing an appropriate movement model using the applied case of malaria transmission and importation on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, finding that one model produces intelligible predictions of <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>, whereas the other produces nonsensical results.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2021-May,"Citron DT, Guerra CA, Dolgert AJ, Wu SL, Henry JM, Sánchez C HM, Smith DL",7,1321,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Furthermore, a comparison of patients with distinct infectious diseases treated with or without an ID consultation was initiated. In total, 215.915 patients were included in the study, 3% (n = 6311) of those were seen by an ID consultant. Patients receiving ID consultations had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher PCCL (median 4 vs. 0), CMI (median 3,8 vs. 1,1) and deviation of the expected mean LOS (median 7 days vs. 0 days) than patients in the control group. No differences among hospitals or between years were observed. Comparing patients with distinct infectious diseases treated with or without an ID consultation, the differences were confirmed throughout the groups.

35687155,Emerging infectious diseases may spread across pig trade networks in Thailand once introduced: a network analysis approach.,"In Thailand, pork is one of the most consumed meats nationwide. Pig farming is hence an important business in the country. However, 95% of the farms were considered smallholders raising only 50 pigs or less. With limited budgets and resources, the biosecurity level in these farms is relatively low. Pig movements have been previously identified as a risk factor in the spread of infectious diseases. Therefore, the present study aimed to explicitly analyze the pig movement network structure and assess its vulnerability to the spread of emerging diseases in Thailand. We used official electronic records of nationwide pig movements throughout the year 2021 to construct a directed weighted one-mode network. Degree centrality, degree distribution, connected components, network community, and modularity were measured to explore the network architectures and properties. In this network, 484,483 pig movements were captured. In which, 379,948 (78.42%) were moved toward slaughterhouses and hence excluded from further analyses. From the remaining links, we suggested that the pig movement network in Thailand was vulnerable to the spread of emerging infectious diseases. Within the network, we found a strongly connected component (SCC) connecting 1044 subdistricts (38.6% of the nodes), a giant weakly connected component (GWCC) covering 98.2% of the nodes (2654/2704), and inter-regional communities with overall network modularity of 0.68. The disease may rapidly spread throughout the country. A better understanding of the nationwide pig movement networks is helpful in tailoring control interventions to cope with the newly emerged diseases once introduced.",Tropical animal health and production,2022-Jun,"Wiratsudakul A, Wongnak P, Thanapongtharm W",3,1665,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

In this retrospective 6-year study, we examined the epidemiology of fever of unknown origin (FUO) in Greece over the past years. Forty-eight patients with classical FUO were included. The proportion of infectious causes of FUO (29.2%) was similar to previous studies in Greece and all infections were endemic to the area. Disease-related mortality was 12.5% and no deaths due to infection were recorded. In conclusion, none of the diagnosed infectious causes of FUO raised concerns about the possibility of imported diseases or pathogens.

Studies carried out in Bangladesh have primarily focused on diarrhoea and acute respiratory tract infections independently without considering their co-occurrence effect. The present study examines the multimorbid conditions of infectious diseases in under-five Bangladeshi children. It explores multimorbidity determinants and the role of community context, which are often overlooked in previous literature. Utilizing the most recent Demographic and Health Survey of Bangladesh (2017-18), we used mixed-effects random-intercept Poisson regression models to understand the determinants of multimorbidity of infectious diseases in under-five Bangladeshi children considering the community-level characteristics. The present study found that 28% of the children experienced multimorbidity two weeks prior to the survey. Community-level variability across all the statistical models was statistically significant at the 5% level. On average, the incidence rate of multimorbidity was 1.34 times higher among children from high-risk communities than children from low-risk communities. Moreover, children residing in rural areas and other urban areas involved 1.29 [CI: 1.11, 1.51] and 1.28 [CI: 1.11, 1.47] times greater risk of multimorbidity respectively compared to children from city corporations. Additionally, the multimorbidity incidence was 1.16 times [CI: 1.03, 1.30] higher among children from high-altitude communities than children living in low-altitude communities. The significant effect of public handwashing places suggests community-based interventions among individuals to learn hygiene habits among themselves, thus, the severity of coexistence nature of infectious diseases. A higher incidence of coexistence of such infectious diseases in the poor and semi-urban populace further recommends a targeted awareness of a clean environment and primary healthcare programmes.",BMC pediatrics,2022-Mar,"Rashmi R, Paul R",2,1993,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This study more focused on the prevalence of communicable diseases, including COVID-19 that is an emerging pandemic, which affects the global economy. The objective of the study is to examine the impact of population density, lack of sanitation facilities, chemical concentration, fossil fuel combustions, poverty incidence, and healthcare expenditures on communicable diseases including COVID-19. The study covered a large panel of heterogenous countries to assess the relationships between the stated factors by using the robust least square regression, Granger causality test, and innovation accounting matrix. The study used a time series data from 2010 to 2019 for assessing the determinants of communicable diseases, while it is further extended with the current data of 2019-2020 for the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the study show that high population density, lack of primary handwashing facilities, chemicals used in manufacturing value-added fossil fuel combustion, and poverty headcount substantially increase communicable diseases. In contrast, population diffusion, low carbon concentration in air, renewable fuels, and healthcare expenditures decrease infectious diseases in a panel of 78 countries. The causal inferences found the bidirectional relationship between communicable diseases and primary handwashing facility, and carbon emissions and poverty headcount, whereas the unidirectional relationship is running from lack of sanitation to infectious diseases, economic growth to carbon emissions, and communicable diseases to fossil fuel combustion across countries. Communicable diseases increase healthcare expenditures and decrease the country's economic growth which is a vital concern of the global economy to confront the outbreak of novel coronavirus through increasing the healthcare budget in national bills and stabilize financial activities at a worldwide scale.",BioMed research international,2020-,"Anser MK, Islam T, Khan MA, Zaman K, Nassani AA, Askar SE, Abro MMQ, Kabbani A",8,2099,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
35495886,A Secure High-Order Gene Interaction Detecting Method for Infectious Diseases.,"Infectious diseases pose a serious threat to human life, the Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) can analyze susceptibility genes of infectious diseases from the genetic level and carry out targeted prevention and treatment. The susceptibility genes for infectious diseases often act in combination with multiple susceptibility sites; therefore, high-order epistasis detection has become an important means. However, due to intensive computational burden and diversity of disease models, existing methods have drawbacks on low detection power, high computation cost, and preference for some types of disease models. Furthermore, these methods are exposed to repeated query and model inversion attacks in the process of iterative optimization, which may disclose Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) information associated with individual privacy. Therefore, in order to solve these problems, this paper proposed a safe harmony search algorithm for high-order gene interaction detection, termed as HS-DP. Firstly, the linear weighting method was used to integrate 5 objective functions to screen out high-order SNP sets with high correlation, including K2-Score, JS divergence, logistic regression, mutual information, and Gini. Then, based on the Differential Privacy (DP) theory, the function disturbance mechanism was introduced to protect the security of individual privacy information associated with the objective function, and we proved the rationality of the disturbance mechanism theoretically. Finally, the practicability and superiority of the algorithm were verified by experiments. Experimental results showed that the algorithm proposed in this paper could improve the detection accuracy to the greatest extent while guaranteeing privacy.",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2022-,"Wang H, Yin H, Wu X",3,1754,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The State of West Bengal is uniquely positioned with its innate geographical vulnerabilities that favour outbreaks of a host of infectious diseases. The northern districts of this State are well known endemic areas for many outbreak prone communicable diseases like malaria, Japanese encephalitis, scrub typhus, dengue and kala-azar. An outbreak of Nipah virus in the recent past is a pointer towards the emerging and re-emerging threat in these regions and warrants urgent prioritization for surveillance and monitoring of these diseases. Identification of risk factors, challenges in delivery of primary healthcare, implementation of intervention strategies along with strengthening of healthcare setup are also the need of the hour.

The effective reproduction number [Formula: see text] of the epidemic disease is computed. It is shown that the reproduction number is the threshold value for eradicating disease in the sense that the disease-free steady state is globally stable if [Formula: see text] and there exists a unique endemic equilibrium if [Formula: see text]. The effective reproduction number is used as an objective to minimize the disease spread risk. Using the epidemic data from the early spread of Wuhan, China and demographic data of Wuhan, we figure out the strategies to distribute the vaccine to the age groups to achieve the optimal vaccination effects.

Since 2015, Senecavirus A (SVA) has been identified as a cause of vesicular disease in different countries and is considered an emerging disease. Despite the growing concern about SVA, there is a lack of preventive and diagnostic strategies, which is also a problem for all emerging infectious diseases. Using SVA as a model, we demonstrated that Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing could be used as a robust tool for the investigation and surveillance of emerging viral diseases. Our results identified that MinION sequencing allowed for rapid, unbiased pathogen detection at the species and strain level for clinical cases. SVA whole genome sequences were generated using both direct RNA sequencing and PCR-cDNA sequencing methods, with an optimized consensus accuracy of 94% and 99%, respectively. The advantages of direct RNA sequencing lie in its shorter turnaround time, higher analytical sensitivity and its quantitative relationship between input RNA and output sequencing reads, while PCR-cDNA sequencing excelled at creating highly accurate sequences. This study developed whole genome sequencing methods to facilitate the control of SVA and provide a reference for the timely detection and prevention of other emerging infectious diseases.",Viruses,2020-Oct,"Tan S, Dvorak CMT, Murtaugh MP",3,1336,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The major purpose of this article is to theoretically demonstrate that the Chinese government's intervention in large-scale infectious diseases is successful and efficient. Two potential strategies were considered: strategy 1 was infectious disease without government intervention, and strategy 2 was infectious disease with government intervention. By evolution model, this article illustrates the efficiency of big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China. Without government reimbursement, this article finds that high expenditures accelerate the disease infection. The number of infected persons decreases under big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China. The higher the treatment costs, the more important the government intervention. Big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China can serve as an efficient example to cope with big infectious diseases.","Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",2020-,"Nie KX, Wang C, Li XW",3,986,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39758204,Prevention and control of infectious disease transmission in subways: an improved susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model.,"A well-connected transportation network unites localities but also accelerates the transmission of infectious diseases. Subways-an important aspect of daily travel in big cities-are high-risk sites for the transmission of urban epidemics. Intensive research examining the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases in subways is necessary to ascertain the risk of disease transmission encountered by commuters. In this study, we improve the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model and propose the susceptible-exposed-infected-asymptomatic infected (SEIA) model. First, we added asymptomatic patients to the improved model as a parameter to explore the role of asymptomatic patients in the transmission of infectious diseases in a subway. The numbers of boarding and alighting passengers were added to the model as two time-varying parameters to simulate the exchange of passengers at each station. The improved model could simulate the transmission of infectious diseases in subways and identify the key factors of transmission. We then produced an example of the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in a subway using real subway passenger data substituted into the model for the calculations. We ascertained that the number of exposed people continuously increased with the operation of the subway. Asymptomatic patients had a greater impact on the transmission of infectious diseases than infected people in the course of transmission. The SEIA model constructed in this study accurately determined the spread of infectious diseases in a subway and may also be applicable to studies on the transmission of infectious diseases in other urban public transport systems.",Frontiers in public health,2024-,"Zhou F, Hou F, Wang J, Ma Q, Luo L",5,1695,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

However, to date, there has been insufficient political thrust to make that much-needed climate action a reality. Infectious diseases represent only one facet of the threats arising from climate change. Direct impacts from climate change include the more frequent occurrence and increased magnitude of extreme weather events, as well as changing temperatures and precipitation patterns. For climate-sensitive infectious diseases, these changes implicate a shift in geographical and temporal distribution, seasonality, and transmission intensity. Susceptibility to the deleterious effects of climate change is a net result of the interplay of not only environmental factors, but also human, societal, and economic factors, with social inequalities being a major determinant of vulnerability. The global South is already disproportionately affected by the climate crisis. The financial capacity to pursue adaptation options is also limited and unevenly distributed. Climate change-induced mortality and morbidity from both infectious and non-infectious diseases, among other adverse scenarios, are expected to rise globally in the future. The coming decade will be crucial for using all remaining opportunities to develop and implement adequate mitigation and adaptation strategies.",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2022-Mar,"Grobusch LC, Grobusch MP",2,1359,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34682492,Leveraging HIV Care Infrastructures for Integrated Chronic Disease and Pandemic Management in Sub-Saharan Africa.,"In Sub-Saharan Africa, communicable and other tropical infectious diseases remain major challenges apart from the continuing HIV/AIDS epidemic. Recognition and prevalence of non-communicable diseases have risen throughout Africa, and the reimagining of healthcare delivery is needed to support communities coping with not only with HIV, tuberculosis, and COVID-19, but also cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression. Many non-communicable diseases can be prevented or treated with low-cost interventions, yet implementation of such care has been limited in the region. In this Perspective piece, we argue that deployment of an integrated service delivery model is an urgent next step, propose a South African model for integration, and conclude with recommendations for next steps in research and implementation. An approach that is inspired by South African experience would build on existing HIV-focused infrastructure that has been developed by Ministries of Health with strong support from the U.S. President's Emergency Response for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. An integrated chronic healthcare model holds promise to sustainably deliver infectious disease and non-communicable disease care.

35699560,The Italian Mandatory Notification System: An Important Public Health Tool For Continuous Monitoring Of Infectious Diseases.,"Infectious diseases still register significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Surveillance through a mandatory notification system allows the continuous analysis of the situation even at a local level and its importance has been highlighted by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aimed to outline the importance of the mandatory notification system as a Public Health tool in the continuous monitoring of infectious diseases. To this aim, we carried out a cross-sectional study examining the notifications reported in the Italian territory of Messina, Sicily, in the period 2001-2020. The institutional websites were examined and the notification data were used to obtain the incidences. Overall, a significant reduction of the incidence notification trend was observed. Chickenpox was by far the most notified infectious disease, followed by scabies, pediculosis, and brucellosis. Outbreaks of brucellosis, measles and hepatitis A occurred. All the diseases decreased over time, except syphilis, for which a significant increase was observed. Surveillance of infectious diseases through a mandatory notification system remains a bulwark of public health despite underreporting. Our study reflects the situation of a typical high-income area, although some unexpected criticisms are highlighted. Continuous information about correct behaviors through education campaigns are crucial in order to improve the situation.

34214237,Mammal assemblage composition predicts global patterns in emerging infectious disease risk.,"As a source of emerging infectious diseases, wildlife assemblages (and related spatial patterns) must be quantitatively assessed to help identify high-risk locations. Previous assessments have largely focussed on the distributions of individual species; however, transmission dynamics are expected to depend on assemblage composition. Moreover, disease-diversity relationships have mainly been studied in the context of species loss, but assemblage composition and disease risk (e.g. infection prevalence in wildlife assemblages) can change without extinction. Based on the predicted distributions and abundances of 4466 mammal species, we estimated global patterns of disease risk through the calculation of the community-level basic reproductive ratio R0, an index of invasion potential, persistence, and maximum prevalence of a pathogen in a wildlife assemblage. For density-dependent diseases, we found that, in addition to tropical areas which are commonly viewed as infectious disease hotspots, northern temperate latitudes included high-risk areas. We also forecasted the effects of climate change and habitat loss from 2015 to 2035. Over this period, many local assemblages showed no net loss of species richness, but the assemblage composition (i.e. the mix of species and their abundances) changed considerably. Simultaneously, most areas experienced a decreased risk of density-dependent diseases but an increased risk of frequency-dependent diseases. We further explored the factors driving these changes in disease risk. Our results suggest that biodiversity and changes therein jointly influence disease risk. Understanding these changes and their drivers and ultimately identifying emerging infectious disease hotspots can help health officials prioritize resource distribution.",Global change biology,2021-Oct,"Wang YXG, Matson KD, Santini L, Visconti P, Hilbers JP, Huijbregts MAJ, Xu Y, Prins HHT, Allen T, Huang ZYX, de Boer WF",11,1793,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The focal point of CM in the treatment of infectious diseases is the personalized response state to pathogen, which is a treatment method consistent with the personalized concept of precision medicine. Compared with the methods of directly killing or inactivating pathogens, which are used in modern medicine, CM is an effective treatment modality that has a wider range of points of action in the human body. The remarkable effects achieved while treating SARS in 2003 and the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and the history of the effective responses to epidemics in the past 2,000 years have fully demonstrated the effectiveness of CM in treating infectious diseases. This article discusses the different treatment mechanisms for infectious diseases in CM and modern medicine and the advantages of CM methods, which will reacquaint the world with CM. The improvement of the diagnosis and treatment system of CM based on scientific concepts and methods and the organic combination of both treatment methods of modern medicine and CM will provide the best solution for humans to defeat epidemic infectious diseases.",Chinese journal of integrative medicine,2022-Feb,Yuan B,1,1321,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
35596137,A compelling demonstration of why traditional statistical regression models cannot be used to identify risk factors from case data on infectious diseases: a simulation study.,"Regression models are often used to explain the relative risk of infectious diseases among groups. For example, overrepresentation of immigrants among COVID-19 cases has been found in multiple countries. Several studies apply regression models to investigate whether different risk factors can explain this overrepresentation among immigrants without considering dependence between the cases. We study the appropriateness of traditional statistical regression methods for identifying risk factors for infectious diseases, by a simulation study. We model infectious disease spread by a simple, population-structured version of an SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered)-model, which is one of the most famous and well-established models for infectious disease spread. The population is thus divided into different sub-groups. We vary the contact structure between the sub-groups of the population. We analyse the relation between individual-level risk of infection and group-level relative risk. We analyse whether Poisson regression estimators can capture the true, underlying parameters of transmission. We assess both the quantitative and qualitative accuracy of the estimated regression coefficients. We illustrate that there is no clear relationship between differences in individual characteristics and group-level overrepresentation -small differences on the individual level can result in arbitrarily high overrepresentation. We demonstrate that individual risk of infection cannot be properly defined without simultaneous specification of the infection level of the population. We argue that the estimated regression coefficients are not interpretable and show that it is not possible to adjust for other variables by standard regression methods. Finally, we illustrate that regression models can result in the significance of variables unrelated to infection risk in the constructed simulation example (e.g. ethnicity), particularly when a large proportion of contacts is within the same group. Traditional regression models which are valid for modelling risk between groups for non-communicable diseases are not valid for infectious diseases. By applying such methods to identify risk factors of infectious diseases, one risks ending up with wrong conclusions. Output from such analyses should therefore be treated with great caution.",BMC medical research methodology,2022-May,"Engebretsen S, Rø G, de Blasio BF",3,2341,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

At the Department of Emergency, Huizhou Third People's Hospital as the research subject, the common pre-hospital first aid procedure for infectious diseases was identified. The Petri net was used to model and determine the execution time of each link of the pre-hospital first aid process. The isomorphic Markov chain was used to optimize the pre-hospital first aid procedure for infectious diseases. In terms of the emergency path, deep learning was combined with the reinforcement learning model to construct the reinforcement learning model for ambulance path planning. Isomorphic Markov chain analysis revealed that the patient status when returning to the hospital, the time needed for the ambulance to come to designated location, and the on-site treatment were the main problems in the first aid process, and the time needed for the pre-hospital first aid process was reduced by 25.17% after optimization. In conclusion, Petri net and isomorphic Markov chain can optimize the pre-hospital first aid management strategies for patients with infectious diseases, and the use of deep learning algorithm can effectively plan the emergency path, achieving intelligent and informationalized pre-hospital transfer, which provides a basis for reducing the suffering, mortality, and disability rate of patients with infectious diseases.",Acta clinica Croatica,2023-Apr,"Zeng J, Chen W, Chen W, Wang Y, Li X",5,1617,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33653146,Mapping time use in clinical trials for vaccines against emerging infectious diseases.,"Vaccines are potent tools to prevent outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases from becoming epidemics and need to be developed at an accelerated pace to have any impact on the course of an ongoing epidemic. The aim of this study was to describe time use in the execution of vaccine trials, to identify steps that could be accelerated to improve preparedness and planning for future emerging infectious diseases vaccine trials. We used a mixed-methods approach to map time use and process steps that could be accelerated during vaccine trials. Trials for vaccines against infectious diseases registered in three global trial databases reported in the period 2011-2017 were eligible to join the survey. We invited sponsors to contribute data through a predefined structured questionnaire for clinical trial process metrics. Data were stratified by trial phase, disease type (i.e. emerging infectious diseases or not emerging infectious diseases), sponsor type, and continent. Qualitative interviews were conducted with purposively selected sponsors, and thematic analysis of the interview transcripts was performed. Based on data from 155 vaccine trials including 29,071 subjects, 52% were phase I, 23% phase II, and 25% phase III. We found that the regulatory approval, subject enrollment, study execution, and study close-out accounted for most of the cycle time of the vaccine trial process. Cycle times for the regulatory and ethical approvals, contract agreement, site initiation, and study execution were shorter in trials conducted during outbreaks. Qualitative interviews indicated that early engagement of the regulatory and independent ethical committee authorities in planning the vaccine trials was critical for saving time in trial approval. Furthermore, adapting the trial implementation to the reality of the study sites and active involvement of the local investigators during the planning of the trial and protocol writing were stated to be of paramount importance to successful completion of trials at an accelerated pace. The regulatory approval, subject recruitment, study execution, and close-out cycle times accounted for most of the vaccine trial time use and are activities that could be accelerated during a vaccine trial planning and implementation. We encourage tracking of key cycle time metrics and facilitating sharing of knowledge across industry and academia, as this may serve to reduce the time from index case detection to access of a vaccine during emerging infectious diseases epidemics.","Clinical trials (London, England)",2021-Jun,"Mandi H, Yimer SA, Norheim G",3,2523,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39176406,Possible counter-intuitive impact of local vaccine mandates for vaccine-preventable infectious diseases.,"We modeled the impact of local vaccine mandates on the spread of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, which in the absence of vaccines will mainly affect children. Examples of such diseases are measles, rubella, mumps, and pertussis. To model the spread of the pathogen, we used a stochastic SIR (susceptible, infectious, recovered) model with two levels of mixing in a closed population, often referred to as the household model. In this model, individuals make local contacts within a specific small subgroup of the population (e.g., within a household or a school class), while they also make global contacts with random people in the population at a much lower rate than the rate of local contacts. We considered what would happen if schools were given freedom to impose vaccine mandates on all of their pupils, except for the pupils that were exempt from vaccination because of medical reasons. We investigated first how such a mandate affected the probability of an outbreak of a disease. Furthermore, we focused on the probability that a pupil that was medically exempt from vaccination, would get infected during an outbreak. We showed that if the population vaccine coverage was close to the herd-immunity level, then both probabilities may increase if local vaccine mandates were implemented. This was caused by unvaccinated pupils possibly being moved to schools without mandates.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2024-Jul,"Donà M, Trapman P",2,1395,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

It shows how shortcomings in the areas of public health focus, vigilance and resilience will be addressed through specific strategies in the coming years and how these strategies will lead to stronger surveillance systems for early detection and monitoring of public health threats as well as informing their effective prevention and control. A sharper public health focus is expected from a more targeted list of notifiable diseases, strictly public-health-objective-driven surveillance standards, and consequently, leaner surveillance systems. Vigilance should improve through mandatory event reporting, more automated epidemic intelligence processing and increased use of genomic surveillance. Finally, EU/EEA surveillance systems should become more resilient by modernising the underlying information technology infrastructure, expanding the influenza sentinel surveillance system to other respiratory viruses for better pandemic preparedness, and increasingly exploiting potentially more robust alternative data sources, such as electronic health records and wastewater surveillance. Continued close collaboration across EU/EEA countries will be key to ensuring the full implementation of this surveillance framework and more effective disease prevention and control.",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,2024-Aug,"Zucs P, Beauté J, Palm D, Spiteri G",4,1463,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34553669,Plasma calprotectin in the emergency department: a potential clinical biomarker for patients with infectious diseases.,"Increased levels of plasma calprotectin are reported in patients with infectious diseases. However, the clinical usefulness of calprotectin as a biomarker to identify patients with infectious diseases in the emergency department (ED) setting has not been investigated. To study the ability of calprotectin to discriminate patients with acute infectious diseases and dyspnea from patients with other causes of acute dyspnea in the ED setting. Patients aged ≥18 years seeking ED during daytime on weekdays between March 2013 and July 2018, with acute dyspnea, were included. Participants (<i>n</i> = 1287) were triaged according to Medical Emergency Triage and Treatment System-Adult score (METTS-A) or Rapid Emergency Triage and Treatment System (RETTS), and blood samples were collected. The association between calprotectin and other markers of infectious diseases, i.e. biomarkers (CRP, leucocytes) and body temperature, was studied. The predictive value of calprotectin for the outcome of acute infection was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Univariate cross-sectional regression showed significant associations between calprotectin and leucocytes, CRP and body temperature. Patients with severe infections including pneumonia (<i>n</i> = 119) had significantly higher concentrations of calprotectin compared to patients with heart failure (<i>n</i> = 162) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<i>n</i> = 183). When tested for the outcome of acute infection (<i>n</i> = 109), the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was for CRP 0.83 and for calprotectin 0.78.

37316780,Interrupted time series analysis using the ARIMA model of the impact of COVID-19 on the incidence rate of notifiable communicable diseases in China.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in China is ongoing. Some studies have shown that the incidence of respiratory and intestinal infectious diseases in 2020 decreased significantly compared with previous years. Interrupted time series (ITS) is a time series analysis method that evaluates the impact of intervention measures on outcomes and can control the original regression trend of outcomes before and after the intervention. This study aimed to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on the incidence rate of notifiable communicable diseases using ITS in China. National data on the incidence rate of communicable diseases in 2009-2021 were obtained from the National Health Commission website. Interrupted time series analysis using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models was used to analyse the changes in the incidence rate of infectious diseases before and after the COVID-19 epidemic. There was a significant short-term decline in the incidence rates of respiratory infectious diseases and enteric infectious diseases (step values of -29.828 and - 8.237, respectively), which remained at a low level for a long time after the decline. There was a short-term decline in the incidence rates of blood-borne and sexually transmitted infectious diseases (step = -3.638), which tended to recover to previous levels in the long term (ramp = 0.172). There was no significant change in the incidence rate of natural focus diseases or arboviral diseases before and after the epidemic. The COVID-19 epidemic had strong short-term and long-term effects on respiratory and intestinal infectious diseases and short-term control effects on blood-borne and sexually transmitted infectious diseases. Our methods for the prevention and control of COVID-19 can be used for the prevention and control of other notifiable communicable diseases, especially respiratory and intestinal infectious diseases.",BMC infectious diseases,2023-Jun,"Zhou Q, Hu J, Hu W, Li H, Lin GZ",5,1915,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34261848,Infectious disease activity during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan: Lessons learned from prevention and control measures.,"In Japan, the Law Concerning the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Medical Care for Patients with Infectious Diseases (the ""Infectious Diseases Control Law"") classifies infectious diseases as category I-V infectious diseases, pandemic influenza, and designated infectious diseases based on their infectivity, severity, and impact on public health. COVID-19 was designated as a designated infectious disease as of February 1, 2020 and then classified under pandemic influenza as of February 13, 2021. According to national reports from sentinel surveillance, some infectious diseases transmitted by droplets, contact, or orally declined during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. As of week 22 (June 6, 2021), there were 704 cumulative cases of seasonal influenza, 8,144 cumulative cases of chickenpox, 356 cumulative cases of mycoplasma pneumonia, and 45 cumulative cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis; these numbers were significantly lower than those last year, with 563,487 cumulative cases of seasonal influenza, 31,785 cumulative cases of chickenpox, 3,518 cumulative cases of mycoplasma pneumonia, and 250 cumulative cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis. Similarly, many infectious diseases transmitted by droplets or contact declined in other countries and areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. One can reasonably assume that various measures adopted to control the transmission of COVID-19 have played a role in reducing the spread of other infectious diseases, and especially those transmitted by droplets or contact. Extensive and thorough implementation of personal protective measures and behavioral changes may serve as a valuable reference when identifying ways to reduce the spread of infectious diseases transmitted by droplets or contact in the future.",Bioscience trends,2021-Sep,"Sawakami T, Karako K, Song P, Sugiura W, Kokudo N",5,1764,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39839432,Analysis report on trends in public infectious disease control in China.,"The prevention and control of public infectious diseases is a significant issue in the global health sector. Controlling infectious diseases is crucial for maintaining public health. As the most populous country in the world, China still faces a series of new challenges in the control of public infectious diseases. Therefore, it is of great significance to conduct an in-depth analysis of the trends in the control of public infectious diseases. This study selects the death rate, incidence rate, proportion of prevention and control funds input, and the proportion of professional technical personnel in China from 2018 to 2023 as research samples and conducts statistical analysis through multiple linear regression. Overall, factors such as the incidence rate, proportion of prevention and control funds input, and proportion of professional technical personnel can explain 98.7% of the trend changes in the infectious disease death rate. Through multiple regression analysis, the regression coefficient value of 0.001 for the incidence rate indicates a significant positive impact on the mortality rate, meaning that an increase in the incidence of infectious diseases leads to a rise in mortality. The regression coefficient value of -0.012 for the proportion of funding input suggests a significant negative impact on the mortality rate, implying that increased investment in prevention and control funds will correspondingly reduce the mortality rate of infectious diseases. On the other hand, merely increasing the number of professional and technical personnel is not sufficient to control the spread of infectious diseases; comprehensive use of various prevention and control measures is required for effective public infectious disease control. Public infectious disease prevention and control is a complex process that requires the consideration of multiple factors, rather than merely changing a single factor, particularly in controlling incidence rates and reasonably allocating funds. By refining the analysis of infectious disease control strategies and integrating diverse preventive and intervention measures, it is possible to better control the spread and mortality of infectious diseases, thereby protecting public health and safety.",Frontiers in public health,2024-,Zhang Z,1,2257,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

34183192,Emergency Response: A Cross-sectional Study of Core Competencies for Nurses Regarding Major Infectious Disease Outbreaks.,"The core competencies of nursing personnel have been identified as a main factor affecting nursing effectiveness. This study examined core emergency response competencies of Chinese nursing personnel related to the outbreak of major infectious diseases. A survey was conducted among 960 nurses working in a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China. Data were collected on core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel caring for patients with major infectious diseases, measuring overall competency as well as by dimensions of prevention ability, rescue ability, and preparation ability. A t-test and one-way analysis of variance were first analyzed for differences between groups, followed by multiple linear regression to analyze main influencing factors for core emergency response competencies. The average score for core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel delivering care to patients with major infectious diseases was 128.05 (SD 22.23) (range 36-180 points); or 71%, which is equivalent to moderate performance. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that the main influencing factors for these nursing personnel were before participation in emergency drills for infectious diseases, current educational background, and working experience in the realm of infectious disease nursing. The final model explained 8.4% of the variance in core emergency response competencies. These findings indicate that it is necessary to strengthen the training of nursing staff with educational background deficits or no prior work or drill experience related to infectious diseases to effectively improve the core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel relative to infectious diseases.",Journal of emergency nursing,2021-Nov,"Song S, Li X, Bell SA, Yang X, Zhang W",5,1724,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
36653766,Causes and trends of adult mortality in southern Ethiopia: an eight-year follow up database study.,"Broad and specific causes of adult mortalities are often neglected indicators of wellbeing in low-income countries like Ethiopia due to lack of strong vital statistics. Thus, this database study aimed to assess the causes of adult mortality using demographic surveillance data. An 8-year (12 September 2009-11 September 2017) surveillance data from the Arba Minch Health and Demographic Surveillance Site was used for this study. Verbal autopsy methods and ICD codes were used to identify the causes of the adult deaths. The collected data were entered to the database by data clerks. We used Microsoft Excel and STATA version 16 software for data cleaning and analysis. Chi-squared test was used to see the significances of the trend analyses. From the 943 adult deaths from 2009 to 2017 in the Health and Demographic Surveillance Site in southern Ethiopia, more than half of them were females. The specific leading cause of death in the adults were tuberculosis (16.8%), malaria (9.7%), and intestinal infectious diseases (9.6%). Communicable diseases (49.2%, 95% C.I 45.7, 52.7) accounted for about half of the deaths followed by non-communicable diseases (35%, 95% C.I 31.7, 38.4) where both categories showed an increasing trend. Although pieces of evidences are showing the shift from communicable diseases to non-communicable diseases as the major causes of adult death in developing countries, this study showed that communicable diseases are still the major causes of adult deaths.

33734349,Why genetic selection to reduce the prevalence of infectious diseases is way more promising than currently believed.,"Genetic selection for improved disease resistance is an important part of strategies to combat infectious diseases in agriculture. Quantitative genetic analyses of binary disease status, however, indicate low heritability for most diseases, which restricts the rate of genetic reduction in disease prevalence. Moreover, the common liability threshold model suggests that eradication of an infectious disease via genetic selection is impossible because the observed-scale heritability goes to zero when the prevalence approaches zero. From infectious disease epidemiology, however, we know that eradication of infectious diseases is possible, both in theory and practice, because of positive feedback mechanisms leading to the phenomenon known as herd immunity. The common quantitative genetic models, however, ignore these feedback mechanisms. Here, we integrate quantitative genetic analysis of binary disease status with epidemiological models of transmission, aiming to identify the potential response to selection for reducing the prevalence of endemic infectious diseases. The results show that typical heritability values of binary disease status correspond to a very substantial genetic variation in disease susceptibility among individuals. Moreover, our results show that eradication of infectious diseases by genetic selection is possible in principle. These findings strongly disagree with predictions based on common quantitative genetic models, which ignore the positive feedback effects that occur when reducing the transmission of infectious diseases. Those feedback effects are a specific kind of Indirect Genetic Effects; they contribute substantially to the response to selection and the development of herd immunity (i.e., an effective reproduction ratio less than one).",Genetics,2021-Apr,"Hulst AD, de Jong MCM, Bijma P",3,1789,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

As a first step to determine whether investing in such a system offers value for money, this study used contingent valuation to estimate people's willingness to pay for such an early warning system in six European countries. The contingent valuation experiment was conducted through online questionnaires administered in February to March 2018 to cross-sectional, representative samples in the UK, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and The Netherlands, yielding a total sample size of 3140. Mean willingness to pay for an early warning system was €21.80 (median €10.00) per household per month. Pooled regression results indicate that willingness to pay increased with household income and risk aversion, while they decreased with age. Overall, our results indicate that approximately 80-90% of people would be willing to pay for an increase in health safety in the form of an early warning system for infectious diseases and food-borne outbreaks.

39501756,Model-informed optimal allocation of limited resources to mitigate infectious disease outbreaks in societies at war.,"Infectious diseases thrive in war-torn societies. The recent sharp increase in human conflict and war thus requires the development of disease mitigation tools that account for the specifics of war, such as the scarcity of important public health resources. We developed a compartmental, differential equation-based disease model that considers key social, war and disease mechanisms, such as gender homophily and the replacement of soldiers. This model enables the identification of optimal allocation strategies that, given limited resources required for treating infected individuals, minimize disease burden, assessed by total mortality and final epidemic size. A comprehensive model analysis reveals that the level of resource scarcity fundamentally affects the optimal allocation. Desynchronization of the epidemic peaks among several population subgroups emerges as a desirable principle since it reduces disease spread between different subgroups. Further, the level of preferential mixing among people of the same gender, gender homophily, proves to strongly affect disease dynamics and optimal treatment allocation strategies, highlighting the importance of accurately accounting for heterogeneous mixing patterns. Altogether, the findings help answer a timely question: how can infectious diseases be best controlled in societies at war? The developed model can be easily extended to specific diseases, countries and interventions.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2024-Nov,"Srivastava V, Sarkar D, Kadelka C",3,1442,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The multiagent description leads to the study of the evolution over time of a system of kinetic equations for the wealth densities of susceptible, infectious, and recovered individuals, whose proportions are driven by a classical compartmental model in epidemiology. Explicit calculations show that the spread of the disease seriously affects the distribution of wealth, which, unlike the situation in the absence of epidemics, can converge toward a stationary state with a bimodal form. Furthermore, simulations confirm the ability of the model to describe different phenomenon characteristics of economic trends in situations compromised by the rapid spread of an epidemic, such as the unequal impact on the various wealth classes and the risk of a shrinking middle class.",Physical review.

33963679,'Accidents waiting to happen'-Insights from a simple model on the emergence of infectious agents in new hosts.,"This study evaluates through modelling the possible individual and combined effect of three populational parameters of pathogens (reproduction rate; rate of novelty emergence; and propagule size) on the colonization of new host species-putatively the most fundamental process leading to the emergence of new infectious diseases. The results are analysed under the theoretical framework of the Stockholm Paradigm using IBM simulations to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of the pathogen population and the possible role of Ecological Fitting. The simulations suggest that all three parameters positively influence the success of colonization of new hosts by a novel parasite population, but contrary to the prevailing belief, the rate of novelty emergence (e.g. mutations) is the least important factor. Maximization of all parameters results in a synergetic facilitation of the colonization and emulates the expected scenario for pathogenic microorganisms. The simulations also provide theoretical support for the retention of the capacity of fast-evolving lineages to retro-colonize their previous host species/lineage by ecological fitting. Capacity is, thus, much larger than we can anticipate. Hence, the results support the empirical observations that opportunity of encounter (i.e. the breakdown in mechanisms for ecological isolation) is a fundamental determinant to the emergence of new associations-especially Emergent Infectious Diseases-and the dynamics of host exploration, as observed in SARS-CoV-2. Insights on the dynamics of Emergent Infectious Diseases derived from the simulations and from the Stockholm Paradigm are discussed.",Transboundary and emerging diseases,2022-Jul,"Feronato SG, Araujo S, Boeger WA",3,1656,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39139663,The impact of population influx on infectious diseases - from the mediating effect of polluted air transmission.,"The global population influx during the COVID-19 pandemic poses significant challenges to public health, making the prevention and control of infectious diseases a pressing concern. This paper aims to examine the impact of population influx on the spread of infectious diseases, with a specific emphasis on the mediating role of air pollution in this process. A theoretical analysis is conducted to explore the relationship between population influx, air pollution, and infectious diseases. Additionally, we establish a series of econometric models and employ various empirical tests and analytical techniques, including mediation effect test, threshold effect test, and systematic GMM test, to evaluate our hypotheses. The results indicate that: (1) Population influx directly and indirectly impacts infectious diseases. Specifically, population influx not only directly elevates the risk of infectious diseases, but also indirectly increases the incidence rate of infectious diseases by intensifying air pollution. (2) The impact of population inflow on infectious diseases exhibits regional heterogeneity. Compared to central and western China, the eastern regions exhibit a significantly higher risk of infectious diseases, exceeding the national average. (3) External factors influence the relationship between population influx and infectious diseases differently. Personal income and medical resources both help mitigate the risk of infectious diseases due to population influx, with medical resources having a more substantial effect. Contrary to expectations, abundant educational resources have not reduced the risk, instead, they have exacerbated the risk associated with population influx.

This paper proposes a complex network epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate and quadratic transmission. The Turing pattern, sensitivity analysis and parameter identification of the epidemic model under different network structures are studied; METHODS:: this paper discusses the Turing pattern of the model under different network structures, and identifies the key parameters of the model through sensitivity analysis. The influence of network dimension on the spread of infectious diseases on random networks is also explored, and the problems of minimum path and minimum cover set of random networks are further discussed. We also carry out parameter identification experiments, adopt gradient descent algorithm to realize heterogeneous spatial fitting pattern of red blood cell plasma and simulate the transmission path of COVID-19 through Markov chain Monte Carlo fitting experiment, verifying the effectiveness of the model; RESULTS:: the necessary conditions for Turing instability on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks are found. On the heterogeneous lattice network, we observe the special patterns of equal density population. Sensitivity analysis shows that the higher the infection rate, the more infected people. On random networks, the higher the dimension, the better the effect of suppressing the spread of infectious diseases. Through comparison experiment, it is found that gradient descent algorithm has the best performance in parameter identification experiments. Red blood cell plasma fitting experiment reveals the spatial density distribution of infection rate; CONCLUSIONS:: this study provides theoretical support for the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and the complex network model can simulate the transmission process of infectious diseases more accurately. Sensitivity analysis and parameter identification experiments reveal the key influencing factors of propagation and the role of network structure.

We hypothesised that key properties of these patterns can be inferred from multiple infection data in longitudinal follow-ups. We developed a simulator for epidemics with multiple infections on networks and analysed the resulting individual infection time series by introducing similarity metrics between hosts based on their multiple infection histories. We find that, depending on infection multiplicity and network sampling, multiple infection summary statistics can recover network properties such as degree distribution. Furthermore, we show that by mining simulation outputs for multiple infection patterns, one can detect immunological interference between pathogens (i.e. the fact that past infections in a host condition future probability of infection).

A total of 147 Korean nurses were included and data accrued using an online questionnaire. Among the independent variables, perceived behavioral control, attitudes toward the behavior, and sex significantly influenced nursing intention. These variables explained 55.1% of nursing intention to care for patients with emerging infectious diseases, and perceived behavioral control (confidence or self-efficacy in caring for patients) was the strongest predictor. These findings showed the usefulness of the theory of planned behavior in predicting nurses' intention to care for patients with emerging infectious diseases.

31880086,Multilayer network analysis unravels haulage vehicles as a hidden threat to the British swine industry.,"When assessing the role of live animal trade networks in the spread of infectious diseases in livestock, attention has focused mainly on direct movements of animals between premises, whereas the role of haulage vehicles used during transport, an indirect route for disease transmission, has largely been ignored. Here, we have assessed the impact of sharing haulage vehicles from livestock transport service providers on the connectivity between farms as well as on the spread of swine infectious diseases in Great Britain (GB). Using all pig movement records between April 2012 and March 2014 in GB, we built a series of directed and weighted static multiplex networks consisting of two layers of identical nodes, where nodes (farms) are linked either by (a) the direct movement of pigs and (b) the shared use of haulage vehicles. The haulage contact definition integrates the date of the move and the duration <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mi>Δ</mi> <mi>s</mi></mrow> </math> that lorries are left contaminated by pathogens, hence accounting for the temporal aspect of contact events. For increasing <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mi>Δ</mi> <mi>s</mi></mrow> </math> , descriptive network analyses were performed to assess the role of haulage on network connectivity. We then explored how viruses may spread throughout the GB pig sector by computing the reproduction number <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mi>R</mi> <mo>.</mo></mrow> </math> Our results showed that sharing haulage vehicles increases the number of contacts between farms by >50% and represents an important driver of disease transmission. In particular, sharing haulage vehicles, even if <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mi>Δ</mi> <mi>s</mi></mrow> </math>  < 1 day, will limit the benefit of the standstill regulation, increase the number of premises that could be infected in an outbreak, and more easily raise <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mi>R</mi></math> above 1. This work confirms that sharing haulage vehicles has significant potential for spreading infectious diseases within the pig sector.

32081095,A Novel Neorickettsial Infection in 3 Dogs in the Pacific Northwest.,"The genus <i>Neorickettsia</i> includes obligate, intracellular bacteria responsible for diseases including Potomac horse fever caused by <i>Neorickettsia risticii</i> and salmon poisoning disease (SPD) caused by <i>Neorickettsia helminthoeca</i>. The <i>Stellanchasmus falcatus</i> (SF) agent is a member of this genus previously associated only with mild clinical signs in dogs. Between 2013 and 2016, 3 dogs in Washington State (USA) presented with disease suggestive of SPD, but <i>N. helminthoeca</i> was not detected by molecular techniques. Clinical signs included depression, anorexia, and diarrhea. Cytologic examination of aspirates supported a diagnosis of granulomatous lymphadenitis with organisms suggestive of <i>Neorickettsia</i>. Dogs either died or were humanely euthanized due to poor response to therapy. Necropsy findings included lymphadenomegaly and hepatomegaly. Histopathology identified granulomatous and lymphoplasmacytic splenitis, lymphadenitis, enteritis, and hepatitis with extensive necrosis. <i>Neorickettsia</i> DNA was detected using genus-specific primers and direct sequencing showed 100% sequence identity to the SF agent in all 3 dogs. This is the first clinicopathologic description of severe disease in dogs attributed to the SF agent.

39454757,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on reported notifiable infectious diseases in China: An interrupted time series analysis.,"During major public health crises, the epidemiological characteristics of commonly reported infectious diseases may change. Based on routinely reported data on notifiable infectious diseases, we investigated whether the incidence and mortality of infectious diseases in China were affected by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We analyzed monthly reported data on nationally notifiable infectious diseases from January 2013 to March 2024. Using an interrupted time series design, we performed Poisson regression to assess changes in the incidence and mortality rates of infectious diseases before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that during the COVID-19 outbreak, the reported incidence of nationally notifiable infectious diseases significantly and immediately decreased (relative risk [RR]= 0.6206; 95% confidence interval [CI]= 0.6201-0.6211), and so did the mortality rate (RR=0.7814; 95% CI=0.7696-0.7933). After the end of pandemic control measures, the reported incidence surged abruptly starting from January 2023, showing a sharp rise compared with the prepandemic period (RR=1.8608; 95% CI=1.8595-1.8621). The reported mortality increased, too (RR=1.081; 95% CI=1.0638-1.0984). The overall incidence and mortality of infectious diseases decreased immediately after the outbreak of COVID-19.

39587221,Causal inference concepts can guide research into the effects of climate on infectious diseases.,"A pressing question resulting from global warming is how climate change will affect infectious diseases. Answering this question requires research into the effects of weather on the population dynamics of transmission and infection; elucidating these effects, however, has proved difficult due to the challenges of assessing causality from the predominantly observational data available in epidemiological research. Here we show how concepts from causal inference-the sub-field of statistics aiming at inferring causality from data-can guide that research. Through a series of case studies, we illustrate how such concepts can help assess study design and strategically choose a study's location, evaluate and reduce the risk of bias, and interpret the multifaceted effects of meteorological variables on transmission. More broadly, we argue that interdisciplinary approaches based on explicit causal frameworks are crucial for reliably estimating the effect of weather and accurately predicting the consequences of climate change.",Nature ecology & evolution,2025-Feb,"Barrero Guevara LA, Kramer SC, Kurth T, Domenech de Cellès M",4,1031,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33168932,The approximately universal shapes of epidemic curves in the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model.,"Compartmental transmission models have become an invaluable tool to study the dynamics of infectious diseases. The Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model is known to have an exact semi-analytical solution. In the current study, the approach of Harko et al. (Appl. Math. Comput. 236:184-194, 2014) is generalised to obtain an approximate semi-analytical solution of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model. The SEIR model curves have nearly the same shapes as the SIR ones, but with a stretch factor applied to them across time that is related to the ratio of the incubation to infectious periods. This finding implies an approximate characteristic timescale, scaled by this stretch factor, that is universal to all SEIR models, which only depends on the basic reproduction number and initial fraction of the population that is infectious.",Scientific reports,2020-Nov,"Heng K, Althaus CL",2,862,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
32892785,Development of a systematic mapping review protocol for the most recent evidence on ruminant infectious disease frequency and disease-associated mortality: Ethiopia as a case study.,"Almost 19% of the GDP of Ethiopia results from livestock production. Ruminants, in particular, form the majority of the national herd and are a critical source of income for smallholder farmers. Infectious diseases have been identified as a major cause of reduced livestock productivity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); therefore, a sound and comprehensive understanding of the relevant evidence would be beneficial in order to enable decision making on disease control policies. However, livestock disease data from sub-Saharan Africa is variable and disparate, which poses a challenge for evidence synthesis. This paper describes a protocol for a systematic mapping review of the recent available evidence on ruminant disease prevalence and associated mortality in Ethiopia. Literature sources will be identified using database search strategies. The titles, abstracts and, subsequently, full texts will be screened for inclusion based on predefined eligibility criteria. Specific data will be extracted and a preliminary qualitative assessment of the evidence will be performed using predefined indicators. The planned systematic map will be the first to provide a large-scale overview of the available ruminant disease evidence in Ethiopia; the final output will be an interactive dashboard tool to inform critical stakeholders in policy and research.",Animal health research reviews,2020-Jun,"Tsouloufi TK, Donnison LM, Smyth KL, Peters AR",4,1367,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

35168624,Deep learning model for multi-classification of infectious diseases from unstructured electronic medical records.,"Predictively diagnosing infectious diseases helps in providing better treatment and enhances the prevention and control of such diseases. This study uses actual data from a hospital. A multiple infectious disease diagnostic model (MIDDM) is designed for conducting multi-classification of infectious diseases so as to assist in clinical infectious-disease decision-making. Based on actual hospital medical records of infectious diseases from December 2012 to December 2020, a deep learning model for multi-classification research on infectious diseases is constructed. The data includes 20,620 cases covering seven types of infectious diseases, including outpatients and inpatients, of which training data accounted for 80%, i.e., 16,496 cases, and test data accounted for 20%, i.e., 4124 cases. Through the auto-encoder, data normalization and sparse data densification processing are carried out to improve the model training effect. A residual network and attention mechanism are introduced into the MIDDM model to improve the performance of the model. MIDDM achieved improved prediction results in diagnosing seven kinds of infectious diseases. In the case of similar disease diagnosis characteristics and similar interference factors, the prediction accuracy of disease classification with more sample data is significantly higher than the prediction accuracy of disease classification with fewer sample data. For instance, the training data for viral hepatitis, influenza, and hand foot and mouth disease were 2954, 3924, and 3015 respectively and the corresponding test accuracy rates were 99.86%, 98.47%, and 97.31%. There is less training data for syphilis, infectious diarrhea, and measles, i.e., 1208, 575, and 190 respectively and the corresponding test accuracy rates were noticeably lower, i.e., 83.03%, 87.30%, and42.11%. We also compared the MIDDM model with the models used in other studies. Using the same input data, taking viral hepatitis as an example, the accuracy of MIDDM is 99.44%, which is significantly higher than that of XGBoost (96.19%), Decision tree (90.13%), Bayesian method (85.19%), and logistic regression (91.26%). Other diseases were also significantly better predicted by MIDDM than by these three models. The application of the MIDDM model to multi-class diagnosis and prediction of infectious diseases can improve the accuracy of infectious-disease diagnosis. However, these results need to be further confirmed via clinical randomized controlled trials.",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2022-Feb,"Wang M, Wei Z, Jia M, Chen L, Ji H",5,2495,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Recent studies have reasoned about potential climate sensitivity of diseases in the Northern/Arctic Region, where climate change is particularly pronounced. By linking disease and climate data for this region, we here comprehensively quantify empirical climate-disease relationships. Results show significant relationships of borreliosis, leptospirosis, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), Puumala virus infection, cryptosporidiosis, and Q fever with climate variables related to temperature and freshwater conditions. These data-driven results are consistent with previous reasoning-based propositions of climate-sensitive infections as increasing threats for humans, with notable exceptions for TBE and leptospirosis. For the latter, the data imply decrease with increasing temperature and precipitation experienced in, and projected for, the Northern/Arctic Region. This study provides significant data-based underpinning for simplified empirical assessments of the risks of several infectious diseases under future climate change.",Scientific reports,2021-Oct,"Ma Y, Destouni G, Kalantari Z, Omazic A, Evengård B, Berggren C, Thierfelder T",7,1144,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33960715,'It's our job': Constraints to investigation of atypical disease events-Opinions of Australian veterinarians.,"Frontline health practitioners need to be adequately prepared to recognize and respond to atypical disease presentations, some of which may have zoonotic potential. Data from previous research have suggested that veterinarians may face challenges in investigation of disease events due to time and money constraints. As part of an Australia-wide survey project, veterinarians were asked to answer an open-ended question regarding potential constraints in investigation of atypical disease events where there may be concern about a zoonosis or emerging infectious disease. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic content analysis with the consideration of the respondent's area of practice and level of experience. Five main themes were identified which encapsulated constraints to disease investigation described by participants, namely: (a) financing of disease investigations, including client willingness/ability to pay in absence of alternative government schemes; (b) client-related factors, including willingness to consent to investigation and comply with instructions; (c) professional preparedness to act, related to practitioner knowledge and technical competency; (d) workplace environment, impacted by physical, logistical and managerial aspects of workplaces; and (e) access to external technical support, primarily from government veterinary services. Successful investigation and management of atypical diseases, including potential zoonoses, requires preparedness of all veterinarians. Continuing professional education for veterinarians in infection prevention and control and biosecurity, alongside adequate government funding and support will help facilitate optimal health and biosecurity outcomes.

34611689,Nanomedicine as a promising strategy for the theranostics of infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi and their global spread pose a great threat to human health. The 2019 World Health Organization report predicted that infection-related mortality will be similar to cancer mortality by 2050. Particularly, the global cumulative numbers of the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have reached 110.7 million cases and over 2.4 million deaths as of February 23, 2021. Moreover, the crisis of these infectious diseases exposes the many problems of traditional diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, such as time-consuming and unselective detection methods, the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, serious side effects, and poor drug delivery. There is an urgent need for rapid and sensitive diagnosis as well as high efficacy and low toxicity treatments. The emergence of nanomedicine has provided a promising strategy to greatly enhance detection methods and drug treatment efficacy. Owing to their unique optical, magnetic, and electrical properties, nanoparticles (NPs) have great potential for the fast and selective detection of bacteria, viruses, and fungi. NPs exhibit remarkable antibacterial activity by releasing reactive oxygen species and metal ions, exerting photothermal effects, and causing destruction of the cell membrane. Nano-based delivery systems can further improve drug permeability, reduce the side effects of drugs, and prolong systemic circulation time and drug half-life. Moreover, effective drugs against COVID-19 are still lacking. Recently, nanomedicine has shown great potential to accelerate the development of safe and novel anti-COVID-19 drugs. This article reviews the fundamental mechanisms and the latest developments in the treatment and diagnosis of bacteria, viruses, and fungi and discusses the challenges and perspectives in the application of nanomedicine.",Journal of materials chemistry.

38920346,Phylogenetic inference of inter-population transmission rates for infectious diseases.,"Estimating transmission rates is a challenging yet essential aspect of comprehending and controlling the spread of infectious diseases. Various methods exist for estimating transmission rates, each with distinct assumptions, data needs, and constraints. This study introduces a novel phylogenetic approach called transRate, which integrates genetic information with traditional epidemiological approaches to estimate inter-population transmission rates. The phylogenetic method is statistically consistent as the sample size (i.e. the number of pathogen genomes) approaches infinity under the multi-population susceptible-infected-recovered model. Simulation analyses indicate that transRate can accurately estimate the transmission rate with a sample size of 200 ~ 400 pathogen genomes. Using transRate, we analyzed 40,028 high-quality sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in human hosts during the early pandemic. Our analysis uncovered significant transmission between populations even before widespread travel restrictions were implemented. The development of transRate provides valuable insights for scientists and public health officials to enhance their understanding of the pandemic's progression and aiding in preparedness for future viral outbreaks. As public databases for genomic sequences continue to expand, transRate is increasingly vital for tracking and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases.",Briefings in bioinformatics,2024-May,"Gay SA, Ellison G, Xu J, Yang J, Wei Y, Wu S, Yu L, Whalen CC, Arnold J, Liu L",10,1403,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Currently, we use PIA in the longitudinal study ZIFCO (Integrated DZIF Infection Cohort within the German National Cohort) in Hannover (Germany) to investigate e.g. associations of risk factors and infectious diseases. Our aim was to assess user acceptance and compliance to determine suitability of PIA for epidemiological research on transient infectious diseases. ZIFCO participants used PIA to answer weekly questionnaires on health status and report spontaneous onset of symptoms. In case of symptoms of a respiratory infection, the app requested participants to self-sample a nasal swab for viral analysis. To assess user acceptance, we implemented the System Usability Scale (SUS) and fitted a linear regression model on the resulting score. For investigation of compliance with submitting the weekly health questionnaires, we used a logistic regression model with binomial response. We analyzed data of 313 participants (median age 52.5 years, 52.4% women). An average SUS of 72.0 reveals good acceptance of PIA. Participants with a higher technology readiness score at the beginning of study participation also reported higher user acceptance. Overall compliance with submitting the weekly health questionnaires showed a median of 55.7%. Being female, of younger age and being enrolled for a longer time decreased the odds to respond. However, women over 60 had a higher chance to respond than women under 60, while men under 40 had the highest chance to respond. Compliance with nasal swab self-sampling was 77.2%. Our findings show that PIA is suitable for the use in epidemiologic studies with regular short questionnaires. Still, we will focus on user engagement and gamification for the further development of PIA to help incentivize regular and long-term participation.",PloS one,2023-,"Ortmann J, Heise JK, Janzen I, Jenniches F, Kemmling Y, Frömke C, Castell S",7,1941,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
37395450,Antisense oligonucleotides: a promising therapeutic option against infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases have been one of the biggest health problems of humanity for centuries. Nucleic acid-based therapeutics have received attention in recent years with their effectiveness in the treatment of various infectious diseases and vaccine development studies. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the basic properties underlying the mechanism of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), their applications, and their challenges. The efficient delivery of ASOs is the greatest challenge for their therapeutic success, but this problem is overcome with new-generation antisense molecules developed with chemical modifications. The types, carrier molecules, and gene regions targeted by sequences have been summarized in detail. Research and development of antisense therapy is still in its infancy; however, gene silencing therapies appear to have the potential for faster and longer-lasting activity than conventional treatment strategies. On the other hand, realizing the potential of antisense therapy will require a large initial economic investment to ascertain the pharmacological properties and learn how to optimize them. The ability of ASOs to be rapidly designed and synthesized to target different microbes can reduce drug discovery time from 6 years to 1 year. Since ASOs are not particularly affected by resistance mechanisms, they come to the fore in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. The design-based flexibility of ASOs has enabled it to be used for different types of microorganisms/genes and successful <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> results have been revealed. The current review summarized a comprehensive understanding of ASO therapy in combating bacterial and viral infections.","Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",2024-,"Tekintaş Y, Temel A",2,1739,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This may yield earlier pathogen characterisation and genomic data, which can enable earlier vaccine development or deployment of vaccines. Early warning also provides a more feasible prospect of stamping out epidemics before they spread.

We aimed to examine the relationship between internet search engine queries and social media data on COVID-19 and determine if they can predict COVID-19 cases in Canada. We analyzed Google Trends (GT) and Twitter data from 1/1/2020 to 3/31/2020 in Canada and used various signal-processing techniques to remove noise from the data. Data on COVID-19 cases was obtained from the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group. We conducted time-lagged cross-correlation analyses and developed the long short-term memory model for forecasting daily COVID-19 cases. Among symptom keywords, ""cough,"" ""runny nose,"" and ""anosmia"" were strong signals with high cross-correlation coefficients >0.8 ( rCough = 0.825, t - 9; rRunnyNose = 0.816, t - 11; rAnosmia = 0.812, t - 3 ), showing that searching for ""cough,"" ""runny nose,"" and ""anosmia"" on GT correlated with the incidence of COVID-19 and peaked 9, 11, and 3 days earlier than the incidence peak, respectively. For symptoms- and COVID-related Tweet counts, the cross-correlations of Tweet signals and daily cases were rTweetSymptoms = 0.868, t - 11 and tTweetCOVID = 0.840, t - 10, respectively. The LSTM forecasting model achieved the best performance (MSE = 124.78, R2 = 0.88, adjusted R2 = 0.87) using GT signals with cross-correlation coefficients >0.75. Combining GT and Tweet signals did not improve the model performance.

33050933,Health of refugees and migrants from former Soviet Union countries in the Russian Federation: a narrative review.,"This narrative review was conducted to synthesize and summarize available up-to-date evidence on current health status, including both non-communicable diseases and infectious diseases, of migrants and refugees from the former Soviet Union countries in the Russian Federation. Epidemiological and sociological studies with one or more determinants of the health, as well as relevant qualitative studies characterizing risk factors, well-being indicators, and lifestyles of migrants and refugees from the former Soviet Union countries in Russia published from 2004 to 2019 in Russian and English languages were included in the review. Despite significant limitations of the available research literature in the field, some patterns in migrants' health in Russia and issues that need to be addressed were identified. In particular, the syndemic epidemics of communicable and non-communicable diseases, additively increasing negative health consequences, including cardiovascular diseases and chronic digestive system diseases, high rates of sexually transmitted infections and HIV, respiratory diseases and a growing percentage of new tuberculosis cases among migrants from the former Soviet Union countries are all of great concern. Possibly, the burden of these co-occurring morbidities is linked to commonly reported issues among this population group, such as poor nutrition and living conditions, high prevalence of unskilled manual labour, non-compliance with sanitary norms, lack of basic vaccinations, lack of basic knowledge about safe sexual practices and risky sexual behaviour, low healthcare seeking behaviour and limited access to health care. Importantly, these findings may urge the government to increase efforts and promote international collaboration in combating the threat of infectious diseases. Additionally, it was found that migrants had higher levels of anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, and those who stayed in the receiving country 5 years or more had a higher level of somatic pathology than those whose stay was less than 5 years. In order to ensure an adequate health system response and fulfil the main Universal Health Coverage principle of ""leaving no one behind"", a robust monitoring system of the health status of refugees and migrants and an integrated legal framework for the standardized and more inclusive routine care for this population in Russia is urgently needed.",International journal for equity in health,2020-Oct,"Bakunina N, Gil A, Polushkin V, Sergeev B, Flores M, Toskin I, Madyanova V, Khalfin R",8,2416,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This article compares the representations of cross-species pathogens at ontological levels below the opposition between nature and culture. It describes the perceptions of distinctions between interiority and physicality, between wild and domestic, and between sick and dead in three different contexts where human societies manage animal diseases: Australia, Laos and Mongolia. Our article also argues that zoonotic pathogens are one of the entities mobilized by local knowledge to attenuate troubles in ordinary relations with animals, and shows that the conservation of cultural heritage is a tool of mitigation for infectious diseases emerging in animal reservoirs.","Parasite (Paris, France)",2021-,"Keck F, Lainé N, Morvan A, Ruhlmann S",4,835,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Here, we investigate the transmission mechanism of infectious diseases with an incubation period using a networked compartment model that contains simplicial interactions, a typical high-order structure. We establish a simplicial SEIRS model and find that the proportion of infected individuals in equilibrium increases due to the many-body connections, regardless of the type of connections used. We analyze the dynamics of the established model, including existence and local asymptotic stability, and highlight differences from existing models. Significantly, we demonstrate global asymptotic stability using the neural Lyapunov function, a machine learning technique, with both numerical simulations and rigorous analytical arguments. We believe that our model owns the potential to provide valuable insights into transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases on high-order network structures, and that our approach and theory of using neural Lyapunov functions to validate model asymptotic stability can significantly advance investigations on complex dynamics of infectious disease.",Journal of mathematical biology,2024-Jun,"Zou Y, Peng X, Yang W, Zhang J, Lin W",5,1190,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

To address this issue, we formulated a classic SIR model to include a close contact tracing strategy and structured prevention and control interruptions (SPCIs). The impact of the timing of SPCIs on the maximum number of non-isolated infected individuals and on the duration of an infectious disease outside quarantined areas (i.e. implementing a dynamic zero-case policy) were analyzed numerically and theoretically. These analyses revealed that to minimize the maximum number of non-isolated infected individuals, the optimal time to initiate SPCIs is when they can control the peak value of a second rebound of the epidemic to be equal to the first peak value. More individuals may be infected at the peak of the second wave with a stronger intervention during SPCIs. The longer the duration of the intervention and the stronger the contact tracing intensity during SPCIs, the more effective they are in shortening the duration of an infectious disease outside quarantined areas. The dynamic evolution of the number of isolated and non-isolated individuals, including two peaks and long tail patterns, have been confirmed by various real data sets of multiple-wave COVID-19 epidemics in China. Our results provide important theoretical support for the adjustment of NPI strategies in relation to a given carrying capacity of medical resources.",Journal of mathematical biology,2024-Apr,"Zhou H, Sha H, Cheke RA, Tang S",4,1633,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Several cohorts were created, including patients initiated and followed up on ART, specialized cohorts (e.g. TB co-infection) and long-term cohorts with patients on ART for over 10 years and aged 60 and above. These cohorts function as platforms for sub-studies, attracting collaborators and students. Data from the IDI cohorts contributed evidence to ART programs on when to start, which drugs to use, how to best monitor and which models of care to implement.

Unaffected by the homeostasis mechanism in the human body, urine accommodates systemic changes and reflects the pathophysiological condition of an individual. Easy availability in large volumes and non-invasive sample collection have rendered urine an ideal source of biomarkers for various diseases. Infectious diseases may be communicable, and therefore early diagnosis and treatment are of immense importance. Current diagnostic approaches preclude the timely identification of clinical conditions and also lack portability. Point-of-care (POC) testing solutions have gained attention as alternative diagnostic measures due to their ability to provide rapid and on-site results. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) are the mainstay in POC device development and have attracted interest owing to their potential to provide instantaneous results in resource-limited settings. The discovery and optimization of a definitive biomarker can render POC testing an excellent platform, thus impacting unwarranted antibiotic administration and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. This Review summarizes the importance of urine as an emerging biological fluid in infectious disease research and diagnosis in clinical settings. We review the academic research related to LFAs. Further, we also describe commercial POC devices based on the identification of urinary biomarkers as diagnostic targets for infectious diseases.

35132346,"Focus on the Mechanisms and Functions of Pyroptosis, Inflammasomes, and Inflammatory Caspases in Infectious Diseases.","Eukaryotic cells can initiate several distinct self-destruction mechanisms to display essential roles for the homeostasis maintenance, development, and survival of an organism. Pyroptosis, a key response mode in innate immunity, also referred to as caspase-1-dependent proinflammatory programmed necrotic cell death activated by human caspase-1/4/5, or mouse caspase-1/11, plays indispensable roles in response to cytoplasmic insults and immune defense against infectious diseases. These inflammatory caspases are employed by the host to eliminate pathogen infections such as bacteria, viruses, protozoans, and fungi. Gasdermin D requires to be cleaved and activated by these inflammatory caspases to trigger the pyroptosis process. Physiological rupture of cells results in the release of proinflammatory cytokines, the alarmins IL-1<i>β</i> and IL-18, symbolizing the inflammatory potential of pyroptosis. Moreover, long noncoding RNAs play direct or indirect roles in the upstream of the pyroptosis trigger pathway.

However the determinants of child mortality and morbidity in Cambodia is not well understood, and no recent analysis has been conducted to investigate possible determinants. We applied a multivariable logistical regression model and a conditional random forest to explore possible determinants of under-five mortality and under-five child morbidity from infectious diseases using the most recent Demographic Health Survey in 2021-2022. Our findings show that the majority (58%) of under-five deaths occurred during the neonatal period. Contraceptive use of the mother led to lower odds of under-five mortality (0.51 [95% CI 0.32-0.80], p-value 0.003), while being born fourth or later was associated with increased odds (3.25 [95% CI 1.09-9.66], p-value 0.034). Improved household water source and higher household wealth quintile was associated with lower odds of infectious disease while living in the Great Lake or Coastal region led to increased odds respectively.

Accurate diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases-centered around the identification of biomarkers and the elucidation of disease mechanisms-are in dire need of more versatile and practical analytical approaches. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based molecular profiling methods can deliver a wealth of information on a range of functional molecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, and metabolites. While MS-driven omics analyses can yield vast datasets, the sheer complexity and multi-dimensionality of MS data can significantly hinder the identification and characterization of functional molecules within specific biological processes and events. Artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a potent complementary tool that can substantially enhance the processing and interpretation of MS data. AI applications in this context lead to the reduction of spurious signals, the improvement of precision, the creation of standardized analytical frameworks, and the increase of data integration efficiency. This critical review emphasizes the pivotal roles of MS based omics strategies in the discovery of biomarkers and the clarification of infectious diseases. Additionally, the review underscores the transformative ability of AI techniques to enhance the utility of MS-based molecular profiling in the field of infectious diseases by refining the quality and practicality of data produced from omics analyses. In conclusion, we advocate for a forward-looking strategy that integrates AI with MS-based molecular profiling. This integration aims to transform the analytical landscape and the performance of biological molecule characterization, potentially down to the single-cell level.

There is a notable gap in the literature regarding the understanding of socio-discursive representations and their impact on the stigmatization and pathologization of sexual minorities in the context of communicable diseases. This study aims to discuss the understanding of the sociodiscursive aspects of the health-disease process, particularly in stigmatized infectious diseases affecting the LGBTQIAPN+ community. The focus is on examining how news articles, or the set of analyzed texts (corpus), shape these perceptions. We conducted documentary research with a qualitative and discursive approach using news articles retrieved from Google News<sup>Ⓡ</sup> about diseases affecting the LGBTQIAPN+ population from 2011 to 2022. The analysis was based on critical discourse analysis, processed using MAXQDA and IRAMUTEQ software. The identified representations predominantly align with biomedical ideology, manifesting in a discourse that normalizes and medicalizes (normative-curative discourse), and notable for its pathologizing and stigmatizing nature. Six classes were found: Ethical professional dilemmas facing stigma, infection and contamination of the LGBT+ population, prejudice and discrimination in the form of information, stigma related to sexual behavior/orientation, Vulnerability and stigma related to infectious diseases, and strategies for minimizing health risk/stigma for the LGBT+ public. The most relevant analytical categories were related to infectious diseases and sexual identity. These themes were identified, indicating that media representations reinforce stigma and maintain unequal health practices (verticalization) for the LGBT+ community. Understanding these patterns within a broader historical context is crucial for promoting health education and strategies that challenge internalized prejudice.

Few studies, however, have described the potential impact of these measures on other important infectious diseases. The incidence of 19 major infectious diseases in Zhejiang Province was collected from the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Surveillance System from January 2017 to October 2020. The entire epidemic control phase was divided into three stages. The government deployed the first level response from 24 January to 2 March (the most rigorous measures). When the outbreak of COVID-19 was under control, the response level changed to the second level from 3 to 23 March, and then the third level response was implemented after 24 March. We compared the epidemiological characteristics of 19 major infectious diseases during different periods of the COVID-19 epidemic and previous years. A total of 1,814,881 cases of 19 infectious diseases were reported in Zhejiang from January 2017 to October 2020, resulting in an incidence rate of 8088.30 cases per 1,000,000 person-years. After the non-pharmaceutical intervention, the incidence of 19 infectious diseases dropped by 70.84%, from 9436.32 cases per 1,000,000 person-years to 2751.51 cases per 1,000,000 person-years, with the large decrease in the first response period of influenza.

Only 39% of the participants had access to psychological support. <b>Conclusion:</b> Due to the significant impact of the pandemic on infectious diseases and clinical microbiology trainees, further research should focus on their health and welfare in the post-pandemic period.",Future microbiology,2022-Apr,"Bouiller K, Peiffer-Smadja N, Cevik M, Last K, Antunović IA, Šterbenc A, Lopes MJ, Barac A, Schweitzer V, Dellière S",10,880,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
38849256,Epidemiological surveillance and infectious disease outbreaks during mass international summertime sports gatherings: A narrative review.,"The XXXIII<sup>rd</sup> Paris Summer Olympics followed by the XVII<sup>th</sup> Paralympics Games will take place in France, predominantly in and around Paris, from July 26 to September 8, 2024. Public health stakeholders and decision-makers are called upon to set up or strengthen surveillance systems in areas hosting Olympic or Paralympic Games (OPGs) or large-scale international competitions, the objective being to detect and manage outbreaks should they occur during that period. We undertook a narrative review of the literature so as to identify major reported infectious disease outbreaks linked with or during OPGs / international sporting events during warm seasons. Our review found that since 1992, Summer Olympic and Paralympic games and international football competitions have been associated with sporadic cases of infectious diseases, principally respiratory, gastrointestinal/foodborne, but not with any major communicable or other infectious disease outbreak. Communicable disease risks should be assessed for the population taken as a whole, an integrated ecosystem with several population compartments potentially exchanging pathogens among one another. Although the Games afford an opportunity to federate or invent new surveillance systems to fill a gap, surveillance should be based on existing medical and laboratory systems, proven tools reinforced with the necessary human and financial resources. The performance of the public health surveillance system is ultimately predicated on trust on the part of participating clinicians, policymakers and international partners.",Infectious diseases now,2024-Jun,"Gallien Y, Fournet N, Delamare H, Haroutunian L, Tarantola A",5,1599,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

However, subunit vaccines still face problems, such as poor immunogenicity and low efficiency, while traditional adjuvants are usually unable to meet specific response needs. Advanced delivery vectors are important to overcome these barriers; they have favorable safety and effectiveness, tunable properties, precise location, and immunomodulatory capabilities. Nevertheless, there has been no systematic summary of the delivery systems to cover a wide range of infectious pathogens. We herein summarized and compared the delivery systems for major or epidemic infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. We also included the newly licensed vaccines (e.g., COVID-19 vaccines) and those close to licensure. Furthermore, we highlighted advanced delivery systems with high efficiency, cross-protection, or long-term protection against epidemic pathogens, and we put forward prospects and thoughts on the development of future prophylactic vaccines.",Advanced drug delivery reviews,2021-Sep,"Pan C, Yue H, Zhu L, Ma GH, Wang HL",5,1071,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
38986441,Human determinants of age-dependent patterns of death from infection.,"Regardless of microbial virulence (i.e., the global infection-fatality ratio), age generally drives the prevalence of death from infection in unvaccinated humans. Four mortality patterns are recognized: the common U- and L-shaped curves of endemic infections and the unique W- and J-shaped curves of pandemic infections. We suggest that these patterns result from different sets of human genetic and immunological determinants. In this model, it is the interplay between (1) monogenic genotypes affecting immunity to primary infection that preferentially manifest early in life and related genotypes or their phenocopies, including auto-antibodies, which manifest later in life and (2) the occurrence and persistence of adaptive, acquired immunity to primary or cross-reactive infections, which shapes the age-dependent pattern of human deaths from infection.",Immunity,2024-Jul,"Abel L, Casanova JL",2,859,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

A growing amount of evidence suggests that ion channels in the endolysosomal system play a crucial role in the pathology of both groups of diseases. The development of advanced patch-clamp technologies has allowed us to directly characterize ion fluxes through endolysosomal ion channels in their native environments. Endolysosomes are essential organelles for intracellular transport, digestion and metabolism, and maintenance of homeostasis. The endolysosomal ion channels regulate the function of the endolysosomal system through four basic mechanisms: calcium release, control of membrane potential, pH change, and osmolarity regulation. In this review, we put particular emphasis on the endolysosomal cation channels, including TPC2 and TRPML2, which are particularly important in monocyte function. We discuss existing endogenous and synthetic ligands of these channels and summarize current knowledge of their impact on channel activity and function in different cell types. Moreover, we summarize recent findings on the importance of TPC2 and TRPML2 channels as potential drug targets for the prevention and treatment of the emerging infectious diseases and cancer.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2022-Apr,"Chen CC, Krogsaeter E, Kuo CY, Huang MC, Chang SY, Biel M",6,1273,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
35844858,Epidemiology and Economic Burden of Continuing Challenge of Infectious Diseases in India: Analysis of Socio-Demographic Differentials.,"Unlike other low- and middle-income countries, infectious diseases are still predominant, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are emerging without replacing the burden of infectious diseases in India, where it is imposing a double burden of diseases on households in the country. This study aimed to analyse the socio-economic and demographic differentials in the magnitude of economic burden and coping strategies associated with health expenditure on infectious diseases in India. National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) data on ""Key Indicators of Social Consumption in India: Health, (2017-18)"" have been employed in this study. The findings of the study revealed that more than 33% of the individuals are still suffering from infectious diseases out of the total ailing population in India. Based on the various socio-economic and demographic covariates, infectious diseases are highly prevalent among individuals with marginalized characteristics, such as individuals residing in rural areas, females, 0-14 age groups, Muslims, illiterates, scheduled tribes (STs), and scheduled castes (SCs), large family households, and economically poor people in the country. The per capita out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure on infectious diseases is INR 7.28 and INR 29.38 in inpatient and outpatient care, respectively. Whereas, monthly per patient OOP expenditure on infectious diseases by infection-affected populations is INR 881.56 and INR 1,156.34 in inpatient and outpatient care in India. The study found that people residing in rural areas, SCs followed by other backward classes (OBCs), illiterates, poor, and very poor are more dependent on borrowings, sale of assets, and other distressed sources of financing. However, under National Health Policy 2017, many initiatives, such as ""Ayushman Bharat,"" PM-JAY, and National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) in 2021, have been launched by the government of India in the recent years. These initiatives are holistically launched for ensuring better health facilities, but it is early to make any prediction regarding its outcomes; hopefully, the time will define it over the passing of a few more years. Finally, the study proposed the need for proper implementations of policy initiatives, awareness against unhygienic conditions and contamination of illnesses, immunisations/vaccination campaigns, subsidized medical facilities, and the country's expansion of quality primary health-care facilities.",Frontiers in public health,2022-,"Ram B, Thakur R",2,2450,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34375854,Forced Migration and the Spread of Infectious Diseases.,"We examine the role of Venezuelan forced migration on the propagation of 15 infectious diseases in Colombia. For this purpose, we use rich municipal-monthly panel data. We exploit the fact that municipalities closer to the main migration entry points have a disproportionate exposure to infected migrants when the cumulative migration flows increase. We find that higher refugee inflows are associated with increments in the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as chickenpox and tuberculosis, as well as sexually transmitted diseases, namely syphilis. However, we find no significant effects of migration on the propagation of vector-borne diseases. Contact with infected migrants upon arrival seems to be the main driving mechanism.",Journal of health economics,2021-Sep,"Ibáñez AM, Rozo SV, Urbina MJ",3,745,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33262758,Inflammaging in Endemic Areas for Infectious Diseases.,"Immunosenescence is marked by a systemic process named inflammaging along with a series of defects in the immunological activity that results in poor responses to infectious agents and to vaccination. Inflammaging, a state of low-grade chronic inflammation, usually leads to chronic inflammatory diseases and frailty in the elderly. However, some elderly escape from frailty and reach advanced age free of the consequences of inflammaging. This process has been called immunological remodeling, and it is the hallmark of healthy aging as described in the studies of centenarians in Italy. The biological markers of healthy aging are still a matter of debate, and the studies on the topic have focused on inflammatory <i>versus</i> remodeling processes and molecules. The sub-clinical inflammatory status associated with aging might be a deleterious event for populations living in countries where chronic infectious diseases are not prevalent. Nevertheless, in other parts of the world where they are, two possibilities may occur. Inflammatory responses may have a protective effect against these infectious agents. At the same time, the long-term consequences of protective immune responses during chronic infections may result in accelerated immunosenescence in these individuals. Therefore, the biological markers of healthy aging can vary according to environmental, cultural, and geographical settings that reflect worldwide, and in a non-biased, non-westernized perspective, the changes that we experience regarding our contacts with microorganisms and the outcomes of such contacts.",Frontiers in immunology,2020-,"Batista MA, Calvo-Fortes F, Silveira-Nunes G, Camatta GC, Speziali E, Turroni S, Teixeira-Carvalho A, Martins-Filho OA, Neretti N, Maioli TU, Santos RR, Brigidi P, Franceschi C, Faria AMC",14,1589,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Concurrent host nucleic acid sequencing can assess the infected individual's physiological state, including characterization and appropriateness of the immune response. When the pathogen cannot be identified, host RNA sequencing may help infer the organism's nature. While the full promise of mNGS remains far from realization, the potential ability to identify all microbes in a complex clinical sample, assess each organism's virulence and antibiotic susceptibility traits, and simultaneously characterize the host's response to infection provide opportunities for mNGS to supplant existing technologies and become the primary method of infectious diseases diagnostics.",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,2021-Dec,Haslam DB,1,944,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The Stockholm Paradigm suggests that their toll will grow tragically in the face of climate change, in particular. The best research protocol for predicting and preventing infectious disease emergence states that an urgent search must commence to identify unknown human and animal pathogens. This short communication proposes that the ethnobiological knowledge of indigenous and impoverished communities can be a source of information about some of those unknown pathogens. I present the ecological and anthropological theory behind this proposal, followed by a few case studies that serve as a limited proof of concept. This paper also serves as a call to action for the medical anthropology community. It gives a brief primer on the EID crisis and how anthropology research may be vital to limiting its havoc on global health.

The role of a microbiologist is critical not only for laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases, but also for situational analysis and evaluation, planning, prevention and control. The task begins with risk assessment, specifically for identification of diseases epidemic and endemic to the area. Evaluation of existing laboratory setups and establishment of services where none exist is a priority, including facilitation of a tiered laboratory system. Training of laboratory staff at short notice in field settings, biosafety and biomedical waste management are niche areas where microbiologists can contribute.

34307196,Developing Recombinant Antibodies by Phage Display Against Infectious Diseases and Toxins for Diagnostics and Therapy.,"Antibodies are essential molecules for diagnosis and treatment of diseases caused by pathogens and their toxins. Antibodies were integrated in our medical repertoire against infectious diseases more than hundred years ago by using animal sera to treat tetanus and diphtheria. In these days, most developed therapeutic antibodies target cancer or autoimmune diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic was a reminder about the importance of antibodies for therapy against infectious diseases. While monoclonal antibodies could be generated by hybridoma technology since the 70ies of the former century, nowadays antibody phage display, among other display technologies, is robustly established to discover new human monoclonal antibodies. Phage display is an <i>in vitro</i> technology which confers the potential for generating antibodies from universal libraries against any conceivable molecule of sufficient size and omits the limitations of the immune systems. If convalescent patients or immunized/infected animals are available, it is possible to construct immune phage display libraries to select <i>in vivo</i> affinity-matured antibodies. A further advantage is the availability of the DNA sequence encoding the phage displayed antibody fragment, which is packaged in the phage particles. Therefore, the selected antibody fragments can be rapidly further engineered in any needed antibody format according to the requirements of the final application.

These rodents are purchased from pet shops, breeders, and online. Consequently, some of these rodents may subtly transmit diseases as they may be asymptomatic to certain pathogens. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We systematically searched four academic databases viz. Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus to determine zoonotic pathogens associated with pet and feeder rodents globally. Our searches were performed in R statistical software using the packages ""metagear"" and ""revtool"". <b><i>Results:</i></b> We found 62 studies reporting on zoonotic pathogens between 1973 and 2022 from 16 countries representing 4 continents, namely Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America. The review identified 30 zoonotic pathogens isolated from pet and feeder rodents, including the African pygmy mouse (<i>Mus minutoides</i>), brown rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>), and the house mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>). The greatest number of pathogens was reported from the United States, followed by Togo and the United Kingdom. Bacterial pathogens were the most prevalent. However, the Seoul virus and rat bite fever (<i>Streptobacillus moniliformis</i>) were the most studied pathogens, found in more than one country, with reported outbreak cases. Most of the zoonotic pathogens were isolated from rodents acquired from pet shops. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> We recommend that pet and feeder rodents purchased from pet shops should be regularly screened for potential zoonotic pathogens as some of these animals may not show clinical signs of the illness. There is also a critical need to develop strict regulations and policies, especially in underdeveloped and developing regions for an effective surveillance process, which will include early detection, rapid response, and control of zoonotic diseases globally.","Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)",2023-Nov,"Shivambu N, Shivambu TC, Chimimba CT",3,1926,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34799142,"Meeting report: CEPI consultation on accelerating access to novel vaccines against emerging infectious diseases for pregnant and lactating women, London, 12-13 February 2020.","Infectious diseases may cause serious morbidity and mortality in pregnant women, their foetuses, and infants; the risk associated with any newly emerging infectious disease (EID) is likely unknown at the time of its emergence. While the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic shows that the development of vaccines against new pathogens can be considerably accelerated, the immunization of pregnant women generally lags behind the general population. Guided by the priority pathogen list for WHO's R&D Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics, this workshop sought to define the evidence needed for use of vaccines against EIDs in pregnant and lactating women, using Lassa fever as a model. Close to 60 maternal immunization (MI) and vaccine safety experts, regulators, vaccine developers, Lassa fever experts, and investigators from Lassa-affected countries examined the critical steps for vaccine development and immunization decisions for pregnant and lactating women. This paper reports on key themes and recommendations from the workshop. Current practice still assumes the exclusion of pregnant women from early vaccine trials. A shift in paradigm is needed to progress towards initial inclusion of pregnant women in Phase 2 and 3 trials. Several practical avenues were delineated. Participants agreed that vaccine platforms should be assessed early for their suitability for maternal immunization. It was noted that, in some cases, nonclinical data derived from assessing a given platform using other antigens may be adequate evidence to proceed to a first clinical evaluation and that concurrence from regulators may be sought with supporting rationale. For clinical trials, essential prerequisites such as documenting the disease burden in pregnant women, study site infrastructure, capabilities, and staff experience were noted.

We demonstrate clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, kidney pathology, and laboratory diagnostic methods for (1) renal cryptococcosis, which represents involvement of a pure direct pathway; (2) schistosomiasis and dengue fever as examples of dual direct and indirect pathways; and (3) congenital syphilis, visceral leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease, which represent indirect pathways. Infective agents affect the kidneys of children mainly through indirect mechanisms, such as through immunological mechanisms as part of an antigenic response. A direct mechanism of kidney injury, however, is less known within the medical community simply because the direct mechanism is rarely encountered in nontropical countries.

32468923,Validation of laboratory tests for infectious diseases in wild mammals: review and recommendations.,"Evaluation of the diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and specificity (DSp) of tests for infectious diseases in wild animals is challenging, and some of the limitations may affect compliance with the OIE-recommended test validation pathway. We conducted a methodologic review of test validation studies for OIE-listed diseases in wild mammals published between 2008 and 2017 and focused on study design, statistical analysis, and reporting of results. Most published papers addressed <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> infection in one or more wildlife species. Our review revealed limitations or missing information about sampled animals, identification criteria for positive and negative samples (case definition), representativeness of source and target populations, and species in the study, as well as information identifying animals sampled for calculations of DSe and DSp as naturally infected captive, free-ranging, or experimentally challenged animals. The deficiencies may have reflected omissions in reporting rather than design flaws, although lack of random sampling might have induced bias in estimates of DSe and DSp. We used case studies of validation of tests for hemorrhagic diseases in deer and white-nose syndrome in hibernating bats to demonstrate approaches for validation when new pathogen serotypes or genotypes are detected and diagnostic algorithms are changed, and how purposes of tests evolve together with the evolution of the pathogen after identification. We describe potential benefits of experimental challenge studies for obtaining DSe and DSp estimates, methods to maintain sample integrity, and Bayesian latent class models for statistical analysis.

We describe the burden of site-specific infectious diseases among Chinese adults. From 2004 to 2008, the prospective China Kadoorie Biobank enrolled 512,726 adults aged 30-79 years from 10 diverse areas (5 rural, 5 urban) of China. During the 12 years of follow-up, 101,673 participants were hospitalized for any infectious disease. Descriptive analyses examined standardized incidence, mortality and case fatality of infections. The incidence of any infectious disease was 1856 per 100,000 person-years; respiratory tract infections (1069) were most common. The infectious disease mortality rate was 31.8 per 100,000 person-years (20.3 and 9.4 for respiratory and non-respiratory infections, respectively) and case fatality was 2.2% (2.6% and 1.6% for respiratory and non-respiratory infections, respectively). Infectious disease incidence and mortality rates were higher at older ages and in rural areas. There were no clear sex differences in infectious disease incidence rates, but mortality and case fatality rates were twice as high in men as in women. Infectious diseases were common in Chinese adults. The observed burden of, and disparities in, site-specific infections can inform targeted prevention efforts.

Long-term data on seven NNIDs from 2018 to 2021 were analyzed to identify trends and change points using a change point detection technique. The timings of the NPI implementations were compared to the identified change points to determine their association. Varicella, mumps, and scarlet fever showed a significant decrease in incidence following the implementation of NPIs during the COVID-19 pandemic. These diseases, which are primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, demonstrated a clear response to NPIs. However, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) showed an increasing trend unrelated to the timing of NPI implementation, suggesting the complex nature of controlling healthcare-associated infections. Hepatitis A, hepatitis C, and scrub typhus did not show significant changes associated with NPIs, likely due to their non-respiratory route of transmission. NPIs effectively controlled NNIDs, particularly those transmitted through respiratory infections. However, the impact varied depending on the disease. Understanding the effectiveness and limitations of NPIs is crucial for developing comprehensive public health strategies during infectious disease outbreaks.",The Korean journal of internal medicine,2024-Sep,"Lee HJ, Hwang BS, Im SH, Mun SK, Chang M",5,1383,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Namely, whether urbanization will exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases. Based on 31 provincial data from 2002 to 2018 in China, the impact of urbanization on the spread of infectious diseases from the dimensions of ""population"" and ""land"" is analyzed in this paper by using the GMM (generalized method of moments) model. The empirical study shows that the population increase brought by urbanization does not aggravate the spread of infectious diseases. On the contrary, urban education, employment and entrepreneurship, housing, medical and health care, and other basic public services brought by population urbanization can help reduce the risk of the spread of infectious diseases. The increasing density of buildings caused by land urbanization increases the risk of the spread of infectious diseases. Moreover, the impact of urbanization on the spread of infectious diseases has regional heterogeneity. Therefore, the prevention and control of disease play a crucial role.",Frontiers in public health,2021-,"Yu D, Li X, Yu J, Shi X, Liu P, Tian P",6,1129,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

For this reason, apprehending which disease will newly emerge, and preparing countermeasures for that disease, are required. Many different types of infectious diseases are emerging and threatening global human health conditions. For this reason, the detection of emerging infectious disease pattern is critical. However, as the epidemic spread of infectious disease occurs sporadically and rapidly, it is not easy to predict whether an infectious disease will emerge or not. Furthermore, accumulating data related to a specific infectious disease is not easy. For these reasons, finding useful data and building a prediction model with these data is required. The Internet press releases numerous articles every day that rapidly reflect currently pending issues. Thus, in this research, we accumulated Internet articles from Medisys that were related to infectious disease, to see if news data could be used to predict infectious disease outbreak. Articles related to infectious disease from January to December 2019 were collected. In this study, we evaluated if newly emerging infectious diseases could be detected using the news article data.

Since the beginning of the pandemic and the introduction of relate public health measures, notifications for most notifiable diseases have declined compared to previous years. In this study, we aim to quantify the changes in the incidences of notifiable infectious diseases during and after the pandemic in Siracusa Local Health Authority, Italy. We collected and analysed the infectious disease notifications made in two different three-years periods, 2017-2019 and 2020-2022 in Siracusa Local Health Authority, Italy. Descriptive statistics were used to find the percentages and the 95% confidence interval (CI). Exact ""F-tests"" was performed to compare the mean values between the studied periods to evaluate the hypothesis that the number of reported cases would not differ significantly between the two periods. Significance was assessed at the p < 0.05 level. The total number of notifications significantly decreased by 69.3% in the pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic one, with the highest reduction of air-borne transmission diseases (-86.5%), followed by food-borne diseases (-68.2%) and sexually transmitted diseases (-39.3%). Conversely, an increase in number of notifications was found only for legionellosis. The COVID-19 pandemic had the potential to influence communicable disease reporting at multiple points. While the effects could vary considerably, the results would be expected to reduce the number and the detection of notifiable cases.

38806460,Human movement and environmental barriers shape the emergence of dengue.,"Understanding how emerging infectious diseases spread within and between countries is essential to contain future pandemics. Spread to new areas requires connectivity between one or more sources and a suitable local environment, but how these two factors interact at different stages of disease emergence remains largely unknown. Further, no analytical framework exists to examine their roles. Here we develop a dynamic modelling approach for infectious diseases that explicitly models both connectivity via human movement and environmental suitability interactions. We apply it to better understand recently observed (1995-2019) patterns as well as predict past unobserved (1983-2000) and future (2020-2039) spread of dengue in Mexico and Brazil. We find that these models can accurately reconstruct long-term spread pathways, determine historical origins, and identify specific routes of invasion. We find early dengue invasion is more heavily influenced by environmental factors, resulting in patchy non-contiguous spread, while short and long-distance connectivity becomes more important in later stages. Our results have immediate practical applications for forecasting and containing the spread of dengue and emergence of new serotypes. Given current and future trends in human mobility, climate, and zoonotic spillover, understanding the interplay between connectivity and environmental suitability will be increasingly necessary to contain emerging and re-emerging pathogens.",Nature communications,2024-May,"Harish V, Colón-González FJ, Moreira FRR, Gibb R, Kraemer MUG, Davis M, Reiner RC, Pigott DM, Perkins TA, Weiss DJ, Bogoch II, Vazquez-Prokopec G, Saide PM, Barbosa GL, Sabino EC, Khan K, Faria NR, Hay SI, Correa-Morales F, Chiaravalloti-Neto F, Brady OJ",21,1483,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
36333699,Application of logistic differential equation models for early warning of infectious diseases in Jilin Province.,"There is still a relatively serious disease burden of infectious diseases and the warning time for different infectious diseases before implementation of interventions is important. The logistic differential equation models can be used for predicting early warning of infectious diseases. The aim of this study is to compare the disease fitting effects of the logistic differential equation (LDE) model and the generalized logistic differential equation (GLDE) model for the first time using data on multiple infectious diseases in Jilin Province and to calculate the early warning signals for different types of infectious diseases using these two models in Jilin Province to solve the disease early warning schedule for Jilin Province throughout the year. Collecting the incidence of 22 infectious diseases in Jilin Province, China. The LDE and GLDE models were used to calculate the recommended warning week (RWW), the epidemic acceleration week (EAW) and warning removed week (WRW) for acute infectious diseases with seasonality, respectively. Five diseases were selected for analysis based on screening principles: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), shigellosis, mumps, Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), and scarlet fever. The GLDE model fitted the above diseases better (0.80 ≤ R<sup>2</sup> ≤ 0.94, P <  0. 005) than the LDE model. The estimated warning durations (per year) of the LDE model for the above diseases were: weeks 12-23 and 40-50; weeks 20-36; weeks 15-24 and 43-52; weeks 26-34; and weeks 16-25 and 41-50. While the durations of early warning (per year) estimated by the GLDE model were: weeks 7-24 and 36-51; weeks 13-37; weeks 11-26 and 39-54; weeks 23-35; and weeks 12-26 and 40-50. Compared to the LDE model, the GLDE model provides a better fit to the actual disease incidence data. The RWW appeared to be earlier when estimated with the GLDE model than the LDE model. In addition, the WRW estimated with the GLDE model were more lagged and had a longer warning time.",BMC public health,2022-Nov,"Yang T, Wang Y, Yao L, Guo X, Hannah MN, Liu C, Rui J, Zhao Z, Huang J, Liu W, Deng B, Luo L, Li Z, Li P, Zhu Y, Liu X, Xu J, Yang M, Zhao Q, Su Y, Chen T",21,2007,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The gaps and strategies developed by India to meet the WHO guidelines on the effective control of epidemic-prone diseases and outbreaks are also presented in the review. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Epidemiologic information of EIDs, namely Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Ebola and Marburg viruses (EboV and MarV), Zika virus (ZIKAV), Rift Valley fever (RVF), Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah and Hendra virus (NiV and HeV), and Lassa fever virus (LASV), was drawn from international and national electronic databases to assess the situation. A brief view on the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India is also included. <b><i>Results:</i></b> There are no reports for human infection of EboV, MarV, RVF, and LASV in India. CCHF, SARS, ZIKAV, and NiV have been involved in outbreaks in eight states of India, while COVID-19 is currently reported from majority of states. India has deeply strengthened its surveillance and response system of outbreaks and epidemic-prone diseases. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Despite its enormous improvements made in the anticipation of such threats, still more efforts are needed in sensitization of populations as well as hospital management in the context to EIDs, as addressed in the review. Furthermore, there is still a need for more research and development activities to efficiently control EIDs.","Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)",2021-Mar,"Kojom LP, Singh V",2,1651,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Together, such barriers have negatively impacted immunization rates worldwide, resulting in epidemics and pandemics of serious life-threatening infections from vaccine-preventable diseases, especially those affecting children. In addition, pathogens thought to be controlled or eradicated are reemerging with new genetic traits, making them more able to evade natural and acquired immunity, including that induced by available vaccines. Lastly, many serious and widespread infectious diseases await development and utilization of efficacious vaccines. The global burden of communicable diseases remains high, necessitating continued pathogen surveillance as well as vaccine development, deployment and continued efficacy testing.

Nevertheless, archaeal syntrophic principles that shape global microbial networks aid both archaea and potentially pathogenic bacteria. Evaluating archaea interactions remains challenging, requiring clinical studies on inflammatory potential and the effects of archaeal metabolism. Establishing a culture collection is crucial for investigating archaea functions within the human microbiome, which could improve health outcomes in infectious diseases.

In 2018-2019, the proportion of infectious diseases in FUO was higher than 2016-2017 (P < 0.05). The proportion of infectious diseases was higher in men and older FUO than in women and young and middle-aged (P < 0.05). According to follow-up, the mortality rate of FUO patients during hospitalization was low at 1.9%. Infectious diseases are the principal cause of FUO. There are temporal differences in the etiological distribution of FUO, and the etiology of FUO is closely related to the prognosis. It is important to identify the etiology of patients with worsening or unrelieved disease.",BMC infectious diseases,2023-Jul,"Jiang L, Wu H, Zhao S, Zhang Y, Song N",5,1987,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39311537,The effects of stress on gut virome: Implications on infectious disease and systemic disorders.,"The role of gut microbiota in health and disease is being thoroughly examined in various contexts, with a specific focus on the bacterial fraction due to its significant abundance. However, despite their lower abundance, viruses within the gut microbiota are gaining recognition for their crucial role in shaping the structure and function of the intestinal microbiota, with significant effects on the host as a whole, particularly the immune system. Similarly, environmental factors such as stress are key in modulating the host immune system, which in turn influences the composition of the gut virome and neurological functions through the bidirectional communication of the gut-brain axis. In this context, alterations in the host immune system due to stress and/or dysbiosis of the gut virome are critical factors in the development of both infectious and noninfectious diseases. The molecular mechanisms and correlation patterns between microbial species are not yet fully understood. This literature review seeks to explore the interconnected relationship between stress and the gut virome, with a focus on how this interaction is influenced by the host's immune system. We also discuss how disturbances in this finely balanced system can lead to the onset and/or progression of diseases.",MicrobiologyOpen,2024-Oct,"Talarico F, Tilocca B, Spagnuolo R, Abenavoli L, Luzza F, Roncada P",6,1295,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33956324,Self-luminescent photodynamic therapy and pathogen detection for infectious diseases.,"The importance of detection and treatments of infectious diseases has been stressed to the world by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As a substitution of an external light source, self-luminescent therapeutics featuring in situ light emission aims to address the lack of tissue penetration in conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT). Luminol-based self-luminescent systems are successfully incorporated in PDT and detection of pathogens in infectious diseases. In these systems, luminol/hydrogen peroxide is served as luminescence source which can be activated by horseradish peroxidase (HRP). As a supplement strategy to the HRP-based bioluminescence, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) provided an electric-driven therapeutic solution and demonstrated potential capabilities of wearable healthcare devices with properly constructed transparent flexible hydrogels. Besides the diagnosis of infection and detection of bacteria, fungi and virus in solution or powder samples have been achieved by ATP-derived self-luminescence as the light source. In this inspirational note, we provide an overview on latest progress in the PDT and microbial detection by self-luminescent systems with an emphasis on the bioluminescence and ECL.",Drug delivery and translational research,2021-Aug,"Zhang E, Huang Y, Wang S",3,1222,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
38915381,Towards the development of cost-effective point-of-care diagnostic tools for poverty-related infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa.,"In this review, we examine the current landscape of point-of-care testing (POCT) diagnostic tools designed for poverty-related infectious diseases (PRIDs) in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) while delineating key avenues for future advancements. Our analysis encompasses both established and emerging diagnostic methods for PRIDs, addressing the persistent challenges in POCT tool development and deployment, such as cost, accessibility, and reliability. We emphasize recent advancements in POCT diagnostic tools as well as platforms poised to enhance diagnostic testing in sSA. Recognizing the urgency for affordable and widely accessible POCT diagnostic tools to detect PRIDs in sSA, we advocate for a multidisciplinary approach. This approach integrates current and emerging diagnostic methods, explicitly addressing challenges hindering point-of-care (POC) tool development. Furthermore, it recognizes the profound impact of misdiagnosis on public and global health, emphasizing the need for effective tools. To facilitate the successful development and implementation of POCT diagnostic tools in sSA, we propose strategies including the creation of multi-analyte detection POCT tools, the implementation of education and training programs, community engagement initiatives, fostering public-private collaborations, and the establishment of reliable supply chains. Through these concerted efforts, we aim to accelerate the development of POCT in the sSA region, ensuring its effectiveness and accessibility in addressing the diagnostic challenges associated with PRIDs.",PeerJ,2024-,"Ofori B, Twum S, Nkansah Yeboah S, Ansah F, Amofa Nketia Sarpong K",5,1565,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
32895867,Highlights in Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles as a Multifunctional Controlled Drug Delivery Nanoplatform for Infectious Diseases Treatment.,"Infectious diseases are a major global concern being responsible for high morbidity and mortality mainly due to the development and enhancement of multidrug-resistant microorganisms exposing the fragility of medicines and vaccines commonly used to these treatments. Taking into account the scarcity of effective formulation to treat infectious diseases, nanotechnology offers a vast possibility of ground-breaking platforms to design new treatment through smart nanostructures for drug delivery purposes. Among the available nanosystems, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) stand out due their multifunctionality, biocompatibility and tunable properties make them emerging and actual nanocarriers for specific and controlled drug release. Considering the high demand for diseases prevention and treatment, this review exploits the MSNs fabrication and their behavior in biological media besides highlighting the most of strategies to explore the wide MSNs functionality as engineered, smart and effective controlled drug release nanovehicles for infectious diseases treatment.

39231189,Prediction of infectious diseases using sentiment analysis on social media data.,"As the influence and risk of infectious diseases increase, efforts are being made to predict the number of confirmed infectious disease patients, but research involving the qualitative opinions of social media users is scarce. However, social data can change the psychology and behaviors of crowds through information dissemination, which can affect the spread of infectious diseases. Existing studies have used the number of confirmed cases and spatial data to predict the number of confirmed cases of infectious diseases. However, studies using opinions from social data that affect changes in human behavior in relation to the spread of infectious diseases are inadequate. Therefore, herein, we propose a new approach for sentiment analysis of social data by using opinion mining and to predict the number of confirmed cases of infectious diseases by using machine learning techniques. To build a sentiment dictionary specialized for predicting infectious diseases, we used Word2Vec to expand the existing sentiment dictionary and calculate the daily sentiment polarity by dividing it into positive and negative polarities from collected social data. Thereafter, we developed an algorithm to predict the number of confirmed infectious patients by using both positive and negative polarities with DNN, LSTM and GRU. The method proposed herein showed that the prediction results of the number of confirmed cases obtained using opinion mining were 1.12% and 3% better than those obtained without using opinion mining in LSTM and GRU model, and it is expected that social data will be used from a qualitative perspective for predicting the number of confirmed cases of infectious diseases.",PloS one,2024-,"Song Y, Yoon B",2,1688,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

39488038,FGL2: A new target molecule for coagulation and immune regulation in infectious disease.,"Infectious diseases are complex inflammatory-immunologic host responses caused by various pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi. In the process of infectious disease development, immune cells are activated, and a substantial number of inflammatory factors are released within the endothelium, which results in coagulation activation and the formation of intravascular thrombi. Furthermore, infection-induced hypercoagulability amplifies the inflammatory response and immune dysregulation. Emerging evidence suggests that fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) has a crucial role in facilitating procoagulant, pro-inflammatory, and immune-regulatory responses in various infectious diseases. This review illustrates the complex procoagulation and immunoregulatory roles of FGL2, suggesting it could be a target for novel immune interventions in intractable infectious diseases.",International immunopharmacology,2024-Dec,"Wang C, Sun H, Wang R, Ma X, Sun Y",5,891,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
37232310,Reshaping surveillance for infectious diseases: less chasing of pathogens and more monitoring of drivers.,"Animal health surveillance, despite its name, tends to focus on looking for disease. Often this involves searching for cases of infection with known pathogens (â€˜pathogen chasing'). Such an approach is both resource intensive and limited by the requirement for prior knowledge of disease likelihood. In this paper, the authors propose the gradual reshaping of surveillance towards the systems level, focusing on the processes (â€˜drivers') that promote disease or health, rather than on the presence or absence of specific pathogens. Examples of relevant drivers include land-use change, increasing global interconnectedness, and finance and capital flows. Importantly, the authors suggest that surveillance should focus on detecting changes in patterns or quantities associated with such drivers. This would generate systems-level, risk-based surveillance information to identify areas where additional attention may be needed, and, over time, inform the implementation of prevention efforts. The collection, integration and analysis of data on drivers is likely to require investment in improving data infrastructures. A period of overlap would allow the two systems (traditional surveillance and driver monitoring) to be compared and calibrated. This would also lead to a better understanding of the drivers and their linkages, and thereby generate new knowledge that can improve surveillance and inform mitigation efforts. Since surveillance of drivers may give signals when changes are occurring, which could act as alerts and enable targeted mitigation, this might even enable disease to be prevented before it happens by directly intervening in the drivers themselves. Such surveillance focused on the drivers could be expected to bring additional benefits, since the same drivers promote multiple diseases. Further, focusing on drivers rather than pathogens should enable control of currently unknown diseases, making this approach particularly timely, given the increasing risk of emergence of new diseases.",Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),2023-May,"Drewe JA, George J, Hasler B",3,2017,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
37875907,Oral Complications related to tropical infectious Diseases: an introduction and analysis of survey data.,"The non-indigenous tropical infectious diseases that occur in the non-tropics arise from personnel communication between locals and visitors. Many of these infectious diseases involve oral complications. It is very important for practitioners to manage such cases based on a clear understanding of the association between tropical infectious diseases and oral health. In this study, we summarize the oral complications related to tropical infectious diseases and investigate the understanding of infectious disease practitioners in relation to the association between these conditions. In addition, we provide supportive advice to facilitate the oral management of tropical infectious diseases. First, we investigate the oral complications related to tropical infectious diseases by performing an appropriate literature search. Then, we analyzed the understanding of 207 Chinese practitioners specializing in infectious diseases in relation to the association between these two conditions by applying a bespoke online questionnaire. Analysis revealed that the Chinese practitioners had very poor attitudes and knowledge relating to the association between tropical infectious diseases and oral health. Different backgrounds had no significant impact on the understanding of Chinese practitioners with regards to the association between tropical infectious diseases and oral health. Many oral complications are related to tropical infectious diseases. The understanding of Chinese practitioners with regards to the association between infectious disease and oral health was very inadequate. It is essential to promote publicity and education relating to infectious tropical diseases and oral health.",BMC oral health,2023-Oct,"Shuai Y, Lou Y, Zhu L, Chen W, Jiang T",5,1698,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39052140,Fitting Epidemic Models to Data: A Tutorial in Memory of Fred Brauer.,"Fred Brauer was an eminent mathematician who studied dynamical systems, especially differential equations. He made many contributions to mathematical epidemiology, a field that is strongly connected to data, but he always chose to avoid data analysis. Nevertheless, he recognized that fitting models to data is usually necessary when attempting to apply infectious disease transmission models to real public health problems. He was curious to know how one goes about fitting dynamical models to data, and why it can be hard. Initially in response to Fred's questions, we developed a user-friendly R package, fitode, that facilitates fitting ordinary differential equations to observed time series. Here, we use this package to provide a brief tutorial introduction to fitting compartmental epidemic models to a single observed time series. We assume that, like Fred, the reader is familiar with dynamical systems from a mathematical perspective, but has limited experience with statistical methodology or optimization techniques.",Bulletin of mathematical biology,2024-Jul,"Earn DJD, Park SW, Bolker BM",3,1029,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33095583,Utility of Proteomics in Emerging and Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases Caused by RNA Viruses.,"Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to RNA viruses cause major negative consequences for the quality of life, public health, and overall economic development. Most of the RNA viruses causing illnesses in humans are of zoonotic origin. Zoonotic viruses can directly be transferred from animals to humans through adaptation, followed by human-to-human transmission, such as in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, more recently, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or they can be transferred through insects or vectors, as in the case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and dengue virus (DENV). At the present, there are no vaccines or antiviral compounds against most of these viruses. Because proteins possess a vast array of functions in all known biological systems, proteomics-based strategies can provide important insights into the investigation of disease pathogenesis and the identification of promising antiviral drug targets during an epidemic or pandemic. Mass spectrometry technology has provided the capacity required for the precise identification and the sensitive and high-throughput analysis of proteins on a large scale and has contributed greatly to unravelling key protein-protein interactions, discovering signaling networks, and understanding disease mechanisms. In this Review, we present an account of quantitative proteomics and its application in some prominent recent examples of emerging and re-emerging RNA virus diseases like HIV-1, CCHFV, ZIKV, and DENV, with more detail with respect to coronaviruses (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) as well as the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",Journal of proteome research,2020-Nov,"Sperk M, van Domselaar R, Rodriguez JE, Mikaeloff F, Sá Vinhas B, Saccon E, Sönnerborg A, Singh K, Gupta S, Végvári Á, Neogi U",11,1761,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33657594,New Approach to the Surveillance of Pediatric Infectious Diseases From Ambulatory Pediatricians in the Digital Era.,"Many ambulatory networks in several countries have established syndromic surveillance systems to detect outbreaks of different illnesses. Here, we describe a new Pediatric and Ambulatory Research in Infectious diseases network that combined automated data extraction from the computers of primary care pediatricians. Pediatricians who used the same software, AxiSanté 5-Infansoft for electronic medical records were specially trained in infectious diseases, encouraged to comply with French treatments' recommendations, use of point-of-care tests and vaccination guidelines. Infectious disease diagnoses in children <16 years old in the records triggered automatic data extraction of complete records. A quality control process and external validation were developed. From September 2017 to February 2020, 107 pediatricians enrolled 57,806 children (mean age 2.9 ± 2.6 years at diagnosis) with at least one infectious disease diagnosis among those followed by the network. Among the 118,193 diagnoses, the most frequent were acute otitis media (n = 44,924, 38.0%), tonsillopharyngitis (n = 13,334, 11.3%), gastroenteritis (n = 12,367, 10.5%), influenza (n = 11,062, 9.4%), bronchiolitis (n = 10,531, 8.9%), enteroviral infections (n = 8474, 7.2%) and chickenpox (n = 6857, 5.8%). A rapid diagnostic test was performed in 84.7% of cases of tonsillopharyngitis and was positive in 44%. The antibiotic recommendations from French guidelines were strictly followed: amoxicillin was the most prescribed antibiotic and less than 10% of presumed viral infections were treated. This ""tailor-made"" network set up with quality controls and external validation represents a new approach to the surveillance of pediatric infectious diseases in the digital era and could highly optimize pediatric practices.",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,2021-Jul,"Cohen R, Béchet S, Gelbert N, Frandji B, Vie Le Sage F, Thiebault G, Kochert F, Cahn-Sellem F, Werner A, Ouldali N, Levy C",11,1794,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Cell membrane-based nanoplatforms endow nanoparticles with versatile characteristics, such as half-life extension, targeting ability, and immune-system regulation. However, monotypic cell membrane usually fails to provoke strong immune response for immunotherapy while maintaining good biosafety. The integration of different cell-membrane types provides a promising approach to construct multifunctional nanoplatforms for improved immunotherapeutic efficacy by enhancing immunogenicity or targeting function, evading immune clearance, or combining with other therapeutic modalities. In this review, the design principles, preparation strategies, and applications of hybrid cell membrane-based nanoplatforms for cancer and infection immunotherapy are first discussed.

31538184,From the Pipeline to the Bedside: Advances and Challenges in Clinical Metagenomics.,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized multiple areas in the field of infectious diseases, from pathogen discovery to characterization of genes mediating drug resistance. Consequently, there is much anticipation that NGS technologies may be harnessed in the realm of diagnostic methods to complement or replace current culture-based and molecular microbiologic techniques. In this context, much consideration has been given to hypothesis-free, culture-independent tests that can be performed directly on primary clinical samples. The closest realizations of such universal diagnostic methods achieved to date are based on targeted amplicon and unbiased metagenomic shotgun NGS approaches. Depending on the exact details of implementation and analysis, these approaches have the potential to detect viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and archaea, including organisms that were previously undiscovered and those that are uncultivatable. Shotgun metagenomics approaches additionally can provide information on the presence of virulence and resistance genetic elements. While many limitations to the use of NGS in clinical microbiology laboratories are being overcome with decreasing technology costs, expanding curated pathogen sequence databases, and better data analysis tools, there remain many challenges to the routine use and implementation of these methods.

GloPID-R is establishing regional hubs to strengthen stakeholder engagement particularly among low-income and middle-income countries. The first pilot hub, led from Republic of Korea (South Korea), has been launched in the Asia-Pacific region, a region highly prone to outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. We present findings of mapping research undertaken in support of the hub's development. We analysed five COVID-19 research databases in September 2022 to identify research funders and intermediary funding sources supporting research in infectious diseases in the Asia-Pacific region. This was complemented with an in-depth analysis of the UK Collaborative on Development Research (UKCDR) and GloPID-R COVID-19 Research Project Tracker to assess the alignment of funded projects in the region to the WHO COVID-19 research priorities. We identified 453 funders and funding sources supporting COVID-19 research in the Asia-Pacific Region including public, private and philanthropic organisations and universities. However, these organisations were clustered in few countries in the region. The in-depth analysis of the UKCDR and GloPID-R COVID-19 Research project Tracker found limited research involving Asia-Pacific countries with the 117 funders supporting these projects investing at least US$604m in COVID-19 research in the region. Social Sciences was the dominant theme on which funded projects focused whereas the priority areas with the least number of projects were research on 'animal and environmental health' and 'ethics considerations for research'. Our analyses show the diversity of funding sources for research on infectious diseases in the Asia-Pacific region.

For example, the diaries show that the infection rate was high among young children, such as No's younger siblings and nephews. The process of nursing them is meticulously documented. To address infectious diseases, No sought medical assistance by meeting with doctors or visiting pharmacies for prescribed remedies. Additionally, he and his family would relocate to temples or relatives' homes to avoid areas with severe outbreaks. When engaged in official duties, updates about his family and hometown were received through letters, and the diary primarily focused on the circumstances at his workplace. In 1799, while working in the central government, No encountered a large-scale outbreak of infectious diseases. He extensively documented the resulting damage, including the loss of his own family members. An examination of his diaries not only reveals No Sangchu's individual responses but also sheds light on the state's efforts to maintain a relief system. In summary, No Sangchu Ilgi provides detailed records of infectious diseases directly related to household well-being and the state's to infectious diseases, making it a valuable source for understanding the experience of infectious diseases in the late Joseon period.",Ui sahak,2023-Dec,Im H,1,1616,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Among the factors influencing host response, those associated with circadian disruptions are emerging. These latter depend on molecular clocks, which control the two partners of host defense: microbes and immune system. There is some evidence that infections are closely related to circadian rhythms in terms of susceptibility, clinical presentation and severity. In this review, we overview what is known about circadian rhythms in infectious diseases and update the knowledge about circadian rhythms in immune system, pathogens and vectors. This heuristic approach opens a new fascinating field of time-based personalized treatment of infected patients.",Frontiers in immunology,2020-,"Diallo AB, Coiffard B, Leone M, Mezouar S, Mege JL",5,716,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

39374303,The optimal spatially-dependent control measures to effectively and economically eliminate emerging infectious diseases.,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are effective in mitigating infections during the early stages of an infectious disease outbreak. However, these measures incur significant economic and livelihood costs. To address this, we developed an optimal control framework aimed at identifying strategies that minimize such costs while ensuring full control of a cross-regional outbreak of emerging infectious diseases. Our approach uses a spatial SEIR model with interventions for the epidemic process, and incorporates population flow in a gravity model dependent on gross domestic product (GDP) and geographical distance. We applied this framework to identify an optimal control strategy for the COVID-19 outbreak caused by the Delta variant in Xi'an City, Shaanxi, China, between December 2021 and January 2022. The model was parameterized by fitting it to daily case data from each district of Xi'an City. Our findings indicate that an increase in the basic reproduction number, the latent period or the infectious period leads to a prolonged outbreak and a larger final size. This indicates that diseases with greater transmissibility are more challenging and costly to control, and so it is important for governments to quickly identify cases and implement control strategies. Indeed, the optimal control strategy we identified suggests that more costly control measures should be implemented as soon as they are deemed necessary. Our results demonstrate that optimal control regimes exhibit spatial, economic, and population heterogeneity. More populated and economically developed regions require a robust regular surveillance mechanism to ensure timely detection and control of imported infections. Regions with higher GDP tend to experience larger-scale epidemics and, consequently, require higher control costs. Notably, our proposed optimal strategy significantly reduced costs compared to the actual expenditures for the Xi'an outbreak.",PLoS computational biology,2024-Oct,"Xia F, Xiao Y, Ma J",3,1947,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Dysregulation in the inflammatory response and changes in the extracellular matrix by MMPs are related to the development of various diseases including lung and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted to understand the role of MMPs in disease pathogenesis. MMPs are involved in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases through a dysregulation of the activity and expression of MMPs. In this review, we discuss the role of MMPs in infectious diseases and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, we present the potential of MMPs as therapeutic targets in infectious diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022-Sep,"Lee HS, Kim WJ",2,855,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39045894,Tackling transmission of infectious diseases: A probiotic-based system as a remedy for the spread of pathogenic and resistant microbes.,"Built environments (BEs) currently represent the areas in which human beings spend most of their life. Consistently, microbes populating BEs mostly derive from human occupants and can be easily transferred from BE to occupants. The hospital microbiome is a paradigmatic example, representing a reservoir for harmful pathogens that can be transmitted to susceptible patients, causing the healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Environmental cleaning is a crucial pillar in controlling BE pathogens and preventing related infections, and chemical disinfectants have been largely used so far towards this aim. However, despite their immediate effect, chemical-based disinfection is unable to prevent recontamination, has a high environmental impact, and can select/increase antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in treated microbes. To overcome these limitations, probiotic-based sanitation (PBS) strategies were recently proposed, built on the use of detergents added with selected probiotics able to displace surrounding pathogens by competitive exclusion. PBS was reported as an effective and low-impact alternative to chemical disinfection, providing stable rebalance of the BE microbiome and significantly reducing pathogens and HAIs compared to disinfectants, without exacerbating AMR and pollution concerns. This minireview summarizes the most significant results obtained by applying PBS in sanitary and non-sanitary settings, which overall suggest that PBS may effectively tackle the infectious risk meanwhile preventing the further spread of pathogenic and resistant microbes.",Microbial biotechnology,2024-Jul,"D'Accolti M, Soffritti I, Bini F, Mazziga E, Caselli E",5,1578,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39435940,"A Proposed Research Agenda for Ethical, Legal, Social, and Historical Studies at the Intersection of Infectious and Genetic Disease.","Over the past two decades there has been a rapid expansion in our understanding of how human genetic variability impacts susceptibility and severity of disease. Through applications of genome-wide association studies, genome and exome sequencing, researchers have made thousands of discoveries of genetic variants that impact risk of common and rare disorders affecting millions of people. Although these techniques have been primarily applied to highly prevalent chronic disorders such as diabetes<sup>1</sup> and cardiovascular disease<sup>2</sup>, infectious diseases have proven to not be immune to genome-wide association, with studies of Tuberculosis<sup>3</sup>, HIV<sup>4</sup> and SARS-CoV2<sup>5</sup>, to name but a few, identifying host susceptibility loci across the genome. Unlike non-communicable diseases, infectious diseases have the unique element of impacting not only the affected the host, but those who may be most vulnerable to acquiring the infection. Thus, genetic variants that impact one individual's susceptibility to and severity of an infection may also have broader implications to public health, as was brought into keen focus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, as we begin to apply the knowledge gained from genomic studies in the clinic or into policy, there are unique ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) at the intersection of infectious diseases and human genomics. In this issue of the <i>Journal of Law, Medicine and Ethics</i>, Jose et al attempt to address this need by proposing a research agenda for ELSI studies at what they term the ""blurred boundaries"" of infectious and genetic diseases.<sup>6</sup>.","The Journal of law, medicine & ethics : a journal of the American Society of Law, Medicine & Ethics",2024-,"Cholette F, McLaren PJ",2,1664,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

33112102,Evolution of epidemiological thought in medicine taking into account the evolution of Polish epidemiology in the 20th century.,"Communicable diseases have accompanied humanity since the beginning of its existence. The first descriptions of diseases appeared in the 8th century B.C. in the Iliad, Homer. Epidemics of communicable diseases were often described in social context by poets, historians, and chroniclers. Medicine as a science until the 19th century could not provide answers concerning the aetiology of epidemic diseases or propose therapies with measurable benefits. For centuries the fight against epidemics was the duty of administrative services. Quarantine, isolation (including forced isolation), sanitary cordons, and disinfection procedures involving the moxibustion, burning of objects, clothing and bodies, etc. were introduced very early on. The knowledge of practical measures taken during repeated epidemics of various communicable diseases in Europe laid the foundations for the development of social medicine in the 18th century. In the 19th century, methods such as statistics, comparison of patient groups, mathematics and others were introduced to assess the effectiveness of prophylactic and therapeutic measures. In the 19th century it became possible to distinguish a new science - epidemiology. The missing element was the so-called ""bacteriological breakthrough"". After the discovery and description of bacteria, there was a tumultuous development of bacteriology, vaccines were created and huge financial resources were allocated to bacteriological institutes. After extensive use of chemotherapeutics and antibiotics, it turned out in the mid-20th century that the mortality from communicable diseasesis statistically lower in some countries than in others.In the 1940s, population-based cardiological studies using epidemiological patterns were introduced in the United States, and in the 1950s epidemiological congresses worldwide accepted that it was reasonable for epidemiology to investigate the occurrence and causes of communicable and non-communicable diseases. In Poland, in 1964, at the 4th Congress of the Polish Society of Epidemiologists and Doctors of Infectious Diseases in Cracow, a decision was made to extend epidemiological studies to non-communicable diseases.",Przeglad epidemiologiczny,2020-,Paliga RE,1,2189,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, cross-border infectious diseases had provoked a great deal of media and public interest, academic research and foreign-policy agendas. This paper analyses the relevance of health security in global health. It stresses global health as an explicitly political concept taking into consideration existing inequalities and power asymmetries. Global health represents the necessary evolution of public health in the face of ubiquitous global challenges and the growing number of international players. Some of them tend to divert global health towards technification, marketisation and privatisation, promoting biomedical reductionism and predominantly technological solutions. Overall, the current global health concept fails to adequately consider the global burden of disease, which is largely determined by non-communicable conditions. Global health goes beyond preventing infectious diseases and health security and must first and foremost focus on the social, economic, ecologic and political determination of health, which interacts with non-communicable and communicable diseases, turning them into syndemics. Health-in-all policies in a global perspective are required for sustainably reducing health inequalities within and between countries, instead of primarily focusing on security and safeguarding the status quo in a changing world.",Global public health,2022-Dec,"Holst J, Razum O",2,1473,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

32743798,Use of a rapid electronic survey methodology to estimate blood donors' potential exposure to emerging infectious diseases: Application of a statistically representative sampling methodology to assess risk in US blood centers.,"Risk assessments of transfusion-transmitted emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are complicated by the fact that blood donors' demographics and behaviors can be different from the general population. Therefore, when assessing potential blood donor exposure to EIDs, the use of general population characteristics, such as U.S. travel statistics, may invoke uncertainties that result in inaccurate estimates of blood donor exposure. This may, in turn, lead to the creation of donor deferral policies that do not match actual risk. This article reports on the development of a system to rapidly assess EID risks for a nationally representative portion of the U.S. blood donor population. To assess the effectiveness of this system, a test survey was developed and deployed to a statistically representative sample frame of blood donors from five blood collecting organizations. Donors were directed to an online survey to ascertain their recent travel and potential exposure to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A total of 7128 responses were received from 54 256 invitations. The age-adjusted estimated total number of blood donors potentially exposed to MERS-CoV was approximately 15 640 blood donors compared to a lower U.S. general population-based estimate of 9610 blood donors. The structured donor demographic sample-based data provided an assessment of blood donors' potential exposure to an emerging pathogen that was 63% larger than the U.S. population-based estimate. This illustrates the need for tailored blood donor-based EID risk assessments that provide more specific demographic risk intelligence and can inform appropriate regulatory decision making.",Transfusion,2020-Sep,"Whitaker BI, Walderhaug M, Hinkins S, Steele WR, Custer B, Kessler D, Leparc G, Gottschall JL, Bialkowski W, Stramer SL, Dodd RY, Crowder L, Vahidnia F, Shaz BH, Kamel H, Rebosa M, Stern M, Anderson SA",18,1688,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This secondary analysis study, based on a web-based cross-sectional survey, recruited participants from January 21 to 31, 2019. The participants were asked to recall the most memorable diagnostic error cases in which they were primarily involved. We gathered data on internists' demographics, time to error recognition, and error location. Factors causing diagnostic errors included environmental conditions, information processing, and cognitive bias. Participants scored the significance of each contributing factor on a Likert scale (0, unimportant; 10, extremely important). The Big Three comprised 54.1 % (n=372) of the 687 cases reviewed. The median physician age was 51.5 years (interquartile range, 42-58 years); 65.6 % of physicians worked in hospital settings. Delayed diagnoses were the most common among malignancies (n=64, 46 %). Diagnostic errors related to malignancy were frequent in general outpatient settings on weekdays and in the mornings and were not identified for several months following the event. Environmental factors often contributed to cardiovascular disease-related errors, which were typically identified within days in emergency departments, during night shifts, and on holidays. Information gathering and interpretation significantly impacted infectious disease diagnoses. The Big Three accounted for the majority of cases recalled by Japanese internists.

35058571,Obesity and infectious diseases: pathophysiology and epidemiology of a double pandemic condition.,"The current pandemic due to widespread SARS-CoV-19 infection has again highlighted the role of obesity, whose global prevalence increased up to 13%, as a risk factor for both susceptibility to infections and the occurrence of a more severe disease course. To date, this association has not been sufficiently explored. Obesity-related susceptibility to infectious diseases is mostly thought to be due to an impairment of both innate and adaptive immune responses and vitamin D deficiency. Several cofactors can indirectly favour the onset and/or worsening of infectious diseases, such as impairment of respiratory mechanics, skin and subcutaneous tissue homoeostasis, obesity-related comorbidities and inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. Subjects with obesity have a higher incidence of cutaneous infections, probably due to changes in skin barrier functions and wound healing. Excess weight is also associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infection and its recurrence, as well as with a higher prevalence of both lower and higher respiratory tract infections. Moreover, patients with obesity appear to have an increased risk of surgical site infections when undergoing general, orthopaedic, gynaecological, and bariatric surgery. Data concerning the different infectious diseases related to obesity are rather limited since anthropometric parameters are usually poorly recorded. Furthermore, specific therapeutic protocols in subjects with obesity are lacking, especially regarding antibiotic therapy and further supplements. This review summarizes etiopathogenetic and epidemiological evidence and highlights areas of uncertainty in the field of infectious diseases and obesity, which require further research.

38962577,Advances in Bacterial Lysate Immunotherapy for Infectious Diseases and Cancer.,"Antigenic cell fragments, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and other immunostimulants in bacterial lysates or extracts may induce local and systemic immune responses in specific and nonspecific paradigms. Based on current knowledge, this review aimed to determine whether bacterial lysate has comparable functions in infectious diseases and cancer treatment. In infectious diseases, including respiratory and urinary tract infections, immune system activation by bacterial lysate can identify and combat pathogens. Commercially available bacterial lysates, including OM-85, Ismigen, Lantigen B, and LW 50020, were effective in children and adults in treating respiratory tract infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rhinitis, and rhinosinusitis with varying degrees of success. Moreover, OM-89, Uromune, Urovac, Urivac, and ExPEC4V showed therapeutic benefits in controlling urinary tract infections in adults, especially women. Bacterial lysate-based therapeutics are safe, well-tolerated, and have few side effects, making them a good alternative for infectious disease management. Furthermore, a nonspecific immunomodulation by bacterial lysates may stimulate innate immunity, benefiting cancer treatment. ""Coley's vaccine"" has been used to treat sarcomas, carcinomas, lymphomas, melanomas, and myelomas with varying outcomes. Later, several similar bacterial lysate-based therapeutics have been developed to treat cancers, including bladder cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and myeloma; among them, BCG for in situ bladder cancer is well-known. Proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-<i>α</i>, may activate bacterial antigen-specific adaptive responses that could restore tumor antigen recognition and response by tumor-specific type 1 helper cells and cytotoxic T cells; therefore, bacterial lysates are worth investigating as a vaccination adjuvants or add-on therapies for several cancers.",Journal of immunology research,2024-,"Rahman MM, Grice ID, Ulett GC, Wei MQ",4,1943,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33527632,Emerging infectious disease: An underappreciated area of strategic concern for food security.,"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) increasingly threaten global food security and public health. Despite technological breakthroughs, we are losing the battle with (re)emerging diseases as treatment costs and production losses rise. A horizon scan of diseases of crops, livestock, seafood and food-borne illness suggests these costs are unsustainable. The paradigm of coevolution between pathogens and particular hosts teaches that emerging diseases occur only when pathogens evolve specific capacities that allow them to move to new hosts. EIDs ought to be rare and unpredictable, so crisis response is the best we can do. Alternatively, the Stockholm Paradigm suggests that the world is full of susceptible but unexposed hosts that pathogens could infect, given the opportunity. Global climate change, globalized trade and travel, urbanization and land-use changes (often associated with biodiversity loss) increase those opportunities, making EID frequent. We can, however, anticipate their arrival in new locations and their behaviour once they have arrived. We can 'find them before they find us', mitigating their impacts.

The number of disparate ecological parameters and pathogens affected by climate change are vast and expansive. Disentangling the complex relationship between these variables is critical for the development of effective countermeasures against its effects. The pathogen Vibrio vulnificus, a naturally occurring aquatic bacterium that causes fulminant septicemia, represents a quintessential climate-sensitive organism. In this review, we use V. vulnificus as a model organism to elucidate the intricate network of interactions between climatic factors and pathogens, with the objective of identifying common patterns by which climate change is affecting their disease burden. Recent findings indicate that in regions native to V. vulnificus or related pathogens, climate-driven natural disasters are the chief contributors to their disease outbreaks. Concurrently, climate change is increasing the environmental suitability of areas non-endemic to their diseases, promoting a surge in their natural populations and transmission dynamics, thus elevating the risk of new outbreaks. We highlight potential risk factors and climatic drivers aggravating the threat of V. vulnificus transmission under both scenarios and propose potential measures for mitigating its impact. By defining the mechanisms by which climate change influences V. vulnificus disease burden, we aim to shed light on the transmission dynamics of related disease-causing agents, thereby laying the groundwork for early warning systems and broadly applicable control measures.",PLoS pathogens,2024-Dec,"Jayakumar JM, Martinez-Urtaza J, Brumfield KD, Jutla AS, Colwell RR, Cordero OX, Almagro-Moreno S",7,1714,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
35676809,Application of Nanopore Sequencing Technology in the Clinical Diagnosis of Infectious Diseases.,"Infectious diseases are an enormous public health burden and a growing threat to human health worldwide. Emerging or classic recurrent pathogens, or pathogens with resistant traits, challenge our ability to diagnose and control infectious diseases. Nanopore sequencing technology has the potential to enhance our ability to diagnose, interrogate, and track infectious diseases due to the unrestricted read length and system portability. This review focuses on the application of nanopore sequencing technology in the clinical diagnosis of infectious diseases and includes the following: (i) a brief introduction to nanopore sequencing technology and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platforms; (ii) strategies for nanopore-based sequencing technologies; and (iii) applications of nanopore sequencing technology in monitoring emerging pathogenic microorganisms, molecular detection of clinically relevant drug-resistance genes, and characterization of disease-related microbial communities. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, potential opportunities, and future outlook for applying nanopore sequencing technology in the diagnosis of infectious diseases.",Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES,2022-May,"Zhang LL, Zhang C, Peng JP",3,1175,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
32384901,Bibliometric analysis of peer-reviewed literature on climate change and human health with an emphasis on infectious diseases.,"Assessing research activity is important for planning future protective and adaptive policies. The objective of the current study was to assess research activity on climate change and health with an emphasis on infectious diseases. A bibliometric method was applied using SciVerse Scopus. Documents on climate change and human health were called ""health-related literature"" while documents on climate change and infectious diseases were called ""infection-related literature"". The study period was from 1980 to 2019. The search query found 4247 documents in the health-related literature and 1207 in the infection-related literature. The growth of publications showed a steep increase after 2007. There were four research themes in the health-related literature: (1) climate change and infectious diseases; (2) climate change, public health and food security; (3) heat waves, mortality, and non-communicable diseases; and (4) climate change, air pollution, allergy, and respiratory health. The most frequently encountered pathogens/infectious diseases in the infection-related literature were malaria and dengue. Documents in infection-related literature had a higher h-index than documents in the health-related literature. The top-cited documents in the health-related literature focused on food security, public health, and infectious diseases while those in infection-related literature focused on water-, vector-, and mosquito-borne diseases. The European region had the highest contribution in health-related literature (n = 1626; 38.3%) and infection-related literature (n = 497; 41.2%). The USA led with 1235 (29.1%) documents in health-related literature and 365 (30.2%) documents in infection-related literature. The Australian National University ranked first in the health-related literature while the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ranked first in the infection-related literature. International research collaboration was inadequate. Documents published in the Environmental Health Perspectives journal received the highest citations per document. A total of 1416 (33.3%) documents in the health-related literature were funded while 419 (34.7%) documents in the infection-related literature were funded. Research on climate change and human health is on the rise with research on infection-related issues making a good share. International research collaboration should be funded and supported. Future research needs to focus on the impact of climate change on psychosocial, mental, innovations, policies, and preparedness of health systems.",Globalization and health,2020-May,Sweileh WM,1,2568,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

In addition to causing arctic ice melting and extreme weather events, climatologic factors are linked strongly to the transmission of many infectious diseases. Changes in the prevalence of infectious diseases not only reflect the impacts of temperature, humidity, and other weather-related phenomena on pathogens, vectors, and animal hosts but are also part of a complex of social and environmental factors that will be affected by climate change, including land use, migration, and vector control. Vector- and waterborne diseases and coccidioidomycosis are all likely to be affected by a warming planet; there is also potential for climate-driven impacts on emerging infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance.

39481208,Intrapartum antibiotic exposure and infectious diseases in childhood - a population-based cohort study.,"Intrapartum antibiotics are used to prevent group B streptococcus disease in newborn infants. We hypothesised that intrapartum antibiotic exposure is associated with the occurrence of childhood infectious diseases because it influences the development of the gut microbiome. The cohort for this population-based study comprised vaginally delivered children born in Northern Finland in 2007-2018. We used structured electronic medical records linked to comprehensive national registers. Primary outcome was the number of infectious disease episodes leading to an emergency room visit, outpatient hospital visit, or hospitalisation from birth until five years of age. Analyses were performed on 9733 children (48.8% girls) exposed to intrapartum antibiotics and on 35,842 unexposed children (49.9% girls). Exposure to intrapartum antibiotics was associated with increased risk of any infectious disease episode at the ages 7-28 days (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 1.30, 95% CI 1.10-1.54) and 1-2 years (aIRR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18). The occurrence of urinary tract infections was associated with the exposure to intrapartum antibiotics whereas the occurrence of severe infections caused by pathogens susceptible to penicillin was reversely associated with the exposure to intrapartum antibiotics. Maternal intrapartum antibiotics were associated with the occurrence of infectious diseases in the offspring. The observed associations appeared to depend on bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility to penicillin. Pediatric Research Foundation, Alma och K.A.

34242196,Infectious diseases screening approach among refugees: results from a single-center study.,"Our aim was to evaluate a screening program, with active case-finding and treatment for active tuberculosis (TB), latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), blood-borne viruses (BBV), and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among refugees living in facility centers. We collected data on refugees arriving to our attention in migrant centers in Sardinia, Italy. Socio-demographical data, anamnesis, and clinical features were collected. TST Mantoux was conducted, and X-ray chest (XRC) was performed if TST was positive. Blood-borne virus screening was proposed to all patients. Screening for STDs was offered according to guidelines, anamnesis, and physical examination. Eighty-one patients were included. Seventy (86.4%) were male, and the mean age was 24.8±5.7 years. Thirty-three (40.7%) had scabies. Overall, 40/81 (49.4%) had a positive TST Mantoux. One (2.5%) was hospitalized and died for multi-drug-resistant TB. One (2.5%) patient had intestinal-TB. 52/81 (64.2%) refused HIV screening, whereas no positivity was found among tested migrants. Sixty-two (76.5%) accepted HCV screening, and one (1.6%) had a positive test. Fifty-eight (71.6%%) accepted HBV testing, and 29 (50%) of them had positive serology. Ten (12.3%) patients had anal or genital lesions due to syphilis, Molluscum contagiosum, and HPV in 7 (70%), 2 (20%), and one (10%) case, respectively. Infectious diseases control and prevention are a key strategy among refugees. The stay in a migrant center is an extraordinary occasion for healthcare provision. This condition could allow a broad screening program in which quick BBV screening tests could be a good method to implement uptake.

We found that human respiratory infectious diseases other than COVID-19 decreased by an average of 54.7% after NPIs were introduced. On the basis of that trend, we estimated that annual medical expenses associated with respiratory infections other than COVID-19 also decreased by 3.8% in 2020 and 18.9% in 2021. However, human gastrointestinal infectious diseases and livestock diseases exhibited similar or even higher incidence rates after NPIs were instituted.

Rising population, increase in number of urban poverty, low government spending (in terms of % of GDP) on health, dwindling health indicators are some of the immediate concerns. Apart from this, the region is facing a dual burden of diseases, where the communicable diseases are still responsible for substantial portion of deaths, burden of non-communicable diseases is steadily increasing. These changes are explained by four main stages of epidemiological transition. Movement through these stages has resulted in a dramatic shift in the cause of death from infectious diseases and malnutrition in the first stage to cardio-vascular diseases (CVDs) and cancers in most high-income countries over the last two centuries.

An intake of placebo, 200 mg, or 600 mg of LF were administered to healthy adults in Kyushu University of Health and Welfare for 12 weeks in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled parallel-group comparative trial. The primary endpoints were the prevalence and duration of infectious diseases and changes in immune parameters. Three hundred and ten subjects were randomized (placebo, n = 104; 200 mg, n = 103; 600 mg, n = 103). Twenty subjects were lost to the follow-up, leaving 290 for a full analysis set (n = 99; n = 95; n = 96). The duration (day) of total infectious diseases was shorter in the 200 mg group (2.0, p = 0.045) and 600 mg group (2.0, p = 0.010) than in the placebo group (3.0). The duration of summer colds was shorter in the 600 mg group (2.0, p = 0.036) than in the placebo group (3.0). No significant differences were observed in the prevalence of infectious diseases or changes in immune parameters. In exploratory investigations, changes in the neutrophil phagocytic capacity, cortisol concentrations, and T score of ""Vigor/Activity"" in the Profile of Mood States 2 were greater in the 600 mg group than in the placebo group, when analysis was done on the lower half groups at the baseline.

34111134,"Which public health interventions are effective in reducing morbidity, mortality and health inequalities from infectious diseases amongst children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs): An umbrella review.","Despite significant progress in the last few decades, infectious diseases remain a major threat to child health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)-particularly amongst more disadvantaged groups. It is imperative to understand the best available evidence concerning which public health interventions reduce morbidity, mortality and health inequalities in children aged under five years. To address this gap, we carried out an umbrella review (a systematic reviews of reviews) to identify evidence on the effects of public health interventions (promotion, protection, prevention) on morbidity, mortality and/or health inequalities due to infectious diseases amongst children in LMICs. Ten databases were searched for records published between 2014-2021 alongside a manual search of gray literature. Articles were quality-assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews tool (AMSTAR 2). A narrative synthesis was conducted. We identified 60 systematic reviews synthesizing 453 individual primary studies. A majority of the reviews reported on preventive interventions (n = 48), with a minority on promotion (n = 17) and almost no reviews covering health protection interventions (n = 2). Effective interventions for improving child health across the whole population, as well as the most disadvantaged included communication, education and social mobilization for specific preventive services or tools, such as immunization or bed nets. For all other interventions, the effects were either unclear, unknown or detrimental, either at the overall population level or regarding health inequalities. We found few reviews reporting health inequalities information and the quality of the evidence base was generally low.

36430676,ILCs-Crucial Players in Enteric Infectious Diseases.,"Research of the last decade has remarkably increased our understanding of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). ILCs, in analogy to T helper (Th) cells and their cytokine and transcription factor profile, are categorized into three distinct populations: ILC1s express the transcription factor T-bet and secrete IFNγ, ILC2s depend on the expression of GATA-3 and release IL-5 and IL-13, and ILC3s express RORγt and secrete IL-17 and IL-22. Noteworthy, ILCs maintain a level of plasticity, depending on exposed cytokines and environmental stimuli. Furthermore, ILCs are tissue resident cells primarily localized at common entry points for pathogens such as the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They have the unique capacity to initiate rapid responses against pathogens, provoked by changes of the cytokine profile of the respective tissue. Moreover, they regulate tissue inflammation and homeostasis. In case of intracellular pathogens entering the mucosal tissue, ILC1s respond by secreting cytokines (e.g., IFNγ) to limit the pathogen spread. Upon infection with helminths, intestinal epithelial cells produce alarmins (e.g., IL-25) and activate ILC2s to secrete IL-13, which induces differentiation of intestinal stem cells into tuft and goblet cells, important for parasite expulsion. Additionally, during bacterial infection ILC3-derived IL-22 is required for bacterial clearance by regulating antimicrobial gene expression in epithelial cells. Thus, ILCs can limit infectious diseases via secretion of inflammatory mediators and interaction with other cell types. In this review, we will address the role of ILCs during enteric infectious diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022-Nov,"Leupold T, Wirtz S",2,1651,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

40098944,Migrations in Latin America: the corridor to the American dream is a public health problem.,"Migrant movements have tripled, and it is evident throughout the Americas. On the way to North America, people come from South America, the Caribbean, mainly Haiti, Cuba, Asia, and Africa. People migrate for work, study, humanitarian situations, poverty, violence in their territories, lifestyle change, or family reunification. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of most frequent infectious conditions of the population exposed to migratory movement through the Americas. The present review focuses on the leading infectious diseases migrants acquired during the arduous journey through the tropical areas. Official migration web sides, journals, and scientific journals were used to get information. Some infectious diseases have re-emerged in transit countries used by migrants, and the increase in migratory phenomena, triggered cases of HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, arbovirosis, Malaria, and hepatitis, among others. Migrants suffer infectious diseases as they pass the countries to the USA; besides, they suffer violence and even sexual assault. The receiving countries should establish public policies to regularize the access of migrants to health services, which include preventive programs and easily accessible vaccination plans. Some of the pathologies suffered by migrants are preventable, although there are groups of populations in extreme social conditions and with compromised nutritional status. The need to establish a primary medical care center to apply an innovative border and transnational protocols for infectious diseases for migrant populations is highlighted.","Revista de salud publica (Bogota, Colombia)",2024-Jun,"Camargo-Assis F, Lopez-Mejia Y, Salim-Mattar A, Salim-Mattar",4,1593,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
32650013,Infectious disease antibodies for biomedical applications: A mini review of immune antibody phage library repertoire.,"Antibody phage display is regarded as a critical tool for the development of monoclonal antibodies for infectious diseases. The different classes of antibody libraries are classified based on the source of repertoire used to generate the libraries. Immune antibody libraries are generated from disease infected host or immunization against an infectious agent. Antibodies derived from immune libraries are distinct from those derived from naïve libraries as the host's in vivo immune mechanisms shape the antibody repertoire to yield high affinity antibodies. As the immune system is constantly evolving in accordance to the health state of an individual, immune libraries can offer more than just infection-specific antibodies but also antibodies derived from the memory B-cells much like naïve libraries. The combinatorial nature of the gene cloning process would give rise to a combination of natural and un-natural antibody gene pairings in the immune library. These factors have a profound impact on the coverage of immune antibody libraries to target both disease-specific and non-disease specific antigens. This review looks at the diverse nature of antibody responses for immune library generation and discusses the extended potential of a disease-specified immune library in the context of phage display.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2020-Nov,"Lai JY, Lim TS",2,1313,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
32048110,Are infectious diseases risk factors for sarcoidosis or a result of reverse causation? Findings from a population-based nested case-control study.,"Findings from molecular studies suggesting that several infectious agents cause sarcoidosis are intriguing yet conflicting and likely biased due to their cross-sectional design. As done in other inflammatory diseases to overcome this issue, prospectively-collected register data could be used, but reverse causation is a threat when the onset of disease is difficult to establish. We investigated the association between infectious diseases and sarcoidosis to understand if they are etiologically related. We conducted a nested case-control study (2009-2013) using incident sarcoidosis cases from the Swedish National Patient Register (n = 4075) and matched general population controls (n = 40,688). Infectious disease was defined using inpatient/outpatient visits and/or antimicrobial dispensations starting 3 years before diagnosis/matching. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of sarcoidosis were estimated using conditional logistic regression and tested for robustness assuming the presence of reverse causation bias. The aOR of sarcoidosis associated with history of infectious disease was 1.19 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09, 1.29; 21% vs. 16% exposed cases and controls, respectively). Upper respiratory and ocular infections conferred the highest OR. Findings were similar when we altered the infection definition or varied the infection-sarcoidosis latency period (1-7 years). In bias analyses assuming one in 10 infections occurred because of preclinical sarcoidosis, the observed association was completely attenuated (aOR 1.02; 95% CI 0.90, 1.15). Our findings, likely induced by reverse causation due to preclinical sarcoidosis, do not support the hypothesis that common symptomatic infectious diseases are etiologically linked to sarcoidosis. Caution for reverse causation bias is required when the real disease onset is unknown.",European journal of epidemiology,2020-Nov,"Rossides M, Kullberg S, Askling J, Eklund A, Grunewald J, Di Giuseppe D, Arkema EV",7,1839,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34815507,Socioeconomic variation of multimorbidity in Colombian older adults.,"Multimorbidity (MM) prevalence among older adults is increasing worldwide. Variations regarding the socioeconomic characteristics of the individuals and their context have been described, mostly in high-income settings. However, further research is needed to understand the effect of the coexistence of infectious diseases along with socioeconomic factors regarding MM. This study aims to examine the variation of MM regarding infectious diseases mortality after adjusting for socioeconomic factors. A cross-sectional multilevel study with a nationally representative sample of 17,571 Colombian adults of 60 years of age or older was conducted. Individual socioeconomic, demographic, childhood and health related characteristics, as well as group level variables (multidimensional poverty index and infectious diseases mortality rate) were analyzed. A two-level stepwise structural equation model was used to simultaneously adjust for the individual and contextual effects. Multimorbidity prevalence was 62.3% (95% CI 61.7-62.9). In the multilevel adjusted models, age, female sex, having functional limitations, non-white ethnicity, high body mass index, higher income, physical inactivity and living in urban areas were associated with multimorbidity among the sample for this study. The median odds ratio for multidimensional poverty was 1.18 (1.16-1.19; p = 0.008) and for infectious diseases was 1.25 (1.22-1.28; p = 0.014). This paper demonstrates that MM varies regarding the mortality of infectious diseases and shows a strong association between MM and poverty in a low-middle income country. Differences in the factors involved in the etiology of multimorbidity are expected among wealthy and poor countries regarding availability and prioritization of health services.",Scientific reports,2021-Nov,"Ballesteros SM, Moreno-Montoya J, Grooten WJA, Barrera-López P, De la Hoz-Valle JA",5,1779,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
36011854,Infectious Diseases Associated with Hydrometeorological Hazards in Europe: Disaster Risk Reduction in the Context of the Climate Crisis and the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Hydrometeorological hazards comprise a wide range of events, mainly floods, storms, droughts, and temperature extremes. Floods account for the majority of the related disasters in both developed and developing countries. Flooding alters the natural balance of the environment and frequently establish a favorable habitat for pathogens and vectors to thrive. Diseases caused by pathogens that require vehicle transmission from host to host (waterborne) or a host/vector as part of their life cycle (vector-borne) are those most likely to be affected by flooding. Considering the most notable recent destructive floods events of July 2021 that affected several Central Europe countries, we conducted a systematic literature review in order to identify documented sporadic cases and outbreaks of infectious diseases in humans in Europe, where hydrometeorological hazards, mainly floods, were thought to have been involved. The occurrence of water-, rodent-, and vector-borne diseases in several European countries is highlighted, as flooding and the harsh post-flood conditions favor their emergence and transmission. In this context, strategies for prevention and management of infectious disease outbreaks in flood-prone and flood-affected areas are also proposed and comprise pre- and post-flood prevention measures, pre- and post-outbreak prevention measures, as well as mitigation actions when an infectious disease outbreak finally occurs. Emphasis is also placed on the collision of floods, flood-related infectious disease outbreaks, and the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, which may result in unprecedented multi-hazard conditions and requires a multi-hazard approach for the effective disaster management and risk reduction.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022-Aug,"Mavrouli M, Mavroulis S, Lekkas E, Tsakris A",4,1727,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
36348272,Can breeders prevent pathogen adaptation when selecting for increased resistance to infectious diseases?,"Recent research shows that genetic selection has high potential to reduce the prevalence of infectious diseases in livestock. However, like all interventions that target infectious diseases, genetic selection of livestock can exert selection pressure on pathogen populations. Such selection on the pathogen may lead to escape strategies and reduce the effect of selection of livestock for disease resistance. Thus, to successfully breed livestock for lower disease prevalence, it is essential to develop strategies that prevent the invasion of pathogen mutants that escape host resistance. Here we investigate the conditions under which such ""escape mutants"" can replace wild-type pathogens in a closed livestock population using a mathematical model of disease transmission. Assuming a single gene that confers sufficient resistance, results show that genetic selection for resistance in livestock typically leads to an ""invasion window"" within which an escape mutant of the pathogen can invade. The bounds of the invasion window are determined by the frequency of resistant hosts in the population. The lower bound occurs when the escape mutant has an advantage over the wild-type pathogen in the population. The upper bound occurs when local eradication of the pathogen is expected. The invasion window is smallest when host resistance is strong and when infection with the wild-type pathogen provides cross immunity to infection with the escape mutant. To minimise opportunities for pathogens to adapt, under the assumptions of our model, the aim of disease control through genetic selection should be to achieve herd-level eradication of the infection faster than the rate of emergence of escape mutants of the pathogen. Especially for microparasitic infections, this could be achieved by placing animals into herds according to their genetic resistance, such that these herds stay completely out of the invasion window. In contrast to classical breeding theory, our model suggests that multi-trait selection with gradual improvement of each trait of the breeding goal might not be the best strategy when resistance to infectious disease is part of the breeding goal. Temporally, combining genetic selection with other interventions helps to make the invasion window smaller, and thereby reduces the risk of invasion of escape mutants.","Genetics, selection, evolution : GSE",2022-Nov,"Hulst AD, Bijma P, De Jong MCM",3,2340,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Therefore, extensive studies have been reported to develop MIPs/SIPs for the detection of infectious diseases with high selectivity and reliability. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of recognition events between imprinted polymers with different biomarkers, such as signaling molecules, microbial toxins, viruses, and bacterial and fungal cells. Then, various preparation methods of MIPs/SIPs for electrochemical biosensors are summarized. Especially, the methods of electropolymerization and micro-contact imprinting are emphasized.

37967881,Effective Vaccination and Education Strategies for Emerging Infectious Diseases Such as COVID-19.,"Social isolation and control owing to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are easing; however, concerns regarding new infectious diseases have not disappeared. Given epidemic experiences such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the influenza pandemic, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19, it is necessary to prepare for the outbreak of new infectious diseases and situations in which large-scale vaccinations are required. Although the development of vaccines against COVID-19 has contributed greatly to overcoming the pandemic, concerning vaccine side effects from the general public, including medical personnel, and decreased confidence in vaccine efficacy and side effects, present many challenges in promoting and educating vaccinations for new infectious diseases in the future. In addition to plans to develop vaccines for the outbreak of new infectious diseases, education and promotion plans are necessary to administer the latest developments of vaccines to the general public. Moreover, efforts are needed to secure the necessity, legitimacy, and evidence for rapid vaccination on a large scale at the national level. It is also necessary to carefully prepare scientific bases and explanatory statements so that the general public can easily understand them. This study aimed to establish vaccine strategies and vaccination education plans for new infectious diseases that may occur in the future. Many ways to promote vaccination to the general public and healthcare workers should be prepared to ensure that the latest vaccines against new infectious diseases are administered safely. Thus, education and promotion of vaccine efficacy and safety based on specific data from clinical studies are necessary.",Journal of Korean medical science,2023-Nov,"Wie SH, Jung J, Kim WJ",3,1745,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

We first describe the long-term aging-profile of the population by describing the pattern and stability of equilibrium of the demographic model. We also investigate the disease transmission dynamics, using the epidemic model when the population reaches the positive equilibrium (limiting equation). We establish conditions for the existence, uniqueness and global stability of the disease endemic equilibrium. We then prove the global stability of the endemic equilibrium for the original epidemic model with varying population demographics. The global stability of the endemic equilibrium allows us to examine the effects of reproduction ageing and rate, under different family planning strategies, on the childhood infectious disease transmission dynamics. We also examine demographic distribution, diseases reproductive number, infant disease rate and age distribution of disease, and as such, the work can be potentially used to inform targeted age group for optimal vaccine booster programs.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2020-Nov,"Su Q, Wu J",2,1278,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

In our evaluation, we sought to catalog and quantify information delivered to members of Congress that would enable them to determine their level of concern about emerging infectious disease (EID) risk and direct a course of action. We examined hearings on EID from 1995 through 2019 as a proxy for congressional awareness of EID risk, searching the Congressional Record using keywords. During this timeframe, Congress conducted 167 hearings relevant to EID, encompassing 860 witness appearances. The most active House and Senate committees were those with jurisdiction over homeland security, health, oversight, and funding. There was a markedly lower level of activity among committees with jurisdiction over foreign relations, financial services, small business, agriculture, and every other relevant area of jurisdiction.

Patients with a fever of unknown origin (FUO) were evaluated to determine the etiology. In this study, 110 cases with FUO who were admitted to two hospitals with a total of 800 beds, in which 5000 daily outpatient patients were admitted between 2006 and 2016 have been evaluated retrospectively. Anamnesis and the findings were obtained from hospital records. Patients with a temperature higher than 38.3°C and lasting three weeks or longer without diagnosis despite one week of investigation in the hospital were included as FUO cases in this study. Nosocomial and neutropenic cases were excluded from the present study. Fifty-seven patients were male (52%), and the mean age was 40.2 ± 17.2. The distribution of the classic and HIV-associated cases was 85 (77.3%) and 18 (16.4%). Tuberculosis (TB) was the most frequent disease in both groups. The etiology was infectious in 68.2%, autoimmune in 14.5%, and neoplastic in 5.4%. There was no case of collagen vascular disease in the HIV-associated FUO group. As a result of our study, infectious diseases and TB were still the leading factors that caused FUO. TB has been notably found higher in the HIV-associated group than the classic group. FUO is usually either a rare cause or an unusual clinical presentation of a well-known infectious disease in Turkey. Therefore, it should be noted that various manifestations of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis may be considered a FUO case.",Hospital practice (1995),2022-Aug,"Karabela ŞN, Kart Yasar K",2,1539,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

37489781,The Utilization and Development of Viral Vectors in Vaccines as a Prophylactic Treatment Against Ebola Virus as an Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Disease.,"Alongside the prescription of commonly used antivirals, such as acyclovir, remdesivir, oseltamivir, and ciprofloxacin, the most efficient way to prevent or treat communicable diseases is by vaccination. Vaccines have been the most efficient way to prevent or treat highly transmissible infectious agents, such as Ebola, Anthrax, and Dengue Fever. Most epidemics of these highly transmissible infectious agents occur in places, such as South America, Central America, Tropical Asia, and Africa, where the availability of resources and access to adequate healthcare are limited. However, recent events in history have proven that even with access to resources and proper healthcare, those in firstworld countries are not invincible when it comes to infectious diseases and epidemics. The Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa highlighted the gaps in therapeutic advancement and readiness and led to the rapid development of novel vaccine approaches. Viral vectors, in the case of the Ebola vaccine the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), can be safely used to activate or initiate the innate adaptive immune response to protect against viral infection. When developed properly and with extensive study, novel vaccine approaches allow physicians and health experts to control the rate at which viruses spread or prevent transmission. This review will discuss the advantages of viral vector vaccines, their chemistry and development, and the pathophysiology of the Ebola virus to develop advantageous and efficacious treatments.",Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,2024-,"Garcia A, Grundmann O",2,1520,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

We compared disease burdens between the pandemic and pre-pandemic year of 2020 (with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)) and 2010 (without NPIs), respectively, to understand the overall pandemic impact on NIDs in Taiwan. Forty-three national NIDs were analyzed using the Statistics of Communicable Diseases and Surveillance Report by estimating the premature death and disability <i>via</i> different transmission categories, sex, and age groups. The study evaluated the impact of diseases by assessing the years lost due to death (YLLs), the duration of living with disability (YLDs), and the overall disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by measuring both the severity of the illness and its duration. Taiwan recorded 1,577 (2010) and 1,260 (2020) DALYs per million population and lost 43 NIDs, decreasing 317 DALYs per million population. Tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and acute hepatitis B/D were the leading causes of DALYs, accounting for 89% (2010) and 77% (2020).

39147369,Mortality Associated with Infectious Diseases in Dutch Nursing Homes.,"Although older people in nursing homes have a larger susceptibility to infectious diseases, the extent to which infectious diseases contribute to their mortality is unknown. Therefore, we quantified the associations between seasonal infectious diseases and all-cause mortality in Dutch nursing homes. We analyzed time series (January 2009 to December 2021) of the weekly sentinel surveillance of infectious diseases in Dutch nursing homes. A generalized linear model with binomial distribution and identity link was used to associate the proportion of all-cause mortality with the incidence of infections: COVID-19 (2020-2021), gastroenteritis (GE), influenza-like illness (ILI), and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) at 0- to 4-week time-lags (mortality incidence at 0 to 4 weeks after infections incidence). Over 13 years, 81 nursing homes participated, with 20 to 35 homes each year (mean: 26). A total of 11,555 all-cause deaths occurred over 1,864,667 resident weeks, averaging a mortality incidence of 6.2 per 1000 resident weeks. All 4 tested infectious diseases exhibited a significant association with all-cause mortality in nursing homes (P ≤ .01). Collectively, these infectious diseases were associated with 18.6% (95% CI, 17.8%-19.3%) of all deaths. The association between mortality and ILI was significant in 7 of 12 ILI seasons. Yearly mortality associated with the specific infectious diseases was as follows: LRTI (10.2%; 95% CI, 9.6%-10.8%), ILI (8.2%; 95% CI, 7.5%-8.9%) (over the 7 of 12 significant seasons), COVID-19 (6.5%; 95% CI, 5.4%-7.7%) (over 2019-2021 as there was no previous SARS-CoV-2 circulation), and GE (2.3%; 95% CI, 2.0%-2.5%). In nursing homes, the occurrence of seasonal respiratory and gastrointestinal infections is associated with nearly one-fifth of all-cause deaths.

39270469,Preparing the developing world for the next pandemic: Evidence from China's R&D blueprint for emerging infectious diseases.,"With double pressures of endemic and imported emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), China's ability to detect, prevent and control the unknown virus is of regional and global interest. This study aimed to establish an R&D Blueprint for EIDs in China by identifying the list of prioritized diseases and medical countermeasures (MCMs) that need proactive actions for the next pandemic. The process mainly referred to the World Health Organization's prioritization methodology, supplemented by pipeline landscape, rapid risk assessment and multi-dimensional analysis. The study included five steps: 1) identifying potential pathogens, 2) screening into the long list, 3) prioritizing the long list, 4) identifying the final list and 5) generating an R&D Blueprint. China's R&D Blueprint identified 14 viral pathogens and two virus groups (i.e., Influenza HxNy and Coronavirus X) for proactive and representative MCM development. At least one diagnostic candidate in preclinical study, and one therapeutic and one vaccine candidate in Phase I/II clinical trials for each prioritized pathogen were suggested to be developed as strategic national stockpiles. Various generalized and innovative platform technologies were also highlighted for enhancing overall capacities of EID preparedness and response, covering basic research, experiment, detection, prevention and control, surveillance and information sharing. This is the first study in developing countries that established an R&D Blueprint of prioritized diseases, countermeasures and technologies. Our findings could help to drive pre-emptive scientific and technological actions toward emerging pathogens that may cause the next epidemic and could provide evidence-based strategies for developing countries to establish their national health research agenda tailored to health and research context under resource-limited settings.",Journal of infection and public health,2024-Oct,"Ma J, Li C, Cui Y, Xu L, Chen N, Wang R, Gao X, Liu Z, Huang Y",9,1882,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

We applied the prioritisation method recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to rank infectious diseases, according to their relative importance for surveillance and public health, to inform future public health action in Belgium. We applied the multi-criteria-decision-analysis approach. A working group of epidemiologists and statisticians from Belgium (n = 6) designed a balanced set of prioritisation criteria. A panel of Belgian experts (n = 80) allocated in an online survey each criteria a weight, according to perceived relative importance. Next, experts (n = 37) scored each disease against each criteria in an online survey, guided by disease-specific factsheets referring the period 2010-2016 in Belgium. The weighted sum of the criteria's scores composed the final weighted score per disease, on which the ranking was based. Sensitivity analyses quantified the impact of eight alternative analysis scenarios on the top-20 ranked diseases. We identified criteria and diseases associated with data-gaps as those with the highest number of blank answers in the scoring survey. Principle components of the final weighted score were identified. Working groups selected 98 diseases and 18 criteria, structured in five criteria groups. The diseases ranked highest were (in order) pertussis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis C and hepatitis B. Among the five criteria groups, overall the highest weights were assigned to 'impact on the patient', followed by 'impact on public health', while different perceptions were identified between clinicians, microbiologists and epidemiologists. Among the 18 individual criteria, 'spreading potential' and 'events requiring public health action' were assigned the highest weights. Principle components clustered with thematic disease groups. Notable data gaps were found among hospital-related diseases. We ranked infectious diseases using a standardised reproducible approach. The diseases ranked highest are included in current public health programs, but additional reflection for example about needs among risk groups is recommended. Cross-reference of the obtained ranking with current programs is needed to verify whether resources and activities map priority areas. We recommend to implement this method in a recurrent evaluation cycle of national public health priorities.",BMC public health,2021-Jan,"Klamer S, Van Goethem N, Thomas D, Duysburgh E, Braeye T, Quoilin S",6,2478,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33444390,Source identification of infectious diseases in networks via label ranking.,"Outbreaks of infectious diseases would cause great losses to the human society. Source identification in networks has drawn considerable interest in order to understand and control the infectious disease propagation processes. Unsatisfactory accuracy and high time complexity are major obstacles to practical applications under various real-world situations for existing source identification algorithms. This study attempts to measure the possibility for nodes to become the infection source through label ranking. A unified Label Ranking framework for source identification with complete observation and snapshot is proposed. Firstly, a basic label ranking algorithm with complete observation of the network considering both infected and uninfected nodes is designed. Our inferred infection source node with the highest label ranking tends to have more infected nodes surrounding it, which makes it likely to be in the center of infection subgraph and far from the uninfected frontier. A two-stage algorithm for source identification via semi-supervised learning and label ranking is further proposed to address the source identification issue with snapshot. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world network datasets. It turns out that the proposed label ranking algorithms are capable of identifying the propagation source under different situations fairly accurately with acceptable computational complexity without knowing the underlying model of infection propagation. The effectiveness and efficiency of the label ranking algorithms proposed in this study make them be of practical value for infection source identification.",PloS one,2021-,"Zhou J, Jiang Y, Huang B",3,1659,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
36634551,The differential expression of toll like receptors and RIG-1 correlates to the severity of infectious diseases.,"The toll like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-1 are proteins involved in the initial reaction of the innate immune system to infectious diseases and, thus, can provide much information to the surgical pathologist in terms of the molecular dynamics of the infection. The TLRs (TLR1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8) and RIG-1 distribution as determined by immunohistochemistry was examined in the following diseases: human papillomavirus (n = 30 including 15 squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL), 5 cancers, and 10 controls); molluscum contagiosum (n = 8 including 4 controls), SARS-CoV2 (n = 52 including 20 mild, 5 fatal, and 27 controls) and reovirus infection as oncolytic therapy. Mild, regressing infection (molluscum contagiosum, mild SARS-CoV2 and low grade SIL) each showed the same pattern: marked up regulation of at least three of the TLRs/RIG-1 with decreased expression of none compared to the controls. Severe infection (fatal SARS-CoV2, and cervical cancer) each showed marked decrease expression in at least three of the TLRs/RIG-1. We recently documented an equivalent marked decrease expression of the TLRs/RIG-1 in the placenta in fatal in utero infections. The reoviral infected tissues showed an overall pattern of marked increase expression of TLRs/RIG-1, consistent with a strong anti-viral response. Thus, the in situ testing of infectious diseases by a panel of these early infectious disease recognition proteins may allow the surgical pathologist to predict the outcome of the disease which, in turn, may assist in the understanding of the role of the TLRs/RIG-1 in determining the fate of a given infectious process.",Annals of diagnostic pathology,2023-Apr,"Rice M, Tili E, Loghmani H, Nuovo GJ",4,1621,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Taking in account the complexity of inflammasome activation and that several regulatory steps are involved in maintaining its physiologic role in homeostasis and innate immune response, it does not surprise that several genetic variants in inflammasome components have been associated with common pathologies in the general population, such as autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular diseases, obesity and associated metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Moreover, the susceptibility to infectious agents and/or to develop severe complications during infections also has been related to inflammasome genetics.

Given that children represent up to 10% of international travellers, it is critical to the health of all age groups to ensure that tailored guidance for children is considered in public health policy and guidelines, and pandemic responses. To further support pandemic preparedness, public health systems need to strengthen ties with communities and health systems. In addition, travel and migration issues need to be included as core competencies in medical education. Ensuring that clinicians who care for children have knowledge of travel and migration health will foster a better health outcome in an increasingly mobile population at risk of emerging infectious diseases.<b>Abbreviations</b> CDC: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; DGMQ: CDC Division of Global Migration and Quarantine; EID: emerging infectious diseases; EU: European Union; VFR: visiting friends and relatives; IOM: United Nations International Organization for Migration; LPR: lawful permanent resident; US: United States of America; WHO: World Health Organization.",Paediatrics and international child health,2021-Feb,"Dawson-Hahn EE, Pidaparti V, Hahn W, Stauffer W",4,1347,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
38713481,Association between ambient temperature and risk of notifiable infectious diseases in China from 2011 to 2019.,"Previous studies on temperature and infectious diseases primarily focused on individual disease types, yielding inconsistent conclusions. This study collected monthly data on notifiable infectious disease cases and meteorological variables across 7 provinces in China from 2011 to 2019. A distributed lag nonlinear model was used to evaluate the association between ambient temperature and infectious diseases within each province, and random meta-analysis was applied to evaluate the pooled effect. Extreme hot temperature (the 97.5th percentile) was positively associated with the risk of respiratory infectious diseases with the relative risk (RR) of 1.45 (95%CI: 1.01-2.08). Conversely, extreme cold temperature (the 2.5th percentile) was negatively associated with intestinal infectious diseases and zoonotic diseases and vector-borne diseases, reporting RRs of 0.43 (95%CI: 0.30-0.60) and 0.46 (95%CI: 0.38-0.57), respectively. This study described the nonlinear association between ambient temperature and infectious diseases with different transmission routes, informing comprehensive prevention and control strategies for temperature-related infectious diseases.",International journal of environmental health research,2025-Feb,"Wang W, Yang K, Li J, Jiang H, Zhang S, Lin Y, Zhang X, Jin M, Wang J, Tang M, Chen K",11,1171,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
38789528,Bridging the gap with multispecific immune cell engagers in cancer and infectious diseases.,"By binding to multiple antigens simultaneously, multispecific antibodies are expected to substantially improve both the activity and long-term efficacy of antibody-based immunotherapy. Immune cell engagers, a subclass of antibody-based constructs, consist of engineered structures designed to bridge immune effector cells to their target, thereby redirecting the immune response toward the tumor cells or infected cells. The increasing number of recent clinical trials evaluating immune cell engagers reflects the important role of these molecules in new therapeutic approaches for cancer and infections. In this review, we discuss how different immune cell types (T and natural killer lymphocytes, as well as myeloid cells) can be bound by immune cell engagers in immunotherapy for cancer and infectious diseases. Furthermore, we explore the preclinical and clinical advancements of these constructs, and we discuss the challenges in translating the current knowledge from cancer to the virology field. Finally, we speculate on the promising future directions that immune cell engagers may take in cancer treatment and antiviral therapy.",Cellular & molecular immunology,2024-Jul,"Rolin C, Zimmer J, Seguin-Devaux C",3,1138,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
35928814,Recent Advances in the Molecular Design and Delivery Technology of mRNA for Vaccination Against Infectious Diseases.,"Vaccines can prevent many millions of illnesses against infectious diseases and save numerous lives every year. However, traditional vaccines such as inactivated viral and live attenuated vaccines cannot adapt to emerging pandemics due to their time-consuming development. With the global outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, the virus continues to evolve and mutate, producing mutants with enhanced transmissibility and virulence; the rapid development of vaccines against such emerging global pandemics becomes more and more critical. In recent years, mRNA vaccines have been of significant interest in combating emerging infectious diseases due to their rapid development and large-scale production advantages. However, their development still suffers from many hurdles such as their safety, cellular delivery, uptake, and response to their manufacturing, logistics, and storage. More efforts are still required to optimize the molecular designs of mRNA molecules with increased protein expression and enhanced structural stability. In addition, a variety of delivery systems are also needed to achieve effective delivery of vaccines. In this review, we highlight the advances in mRNA vaccines against various infectious diseases and discuss the molecular design principles and delivery systems of associated mRNA vaccines. The current state of the clinical application of mRNA vaccine pipelines against various infectious diseases and the challenge, safety, and protective effect of associated vaccines are also discussed.",Frontiers in immunology,2022-,"Yang L, Tang L, Zhang M, Liu C",4,1524,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This study conducted surveillance for viruses in small mammals and assessed potential risks for virus transmission to people in urban settlements along rivers in Kathmandu, Nepal. We collected samples from 411 small mammals (100 rodents and 311 shrews) at four riverside settlement sites and detected six viruses from four virus families including Thottapalayam virus; a strain of murine coronavirus; two new paramyxoviruses; and two new rhabdoviruses. Additionally, we conducted surveys of 264 residents to characterize animal-human contact. Forty-eight percent of individuals reported contact with wildlife, primarily with rodents and shrews (91%). Our findings confirm that rodents and shrews should be considered a health threat for residents of temporary settlements, and that assessment of disease transmission risk coupled with targeted surveillance for emerging pathogens could lead to improved disease control and health security for urban populations. Additionally, interventions focused on disease prevention should consider the unique urban ecology and social dynamics in temporary settlements, along with the importance of community engagement for identifying solutions that address specific multi-dimensional challenges that life on the urban river margins presents.",EcoHealth,2020-Sep,"Wolking D, Karmacharya D, Bista M, Shrestha R, Pandit P, Sharma A, Manandhar S, Shrestha B, Bajracharya S, Bhatta T, Dulal S, Rajbhandari R, Smith B, Mazet J, Goldstein T, Johnson C",16,1477,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The findings showed that: (1) The regional spillover effect of incidence of class A and B infectious diseases was significantly positive, and that is most obvious in the central regions. (2) Internet penetration not only has a positive effect on curbing the spread of infectious diseases within the local region but also help to inhibits the proximity spread of infectious diseases in neighborhood, showing the synergistic effect of ""neighbor as a partner"" in joint prevention and control mechanism. (3) The ""digital gap"" between regions, urban and rural areas, and user structures had led to significant group differences in the effect of the Internet on suppressing the spread of Class A and B infectious diseases. The findings of this paper provide a reference for understanding the potential role of the Internet in the COVID-19 and also provide policy support for the construction of Internet-based inter-regional ""joint prevention and control mechanism"" in public health events.",Frontiers in public health,2023-,"Yu D, Li H, Yu J",3,1250,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This is generally attributed to both a failure of the immune system and the lack of an effective anti-microbial pharmaceutical. Infections can be regarded as a competitive process between the microbe and the host for cellular energy-generated resources. Cells obtain energy not only from the metabolism of food but also from the alternative cellular energy (ACE) pathway. This pathway utilizes an environmental force termed as KELEA (kinetic energy limiting electrostatic attraction), which provides an added kinetic/chemical energy to the body's fluids. The ACE pathway can be enhanced through the use of KELEA activated water, which is currently available under different names from several sources. Enhancing the body's ACE pathway, including the use of a wearable waterceutical ™, provides a novel means of potentially increasing the body's resistance against all infectious diseases.",Infectious disorders drug targets,2021-,Martin WJ,1,958,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Outbreaks of infectious disease and widespread incidents of food poisoning are also public health concerns at such times. In Japan, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government operates Ambulance Transfer Syndromic Surveillance (ATSS), which can help monitor such incidents. The present study presents and assesses the ATSS framework. During the study period of October 2017 through November 2018, we monitored 33 areas for symptoms of 9 categories: vomiting/nausea, dizziness, palpitation, unconsciousness, breathing disorder, fever, spasm/paralysis, collapse/weakness, and bloody emesis/nasal hemorrhage. Among all symptoms, we found 9929 low-level aberrations, 2537 medium-level aberrations, and 577 high-level aberrations, with respective frequencies of 9.2%, 2.3%, and 0.5%. Of those, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health reported the information to Tokyo Metropolitan Government 28 times during the period. Of the 28 identified clusters, Tokyo Metropolitan Government judged the necessity for investigating 7. All of those were investigated at hospitals by the jurisdictional public health center. Because ATSS covers almost the entire Tokyo metropolitan area, with about 13.8 million residents, it is definitely the largest syndromic surveillance in the world.",Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,2020-Jan,"Sugishita Y, Sugawara T, Ohkusa Y, Ishikawa T, Yoshida M, Endo H",6,1502,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The objective of this study was to compare infectious disease risks within the same occupations by gender. A systematic review of peer-reviewed studies published between 2016 and 2021 was undertaken. To be included, studies were required to report infectious disease risks for men, women or non-binary people within the same occupation. The included studies were appraised for methodological quality. A post hoc power calculation was also conducted. 63 studies were included in the systematic review. Among high-quality studies with statistical power (9/63), there was evidence of a higher hepatitis risk for men than for women among patient-facing healthcare workers (HCWs) and a higher parasitic infection risk for men than for women among farmers (one study each). The rest of the high-quality studies (7/63) reported no difference between men and women, including for COVID-19 risk among patient-facing HCWs and physicians, hepatitis risk among swine workers, influenza risk among poultry workers, tuberculosis risk among livestock workers and toxoplasmosis risk among abattoir workers. The findings suggest that occupational infectious disease risks are similarly experienced for men and women within the same occupation with a few exceptions showing a higher risk for men.

This study included adult inpatients who underwent ID consultations between October 2016 and March 2018. The demographic data, clinical manifestations, and final non-ID diagnoses of cases were explored. Among the 502 patients who underwent ID consultations, 45 (9.0%) were diagnosed with non-IDs. The most common diagnoses were tumors (22.2%, n = 10), connective tissue and collagen vascular diseases (13.3%, n = 6), other inflammatory diseases (8.9%, n = 4), and drug-induced fever (8.9%, n = 4). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of consultations for diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 22.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.1-48.2; p<0.01), consultations from the internal medicine department (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2-5.2; p = 0.02), and non-bacteremia cases (OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 1.4-19.3; p = 0.01) were independently associated with diagnosed non-IDs. Non-IDs after ID consultations were mainly tumor-related, inflammatory diseases, and drug fever. The presence of consultations for diagnosis, consultations from the internal medicine department and non-bacteremia cases were related to non-IDs among ID consultations.

34684318,Alcohol Use and the Risk of Communicable Diseases.,"The body of knowledge on alcohol use and communicable diseases has been growing in recent years. Using a narrative review approach, this paper discusses alcohol's role in the acquisition of and treatment outcomes from four different communicable diseases: these include three conditions included in comparative risk assessments to date-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), and lower respiratory infections/pneumonia-as well as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) because of its recent and rapid ascension as a global health concern. Alcohol-attributable TB, HIV, and pneumonia combined were responsible for approximately 360,000 deaths and 13 million disability-adjusted life years lost (DALYs) in 2016, with alcohol-attributable TB deaths and DALYs predominating. There is strong evidence that alcohol is associated with increased incidence of and poorer treatment outcomes from HIV, TB, and pneumonia, via both behavioral and biological mechanisms. Preliminary studies suggest that heavy drinkers and those with alcohol use disorders are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection and severe illness. Aside from HIV research, limited research exists that can guide interventions for addressing alcohol-attributable TB and pneumonia or COVID-19. Implementation of effective individual-level interventions and alcohol control policies as a means of reducing the burden of communicable diseases is recommended.",Nutrients,2021-Sep,"Morojele NK, Shenoi SV, Shuper PA, Braithwaite RS, Rehm J",5,1454,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

However, the causal relationship between gut microbiota and infectious diseases remains unclear. We identified gut microbiota based on phylum, class, order, family, and genus classifications, and obtained infectious disease datasets from the IEU OpenGWAS database. The two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis was then performed to determine whether the gut microbiota were causally associated with different infectious diseases. In addition, we performed reverse MR analysis to test for causality. Herein, we characterized causal relationships between genetic predispositions in the gut microbiota and nine infectious diseases. Eight strong associations were found between genetic predisposition in the gut microbiota and infectious diseases. Specifically, the abundance of class <i>Coriobacteriia</i>, order <i>Coriobacteriales</i>, and family <i>Coriobacteriaceae</i> was found to be positively associated with the risk of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). On the other hand, family <i>Acidaminococcaceae</i>, genus <i>Clostridiumsensustricto1</i>, and class <i>Bacilli</i> were positively associated with the risk of endocarditis, cellulitis, and osteomyelitis, respectively. We also discovered that the abundance of class <i>Lentisphaeria</i> and order <i>Victivallales</i> lowered the risk of sepsis.

By mediating an active and steady-state cell-to-cell communication, EVs contribute to regulating and preserving cellular homeostasis. On the other hand, EVs can also spread pathogen-derived molecules during infections, subverting the host immune responses during infections and thus worsening pathophysiological processes. In recent years, the biological functioning of EVs has become a widespread research field in basic and clinical branches of medical sciences due to their potential role in therapeutic applications for several diseases. This review aims to summarize the main recent findings regarding the implication of EVs shed by human macrophages (MΦ-EVs) and how they can modulate the host immune response to control or increase the damage caused by infectious agents. We will also present the methods used to describe MΦ-EVs, as well as the potential of these EVs as disease diagnostic tools for some human pathogens.

CC was found to have a major influence on the distribution and severity of hepatic diseases, such as outbreaks of vector-borne, water or food-borne, parasitic diseases, re-emerging of disappeared diseases, or emerging of new forms of infectious agents. Migration of infected people from endemic areas due to the CC disasters results in rapid dissemination of infectious diseases that leads to outbreaks or endemicity of diseases in new areas. CC could cause increasing chemical emissions, or change in its biodegradability, or restriction in its dispersion, such as PM, PAHs, heavy metals, mycotoxins, and aquatic toxins. Increase in the concentrations of these chemicals may have significant impacts in changing the health map of hepatic toxicity and liver cancer. The current review confirms the role of CC in changing the pattern of several liver health problems and remapping of these problems in several regions of the world. This review could be of high importance to the health decision-makers as an early alarm and prediction of hepatic health problems with the projected CC.",Current environmental health reports,2022-Jun,"Saad-Hussein A, Ramadan HK, Bareedy A, Elwakil R",4,1366,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
32848269,Updates on Rapid Diagnostic Tests in Infectious Diseases.,"In the last two decades there have been dramatic advances in development of rapid diagnostic tests. Turnaround time of the assays have significantly been shortened which led to reductions in time to appropriate antimicrobial therapy and improvement of patient clinical outcomes. Molecular-based assays generally have better sensitivity than conventional methods, but the cost is higher. The results need to be interpreted cautiously as detection of colonized organisms, pathogen detection in asymptomatic patients, and false negative/positive can occur. Indications and cost-effectiveness need to be considered for appropriate utilization of rapid diagnostic tests.",Missouri medicine,2020-,Mizusawa M,1,665,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33058533,"The potential of diagnostic point-of-care tests (POCTs) for infectious and zoonotic animal diseases in developing countries: Technical, regulatory and sociocultural considerations.","Remote and rural communities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately affected by infectious animal diseases due to their close contact with livestock and limited access to animal health personnel). However, animal disease surveillance and diagnosis in LMICs is often challenging, and turnaround times between sample submission and diagnosis can take days to weeks. This diagnostic gap and subsequent disease under-reporting can allow emerging and transboundary animal pathogens to spread, with potentially serious and far-reaching consequences. Point-of-care tests (POCTs), which allow for rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases in non-laboratory settings, have the potential to significantly disrupt traditional animal health surveillance paradigms in LMICs. This literature review sought to identify POCTs currently available for diagnosing infectious animal diseases and to determine facilitators and barriers to their use and uptake in LMICs. Results indicated that some veterinary POCTs have been used for field-based animal disease diagnosis in LMICs with good results. However, many POCTs target a small number of key agricultural and zoonotic animal diseases, while few exist for other important animal diseases. POCT evaluation is rarely taken beyond the laboratory and into the field where they are predicted to have the greatest impact, and where conditions can greatly affect test performance. A lack of mandated test validation regulations for veterinary POCTs has allowed tests of varying quality to enter the market, presenting challenges for potential customers. The use of substandard, improperly validated or unsuitable POCTs in LMICs can greatly undermine their true potential and can have far-reaching negative impacts on disease control. To successfully implement novel rapid diagnostic pathways for animal disease in LMICs, technical, regulatory, socio-political and economic challenges must be overcome, and further research is urgently needed before the potential of animal disease POCTs can be fully realized.",Transboundary and emerging diseases,2021-Jul,"Hobbs EC, Colling A, Gurung RB, Allen J",4,2061,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34138911,Epidemic spread simulation in an area with a high-density crowd using a SEIR-based model.,"Understanding the spread of infectious diseases is an extremely essential step to preventing them. Thus, correct modeling and simulation approaches are critical for elucidating the transmission of infectious diseases and improving the control of epidemics. The primary objective of this study is to simulate the spread of communicable diseases in an urban rail transit station. Data were collected by a field investigation in the city of Ningbo, China. A SEIR-based model was developed to simulate the spread of infectious diseases in Tianyi station, considering four groups of passengers (susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered) and a 14-day incubation period. Based on the historical data of infectious diseases, the parameters of the SEIR infectious disease model were clarified, and a sensitivity analysis of the parameters was also performed. The results showed that the contact rate (CR), infectivity (I), and average illness duration (AID) were positively correlated with the number of infections. It was also found that the length of the average incubation time (AIT) was positively correlated with the number of exposed individuals and negatively correlated with the number of infectors. These simulation results provide support for the validity and reliability of using the SEIR model in studies of the spread of epidemics and facilitate the development of effective measures to prevent and control an epidemic.",PloS one,2021-,"Zhou J, Dong S, Ma C, Wu Y, Qiu X",5,1428,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39127773,Assessing vaccine efficacy for infectious diseases with variable immunity using a mathematical model.,"This study introduces an SIRS compartmental mathematical model encompassing vaccination and variable immunity periods for infectious diseases. I derive a basic reproduction number formula and assess the local and global stability of disease-free and the local stability of the endemic equilibria. I demonstrate that the basic reproduction number in the presence of a vaccine is highly sensitive to the rate of immunity loss, and even a slight reduction in this rate can significantly contribute to disease control. Additionally, I have derived a formula to calculate the critical efficacy period required for a vaccine to effectively manage and control the disease.The analysis conducted for the model suggests that increasing the vaccine's immunity duration (efficacy) decelerates disease dynamics, leading to reduced rates of reinfection and less severe disease outcomes. Furthermore, this delay contributes to a decrease in the basic reproduction number ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><msub><mi>R</mi> <mn>0</mn></msub> </math> ), thus facilitating more rapid disease control efforts.",Scientific reports,2024-Aug,Al-Arydah M,1,1107,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
38226809,"""Smart markets"": harnessing the potential of new technologies for endemic and emerging infectious disease surveillance in traditional food markets.","Emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases continue to threaten human and animal health, our social fabric, and the global economy. Zoonoses frequently emerge from congregate interfaces where multiple animal species and humans coexist, including farms and markets. Traditional food markets are widespread across the globe and create an interface where domestic and wild animals interact among themselves and with humans, increasing the risk of pathogen spillover. Despite decades of evidence linking markets to disease outbreaks across the world, there remains a striking lack of pathogen surveillance programs that can relay timely, cost-effective, and actionable information to decision-makers to protect human and animal health. However, the strategic incorporation of environmental surveillance systems in markets coupled with novel pathogen detection strategies can create an early warning system capable of alerting us to the risk of outbreaks before they happen. Here, we explore the concept of ""smart"" markets that utilize continuous surveillance systems to monitor the emergence of zoonotic pathogens with spillover potential.IMPORTANCEFast detection and rapid intervention are crucial to mitigate risks of pathogen emergence, spillover and spread-every second counts. However, comprehensive, active, longitudinal surveillance systems at high-risk interfaces that provide real-time data for action remain lacking.

34543228,"Ethics, Integrity, and Retributions of Digital Detection Surveillance Systems for Infectious Diseases: Systematic Literature Review.","The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the importance of the deployment of digital detection surveillance systems to support early warning and monitoring of infectious diseases. These opportunities create a ""double-edge sword,"" as the ethical governance of such approaches often lags behind technological achievements. The aim was to investigate ethical issues identified from utilizing artificial intelligence-augmented surveillance or early warning systems to monitor and detect common or novel infectious disease outbreaks. In a number of databases, we searched relevant articles that addressed ethical issues of using artificial intelligence, digital surveillance systems, early warning systems, and/or big data analytics technology for detecting, monitoring, or tracing infectious diseases according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, and further identified and analyzed them with a theoretical framework. This systematic review identified 29 articles presented in 6 major themes clustered under individual, organizational, and societal levels, including awareness of implementing digital surveillance, digital integrity, trust, privacy and confidentiality, civil rights, and governance. While these measures were understandable during a pandemic, the public had concerns about receiving inadequate information; unclear governance frameworks; and lack of privacy protection, data integrity, and autonomy when utilizing infectious disease digital surveillance. The barriers to engagement could widen existing health care disparities or digital divides by underrepresenting vulnerable and at-risk populations, and patients' highly sensitive data, such as their movements and contacts, could be exposed to outside sources, impinging significantly upon basic human and civil rights. Our findings inform ethical considerations for service delivery models for medical practitioners and policymakers involved in the use of digital surveillance for infectious disease spread, and provide a basis for a global governance structure.

35060214,The concept of one health applied to the problem of zoonotic diseases.,"Zoonotic diseases are a burden on healthcare systems globally, particularly underdeveloped nations. Numerous vertebrate animals (e.g., birds, mammals and reptiles) serve as amplifier hosts or reservoirs for viral zoonoses. The spread of zoonotic disease is associated with environmental factors, climate change, animal health as well as other human activities including globalization, urbanization and travel. Diseases at the human-animal environment interface (e.g., zoonotic diseases, vector-borne diseases, food/water borne diseases) continue to pose risk to animals and humans with a great significant mortality and morbidity. It is estimated that of 1400 infectious diseases known to affect humans, 60% of them are of animal origin. In addition, 75% of the emerging infectious diseases have a zoonotic nature, worldwide. The one health concept plays an important role in the control and prevention of zoonoses by integrating animal, human, and environmental health through collaboration and communication among osteopaths, wildlife, physicians, veterinarians professionals, public health and environmental experts, nurses, dentists, physicists, biomedical engineers, plant pathologists, biochemists, and others.

This study aimed to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and factors influencing imported RIDs, with the goal of providing evidence to support adoption of high-tech, intelligent methods to early find imported RIDs and prevent their spread in China. We obtained data of imported RIDs cases from 2014 to 2018 from the Inbound Sentinel Network of Customs and the National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System in China. We analyzed spatial, temporal, and population distribution characteristics of the imported RIDs. We developed an index to describe seasonality. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine associations between independent variables and imported cases. Data analyses and visualizations were conducted with R software. From a total of 1 409 265 253 inbound travelers, 31 732 (2.25/100 000) imported RIDs cases were reported. RIDs cases were imported from 142 countries and five continents. The incidence of imported RIDs was nearly 5 times higher in 2018 (2.81/100 000) than in 2014 (0.58/100 000). Among foreigners, incidence rates were higher among males (5.32/100 000), 0-14-year-olds (15.15/100 000), and cases originating in Oceania (11.10/100 000). The vast majority (90.3%) of imported RIDs were influenza, with seasonality consistent with annual seasonality of influenza. The spatial distribution of imported RIDs was different between Chinese citizens and foreigners. Increases in inbound travel volume and the number of influenza cases in source countries were associated with the number of imported RIDs. Our study documented importation of RIDs into China from 142 countries. Inbound travel poses a significant risks bringing important RIDs to China. It is urgent to strengthen surveillance at customs of inbound travelers and establish an intelligent surveillance and early warning system to prevent importation of RIDs to China for preventing further spread within China.",Infectious diseases of poverty,2022-Mar,"Wang JL, Chen T, Deng LL, Han YJ, Wang DY, Wang LP, He GX",7,2075,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

A cross-sectional study. A cross-sectional survey of 879 nurses in infectious diseases department of specialty or general hospitals in China completed online questionnaires on the nurses' risk perception questionnaire, quality of working life, psychological resilience and the social support rating scale. Our study observed that risk perception directly negatively influences the quality of working life of infectious disease nurses, while psychological resilience and social support positively chain mediate this relationship. Critical elements impacting the quality of working life of infectious disease nurses are risk perception, psychological resilience and social support. Managers may think about decreasing the level of risk perception and enhancing the quality of working life of infectious disease nurses by enhancing their psychological resilience and providing support. The quality of working life of infectious disease nurses should be a priority for nursing management; it is critical to maintain their health and well-being, raise the quality of care and lower turnover. Managers should create resilience-building programmes and support tools to assist nurses properly perceive risks and adopt protective strategies to deal with them to improve the quality of working life for nurses.",Nursing open,2024-Sep,"Zhang HL, Wu C, Hu MY, Ma WJ, Xu XL, Shi RJ, Lang HJ",7,1515,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

So far, it has only been investigated in special risk populations (e.g. patients with neutropenic fever). To investigate the extent to which mNGS (DISQVER® platform) can be used in routine clinical practice. We collected whole blood specimens for mNGS testing, blood cultures (BC), and pathogen-specific PCR diagnostics. Clinical data and pathogen diagnostics were retrospectively reviewed by an infectious disease expert panel regarding the adjustment of anti-infective therapy. In 55 selected patients (median age 53 years, 67% male) with heterogeneous diagnoses, a total of 66 different microorganisms and viruses were detected using mNGS (51% viruses, 38% bacteria, 8% fungi, 3% parasites). The overall positivity rate of mNGS was 53% (29/55). Fifty-two out of 66 (79%) potential pathogens detected by mNGS were found in patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency. The concordance rates of BC and pathogen-specific PCR diagnostics with mNGS testing were 14% (4/28) and 36% (10/28), respectively (p < 0.001). An additional bacterial pathogen (Streptococcus agalactiae) could only be detected by BC. Therapeutic consequences regarding anti-infective therapy were drawn from 23 pathogens (35% of detections), with 18 of these detections occurring in patients with immunodeficiency. We conclude that mNGS is a useful diagnostic tool, but should only be performed selectively in addition to routine diagnostics of infectious diseases.

34717937,A spatio-stochastic model for the spread of infectious diseases.,"The spread of infectious diseases is a world-wide problem that has a greater impact on low-income countries. Mathematical modelling is a useful tool to better understand these diseases and to plan prevention and interventions. In this article, discrete-time binomial chain models, which are used for modelling the transmission of infectious diseases, have been extended by the addition of a spatial component. The spatial component is included in the function which represents the number of contacts that an individual makes. The spatio-stochastic model is derived to form three cases to match different modelling scenarios, namely: a model with only local transmission, a model with interaction between spatial units but no migration, and a model with interaction and migration between spatial units. Simulations are then used to compare the different models. The spatio-stochastic model is also demonstrated with an application to measles data. From this study, it can be seen that the type of model and inclusion of a spatial component plays an important role in the transmission of infectious diseases. The importance of choosing a model which best represents the dynamics and circumstances of an infectious disease is highlighted. The models presented in this paper allows flexibility which accommodate for a wide range of modelling cases.",Journal of theoretical biology,2022-Jan,Manjoo-Docrat R,1,1344,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

39742580,Targeted prevention strategy: Exploring the interaction effect of environmental and social factors on infectious diseases.,"Human disease and health issues are globally significant and closely related to environmental and social factors. However, the interaction effects of such factors on diseases are unclear, which has resulted in a lack of targeted prevention strategies. By taking infectious diseases in China as an example, this study uses an interpretable machine learning method to analyze the impact of environmental and social factors on disease, including industrial SO<sub>2</sub> emissions, sanitary toilet coverage rate, and sunshine duration. The modeling results confirm the existence of a nonlinear relationship between infectious diseases incidence and each of the potential factors. That is, increased SO<sub>2</sub> emissions can increase infectious diseases incidence, whereas broad sanitary toilet coverage can reduce such risk. This study examines the interaction of the driving factors and reveals that variation in the sunshine duration can affect the impact of SO<sub>2</sub> emissions on infectious diseases incidence. This study proposes the use of multilevel risk trigger points (RTPs) to develop early warning and targeted regulation measures and classifies the points as primary, secondary, and tertiary. For example, for Henan Province, the RTPs of SO<sub>2</sub> emissions are 291,031, 897,579, and 1,381,342 tons, whereas those for Shandong are 362,802, 1,177,650, and 1,658,118 tons. At the tertiary RTP level, SO<sub>2</sub> emissions can significantly increase infectious disease incidence, which has prompted policymakers to implement pollution reduction and disease prevention measures.

These cells are involved in early anti-infective immunity, antitumour immunity, regulation of tissue inflammation, and maintenance of homeostasis in the internal environment of tissues and have been referred to as the ""first armies stationed in the human body"". ILCs are widely distributed in the lungs, colon, lymph nodes, oral mucosa and even embryonic tissues. Due to the advantage of their distribution location, they are often among the first cells to come into contact with pathogens.Relevant studies have demonstrated that ILCs play an early role in the defence against a variety of pathogenic microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and helminths, before they intervene in the adaptive immune system. ILCs can initiate a rapid, nonspecific response against pathogens prior to the initiation of an adaptive immune response and can generate a protective immune response against specific pathogens, secreting different effectors to play a role.There is growing evidence that ILCs play an important role in host control of infectious diseases. In this paper, we summarize and discuss the current known infectious diseases in which ILCs are involved and ILC contribution to the defence against infectious diseases.

34524795,Early Warning Diagnostics for Emerging Infectious Diseases in Developing into Late-Stage Pandemics.,"The spread of infectious diseases due to travel and trade can be seen throughout history, whether from early settlers or traveling businessmen. Increased globalization has allowed infectious diseases to quickly spread to different parts of the world and cause widespread infection. Posthoc analysis of more recent outbreaks-SARS, MERS, swine flu, and COVID-19-has demonstrated that the causative viruses were circulating through populations for days or weeks before they were first detected, allowing disease to spread before quarantines, contact tracing, and travel restrictions could be implemented. Earlier detection of future novel pathogens could decrease the time before countermeasures are enacted. In this Account, we examined a variety of novel technologies from the past 10 years that may allow for earlier detection of infectious diseases. We have arranged these technologies chronologically from pre-human predictive technologies to population-level screening tools. The earliest detection methods utilize artificial intelligence to analyze factors such as climate variation and zoonotic spillover as well as specific species and geographies to identify where the infection risk is high. Artificial intelligence can also be used to monitor health records, social media, and various publicly available data to identify disease outbreaks faster than traditional epidemiology. Secondary to predictive measures is monitoring infection in specific sentinel animal species, where domestic animals or wildlife are indicators of potential disease hotspots. These hotspots inform public health officials about geographic areas where infection risk in humans is high. Further along the timeline, once the disease has begun to infect humans, wastewater epidemiology can be used for unbiased sampling of large populations. This method has already been shown to precede spikes in COVID-19 diagnoses by 1 to 2 weeks. As total infections increase in humans, bioaerosol sampling in high-traffic areas can be used for disease monitoring, such as within an airport. Finally, as disease spreads more quickly between humans, rapid diagnostic technologies such as lateral flow assays and nucleic acid amplification become very important. Minimally invasive point-of-care methods can allow for quick adoption and use within a population. These individual diagnostic methods then transfer to higher-throughput methods for more intensive population screening as an infection spreads. There are many promising early warning technologies being developed. However, no single technology listed herein will prevent every future outbreak. A combination of technologies from across our infection timeline would offer the most benefit in preventing future widespread disease outbreaks and pandemics.",Accounts of chemical research,2021-Oct,"Oeschger TM, McCloskey DS, Buchmann RM, Choubal AM, Boza JM, Mehta S, Erickson D",7,2779,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This study aims to investigate the attitude and knowledge of Chinese dental professionals on tropical infectious diseases and oral health, and to explore the difference between different genders, education backgrounds, professional identities, professional titles and tropics working experience. Network questionnaire was used to evaluate the knowledge and attitude of 236 Chinese dental professionals towards tropical infectious diseases and oral health. The scores of the participants on tropical infectious diseases and oral health were quite low. Although working experience in the tropics partially affected the understanding, there was no difference between different genders, education backgrounds, professional identities and professional titles.

Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis, and quantitative data were analyzed according to Borich's formula. Data for the study were collected in March 2021 from 16 nurses who had completed a nursing program for critically ill patients with COVID-19 and were working at three hospitals designated for COVID-19. Participants' experiences were classified into three major categories, namely ""Participation experiences and perceptions of the training program,"" ""Recommendations for improving the training program,"" and ""Perceptions of working in an infectious environment,"" and 10 subcategories. According to Borich's formula, the most pressing educational needs in respiratory and non-respiratory nursing, respectively, were for ""nursing care for patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation"" and ""application of continuous renal replacement therapy and caring for patients."" To prepare for the periodic emergence of communicable infectious diseases throughout the world and cultivate nursing staff to care for critically ill patients, it is necessary to develop nursing education programs with content corresponding to nurses' needs.

However, the multivariate case is challenging due to the need to account for correlations across space, time and disease in both the count and zero-inflated components of the model. We are interested in comparing the transmission dynamics of several co-circulating infectious diseases across space and time, where some of the diseases can be absent for long periods. We first assume there is a baseline disease that is well-established and always present in the region. The other diseases switch between periods of presence and absence in each area through a series of coupled Markov chains, which account for long periods of disease absence, disease interactions and disease spread from neighboring areas. Since we are mainly interested in comparing the diseases, we assume the cases of the present diseases in an area jointly follow an autoregressive multinomial model. We use the multinomial model to investigate whether there are associations between certain factors, such as temperature, and differences in the transmission intensity of the diseases. Inference is performed using efficient Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods based on jointly sampling all unknown presence indicators. We apply the model to spatio-temporal counts of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya cases in Rio de Janeiro, during the first triple epidemic there.","Biostatistics (Oxford, England)",2024-Dec,"Douwes-Schultz D, Schmidt AM, Freitas LP, Carvalho MS",4,1472,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39596075,Zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) as a Model System to Investigate the Role of the Innate Immune Response in Human Infectious Diseases.,"The zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>) has emerged as a valuable model for studying host-pathogen interactions due to its unique combination of characteristics. These include extensive sequence and functional conservation with the human genome, optical transparency in larvae that allows for high-resolution visualization of host cell-microbe interactions, a fully sequenced and annotated genome, advanced forward and reverse genetic tools, and suitability for chemical screening studies. Despite anatomical differences with humans, the zebrafish model has proven instrumental in investigating immune responses and human infectious diseases. Notably, zebrafish larvae rely exclusively on innate immune responses during the early stages of development, as the adaptive immune system becomes fully functional only after 4-6 weeks post-fertilization. This window provides a unique opportunity to isolate and examine infection and inflammation mechanisms driven by the innate immune response without the confounding effects of adaptive immunity. In this review, we highlight the strengths and limitations of using zebrafish as a powerful vertebrate model to study innate immune responses in infectious diseases. We will particularly focus on host-pathogen interactions in human infections caused by various bacteria (<i>Clostridioides difficile</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>), viruses (herpes simplex virus 1, SARS-CoV-2), and fungi (<i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> and <i>Candida albicans</i>).",International journal of molecular sciences,2024-Nov,"Franza M, Varricchio R, Alloisio G, De Simone G, Di Bella S, Ascenzi P, di Masi A",7,1523,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

In this review, we briefly highlight the development and applications of PI3K inhibitors and summarize data supporting the concept that PI3Kδ inhibitors initially developed for oncology have immune regulatory potential that could be exploited to improve the control of some infectious diseases. This repurposing of existing kinase inhibitors could lay the foundation for alternative infectious disease therapy using available therapeutic agents.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2020-Dec,"Adefemi F, Fruman DA, Marshall AJ",3,976,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

39338961,Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus: An Emerging Threat in Europe with a Focus on Epidemiology in Spain.,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne disease transmitted by ticks of the genus <i>Hyalomma</i> and caused by a virus of the <i>Nairoviridae</i> family. In humans, the virus can generate different clinical presentations that can range from asymptomatic to mild illness or produce an hemorrhagic fever with a mortality rate of approximately 30%. The virus pathogenicity and the lack of effective treatment or vaccine for its prevention make it an agent of concern from a public health point of view. The main transmission route is tick bites, so people most exposed to this risk are more likely to become infected. Another risk group are veterinarians and livestock farmers who are in contact with the blood and other fluids of animals that are mostly asymptomatic. Finally, due to its first phase with a non-characteristic symptomatology, there exists a risk of nosocomial infection. It is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and those Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north, the geographical limit of the main vector. Recently, autochthonous cases have been observed in areas of Europe where the virus was not previously present. Human cases have been detected in Greece, Bulgaria, and Spain. Spain is one of the most affected countries, with a total of 17 autochthonous cases detected since 2013. In other countries, such as France, the virus is present in ticks and animals but has not spread to humans. A high-quality epidemiological surveillance system in these countries is essential to avoid the expansion of this virus to new areas and to limit the impact of current cases.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2024-Sep,"Eslava M, Carlos S, Reina G",3,1621,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The morbidity, mortality, and economic costs of these pandemics have been staggering. We desperately need a more targeted, cost-efficient, and sustainable strategy to detect and mitigate future zoonotic respiratory virus threats. Evidence suggests that the transition from an animal virus to a human pathogen is incremental and requires a considerable number of spillover events and considerable time before a pandemic variant emerges. This evolutionary view argues for the refocusing of public health resources on novel respiratory virus surveillance at human-animal interfaces in geographical hotspots for emerging infectious diseases. Where human-animal interface surveillance is not possible, a secondary high-yield, cost-efficient strategy is to conduct novel respiratory virus surveillance among pneumonia patients in these same hotspots. When novel pathogens are discovered, they must be quickly assessed for their human risk and, if indicated, mitigation strategies initiated. In this review, we discuss the most common respiratory virus threats, current efforts at early emerging pathogen detection, and propose and defend new molecular pathogen discovery strategies with the goal of preempting future pandemics.",Viruses,2021-Apr,"Gray GC, Robie ER, Studstill CJ, Nunn CL",4,1405,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

In this context, the search for new effective strategies in prevention and/or treatment is considered essential, since current drugs often have side effects or end up, causing microbial resistance, making it a serious health problem. As an alternative to these limitations, nanotechnology has been widely used. The use of lipid-based drug delivery nanosystems (DDNs) has some advantages, such as biocompatibility, low toxicity, controlled release, the ability to carry both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs, in addition to be easel scalable. Besides, as an improvement, studies involving the conjugation of signalling molecules on the surfaces of these nanocarriers can allow the target of certain tissues or cells.

Disease notification is a mandatory procedure for most infectious diseases, even during non-pandemic periods in healthcare. The main rationale behind MRID is the protection of public health. The information and data provided by infectious disease reports are used for many purposes, such as preventing the spread and potential negative impact of infectious diseases, assessing the national and global situation regarding reported diseases, conducting scientific research and planning health policy. In this context, the relevant information benefits public health, health systems and scientific work. Additionally, the follow up and treatment of individuals with infectious diseases is a necessity in certain cases to protect those who cohabit with them. However, these benefits cannot be accepted as unrestricted justifications for MRID, since it is evident that reporting should be conducted within ethical and legal boundaries. MRID should only be devised and implemented with due regard to balancing potential benefits between all individuals, as well as between the individual and the rest of society. Disease notification systems that are not designed with a balancing and harm-reductionist approach may lead to stigmatisation and discrimination.

In this review, the pathogen pyramid framework was utilized to identify the ""unknown unknowns"" associated with the emergence and rapid transmission of novel infectious disease agents. Given that the evolutionary origin of most of the emerging infectious disease agents can be traced to an animal source, we argue the need to integrate the ""One Health"" approach as a part of surveillance activities. The need for focusing on undertaking global and regional mapping activities to identify novel pathogens is discussed, given that there are an estimated 1.67 million unknown viruses, of which around 631,000 to 827,000 unknown viruses have the capacity to infect human beings. The emerging risks due to the ever-expanding interface between human, animals, both domestic and wildlife, and the environment are highlighted, these are largely driven by the need for safe habitation, growing food, developing infrastructure to support the increasing human population and desire for economic growth.

Here, we demonstrate an operational, mechanism-agnostic detection algorithm for disease (re-)emergence based on early warning signals (EWSs) derived from the theory of critical slowing down. Specifically, we used computer simulations to train a supervised learning algorithm to detect the dynamical footprints of (re-)emergence present in epidemiological data. Our algorithm was then challenged to forecast the slowly manifesting, spatially replicated reemergence of mumps in England in the mid-2000s and pertussis post-1980 in the United States. Our method successfully anticipated mumps reemergence 4 years in advance, during which time mitigation efforts could have been implemented. From 1980 onwards, our model identified resurgent states with increasing accuracy, leading to reliable classification starting in 1992. Additionally, we successfully applied the detection algorithm to 2 vector-transmitted case studies, namely, outbreaks of dengue serotypes in Puerto Rico and a rapidly unfolding outbreak of plague in 2017 in Madagascar.

The mucosa is well known to provide the first line of host defense against pathogen entry by physical, chemical, biological, and immunological barriers, and therefore, mucosa-targeting vaccination is emerging as a promising strategy for conferring superior protection. However, there are still many challenges to be solved to develop an effective mucosal vaccine, such as poor adhesion to the mucosal surface, insufficient uptake to break through the mucus, and the difficulty in avoiding strong degradation through the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, increasing efforts to overcome these issues have been made, and we herein summarize the latest findings on these strategies to develop mucosa-targeting vaccines, including a novel needle-free mucosa-targeting route, the development of mucosa-targeting vectors, the administration of mucosal adjuvants, encapsulating vaccines into nanoparticle formulations, and antigen design to conjugate with mucosa-targeting ligands.

34487865,Human host genetics and susceptibility to ZIKV infection.,"Managing emerging infectious diseases is a current challenge in the fields of microbiology and epidemiology. Indeed, among other environmental and human-related factors, climate change and global warming favor the emergence of new pathogens. The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic, of which the large and rapid spread surprised the scientific community, is a reminder of the importance to study viruses currently responsible for sporadic infections. Increasing our knowledge of key factors involved in emerging infections is essential to implement specific monitoring that can be oriented according to the pathogen, targeted population, or at-risk environment. Recent technological developments, such as high-throughput sequencing, genome-wide association studies and CRISPR screenings have allowed the identification of human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in infectious disease outcome. This review focuses on the human genetic host factors that have been identified and shown to be associated with the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection and candidate SNP targets.","Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2021-Nov,"Ferraris P, Wichit S, Cordel N, Missé D",4,1078,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
36480159,An analysis of the policy participation of field response nurses in South Korea: COVID-19 response guidelines and the infectious disease act revision.,"The Republic of Korea's response to Coronavirus disease 2019 was divided before and after global vaccine development at the end of 2020. It also varied according to the size of confirmed patients in the non-pharmaceutical intervention. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the contribution of frontline nurses to the policy and law revision on infectious diseases and suggest health and nursing policies for emerging infectious diseases in the future. This case evaluation study analyzed the significant policy decisions that nurses' roles brought on changes in the infectious disease response system in the Republic of Korea and applying the health system model and those capacities on resilience under emerging infectious diseases. Objective data that contributed directly to the revision of infectious disease-related Acts and policies in 2020 were collected and analyzed through literature search and information disclosure claims from the first to third waves of Coronavirus disease 2019 in one city. With the rapid outbreak of COVID-19 confirmed cases at the end of February 2020, a pan-government support group was formed and dispatched to D City. In addition, central quarantine officials worked with local quarantine officials to share real-time situations and find out on-site difficulties and support requests. As a result, inquiry of opinions to working staff before changing the ""response guidelines to Coronavirus disease 2019"" was reflected in major contents on the revision of ""policy on infectious disease response"" and ""Infectious Disease Prevention and Management Act."" With the establishment of an epidemiological investigation team in September 2020, the number of new nurses in 17 cities and provinces increased by 19.1% compared to the previous year, the most significant increase compared to doctors (-2.3), dentists (-1.6), and health workers (3.7). The experience of responding to Coronavirus was a reminder that the curriculum needed to be improved so that nurses will be recognized to have leadership competencies and as field experts regarding social determinants of health for population groups in the decision-making process. In the initial COVID-19 response process, nurses showed excellence in analyzing patient interviews and various information as field epidemiological investigation response personnel, making comprehensive judgments, and solving problems in cooperation with related agencies and severe patients' bedside nursing care. Continuous primary care and management of infectious diseases for the vulnerable should be prepared on an ongoing basis to assure the quality of care. Action strategies for developing leadership to enable nurses to have participated in the social determinants of health and the nursing policy formation for health equity should be applied in nursing education and practice, and global monitoring efforts were accelerated.",Journal of nursing scholarship : an official publication of Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing,2023-Jan,"Kang S, Kim Y, Kim J",3,2895,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

A survey was sent to 1,126 jails in the United States to identify the prevalence of health screenings at intake and characteristics of care for ID; 371 surveys were completed correctly and analyzed. Despite conflicting Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidance, only seven percent of surveyed jails test individuals for HIV at admission. In 46% of jails, non-healthcare personnel perform ID screenings. Jails in less urban areas were more likely to report healthcare screenings performed by correctional officers. Survey findings indicate that HIV, HCV and TB testing during jail admissions and access to PrEP are severely lacking in less urban jails in particular.

39244437,Medical-legal aspects in infectious diseases.,"This article reviews the medico-legal aspects associated with infectious diseases, highlighting their complexity and the challenges they pose. Infectious diseases cause not only an increase in morbidity and mortality in the healthcare setting but also involve complex legal issues. Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) represent a growing risk with the increase in invasive procedures and can lead to patient complications and legal claims against healthcare professionals and institutions. The consequences of medical malpractice in this context are discussed, such as diagnostic delays, inappropriate use of treatments, and lack of adequate testing, which can have serious sequelae or even result in the patient's death. The review focuses on highlighting the importance of prevention, considering that healthcare-associated infections can be difficult to avoid, posing complex legal challenges. It concludes that managing infectious diseases and their legal consequences requires careful consideration of clinical practice guidelines, prevention and control strategies, and effective communication with patients. An integrated and evidence-based approach is advocated to address these challenges, emphasizing continuous education, the use of advanced diagnostic technologies, and interdisciplinary collaboration.",Medicina clinica,2024-Nov,"Güerri-Fernández R, Benet J, Vargas C",3,1318,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

We evaluated implementation of mpox surveillance in Tennessee during an outbreak response and made recommendations for surveillance during emerging infectious disease outbreaks. To understand surveillance implementation, system processes, and areas for improvement, we conducted 8 semistructured focus groups and 7 interviews with 36 health care, laboratory, and health department representatives during September 9-20, 2022. We categorized and analyzed session transcription and notes. We analyzed completeness and timeliness of surveillance data, including 349 orthopoxvirus-positive laboratory reports from commercial, public health, and health system laboratories during July 1-August 31, 2022. Participants described an evolving system and noted that existing informatics platforms inefficiently supported iterations of reporting requirements. Clear communication, standardization of terminology, and shared, adaptable, and user-friendly informatics platforms were prioritized for future emerging infectious disease surveillance systems. Laboratory-reported epidemiologic information was often incomplete; only 55% (191 of 349) of reports included patient address and telephone number. The median time from symptom onset to specimen collection was 5 days (IQR, 3-6 d), from specimen collection to laboratory reporting was 3 days (IQR, 1-4 d), from laboratory reporting to patient interview was 1 day (IQR, 1-3 d), and from symptom onset to patient interview was 9 days (IQR, 7-12 d). Future emerging infectious disease responses would benefit from standardized surveillance approaches that facilitate rapid implementation. Closer collaboration among informatics, laboratory, and clinical partners across jurisdictions and agencies in determining system priorities and designing workflow processes could improve flexibility of the surveillance platform and completeness and timeliness of laboratory reporting. Improved timeliness will facilitate public health response and intervention, thereby mitigating morbidity.","Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",2024-,"Thomas CM, Shaffner J, Johnson R, Wiedeman C, Fill MA, Jones TF, Schaffner W, Dunn JR",8,2086,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This work presents a hybrid machine-learning model that could predict the validity of the infectious disease's news spread on the media. The proposed hybrid machine learning (ML) model uses the Dynamic Classifier Selection (DCS) process to validate news. Several machine learning models, such as K-Neighbors-Neighbor (KNN), AdaBoost (AB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), SVC, Gaussian Naïve Base (GNB), and Logistic Regression (LR) are tested in the simulation process on benchmark dataset. The simulation employs three DCS process methods: overall Local Accuracy (OLA), Meta Dynamic ensemble selection (META-DES), and Bagging. From seven ML classifiers, the AdaBoost with Bagging DCS method got a 97.45% high accuracy rate for training samples and a 97.56% high accuracy rate for testing samples. The second high accuracy was obtained at 96.12% for training and 96.45% for testing samples from AdaBoost with the Meta-DES method. Overall, the AdaBoost with Bagging model obtained higher accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity rate with minimum FPR and FNR for validation.",Microscopy research and technique,2023-May,Bahaj SA,1,1271,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

38861711,Prospective Spatiotemporal Cluster Detection Using SaTScan: Tutorial for Designing and Fine-Tuning a System to Detect Reportable Communicable Disease Outbreaks.,"Staff at public health departments have few training materials to learn how to design and fine-tune systems to quickly detect acute, localized, community-acquired outbreaks of infectious diseases. Since 2014, the Bureau of Communicable Disease at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has analyzed reportable communicable diseases daily using SaTScan. SaTScan is a free software that analyzes data using scan statistics, which can detect increasing disease activity without a priori specification of temporal period, geographic location, or size. The Bureau of Communicable Disease's systems have quickly detected outbreaks of salmonellosis, legionellosis, shigellosis, and COVID-19. This tutorial details system design considerations, including geographic and temporal data aggregation, study period length, inclusion criteria, whether to account for population size, network location file setup to account for natural boundaries, probability model (eg, space-time permutation), day-of-week effects, minimum and maximum spatial and temporal cluster sizes, secondary cluster reporting criteria, signaling criteria, and distinguishing new clusters versus ongoing clusters with additional events. We illustrate how to support health equity by minimizing analytic exclusions of patients with reportable diseases (eg, persons experiencing homelessness who are unsheltered) and accounting for purely spatial patterns, such as adjusting nonparametrically for areas with lower access to care and testing for reportable diseases. We describe how to fine-tune the system when the detected clusters are too large to be of interest or when signals of clusters are delayed, missed, too numerous, or false. We demonstrate low-code techniques for automating analyses and interpreting results through built-in features on the user interface (eg, patient line lists, temporal graphs, and dynamic maps), which became newly available with the July 2022 release of SaTScan version 10.1. This tutorial is the first comprehensive resource for health department staff to design and maintain a reportable communicable disease outbreak detection system using SaTScan to catalyze field investigations as well as develop intuition for interpreting results and fine-tuning the system. While our practical experience is limited to monitoring certain reportable diseases in a dense, urban area, we believe that most recommendations are generalizable to other jurisdictions in the United States and internationally. Additional analytic technical support for detecting outbreaks would benefit state, tribal, local, and territorial public health departments and the populations they serve.",JMIR public health and surveillance,2024-Jun,"Levin-Rector A, Kulldorff M, Peterson ER, Hostovich S, Greene SK",5,2677,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

35285684,Generation of Human Lung Organoid Cultures from Healthy and Tumor Tissue to Study Infectious Diseases.,"Respiratory viruses cause mild to severe diseases in humans every year, constituting a major public health problem. Characterizing the pathogenesis in physiologically relevant models is crucial for developing efficient vaccines and therapeutics. Here, we show that lung organoids derived from human primary or lung tumor tissue maintain the cellular composition and characteristics of the original tissue. Moreover, we show that these organoids sustain viral replication with particular infection foci formation, and they activate the expression of interferon-associated and proinflammatory genes responsible for mediating a robust innate immune response. All together, we show that three-dimensional (3D) lung organoids constitute a relevant platform to model diseases and enable the development of drug screenings. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Three-dimensional (3D) human lung organoids reflect the native cell composition of the lung as well as its physiological properties. Human 3D lung organoids offer ideal conditions, such as timely availability in large quantities and high physiological relevance for reassessment and prediction of disease outbreaks of respiratory pathogens and pathogens that use the lung as a primary entry portal. Human lung organoids can be used in basic research and diagnostic settings as early warning cell culture systems and also serve as a relevant platform for modeling infectious diseases and drug development. They can be used to characterize pathogens and analyze the influence of infection on, for example, immunological parameters, such as the expression of interferon-associated and proinflammatory genes in the context of cancer. In our study, we found that cancer-derived lung organoids were more sensitive to influenza A virus infection than those derived from healthy tissue and demonstrated a decreased innate immune response.",Journal of virology,2022-Apr,"Salgueiro L, Kummer S, Sonntag-Buck V, Weiß A, Schneider MA, Kräusslich HG, Sotillo R",7,1865,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Rapid and accurate detection of pathogens is important in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. Metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is an unbiased and comprehensive approach for detecting all RNA and DNA in a sample. With the development of sequencing and bioinformatics technologies, mNGS is moving from research to clinical application, which opens a new avenue for pathogen detection. Numerous studies have revealed good potential for the clinical application of mNGS in infectious diseases, especially in difficult-to-detect, rare, and novel pathogens. However, there are several hurdles in the clinical application of mNGS, such as: (1) lack of universal workflow validation and quality assurance; (2) insensitivity to high-host background and low-biomass samples; and (3) lack of standardized instructions for mass data analysis and report interpretation. Therefore, a complete understanding of this new technology will help promote the clinical application of mNGS to infectious diseases. This review briefly introduces the history of next-generation sequencing, mainstream sequencing platforms, and mNGS workflow, and discusses the clinical applications of mNGS to infectious diseases and its advantages and disadvantages.",Journal of Zhejiang University.

37419128,The challenges in the monitoring of infectious diseases after the earthquake in Türkiye in 2023.,"After the devastating earthquake in Türkiye and Syria in February, 2023, the long-term failure to meet the need for shelter, unfavourable living conditions in tent settlements, poor access to clean drinking water, water suitable for personal hygiene, and sanitary facilities, as well as interruptions in provision of primary health-care services, have emerged as the most important risk factors contributing to the spread of infectious diseases. 3 months after the earthquake, most of these problems persist in Türkiye. Data on the control of infectious diseases are scarce according to the reports prepared by medical specialist associations based on observations of health-care providers working in the region and statements made by the local health authorities. According to these unsystematised data, and considering the conditions in the region, faecal-oral transmissible gastrointestinal infections, as well as respiratory and vector-borne infections, are the main challenges. Vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, varicella, meningitis, and polio can be spread in temporary shelters due to interrupted vaccine services and crowded living conditions. In addition to controlling risk factors for infectious diseases, sharing data on the status and control of infectious diseases in the region with the community, health-care providers, and relevant expert groups should be a priority to improve the understanding of the effects of interventions and prepare for possible infectious disease outbreaks.",The Lancet.

39411713,Future applications of host direct therapies for infectious disease treatment.,"New and emerging pathogens, such as SARS-CoV2 have highlighted the requirement for threat agnostic therapies. Some antibiotics or antivirals can demonstrate broad-spectrum activity against pathogens in the same family or genus but efficacy can quickly reduce due to their specific mechanism of action and for the ability of the disease causing agent to evolve. This has led to the generation of antimicrobial resistant strains, making infectious diseases more difficult to treat. Alternative approaches therefore need to be considered, which include exploring the utility of Host-Directed Therapies (HDTs). This is a growing area with huge potential but difficulties arise due to the complexity of disease profiles. For example, a HDT given early during infection may not be appropriate or as effective when the disease has become chronic or when a patient is in intensive care. With the growing understanding of immune function, a new generation of HDT for the treatment of disease could allow targeting specific pathways to augment or diminish the host response, dependent upon disease profile, and allow for bespoke therapeutic management plans. This review highlights promising and approved HDTs that can manipulate the immune system throughout the spectrum of disease, in particular to viral and bacterial pathogens, and demonstrates how the advantages of HDT will soon outweigh the potential side effects.",Frontiers in immunology,2024-,"Thom RE, D'Elia RV",2,1411,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) aims to support and strengthen this capacity in European Union/ European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries as part of its 2021-27 strategy which includes explicit attention to social and behavioural aspects of disease prevention. To achieve its strategic goals, it is important that ECDC improves its knowledge of prevention strategies, actors and activities in EU/EEA countries. In this Perspective, we summarise three challenges to implementing the prevention framework proposed by ECDC: (i) defining, recognising and identifying with 'prevention', (ii) integrating new understandings into established ways of thinking, and (iii) the need for more attention to prevention in governance. These challenges are derived from the findings of a project which conducted a preliminary mapping of prevention actors, networks and activities in four EU countries to support the development of a community of practice within the new ECDC prevention framework. This Perspective serves to draw attention to this prevention framework and the three identified challenges for those working on its implementation.",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,2024-Oct,"de Vries DH, Geise M, Maukner AC, Kramarz P, Deogan C, Kinsman J",6,1271,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

As people continue to flee Ukraine amid the ongoing pandemic in droves, their exposure to COVID-19 and infectious diseases that are common among the refugee population, such as tuberculosis, is on the rise as well. Also factoring in the fact that Ukraine has a large population living with communicable diseases like HIV and hepatitis C, along with other non-communicable conditions like diabetes and cancer, there is a pronounced need to protect these refugees and local residents from potential public health crises. In this paper, we investigate the challenges that health and government officials face in addressing refugees' health needs and preferences. Furthermore, we discuss the imperative to provide timely and effective health services to refugees, such as psychoneuroimmunology-based interventions that could help address refugees' multifactorial and multifaceted health needs and requirements. While conflicts are inevitable, public health crises are not. In light of the renewed imperative to safeguard shared humanity and solidify global solidarity, collaborative actions are needed to ensure fair, kind, and true public health environments are available to refugees of the current conflict and beyond.","Brain, behavior, and immunity",2022-Jul,"Su Z, McDonnell D, Cheshmehzangi A, Ahmad J, Šegalo S, Pereira da Veiga C, Xiang YT",7,1346,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

38357446,Beyond the acute phase: a comprehensive literature review of long-term sequelae resulting from infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases have consistently served as pivotal influences on numerous civilizations, inducing morbidity, mortality, and consequently redirecting the course of history. Their impact extends far beyond the acute phase, characterized by the majority of symptom presentations, to a multitude of adverse events and sequelae that follow viral, parasitic, fungal, or bacterial infections. In this context, myriad sequelae related to various infectious diseases have been identified, spanning short to long-term durations. Although these sequelae are known to affect thousands of individuals individually, a comprehensive evaluation of all potential long-term effects of infectious diseases has yet to be undertaken. We present a comprehensive literature review delineating the primary sequelae attributable to major infectious diseases, categorized by systems, symptoms, and duration. This compilation serves as a crucial resource, illuminating the long-term ramifications of infectious diseases for healthcare professionals worldwide. Moreover, this review highlights the substantial burden that these sequelae impose on global health and economies, a facet often overshadowed by the predominant focus on the acute phase. Patients are frequently discharged following the resolution of the acute phase, with minimal long-term follow-up to comprehend and address potential sequelae.

This study investigated trends in mortality and the economic burden of infectious diseases. Healthcare data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (2009-2019) and the Korean Statistics Information Service (1997-2019) were used. We selected 10 infectious disease groups (intestinal infections, tuberculosis, vaccine- preventable diseases, sepsis, viral hepatitis, HIV-related diseases, central nervous system infections, rheumatic heart diseases, respiratory tract infections, and arthropod-borne viral diseases). The age-standardized mortality rate for infectious diseases increased from 27.2 per 100,000 population in 1997 to 37.1 per 100,000 population in 2019 and has had an upward trend since 2004. During this same period, significant increases were seen in respiratory tract infections and among elderly persons, especially those aged ≥85 years. The costs for infectious diseases increased from 4.126 billion US dollar (USD) in 2009 to 6.612 billion USD in 2019, with respiratory tract infections accounting for 3.699 billion USD (69%). The annual cost per patient for visits for medical care due to infectious diseases increased from 131 USD in 2009 to 204 USD in 2019. Mortality among elderly persons and those with respiratory tract infections increased during the study period.

In this survey, we explored capacities of village health teams (VHTs) in Sebei communities of Mount Elgon in undertaking surveillance tasks for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in the context of a changing climate. We used participatory epidemiology techniques to elucidate VHTs' perceptions on climate change and public health and assessed their capacities to conduct surveillance for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Overall, VHTs perceived climate change to be occurring with wider impacts on public health. However, they had inadequate capacities in collecting surveillance data. The VHTs lacked transport to navigate through their communities and had insufficient capacities in using mobile phones for sending alerts. They did not engage in reporting other hazards related to the environment, wildlife, and domestic livestock that would accelerate infectious disease outbreaks. Records were not maintained for disease surveillance activities and the abilities of VHTs to analyze data were also limited.

34495538,The Role of Glycosylation in Infectious Diseases.,"Glycosylation plays an important role in infectious diseases. Many important interactions between pathogens and hosts involve their carbohydrate structures (glycans). Glycan interactions can mediate adhesion, recognition, invasion, and immune evasion of pathogens. To date, changes in many protein N/O-linked glycosylation have been identified as biomarkers for the development of infectious diseases and cancers. In this review, we will discuss the principal findings and the roles of glycosylation of both pathogens and host cells in the context of human important infectious diseases. Understanding the role and mechanism of glycan-lectin interaction between pathogens and hosts may create a new paradigm for discovering novel glycan-based therapies that can lead to eradication or functional cure of pathogens infection.",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2021-,"Zhang XL, Qu H",2,824,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Furthermore, the field of explainable AI and ML has gained particular relevance and is attracting increasing interest. Infectious diseases have already started to benefit from explainable AI/ML models. For example, they have been employed or proposed to better understand complex models aimed at improving the diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019, in the field of antimicrobial resistance prediction and in quantum vaccine algorithms.

This article aimed to describe those among travelers to Japan. This is a descriptive study based on national surveillance data. Imported infectious disease cases were defined as those with a reported overseas source of infection among 15 diseases pre-selected based on the probability and impact of importation. The number of notified cases from April 2016 to March 2021 were described by disease and time of diagnosis. The relative ratio and absolute difference in case counts-both by number and per arrival-were calculated by disease comparing those from the pandemic period (April 2020-March 2021) to the pre-pandemic period (April 2016-March 2020). A total of 3,524 imported infectious disease cases were diagnosed during the study period, including 3,439 cases before and 85 cases during the pandemic. The proportionate distribution of diseases changed but notification counts of all 15 diseases decreased during the pandemic. Accounting for arrivals, however, seven diseases showed a two-fold or greater increase, with a notable absolute increase per million arrivals for amebiasis (60.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 41.5-78.7), malaria (21.7; 95% CI, 10.5-33.0), and typhoid fever (9.3; 95% CI, 1.9-16.8).

While the number of imported infectious disease cases decreased, the number of cases per arrivals increased considerably both in relative and absolute terms for several diseases of public health and clinical importance.",Journal of epidemiology,2024-Apr,"Kasamatsu A, Kanou K, Fukusumi M, Arima Y, Omori S, Nakamura H, Sato T, Serizawa Y, Takeda A, Fujikura H, Ikenoue C, Nishiki S, Fujiya Y, Arashiro T, Takahashi T, Shimada T, Suzuki M, Sunagawa T",18,1681,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34215513,Regional Rodent-Borne Infectious Diseases in North America: What Wilderness Medicine Providers Need to Know.,"Rodents can transmit infectious diseases directly to humans and other animals via bites and exposure to infectious salivary aerosols and excreta. Arthropods infected while blood-feeding on rodents can also transmit rodent-borne pathogens indirectly to humans and animals. Environmental events, such as wet winters, cooler summers, heavy rains, and flooding, have precipitated regional rodent-borne infectious disease outbreaks; these outbreaks are now increasing with climate change. The objectives of this review are to inform wilderness medicine providers about the environmental conditions that can precipitate rodent-borne infectious disease outbreaks; to describe the regional geographic distributions of rodent-borne infectious diseases in North America; and to recommend prophylactic treatments and effective prevention and control strategies for rodent-borne infectious diseases. To meet these objectives, Internet search engines were queried with keywords to identify scientific articles on outbreaks of the most common regional rodent-borne infectious diseases in North America. Wilderness medicine providers should maintain high levels of suspicion for regional rodent-borne diseases in patients who develop febrile illnesses after exposure to contaminated freshwater after heavy rains or floods and after swimming, rafting, or paddling in endemic areas. Public health education strategies should encourage limiting human contact with rodents; avoiding contact with or safely disposing of rodent excreta; avoiding contact with contaminated floodwaters, especially contact with open wounds; securely containing outdoor food stores; and modifying wilderness cabins and campsites to deter rodent colonization.",Wilderness & environmental medicine,2021-Sep,Diaz JH,1,1717,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Based on the UK Biobank, the prospective cohort study included a total of 396,080 participants without diabetes at baseline. We determined the types and sites of infectious diseases and incident T2D using the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision codes (ICD-10). Time-varying Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the association. Infection burden was defined as the number of infection episodes over time and the number of co-occurring infections. Genetic risk score (GRS) for T2D consisted of 424 single nucleotide polymorphisms. During a median of 9.04 [IQR, 8.3-9.7] years of follow-up, hospital-treated infectious diseases were associated with a greater risk of T2D (adjusted HR [aHR] 1.54 [95 % CI 1.46-1.61]), with risk difference per 10,000 individuals equal to 154.1 [95 % CI 140.7-168.2]. The heightened risk persisted after 5 years following the index infection. Bacterial infection with sepsis had the strongest risk of T2D (aHR 2.95 [95 % CI 2.53-3.44]) among different infection types. For site-specific analysis, bloodstream infections posed the greatest risk (3.01 [95 % CI 2.60-3.48]). A dose-response association was observed between infection burden and T2D risk within each GRS tertile (p-trend <0.001). High genetic risk and infection synergistically increased the T2D risk. Infectious diseases were associated with an increased risk of subsequent T2D. The risk showed specificity according to types, sites, severity of infection and the period since infection occurred.

37698368,Province clustering based on the percentage of communicable disease using the BCBimax biclustering algorithm.,"Indonesia needs to lower its high infectious disease rate. This requires reliable data and following their temporal changes across provinces. We investigated the benefits of surveying the epidemiological situation with the imax biclustering algorithm using secondary data from a recent national scale survey of main infectious diseases from the National Basic Health Research (Riskesdas) covering 34 provinces in Indonesia. Hierarchical and k-means clustering can only handle one data source, but BCBimax biclustering can cluster rows and columns in a data matrix. Several experiments determined the best row and column threshold values, which is crucial for a useful result. The percentages of Indonesia's seven most common infectious diseases (ARI, pneumonia, diarrhoea, tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis, malaria, and filariasis) were ordered by province to form groups without considering proximity because clusters are usually far apart. ARI, pneumonia, and diarrhoea were divided into toddler and adult infections, making 10 target diseases instead of seven. The set of biclusters formed based on the presence and level of these diseases included 7 diseases with moderate to high disease levels, 5 diseases (formed by 2 clusters), 3 diseases, 2 diseases, and a final order that only included adult diarrhoea. In 6 of 8 clusters, diarrhea was the most prevalent infectious disease in Indonesia, making its eradication a priority. Direct person-to-person infections like ARI, pneumonia, TB, and diarrhoea were found in 4-6 of 8 clusters. These diseases are more common and spread faster than vector-borne diseases like malaria and filariasis, making them more important.",Geospatial health,2023-Sep,"Aidi MN, Wulandari C, Oktarina SD, Aditra TR, Ernawati F, Efriwati E, Nurjanah N, Rachmawati R, Julianti ED, Sundari D, Retiaty F, Arifin AY, Dewi RM, Nazaruddin N, Salimar S, Fuada N, Widodo Y, Setyawati B, Nurhidayati N, Sudikno S, Irawan IR, Widoretno W",22,1669,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

32673307,Data-driven contact structures: From homogeneous mixing to multilayer networks.,"The modeling of the spreading of communicable diseases has experienced significant advances in the last two decades or so. This has been possible due to the proliferation of data and the development of new methods to gather, mine and analyze it. A key role has also been played by the latest advances in new disciplines like network science. Nonetheless, current models still lack a faithful representation of all possible heterogeneities and features that can be extracted from data. Here, we bridge a current gap in the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases and develop a framework that allows to account simultaneously for both the connectivity of individuals and the age-structure of the population. We compare different scenarios, namely, i) the homogeneous mixing setting, ii) one in which only the social mixing is taken into account, iii) a setting that considers the connectivity of individuals alone, and finally, iv) a multilayer representation in which both the social mixing and the number of contacts are included in the model. We analytically show that the thresholds obtained for these four scenarios are different. In addition, we conduct extensive numerical simulations and conclude that heterogeneities in the contact network are important for a proper determination of the epidemic threshold, whereas the age-structure plays a bigger role beyond the onset of the outbreak. Altogether, when it comes to evaluate interventions such as vaccination, both sources of individual heterogeneity are important and should be concurrently considered. Our results also provide an indication of the errors incurred in situations in which one cannot access all needed information in terms of connectivity and age of the population.",PLoS computational biology,2020-Jul,"Aleta A, Ferraz de Arruda G, Moreno Y",3,1744,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Here, we report the epidemiological features and changes in notifiable infectious diseases in China from 1986 to 2016 to explore the factors contributing to the successful control of infectious diseases and the challenges faced in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. The data of notifiable infectious diseases in China from 1986 to 2016 were collected from the monthly analysis report of the National Infectious Disease Surveillance System. Joinpoint regression models were used to examine incidence and mortality trends from 1986 to 2016. IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0, Excel 2010 and R x64 3.5.2 were used for data analysis. A total of 132 858 005 cases of notifiable infectious diseases were reported over these 31 years, with an average yearly incidence of 342.14/100 000. There were 284 694 deaths with an average yearly mortality rate of 0.73/100 000. The overall incidence and overall mortality of notifiable infectious diseases both showed a ""U"" distribution (ie, a decrease, stable, an increase, stable again). The top five diseases in terms of incidence were hand, foot and mouth disease, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis, other infectious causes of diarrhea and dysentery, accounting for 78.0% of all reported cases. The top five causes of death were HIV/AIDS, rabies, tuberculosis, viral hepatitis and epidemic encephalitis B, which accounted for 76.07% of all mortalities. The diseases with the top five fatality rates were rabies, H5N1, H7N9, HIV/AIDS and plague, with rates of 91.06%, 66.07%, 38.51%, 25.19% and 10.31%, respectively.

38278123,Lateral flow immunoassay based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering using pH-induced phage-templated hierarchical plasmonic assembly for point-of-care diagnosis of infectious disease.,"The outbreak of emerging infectious diseases gave rise to the demand for reliable point-of-care testing methods to diagnose and manage those diseases in early onset. However, the current on-site testing methods including lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) suffer from the inaccurate diagnostic result due to the low sensitivity. Herein, we present the surface-enhanced Raman scattering-based lateral flow immunoassay (SERS-LFIA) by introducing phage-templated hierarchical plasmonic assembly (PHPA) nanoprobes to diagnose a contagious disease. The PHPA was fabricated using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) assembled on bacteriophage MS2, where inter-particle gap sizes can be adjusted by pH-induced morphological alteration of MS2 coat proteins to provide the maximum SERS amplification efficiency via plasmon coupling. The plasmonic probes based on the PHPA produce strong and reproducible SERS signal that leads to sensitive and reliable diagnostic results in SERS-LFIA. The developed SERS-LFIA targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies for a proof of concept had <100 pg/mL detection limits with high specificity in serum, proving it as an effective diagnostic device for the infectious diseases. Clinical validation using human serum samples further confirmed that the PHPA-based SERS-LFIA can distinguish the patients with COVID-19 from healthy controls with significant accuracy. These outcomes prove that the developed SERS-LFIA biosensor can be an alternative point-of-care testing (POCT) method against the emerging infectious diseases, in combination with the commercially available portable Raman devices.",Biosensors & bioelectronics,2024-Apr,"Jeon MJ, Kim SK, Hwang SH, Lee JU, Sim SJ",5,1648,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
36117592,A simple nomogram for predicting infectious diseases in adult kidney transplantation recipients.,"To investigate the risk factors of infectious diseases in adult kidney transplantation recipients and to establish a simple and novel nomogram to guide the prophylactic antimicrobial therapy. Patients who received kidney transplantation between January 2018 and October 2021 were included in the study and were divided into a training and a testing set at a 1:1 ratio. Risk factors correlated to infectious diseases were selected using a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model. The prediction model was built by incorporating the variables selected by the LASSO model into a logistic regression equation. Calibration curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also applied to assess the model calibration and discrimination. A nomogram consisting of the selected factors was established to provide individualized risks of developing infections. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was adopted to estimate the net benefit and reduction in interventions for a range of clinically reasonable risk thresholds. In all, 863 adult kidney recipients were included in the study, and 407 (47.16%) of them developed infectious diseases during the 3-year follow-up period. A total of 8 variables were selected using LASSO regression and were retained for subsequent model construction and infection prediction. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.83 and 0.81 in the training and testing sets, with high F scores of 0.76 and 0.77, sensitivity of 0.76 and 0.81, and specificity of 0.88 and 0.74, respectively. A novel nomogram was developed based on 8 selected predictors (requirement for albumin infusion, requirement for red blood cell infusion, triglyceride, uric acid, creatinine, globulin, neutrophil percentage, and white blood cells). The net benefit indicated that the nomogram would reduce unnecessary interventions at a wide range of threshold probabilities in both sets. Adult kidney transplantation recipients are high-risk hosts for infectious diseases. The novel nomogram consisting of 8 factors reveals good predictive performance and may promote the reasonable antimicrobial prescription. More external validations are required to confirm its effectiveness for further clinical application.",Frontiers in public health,2022-,"Chen RY, Zhang S, Zhuang SY, Li DW, Zhang M, Zhu C, Yu YT, Yuan XD",8,2241,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33303514,Achieving flexible competence: bridging the investment dichotomy between infectious diseases and cancer.,"Today's global health challenges in underserved communities include the growing burden of cancer and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs); infectious diseases (IDs) with epidemic and pandemic potential such as COVID-19; and health effects from catastrophic 'all hazards' disasters including natural, industrial or terrorist incidents. Healthcare disparities in low-income and middle-income countries and in some rural areas in developed countries make it a challenge to mitigate these health, socioeconomic and political consequences on our globalised society. As with IDs, cancer requires rapid intervention and its effective medical management and prevention encompasses the other major NCDs. Furthermore, the technology and clinical capability for cancer care enables management of NCDs and IDs. Global health initiatives that call for action to address IDs and cancer often focus on each problem separately, or consider cancer care only a downstream investment to primary care, missing opportunities to leverage investments that could support broader capacity-building. From our experience in health disparities, disaster preparedness, government policy and healthcare systems we have initiated an approach we call <i>flex-competence</i> which emphasises a systems approach from the outset of program building that integrates investment among IDs, cancer, NCDs and disaster preparedness to improve overall healthcare for the local community. This approach builds on trusted partnerships, multi-level strategies and a healthcare infrastructure providing surge capacities to more rapidly respond to and manage a wide range of changing public health threats.",BMJ global health,2020-Dec,"Coleman CN, Mansoura MK, Marinissen MJ, Grover S, Dosanjh M, Brereton HD, Roth L, Wendling E, Pistenmaa DA, O'Brien DM",10,1661,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34367158,Sexual Dimorphism and Gender in Infectious Diseases.,"Epidemiological studies and clinical observations show evidence of sexual dimorphism in infectious diseases. Women are at less risk than men when it comes to developing most infectious diseases. However, understanding these observations requires a gender approach that takes into account an analysis of both biological and social factors. The host's response to infection differs in males and females because sex differences have an impact on hormonal and chromosomal control of immunity. Estradiol appears to confer protective immunity, while progesterone and testosterone suppress anti-infectious responses. In addition, genetic factors, including those associated with sex chromosomes, also affect susceptibility to infections. Finally, differences in occupational activities, lifestyle, and comorbidities play major roles in exposure to pathogens and management of diseases. Hence, considering sexual dimorphism as a critical variable for infectious diseases should be one of the steps taken toward developing personalized therapeutic approaches.",Frontiers in immunology,2021-,"Gay L, Melenotte C, Lakbar I, Mezouar S, Devaux C, Raoult D, Bendiane MK, Leone M, Mège JL",9,1050,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

33395431,The winding road to health: A systematic scoping review on the effect of geographical accessibility to health care on infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries.,"Geographical accessibility to healthcare is an important component of infectious disease dynamics. Timely access to health facilities can prevent disease progression and enables disease notification through surveillance systems. The importance of accounting for physical accessibility in response to infectious diseases is increasingly recognized. Yet, there is no comprehensive review of the literature available on infectious diseases in relation to geographical accessibility to care. Therefore, we aimed at evaluating the current state of knowledge on the effect of geographical accessibility to health care on infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries. A search strategy was developed and conducted on Web of Science and PubMed on 4 March 2019. New publications were checked until May 28, 2020. All publication dates were eligible. Data was charted into a tabular format and descriptive data analyses were carried out to identify geographical regions, infectious diseases, and measures of physical accessibility among other factors. Search queries in PubMed and Web of Science yielded 560 unique publications. After title and abstract screening 99 articles were read in full detail, from which 64 articles were selected, including 10 manually. Results of the included publications could be broadly categorized into three groups: (1) decreased spatial accessibility to health care was associated with a higher infectious disease burden, (2) decreased accessibility was associated to lower disease reporting, minimizing true understanding of disease distribution, and (3) the occurrence of an infectious disease outbreak negatively impacted health care accessibility in affected regions. In the majority of studies, poor geographical accessibility to health care was associated with higher disease incidence, more severe health outcomes, higher mortality, and lower disease reporting. No difference was seen between countries or infectious diseases. Currently, policy-makers and scientists rely on data collected through passive surveillance systems, introducing uncertainty on disease estimates for remote communities. Our results highlight the need for increasing integration of geographical accessibility measures in disease risk modelling, allowing more realistic disease estimates and enhancing our understanding of true disease burden. Additionally, disease risk estimates could be used in turn to optimize the allocation of health services in the prevention and detection of infectious diseases.",PloS one,2021-,"Hierink F, Okiro EA, Flahault A, Ray N",4,2519,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
37905966,From Snow's map of cholera transmission to dynamic catchment boundary delineation: current front lines in spatial analysis.,"The history of mapping infectious diseases dates back to the 19th century when Dr John Snow utilised spatial analysis to pinpoint the source of the 1854 cholera outbreak in London, a ground-breaking work that laid the foundation for modern epidemiology and disease mapping (Newsom, 2006). As technology advanced, so did mapping techniques. In the late 20th century, geographic information systems (GIS) revolutionized disease mapping by enabling researchers to overlay diverse datasets to visualise and analyse complex spatial patterns (Bergquist & Manda 2019; Hashtarkhani et al., 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic showed that disease mapping is particularly valuable for optimising prevention and control strategies of infectious diseases by prioritising geographical targeting interventions and containment strategies (Mohammadi et al., 2021). Today, with the aid of highresolution satellite imagery, geo-referenced electronic data collection systems, real-time data feeds, and sophisticated modelling algorithms, disease mapping has become a feasible and accessible tool for public health officials in tracking, managing, and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases at global, regional and local scales (Hay et al., 2013).

33863279,Online respondent-driven detection for enhanced contact tracing of close-contact infectious diseases: benefits and barriers for public health practice.,"Online respondent-driven detection (RDD) is a novel method of case finding that can enhance contact tracing (CT). However, the advantages and challenges of RDD for CT have not yet been investigated from the perspective of public health professionals (PHPs). Therefore, it remains unclear if, and under what circumstances, PHPs are willing to apply RDD for CT. Between March and April 2019, we conducted semi-structured interviews with Dutch PHPs responsible for CT in practice. Questions were derived from the 'diffusion of innovations' theory. Between May and June 2019, we distributed an online questionnaire among 260 Dutch PHPs to quantify the main qualitative findings. Using different hypothetical scenarios, we assessed anticipated advantages and challenges of RDD, and PHPs' intention to apply RDD for CT. Twelve interviews were held, and 70 PHPs completed the online questionnaire. A majority of questionnaire respondents (71%) had a positive intention towards using RDD for CT. Anticipated advantages of RDD were 'accommodating easy and autonomous participation in CT of index cases and contact persons', and 'reaching contact persons more efficiently'. Anticipated challenges were 'limited opportunities for PHPs to support, motivate, and coordinate the execution of CT', 'not being able to adequately convey measures to index cases and contact persons', and 'anticipated unrest among index cases and contact persons'. Circumstances under which PHPs anticipated RDD applicable for CT included index cases and contact persons being reluctant to share information directly with PHPs, digitally skilled and literate persons being involved, and large scale CT. Circumstances under which PHPs anticipated RDD less applicable for CT included severe consequences of missing information or contact persons for individual or public health, involvement of complex or impactful measures for index cases and contact persons, and a disease being perceived as severe or sensitive by index cases and their contact persons. PHPs generally perceived RDD as a potentially beneficial method for public health practice, that may help overcome challenges present in traditional CT, and could be used during outbreaks of infectious diseases that spread via close contact. The circumstances under which CT is performed, appear to strongly influence PHPs' intention to use RDD for CT.",BMC infectious diseases,2021-Apr,"Helms YB, Hamdiui N, Eilers R, Hoebe C, Dukers-Muijrers N, van den Kerkhof H, Timen A, Stein ML",8,2371,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39366706,The impact of increasing temperatures due to climate change on infectious diseases.,"Global temperatures will continue to rise due to climate change, with high temperature periods expected to increase in intensity, frequency, and duration. Infectious diseases, including vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever and malaria, waterborne diseases such as cholera, and foodborne diseases such as salmonellosis are influenced by temperature and other climatic variables, thus contributing to higher disease burden and associated healthcare costs, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged regions. Targeted efforts and investments are therefore needed to support low and middle income countries to prepare for and respond to the increasing infectious disease threats posed by rising temperatures. This can be facilitated by the development and refinement of robust disease and entomological surveillance and early warning systems with integration of climatic information that promote enhanced understanding of the geographic distribution of disease risk. To enhance healthcare workforce capacity and capability to respond to these public health threats, medical curricula and continuing professional education programmes for healthcare providers must include evidence based components on the impacts of climate change on infectious diseases.",BMJ (Clinical research ed.),2024-Oct,"Anikeeva O, Hansen A, Varghese B, Borg M, Zhang Y, Xiang J, Bi P",7,1260,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

33871898,Modeling and computation of multistep batch testing for infectious diseases.,"We propose a mathematical model based on probability theory to optimize COVID-19 testing by a multistep batch testing approach with variable batch sizes. This model and simulation tool dramatically increase the efficiency and efficacy of the tests in a large population at a low cost, particularly when the infection rate is low. The proposed method combines statistical modeling with numerical methods to solve nonlinear equations and obtain optimal batch sizes at each step of tests, with the flexibility to incorporate geographic and demographic information. In theory, this method substantially improves the false positive rate and positive predictive value as well. We also conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to verify this theory. Our simulation results show that our method significantly reduces the false negative rate. More accurate assessment can be made if the dilution effect or other practical factors are taken into consideration. The proposed method will be particularly useful for the early detection of infectious diseases and prevention of future pandemics. The proposed work will have broader impacts on medical testing for contagious diseases in general.",Biometrical journal.

39187581,Bottom-up synthetic immunology.,"Infectious diseases and cancer evade immune surveillance using similar mechanisms. Targeting immune mechanisms using common strategies thus represents a promising avenue to improve prevention and treatment. Synthetic immunology can provide such strategies by applying engineering principles from synthetic biology to immunology. Synthetic biologists engineer cells by top-down genetic manipulation or bottom-up assembly from nanoscale building blocks. Recent successes in treating advanced tumours and diseases using genetically engineered immune cells highlight the power of the top-down synthetic immunology approach. However, genetic immune engineering is mostly limited to ex vivo applications and is subject to complex counter-regulation inherent to immune functions. Bottom-up synthetic biology can harness the rich nanotechnology toolbox to engineer molecular and cellular systems from scratch and equip them with desired functions. These are beginning to be tailored to perform targeted immune functions and should hence allow intervention strategies by rational design. In this Perspective we conceptualize bottom-up synthetic immunology as a new frontier field that uses nanotechnology for crucial innovations in therapy and the prevention of infectious diseases and cancer.",Nature nanotechnology,2024-Nov,"Göpfrich K, Platten M, Frischknecht F, Fackler OT",4,1284,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
31539636,Machine learning for clinical decision support in infectious diseases: a narrative review of current applications.,"Machine learning (ML) is a growing field in medicine. This narrative review describes the current body of literature on ML for clinical decision support in infectious diseases (ID). We aim to inform clinicians about the use of ML for diagnosis, classification, outcome prediction and antimicrobial management in ID. References for this review were identified through searches of MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, biorXiv, ACM Digital Library, arXiV and IEEE Xplore Digital Library up to July 2019. We found 60 unique ML-clinical decision support systems (ML-CDSS) aiming to assist ID clinicians. Overall, 37 (62%) focused on bacterial infections, 10 (17%) on viral infections, nine (15%) on tuberculosis and four (7%) on any kind of infection. Among them, 20 (33%) addressed the diagnosis of infection, 18 (30%) the prediction, early detection or stratification of sepsis, 13 (22%) the prediction of treatment response, four (7%) the prediction of antibiotic resistance, three (5%) the choice of antibiotic regimen and two (3%) the choice of a combination antiretroviral therapy. The ML-CDSS were developed for intensive care units (n = 24, 40%), ID consultation (n = 15, 25%), medical or surgical wards (n = 13, 20%), emergency department (n = 4, 7%), primary care (n = 3, 5%) and antimicrobial stewardship (n = 1, 2%). Fifty-three ML-CDSS (88%) were developed using data from high-income countries and seven (12%) with data from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The evaluation of ML-CDSS was limited to measures of performance (e.g. sensitivity, specificity) for 57 ML-CDSS (95%) and included data in clinical practice for three (5%). Considering comprehensive patient data from socioeconomically diverse healthcare settings, including primary care and LMICs, may improve the ability of ML-CDSS to suggest decisions adapted to various clinical contexts. Currents gaps identified in the evaluation of ML-CDSS must also be addressed in order to know the potential impact of such tools for clinicians and patients.",Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,2020-May,"Peiffer-Smadja N, Rawson TM, Ahmad R, Buchard A, Georgiou P, Lescure FX, Birgand G, Holmes AH",8,2027,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The affected population are served by eight Early Warning Alert and Response Network (EWARN) systems for outbreak detection and response. This study aimed to compare structure, function and performance of the systems' adherence to current guidance, and noted emerging lessons. This study included a review of published and unpublished literature, a structured survey and interviews. Findings showed that all systems adhered to basic EWARN structure. Four of eight systems had electronic platforms, while one was implementing one. Regarding key EWARN function of outbreak detection: of the 35 health conditions, 26 were communicable diseases and nine were non-communicable; two systems focused on epidemic-prone diseases. Half the systems achieved ≥60% population coverage, five achieved ≥80% reporting timeliness, six achieved ≥80% reporting completeness, and seven achieved verification of ≥80% of alerts of suspected outbreaks. The findings showed that the systems followed the EWARN structure, while increasing adoption of electronic platforms. Performance, including timeliness and completeness of reporting, and timely verification of alerts were optimal for most of the systems. However, population coverage was low for most of the systems, and the EWARN's primary focus of outbreak detection was undermined by the increasing number of non-epidemic diseases.",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2021-Apr,"Mala P, Abubakar A, Takeuchi A, Buliva E, Husain F, Malik MR, Tayyab M, Elnoserry S",8,1459,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

We examined in this study differences in the use of medicines among different age and sex groups of the study participants. Fifteen different refugee shared accommodation centres in the greater Cologne area, a community centre with a language school and consultation office, and other places frequented by the Syrian community. Syrian AS&Rs registered in NRW and residing in the city of Cologne or surrounding areas. The prevalence of using at least one medicine in the 7 days preceding data collection, and the use of prescribed medicines and self-medication. Of the 1641 Syrian AS&Rs who took part in our study, the overall 7-day prevalence of medicine use was 34.9%. Among adults, headache and hypertension were the most common indications that led to medicine use. By dose, hypertension (954 doses) and diabetes (595 doses) were the first and second most frequent indication. Among children, fever and cough were the most common indication; ibuprofen and hederae helicis folium preparations were the most used medicines. Low prevalence was found of medicine use for the treatment of either infectious diseases or mental disorders. Among the Syrian AS&Rs in NRW who participated in the study, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were common presumed causes of use of medication among adults. We encourage future studies to pay more attention to NCDs medicine use among AS&Rs. Researchers should also consider reaching AS&Rs who live in private housing and not limit studies only to newly arrived AS&Rs who live in shared accommodation centres.",BMJ open,2021-Sep,"Aljadeeah S, Wirtz VJ, Nagel E",3,1775,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34288795,Adjuvants: friends in vaccine formulations against infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases represent a major cause of deaths worldwide. No vaccine or effective treatment exists nowadays, especially against intracellular pathogens. The increase in multiple drug and superbug antibiotic resistance strains, excessive medication, or misuse of drugs has prompted the search for other safe and effective alternatives. Consistent with this, adjuvants (Latin word ""adjuvare"": ""help or aid"") co-administered (Exo) in vaccines have emerged as a promising alternative to initiate and boost an innate, downstream signal that led to adaptative immune response. Nowadays, a promising model of strong immunogens and adjuvants at mucosal sites are the microbial bacterial toxins. Other adjuvants that are also used and might successfully replace aluminum salts in combination with nanotechnology are CpG-ODN, poly IC, type I IFNs, mRNA platforms.

33296387,How to better communicate the exponential growth of infectious diseases.,"Exponential growth bias is the phenomenon whereby humans underestimate exponential growth. In the context of infectious diseases, this bias may lead to a failure to understand the magnitude of the benefit of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Communicating the same scenario in different ways (framing) has been found to have a large impact on people's evaluations and behavior in the contexts of social behavior, risk taking and health care. We find that framing matters for people's assessment of the benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions. In two commonly used frames, most subjects in our experiment drastically underestimate the number of cases avoided by adopting non-pharmaceutical interventions. Framing growth in terms of doubling times rather than growth rates reduces the bias. When the scenario is framed in terms of time gained rather than cases avoided, the median subject assesses the benefit of non-pharmaceutical interventions correctly.

The clinical utility of mNGS, especially its real-world impact on antimicrobial treatment and patient outcome has not been systematically evaluated. We prospectively assessed the effectiveness of mNGS in 70 febrile inpatients with suspected infections at Hematology department of the Children's Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health. 69/70 patients were given empirical antibiotics prior to mNGS. A total of 104 samples (62 plasma, 34 throat swabs, 4 bone marrow, 4 bronchoalveolar lavage) were collected on day 1-28 (mean 6.9) following symptom onset and underwent mNGS testing. Traditional microbiological tests discovered causal microorganisms in 5/70 (7.14%) patients, which were also detected by mNGS. In addition, mNGS reported possible pathogens when routine tests were negative. Antibiotics were adjusted accordingly in 55/70 (78.6%) patients that led to improvement/relief of symptoms within 3 days. In contrast, mNGS results were considered irrelevant in 15/70 (21.4%) patients by a board of clinicians, based on biochemical, serological, imaging evidence, and experiences. mNGS expanded the capacity of pathogen detection and made a positive impact on clinical management of suspected infections through (a) differential diagnosis which may rule out infectious diseases and (b) adjustment or de-escalation of empirical antibiotics.",International journal of laboratory hematology,2021-Apr,"Shen H, Shen D, Song H, Wu X, Xu C, Su G, Liu C, Zhang J",8,1503,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Our patient presented with a prolonged febrile state of unknown origin. Clinical presentation, extensive medical workup and classic microbiologic testing were non-conclusive. Several infectious agents and other causes for the febrile state were excluded. In the end, a broad-range 16S rDNA PCR was to be performed to confirm the diagnosis of CNM infection. Treatment was successful with doxycycline. Due to the obscurity of the pathogen, diagnostic workup in CNM is prolonged and challenging.

Sierra Leone has one of the world's highest prevalences of functional difficulties among children, but little is known about the co-occurrence of major infectious diseases and healthcare-seeking behaviours among children with disabilities. We used household survey cross-sectional data on children 2-4 years old and logistic regression models estimating ORs between functional difficulties and symptoms of infectious diseases including diarrhoea, fever and acute respiratory infection (ARI), adjusted for sex, age and stunting. We also examined whether caregivers sought advice or treatment for the illness from any source and if the child was given any treatment for the illness. There was an increased risk of fever among children with functional difficulty (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8) and children with severe functional difficulty (AOR=1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.7). Children with severe functional difficulty were also at increased risk of diarrhoea (AOR=1.8, 95% CI=1.1 to 3.3). There were no significant differences in seeking advice or treatment for diarrhoea, fever or ARI symptoms between the groups.

Refugees settled at the Thai-Myanmar border are fully dependent on support for health services, shelter, food, education, water, and sanitation. The Non-Governmental Organization Malteser International developed an integrated Primary Health Care program in close cooperation with trained camp residents over 25 years in the two settlements under its supervision. The project has been funded by the European Commission Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO). This was a retrospective primary health care project evaluation. All-cause mortality; morbidity trends in malaria, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), watery diarrhea, and dysentery; and health service utilization covering a time span of 18 years were assessed. Programmatic changes in the Primary Health Care (PHC) project and events with a potential effect on health of the target population were examined. Despite the continuous drain of trained health care workers, the volatile influx of refugees, and the isolated location of the two camps, the initial basic curative health care developed into an integrated and comprehensive PHC project including a SPHERE-compliant water, sanitation, and hygiene program. Malaria, LRTIs, watery diarrhea, and dysentery morbidity dropped twelve, three, two, and fivefold, respectively, over the 18-year period evaluated while the health services utilization dropped from 7.1 to 2.9 consultations per refugee/year. The international community may face situations where integration of refugees into the health services of the host country is not possible. In such a context, integrated and evidence-based PHC adequately funded and implemented by one health agency is an effective and relevant approach to reduce the infectious diseases burden under the constraints of semipermanent living conditions.",Primary health care research & development,2022-Mar,"Mohr O, Benner MT, Sansoenboon A, Kaloy W, McGready R, Carrara VI",6,2038,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This study was designed retrospectively. Among the notifiable group A infectious diseases, acute intestinal infections (AIIs) with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision diagnosis codes A09 (diarrhea and gastroenteritis presumed to be of infectious origin), R11 (nausea and vomiting), and K52 (other noninfectious gastroenteritis and colitis), as well as influenza, tuberculosis, measles, varicella, malaria, and meningococcal meningitis were included in the scope of this study.The data of the selected infectious diseases in Ankara Province for the last 2 years before the pandemic (January 2018-December 2019) and for the 2-year period of the pandemic (January 2020-December 2021) were analyzed after checking the data. The number of cases were presented as frequencies, the 1-sample chi-squared test was used in the statistical analysis and the statistical significance level (α) was taken as 0.05. The findings for each disease/disease group were discussed under separate headings. Comparing the prepandemic period (2018-2019) with the pandemic period (2020-2021), the decreases in the number of cases of selected infectious diseases, except influenza, were statistically significant. Undoubtedly, the experience gained from the pandemic struggle will guide us in shaping our future lives.

Other articles were on COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus, <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, group A <i>Streptococcus</i>, mpox (formerly monkeypox), 5 sexually transmitted infections, and gastrointestinal or vectorborne pathogens. Most studies showed higher prevalence, incidence, or measures of risk for infectious diseases among people experiencing homelessness as compared with people who are housed or the general population. Although having increased published data that quantify the infectious disease risks of homelessness is encouraging, many pathogens that are known to affect people globally who are not housed have not been evaluated in the United States or Canada.

There has been a rapid escalation in case numbers despite efforts to contain it and the WHO has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. To date, over 51 257 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported, the majority in non-endemic countries, with 3279 in the UK. It is vital for ophthalmologists to understand this disease and the risk it poses.  Human monkeypox is a zoonotic disease caused by the monkeypox virus, a double-stranded DNA virus in the <i>Orthopoxvirus</i> genus of the <i>Poxviridae</i> family. Other orthopoxviruses include variola (smallpox), cowpox and vaccinia; all of which have significant ocular sequelae. Transmission occurs from an animal reservoir (unknown, likely rodents) to a human host, leading to secondary human-to-human spread. During the recent outbreak, a higher incidence has been found in gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men.  Clinical diagnosis may be challenging as presentation can mimic common ophthalmic diseases. A thorough history is key to identifying potential cases. Ophthalmic manifestations may include preseptal cellulitis, conjunctivitis and keratitis. The oral antiviral agent tecovirimat, which was developed to treat smallpox, is the mainstay of treatment. Trifluorothymidine (trifluridine) eye-drops can be used for ophthalmic involvement. In addition, smallpox vaccines have provided some cross-immunity.  Ocular monkeypox should be managed by infectious diseases specialists, in consultation with ophthalmologists to provide the expertise needed to treat potentially vision-threatening complications.

35919978,Anticipating infectious disease re-emergence and elimination: a test of early warning signals using empirically based models.,"Timely forecasts of the emergence, re-emergence and elimination of human infectious diseases allow for proactive, rather than reactive, decisions that save lives. Recent theory suggests that a generic feature of dynamical systems approaching a tipping point-early warning signals (EWS) due to critical slowing down (CSD)-can anticipate disease emergence and elimination. Empirical studies documenting CSD in observed disease dynamics are scarce, but such demonstration of concept is essential to the further development of model-independent outbreak detection systems. Here, we use fitted, mechanistic models of measles transmission in four cities in Niger to detect CSD through statistical EWS. We find that several EWS accurately anticipate measles re-emergence and elimination, suggesting that CSD should be detectable before disease transmission systems cross key tipping points. These findings support the idea that statistical signals based on CSD, coupled with decision-support algorithms and expert judgement, could provide the basis for early warning systems of disease outbreaks.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2022-Aug,"Tredennick AT, O'Dea EB, Ferrari MJ, Park AW, Rohani P, Drake JM",6,1089,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Few studies and no definite clinical guidelines for these conditions are available. The present study aimed to elucidate the causes and factors associated with prolongation of liver enzyme elevation. We also investigated actual real-world practices in Korea. A retrospective study was performed on all patients younger than 18 years, who visited six tertiary teaching hospitals around Korea in 2018 for acute infectious diseases and showed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels above 60 IU/L without other specific conditions that could cause ALT elevation. We categorized the infections that cause LFT elevation into six groups: respiratory infection, gastrointestinal infection, urinary tract infection, other febrile disease, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and cytomegalovirus infection. We collected data on the medical specialty of the attending physician who followed up the subject, follow-up duration, percentage of follow-up loss, and their investigation. A total of 613 patients were enrolled in this study, half of whom (50.7%) were younger than 12 months. The mean initial aspartate aminotransferase and ALT values were 171.2 ± 274.1 and 194.9 ± 316.1 IU/L (range 23-2,881, 60-2,949 IU/L), respectively; however, other LFTs were within the normal range. Respiratory infection was the most common diagnosis (45.0%), and rhinovirus was the most commonly identified pathogen (9.8%). The follow-up rate was higher with pediatric gastroenterologists (90.5%) and non-gastroenterology pediatricians (76.4%) than with pediatric residents and emergency doctors. Older age was related to better ALT recovery (odds ratio [OR] of age for month = 1.003; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.001-1.004; <i>P</i> = 0.004), while the number of infection episodes (OR = 0.626; 95% CI, 0.505-0.777; <i>P</i> < 0.001) was associated with poor ALT recovery. Abdominal sonography was the most commonly used diagnostic tool (36.9%), followed by the hepatotropic virus workup. The modalities of hepatitis workup were significantly differently applied by physicians based on their specialties and institutions. Abnormal liver function test after a systemic infection was common in respiratory infection and under the age of 1 year. Age, number of infections, and initial results of LFTs were related to ALT recovery time. Inter-physician, inter-institution, and inter-specialty variances were observed in real-world practice.",Journal of Korean medical science,2021-Dec,"Lee Y, Yi DY, Lee YM, Choi SY, Choi YJ, Lee KJ",6,2516,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Specifically, estimating the relative susceptibility of a child with respect to an adult is still an open question. In our work, we generalize a well-known household model for modeling infectious diseases, to include missing tests. Due to missingness, the likelihood of the generalized model cannot be maximized directly. Thus, we propose an estimation methodology, using a novel EM algorithm, for estimating the MLE in the presence of missing data. We implement the proposed mechanism using R software. Using a simulation study, we illustrate the performance of the proposed estimation methodology compared with the estimation procedure in the complete case. Finally, using the proposed estimation methodology we analyzed a dataset containing SARS-CoV-2 testing results, collected from the city of Bnei Brak, Israel, during the beginning of the pandemic.

The role of mucosal IgA in infection (e.g. neutralization) and in inflammatory homeostasis (e.g. allergy and autoimmunity) has been extensively investigated; by contrast, serum IgA is comparatively understudied. IgA binding to fragment crystallizable alpha receptor plays a dual role in the activation and inhibition of innate effector cell functions. Mounting evidence suggests that serum IgA induces potent effector functions against various bacterial and some viral infections including Neisseria meningitidis and rotavirus. Furthermore, in the era of immunotherapy, serum IgA provides an interesting alternative to classical IgG monoclonal antibodies to treat cancer and infectious pathogens.

Unfortunately, existing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the prevention and control of COVID-19 have many shortcomings. In recent years, the emerging CRISPR/Cas technology can complement the problems of traditional methods. Biological tools based on CRISPR/Cas systems have been widely used in biomedicine. In particular, they are advantageous in pathogen detection, clinical antiviral therapy, drug, and vaccine development. Therefore, CRISPR/Cas technology may have great potential for application in the prevention and control of COVID-19 and emerging infectious diseases in the future. This article summarizes the existing applications of CRISPR/Cas technology in infectious diseases with the aim of providing effective strategies for the prevention and control of COVID-19 and other emerging infectious diseases in the future.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021-,"Ding R, Long J, Yuan M, Jin Y, Yang H, Chen M, Chen S, Duan G",8,1035,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34194045,Thinking clearly about social aspects of infectious disease transmission.,"Social and cultural forces shape almost every aspect of infectious disease transmission in human populations, as well as our ability to measure, understand, and respond to epidemics. For directly transmitted infections, pathogen transmission relies on human-to-human contact, with kinship, household, and societal structures shaping contact patterns that in turn determine epidemic dynamics. Social, economic, and cultural forces also shape patterns of exposure, health-seeking behaviour, infection outcomes, the likelihood of diagnosis and reporting of cases, and the uptake of interventions. Although these social aspects of epidemiology are hard to quantify and have limited the generalizability of modelling frameworks in a policy context, new sources of data on relevant aspects of human behaviour are increasingly available. Researchers have begun to embrace data from mobile devices and other technologies as useful proxies for behavioural drivers of disease transmission, but there is much work to be done to measure and validate these approaches, particularly for policy-making. Here we discuss how integrating local knowledge in the design of model frameworks and the interpretation of new data streams offers the possibility of policy-relevant models for public health decision-making as well as the development of robust, generalizable theories about human behaviour in relation to infectious diseases.",Nature,2021-Jul,"Buckee C, Noor A, Sattenspiel L",3,1414,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The number of cases of NID (n = 42) between January and September 2019 and 2020 were obtained from the open database from Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. The number of NID cases was 21,895 between January and September 2020, which was lower than the number of cases during the same period in 2019 (n = 24,469), with a decline in incidence from 102.9 to 91.7 per 100,000 people in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Fourteen airborne/droplet, 11 fecal-oral, seven vector-borne, and four direct-contact transmitted NID had an overall reduction of 2700 (-28.1%), 156 (-23.0%), 557 (-54.8%), and 73 (-45.9%) cases, respectively, from 2019 to 2020. Similar trends were observed for the changes in incidence, which were 11.5 (-28.4%), 6.7 (-23.4%), 2.4 (-55.0%), and 0.3 (-46.2%) per 100,000 people for airborne/droplet, fecal-oral, vector-borne, and direct-contact transmitted NID, respectively. In addition, all the 38 imported NID showed a reduction of 632 (-73.5%) cases from 2019 to 2020. In contrast, 4 sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) showed an increase of 903 (+7.2%) cases from 2019 to 2020, which was attributed to the increase in gonorrhea (from 3220 to 5028). The overall incidence of STDs increased from 52.5 to 56.0 per 100,000 people, with a percentage change of +6.7%.

35411706,Ecological super-spreaders drive host-range oscillations: Omicron and risk space for emerging infectious disease.,"The unusual genetic diversity of the Omicron strain has led to speculation about its origin. The mathematical modelling platform developed for the Stockholm Paradigm (SP) indicates strongly that it has retro-colonized humans from an unidentified nonhuman mammal, likely originally infected by humans. The relationship between Omicron and all other SARS-CoV-2 variants indicates oscillations among hosts, a core part of the SP. Such oscillations result from the emergence of novel variants following colonization of new hosts, replenishing and expanding the risk space for disease emergence. The SP predicts that pathogens colonize new hosts using pre-existing capacities. Those events are thus predictable to a certain extent. Novel variants emerge after a colonization and are not predictable. This makes it imperative to take proactive measures for anticipating emerging infectious diseases (EID) and mitigating their impact. The SP suggests a policy protocol, DAMA, to accomplish this goal. DAMA comprises: DOCUMENT to detect pathogens before they emerge in new places or colonize new hosts; ASSESS to determine risk; MONITOR to detect changes in pathogen populations that increase the risk of outbreaks and ACT to prevent outbreaks when possible and minimize their impact when they occur.",Transboundary and emerging diseases,2022-Sep,"Boeger WA, Brooks DR, Trivellone V, Agosta SJ, Hoberg EP",5,1292,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Transmission of gastrointestinal, respiratory, waterborne and sexually transmitted infectious diseases pose a particular risk: all have been linked to MG events [-]. Infection risk often depends on the nature of the mass gathering, and on the profile and behaviour of its participants. The interaction between environmental, psychological, biological and social factors plays a vital part. The risk of outbreaks particularly as a result of respiratory transmission remains high at MG, with the majority of outbreaks over the last two decades resulting from a variety of respiratory and vaccine preventable pathogens [-]. Concerns about the spread of infectious diseases at MG are often focussed on crowding, lack of sanitation and the mixing of population groups from different places. Sporting events, which have in recent decades become more complex and international in nature, pose a challenge to the control of communicable disease transmission []. Despite this, large scale outbreaks at sporting events have been rare in recent decades, particularly since the rise of more robust public health planning, prevention, risk assessment and improved health infrastructures in host countries [].",Epidemiology and infection,2022-Nov,"Beebeejaun K, Pebody R, Ciobanu S, Pukkila J, Smallwood C, Perehinets I",6,1499,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The effects of certain systemic viral and bacterial infections on morbidity and mortality are considered as examples of recent emerging infections. Here we will focus on three examples of infections that are important in pregnancy and early childhood: SARS-CoV-2 virus, Zika virus, and Mycoplasma species. The basic structural characteristics of these infectious agents will be examined, along with their general pathogenic mechanisms. Coronavirus infections, such as caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, likely evolved from zoonotic bat viruses to infect humans and cause a pandemic that has been the biggest challenge for humanity since the Spanish Flu pandemic of the early 20th century. In contrast, Zika Virus infections represent an expanding infectious threat in the context of global climate change. The relationship of these infections to pregnancy, the vertical transmission and neurological sequels make these viruses highly relevant to the topics of this special issue. Finally, mycoplasmal infections have been present before mankind evolved, but they were rarely identified as human pathogens until recently, and they are now recognized as important coinfections that are able to modify the course and prognosis of various infectious diseases and other chronic illnesses. The infectious processes caused by these intracellular microorganisms are examined as well as some general aspects of their pathogeneses, clinical presentations, and diagnoses. We will finally consider examples of treatments that have been used to reduce morbidity and mortality of these infections and discuss briefly the current status of vaccines, in particular, against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is important to understand some of the basic features of these emerging infectious diseases and the pathogens involved in order to better appreciate the contributions of this special issue on how infectious diseases can affect human pregnancy, fetuses and neonates.",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Adherence to consensus guidelines on vaccination and infectious diseases screening among refugees resettling in the U.S. is unknown. We sought to determine rates of vaccine completion and infectious diseases screening in refugees following resettlement. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of refugees resettling in a region in the U.S. using medical data from June 2013-April 2015. We determined the proportion of vaccine-eligible refugees vaccinated with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), hepatitis A/B, tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap), and human papillomavirus (HPV) following resettlement. We also determined the proportion of refugees who completed HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) screening. One hundred and eleven subjects were included, primarily from Iraq (53%), Afghanistan (19%), and Eritrea (11%). Of the 84 subjects who were vaccine-eligible, 78 (93%) initiated and 42 (50%) completed vaccinations within one year of resettlement. Odds of completing vaccination were higher for men (OR: 2.38; 95%CI:1.02-5.71) and for subjects with English proficiency (OR: 3.70; 95%CI:1.04-17.49). Of the 78 subjects (70%) completing HIV screening, two (3%) were diagnosed with HIV. Nearly all subjects completed screening for HCV, and one had active infection. While most refugees initiate vaccinations, only 50% completed vaccinations and 70% completed HIV screening within 1 year of resettlement.

34582295,Vaccinomics: a future avenue for vaccine development against emerging pathogens.,"Vaccines are a major achievement in medical sciences, but the development of more effective vaccines against infectious diseases is essential for prevention and control of emerging pathogens worldwide. The application of omics technologies has advanced vaccinology through the characterization of host-vector-pathogen molecular interactions and the identification of candidate protective antigens. However, major challenges such as host immunity, pathogen and environmental factors, vaccine efficacy and safety need to be addressed. Vaccinomics provides a platform to address these challenges and improve vaccine efficacy and safety. In this review, we summarize current information on vaccinomics and propose quantum vaccinomics approaches to further advance vaccine development through the identification and combination of antigen protective epitopes, the immunological quantum. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is an example of emerging infectious diseases with global impact on human health. Vaccines are required for the effective and environmentally sustainable intervention for the control of emerging infectious diseases worldwide. Recent advances in vaccinomics provide a platform to address challenges in improving vaccine efficacy and implementation. As proposed here, quantum vaccinomics will contribute to vaccine development, efficacy, and safety by facilitating antigen combinations to target pathogen infection and transmission in emerging infectious diseases.",Expert review of vaccines,2021-Dec,"de la Fuente J, Contreras M",2,1487,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

39696863,An individual-level probabilistic model and solution for control of infectious diseases.,"We present an individual-level probabilistic model to evaluate the effectiveness of two traditional control measures for infectious diseases: the isolation of symptomatic individuals and contact tracing (plus subsequent quarantine). The model allows us to calculate the reproduction number and the generation-time distribution under the two control measures. The model is related to the work of Fraser et al. on the same topic [1], which provides a population-level model using a combination of differential equations and probabilistic arguments. We show that our individual-level model has certain advantages. In particular, we are able to provide more precise results for a disease that has two classes of infected individuals - the individuals who will remain asymptomatic throughout and the individuals who will eventually become symptomatic. Using the properties of integral operators with positive kernels, we also resolve the important theoretical issue as to why the density function of the steady-state generation time is the eigenfunction associated with the largest eigenvalue of the underlying integral operator. Moreover, the same theoretical result shows why the simple algorithm of repeated integration can find numerical solutions for virtually all initial conditions. We discuss the model's implications, especially how it enhances our understanding about the impact of asymptomatic individuals. For instance, in the special case where the infectiousness of the two classes is proportional to each other, the effects of the asymptomatic individuals can be understood by supposing that all individuals will be symptomatic but with modified infectiousness and modified efficacy of the isolation measure. The numerical results show that, out of the two measures, isolation is the more decisive one, at least for the COVID-19 parameters used in the numerical experiments.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2024-Oct,Xia Y,1,1884,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Using the attribution analysis based on the theoretical infectious diseases model simulation, we found the mechanism of the severe COVID-19 outbreak in the summer of 2022 and identified the amplification effect of heat wave events on its magnitude. The results suggest that approximately 69.3% of COVID-19 cases this summer could have been avoided if there is no heat waves. The collision between the pandemic and the heatwave is not an accident.

33143199,Emerging Natural Focal Infectious Diseases in Russia: A Medical-Geographical Study.,"In Russia, as in other countries, the problem of emerging natural focal infectious diseases (EIDs) became more acute toward the end of the 20th century. However, the situation in Russia is unknown to foreign readers, while the prevention and control of these diseases require international collaboration. The aim of the study is to provide a medical-geographical assessment of the distribution of the main natural focal EIDs in Russia, as well as to present the approaches used in the country to create aggregate maps of risk assessment. To consider its current status, we determined the most important natural focal EIDs for Russia (tick-borne encephalitis, ixodid tick-borne borrelioses, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, West Nile fever, Astrakhan spotted fever, leptospiroses, and tularemia) and analyzed the patterns of their epidemic manifestation. As a result, a working classification of such infections and a series of maps showing the current situation of EID morbidity in Russia were created. To design an aggregated risk map, we developed an original mapping methodology and recalculated the model disease incidence by taking data from administrative units and adjusting them for natural geographical boundaries (biomes) for European Russia, and then evaluated the risk of infection for separate model diseases and for a set of them. The highest risk rates are confined to the northwest regions of European Russia, the Cis-Urals and the Volga region, which are naturally related to forest biomes, as well as to the southern steppe regions of the interfluves between the Volga and the Don, and the foothills of the North Caucasus.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020-Oct,"Malkhazova S, Pestina P, Prasolova A, Orlov D",4,1679,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
37817313,Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit (APSU) Annual Surveillance Report 2022.,"For 30 years the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit (APSU) has conducted national surveillance of rare communicable diseases and rare complications of communicable diseases. In this report, we describe the results of thirteen such studies surveyed by the APSU in 2022, including reported case numbers and incidence estimates, demographics, clinical features, management and short-term outcomes. Conditions described are: acute flaccid paralysis (AFP); congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV); neonatal and infant herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection; perinatal exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and paediatric HIV infection; severe complications of influenza; juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JoRRP); congenital rubella infection/syndrome; congenital varicella syndrome (CVS) and neonatal varicella infection (NVI); and the new conditions dengue; Q fever; and severe acute hepatitis. In 2022, cases of severe complications of influenza were reported to the APSU for the first time since 2019. This likely reflects the easing of government-mandated restrictions imposed in 2020-2021 to curb the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the re-emergence of a range of infectious diseases. As previously, AFP surveillance by the APSU contributed to Australia achieving a minimum target incidence of one AFP case per 105 children aged less than 15 years. Cases of JoRRP and NVI were reported in 2022. This indicates potential gaps in human papillomavirus (HPV) and varicella vaccination coverage respectively, especially in high-risk groups such as young migrant and refugee women of childbearing age from countries without universal vaccination programs. Paediatric HIV case numbers resulting from mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) of HIV remain low in Australia due to use of effective intervention strategies. However, there has been an increase in the number of imported cases of HIV in children (mainly perinatally-acquired) from countries with a high HIV prevalence. Without effective vaccines, there has been no decline in the incidence of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV, indicating the importance of early identification and management to reduce morbidity and mortality. The first cases of dengue, Q fever and severe acute hepatitis were received by APSU in 2022, including two cases of acute hepatitis in which aetiology has not been confirmed to date.

Emerging infectious diseases caused by novel tick-borne pathogens have been reported that are causing particular concern. Several tick-borne diseases often coexist in the same foci, and a single vector tick can transmit two or more pathogens at the same time, which greatly increases the probability of co-infection in host animals and humans and can lead to an epidemic of tick-borne disease. The lack of epidemiological data and information on the specific clinical symptoms related to co-infection with tick-borne pathogens means that it is not currently possible to accurately and rapidly distinguish between a single pathogen infection and co-infection with multiple pathogens, which can have serious consequences. Inner Mongolia in the north of China is endemic for tick-borne infectious diseases, especially in the eastern forest region. Previous studies have found that more than 10% of co-infections were in host-seeking ticks. However, the lack of data on the specific types of co-infection with pathogens makes clinical treatment difficult. In our study, we present data on the co-infection types and the differences in co-infection among different ecological regions through genetic analysis of tick samples collected throughout Inner Mongolia.

Existing technologies for detecting infectious and non-infectious diseases are mostly tedious, expensive, and do not meet the World Health Organization's (WHO) ASSURED (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable to end user) criteria. Hence, more accurate, sensitive, and faster diagnostic technologies that meet the ASSURED criteria are highly required for timely and evidenced-based treatment. Presently, the diagnostics industry is finding interest in microfluidics-based biosensors, as this integration comprises all qualities, such as reduction in the size of the equipment, rapid turnaround time, possibility of parallel multiple analysis or multiplexing, etc. Microfluidics deal with the manipulation/analysis of fluid within micrometer-sized channels. Biosensors comprise biomolecules immobilized on a physicochemical transducer for the detection of a specific analyte. In this review article, we provide an outline of the history of microfluidics, current practices in the selection of materials in microfluidics, and how and where microfluidics-based biosensors have been used for the diagnosis of infectious and non-infectious diseases.

To resolve this pandemic and to prevent even more severe future pandemics, a focus on upstream causation is essential. Convincing evidence shows that this and every other important viral epidemic emerging in the recent past and predictably into the future comes from the same upstream causes: capitalist agriculture, its destruction of natural habitat, and the industrial production of meat. International and national health organizations have obscured the upstream causes of emerging viral epidemics. These organizations have suffered cutbacks in public funding but have received increased support from international financial institutions and private philanthropies that emphasize the downstream effects rather than upstream causes of infectious diseases. Conflicts of interest also have impacted public health policies. A worldwide shift has begun toward peasant agricultural practices: Research so far has shown that peasant agriculture is safer and more efficient than capitalist industrial agricultural practices. Without such a transformation of agriculture, even more devastating pandemics will result from the same upstream causes.","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",2021-Jan,Waitzkin H,1,1334,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

Predefined categories included reports with fungal, parasitic, notable bacterial, notable viral pathogens, or polybacterial results (≥3 bacteria). Polybacterial results were further classified into patterns of microbiome detected. Clinical impact and its correlation with result or patient characteristics were explored. Ninety-two patients met the inclusion criteria, most were immunocompromised (73%). Positive KT results that met predefined categories had the following clinical impact: positive in 30.4%, negative in 2.2%, and none in 65.2%. Polybacterial results, especially interpreted as oral flora had lowest clinical impact (7.1% and 0.0%, respectively), while detection of parasites or notable bacterial pathogens had the highest clinical impact (100% and 77.8%, respectively). There was no correlation between patient characteristics and clinical impact. Among a cohort of largely immunocompromised patients, we were able to demonstrate clinical impact of specific KT result types and patterns but did not find correlation between patient characteristics and clinical impact.

37061101,Diagnostic stewardship in infectious diseases: a continuum of antimicrobial stewardship in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been exacerbated by the inappropriate use of diagnostics, leading to excessive prescription of antimicrobials, and is an imminent threat to global health. Diagnostic stewardship (DS) is an auxiliary to antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and comprises ordering the right tests, for the right patient, at the right time. It also promotes the judicious use of rapid and novel molecular diagnostic tools to enable the initiation of proper antibiotic therapy, while avoiding excessive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Proper interpretation of test results is crucial to avoid overdiagnosis and excessive healthcare costs. Although many rapid diagnostic tools have been developed with a high diagnostic yield, they are often limited by accessibility, cost, and lack of knowledge regarding their use. Careful consideration of clinical signs and symptoms with knowledge of the local epidemiology are essential for DS. This enables appropriate interpretation of microbiological results. Multidisciplinary teams that include well trained professionals should cooperate to promote DS. Challenges and barriers to the implementation of DS are mostly caused by scarcity of resources and lack of trained personnel and, most importantly, lack of knowledge. The lack of resources is often due to absence of awareness of the impact that good medical microbiology diagnostic facilities and expertise can have on the proper use of antibiotics.",International journal of antimicrobial agents,2023-Jul,"Zakhour J, Haddad SF, Kerbage A, Wertheim H, Tattevin P, Voss A, Ünal S, Ouedraogo AS, Kanj SS",9,1457,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This shift underscores the growing need for more cost‑effective and universally accessible sequencing assays to improve patient care and public health. Therefore, targeted NGS (tNGS) is gaining prominence. tNGS involves enrichment of target pathogens in patient samples based on multiplex PCR amplification or probe capture with excellent sensitivity. It is increasingly used in clinical diagnostics due to its practicality and efficiency. The present review compares the principles of different enrichment methods. The high positivity rate of tNGS in the detection of pathogens was found in respiratory samples with specific instances. tNGS maintains high sensitivity (70.8‑95.0%) in samples with low pathogen loads, including blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, tNGS is effective in detecting drug‑resistant strains of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, allowing identification of resistance genes and guiding clinical treatment decisions, which is difficult to achieve with mNGS. In the present review, the application of tNGS in clinical settings and its current limitations are assessed. The continued development of tNGS has the potential to refine diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy and improving infectious disease management. However, further research to overcome technical challenges such as workflow time and cost is required.",Molecular medicine reports,2024-Sep,"Chen Q, Yi J, Liu Y, Yang C, Sun Y, Du J, Liu Y, Gu D, Liu H, Xu Y, Chen Y",11,1545,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

30917729,Caring for Infectious Disease in the Prehospital Setting: A Qualitative Analysis of EMS Providers Experiences and Suggestions for Improvement.,"<b>Objective:</b> The purpose of this study was to examine the attitudes and behaviors of emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and Paramedics when faced with the decision to care for patients with suspected Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) and to illicit suggestions for improvement of infectious disease (ID) preparedness. <b>Methods:</b> A convenience sample of 22 EMT/Paramedics were recruited from an emergency department at one of the designated Ebola centers. Each provider participated in one of three on-site focus groups. Participants answered questions about how they gained their knowledge, felt about caring for EVD patients, made decisions about caring for EVD patients, and suggestions for improvement of ID preparedness. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and coded using inductive content analysis. <b>Results:</b> Analysis revealed five prominent themes: reactions to scare, education/training, danger, decision making, and suggestions for future responses. Overall, first responders were excited to be a part of the response to EVD. They were more comfortable caring for EVD patients if they received adequate education and transparency from the administration. This resulted in a decreased perceived danger of the disease and decreased hesitancy when caring for EVD patients. However, those that expressed the most hesitancy also expressed the most emotional distress. Suggestions for improvement of ID preparedness included continuing education, tiered training models, peer training models, collaboration between emergency medical services (EMS) systems, better communication between departments, and the development of an infectious disease response team. <b>Conclusions:</b> Although first responders were excited to be a part of the response to EVD, this did not come without hesitation and emotional distress. Some of these concerns may be mitigated by first providing a clear definition of ""duty to care,"" followed by interventions such as the development of clear and consistent ID preparedness training and interventions that address the emotional distress experienced by these providers.",Prehospital emergency care,2020-,"Alexander AB, Masters MM, Warren K",3,2115,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This article is part of an American Board of Pediatrics Foundation-sponsored supplement investigating the future of the pediatric subspecialty workforce. The article offers context to findings from a modeling analysis estimating the supply of PID subspecialists in the United States between 2020 and 2040. It provides an overview of children cared for by PID subspecialists, reviews the current state of the PID workforce, and discusses the projected headcount and clinical workforce equivalents of PID subspecialists at the national, census region, and census division levels over this 2-decade period. The article concludes by discussing the education and training, clinical practice, policy, and research implications of the data presented. Adjusting for population growth, the PID workforce is projected to grow more slowly than most other pediatric subspecialties and geographic disparities in access to PID care are expected to worsen. In models considering alternative scenarios, decreases in the number of fellows and time spent in clinical care significantly affect the PID workforce. Notably, model assumptions may not adequately account for potential threats to the PID workforce, including a declining number of fellows entering training and the unknown impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and future emerging infections on workforce attrition. Changes to education and training, clinical care, and policy are needed to ensure the PID workforce can meet the future needs of US children.",Pediatrics,2024-Feb,"Kelly MS, Cataldi JR, Schlaudecker EP, Shah SS, Vinci RJ, Myers AL",6,1692,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34037806,Arginine-dependent immune responses.,"A growing body of evidence indicates that, over the course of evolution of the immune system, arginine has been selected as a node for the regulation of immune responses. An appropriate supply of arginine has long been associated with the improvement of immune responses. In addition to being a building block for protein synthesis, arginine serves as a substrate for distinct metabolic pathways that profoundly affect immune cell biology; especially macrophage, dendritic cell and T cell immunobiology. Arginine availability, synthesis, and catabolism are highly interrelated aspects of immune responses and their fine-tuning can dictate divergent pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory immune outcomes. Here, we review the organismal pathways of arginine metabolism in humans and rodents, as essential modulators of the availability of this semi-essential amino acid for immune cells. We subsequently review well-established and novel findings on the functional impact of arginine biosynthetic and catabolic pathways on the main immune cell lineages. Finally, as arginine has emerged as a molecule impacting on a plethora of immune functions, we integrate key notions on how the disruption or perversion of arginine metabolism is implicated in pathologies ranging from infectious diseases to autoimmunity and cancer.",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2021-Jul,"Martí I Líndez AA, Reith W",2,1317,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The network served as a platform for real-time, open and transparent information-sharing during unknowns of an active outbreak by clinicians caring for patients, by researchers conducting clinical trials and transmission and infection prevention studies, and by teams advising local and national policy makers. Shared knowledge led to earlier adoption of some treatment modalities as compared to most peer institutions and to implementation of protocols prior to incorporation into national guidelines.

Thus, the search of new vaccine strategies and production platforms that allow rapidly and effectively responding against emerging or reemerging pathogens has become a priority in the last years. Targeting the antigens directly to dendritic cells (DCs) has emerged as a new approach to enhance the immune response after vaccination. This strategy is based on the fusion of the antigens of choice to monoclonal antibodies directed against specific DC surface receptors such as CD40. Since time is essential, <i>in silico</i> approaches are of high interest to select the most immunogenic and conserved epitopes to improve the T- and B-cells responses.

Therefore, early detection of infectious diseases is a significant need, and many researchers have developed models to diagnose them in the early stages. This paper reviewed research articles for recent machine-learning (ML) algorithms applied to infectious disease diagnosis. We searched the Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Springer, and IEEE databases from 2015 to 2022, identified the pros and cons of the reviewed ML models, and discussed the possible recommendations to advance the studies in this field. We found that most of the articles used small datasets, and few of them used real-time data. Our results demonstrated that a suitable ML technique depends on the nature of the dataset and the desired goal. Moreover, heterogeneous data could ensure the model's generalization, while big data, many features, and a hybrid model will increase the resulting performance. Furthermore, using other techniques such as deep learning and NLP to extract vast features from unstructured data is a powerful approach to enhancing the performance of ML diagnostic models.",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2022-,"Alqaissi EY, Alotaibi FS, Ramzan MS",3,1219,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
34319148,The Standardization and Control of Serology and Nucleic Acid Testing for Infectious Diseases.,"Historically, the detection of antibodies against infectious disease agents was achieved using test systems that utilized biological functions such as neutralization, complement fixation, hemagglutination, or visualization of binding of antibodies to specific antigens, by testing doubling dilutions of the patient sample to determine an endpoint. These test systems have since been replaced by automated platforms, many of which have been integrated into general medical pathology. Methods employed to standardize and control clinical chemistry testing have been applied to these serology tests. However, there is evidence that these methods are not suitable for infectious disease serology. An overriding reason is that, unlike testing for an inert chemical, testing for specific antibodies to infectious disease agents is highly variable; the measurand for each test system varies in choice of antigen, antibody classes/subclasses, modes of detection, and assay kinetics, and individuals' immune responses vary with time after exposure, individual immune-competency, nutrition, treatment, and exposure to variable circulating sero- or genotypes or organism mutations. Therefore, unlike that of inert chemicals, the quantification of antibodies cannot be standardized using traditional methods. However, there is evidence that the quantification of nucleic acid testing, reporting results in international units, has been successful across many viral load tests. Similarly, traditional methods used to control clinical chemistry testing, such as Westgard rules, are not appropriate for serology testing for infectious diseases, mainly due to variability due to frequent reagent lot changes. This review investigates the reasons why standardization and control of infectious diseases should be further investigated and more appropriate guidelines should be implemented.",Clinical microbiology reviews,2021-Dec,Dimech W,1,1870,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
38049022,Migration in French Guiana: Implications in health and infectious diseases.,"In French Guiana, more than a third of the population, and nearly half of the adults, are of foreign origin. This immigration is explained by the French standard of living, which is attractive to nationals of surrounding countries. Infectious diseases remain in the top 10 causes of premature death, often in the most precarious populations. In this context we aimed to synthesize the state of the knowledge regarding immigration and infectious diseases in French Guiana and the general implications that follow this diagnosis. For HIV, although the majority of patients are of foreign origin, estimates of the presumed date of infection based on CD4 erosion modelling and from molecular analyses suggest that the majority of transmissions in foreign-born individuals occur in French Guiana and that the Guiana shield has been a crossroad between Latin America and the Caribbean. Among key populations bridging these regions illegal gold miners are very mobile and have the greatest proportion B Caribbean HIV viruses. Gold miners have been a key vulnerable population for falciparum malaria and other tropical diseases such as leishmaniasis, leprosy, or leptospirosis. The complex history of migrations in French Guiana and on the Guiana Shield is also reflected in the fingerprinting of mycobacterium tuberculosis and the high incidence of tuberculosis in French Guiana, notably in immigrants, reflects the incidences in the countries of origin of patients. The high burden of infectious diseases in immigrants in French Guiana is first and foremost a reflection of the precarious living conditions within French Guiana and suggests that community-based proactive interventions are crucial to reduce transmission, morbidity, and mortality from infectious diseases.",Travel medicine and infectious disease,2024-,"Nacher M, Epelboin L, Bonifay T, Djossou F, Blaizot R, Couppié P, Adenis A, Lucarelli A, Lambert Y, Schaub R, Douine M",11,1766,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
32638114,Regulatory Considerations on the Development of mRNA Vaccines.,"Developing traditional viral vaccines for infectious diseases usually takes years, as these are usually produced either by chemical inactivation of the virus or attenuation of the pathogen, processes that can take considerable time to validate and also require the live pathogen. With the advent of nucleic-acid vaccines (DNA and mRNA), the time to vaccine design and production is considerably shortened, since once the platform has been established, all that is required is the sequence of the antigen gene, its synthesis and insertion into an appropriate expression vector; importantly, no infectious virus is required. mRNA vaccines have some advantages over DNA vaccines, such as expression in non-dividing cells and the absence of the perceived risk of integration into host genome. Also, generally lower doses are required to induce the immune response. Based on experience in recent clinical trials, mRNA-based vaccines are a promising novel platform that might be useful for the development of vaccines against emerging pandemic infectious diseases. This chapter discusses some of the specific issues that mRNA vaccines raise with respect to production, quality, safety and efficacy, and how they have been addressed so as to allow their evaluation in clinical trials.",Current topics in microbiology and immunology,2022-,"Naik R, Peden K",2,1277,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

35162917,Predicting Infectious Diseases: A Bibliometric Review on Africa.,"Africa has a long history of novel and re-emerging infectious disease outbreaks. This reality has attracted the attention of researchers interested in the general research theme of predicting infectious diseases. However, a knowledge mapping analysis of literature to reveal the research trends, gaps, and hotspots in predicting Africa's infectious diseases using bibliometric tools has not been conducted. A bibliometric analysis of 247 published papers on predicting infectious diseases in Africa, published in the Web of Science core collection databases, is presented in this study. The results indicate that the severe outbreaks of infectious diseases in Africa have increased scientific publications during the past decade. The results also reveal that African researchers are highly underrepresented in these publications and that the United States of America (USA) is the most productive and collaborative country. The relevant hotspots in this research field include malaria, models, classification, associations, COVID-19, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, weather-based prediction using meteorological factors is an emerging theme, and very few studies have used the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) technologies. Therefore, there is a need to explore 4IR predicting tools such as machine learning and consider integrated approaches that are pivotal to developing robust prediction systems for infectious diseases, especially in Africa.

In this work, we intended to investigate the diagnostic value and clinical acceptance of paired-samples mNGS as compared to the culture method. A total of 361 patients with suspected infection were retrospectively included. With reference to the clinical diagnosis, we compared the diagnostic performance and clinical acceptance in pathogen detection between mNGS and culture tests. Moreover, the pathogen concordance of paired blood and respiratory tract (RT) samples in mNGS assay was investigated. Among 511 samples, 62.04% were shown to be pathogen positive by mNGS, and that for clinical diagnosis was 51.86% (265/511). When compared to culture assay (<i>n</i> = 428), mNGS had a significantly higher positivity rate (51.87% vs. 33.18%). With reference to the clinical diagnosis, the sensitivity of mNGS outperformed that of culture (89.08% vs. 56.72%). Importantly, mNGS exhibited a clinically accepted rate significantly superior to that of culture. In addition, the mNGS result from 53 paired blood and RT samples showed that most pairs were pathogen positive by both blood and RT, with pathogens largely being partially matched. Through this large-scale study, we further illustrated that mNGS had a clinically accepted rate and sensitivity superior to those of the traditional culture method in diagnosing infections. Moreover, blood and paired RT samples mostly shared partial-matched positive pathogens, especially for pathogens with abundant read numbers in RT, indicating that both blood and RT mNGS can aid the identification of pathogens for respiratory system infection.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2024-,"Li Z, Tan L, Zhang J, Long Q, Chen Z, Xiang Z, Wu W, Guo Z, Liu H, Hu B, Yang B, Hu M",12,1710,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33525082,Asymptomatic transmission shifts epidemic dynamics.,"Asymptomatic transmission of infectious diseases has been recognized recently in several epidemics or pandemics. There is a great need to incorporate asymptomatic transmissions into traditional modeling of infectious diseases and to study how asymptomatic transmissions shift epidemic dynamics. In this work, we propose a compartmental model with asymptomatic transmissions for waterborne infectious diseases. We conduct a detailed analysis and numerical study with shigellosis data. Two parameters, the proportion $p$ of asymptomatic infected individuals and the proportion $k$ of asymptomatic infectious individuals who can asymptomatically transmit diseases, play major rules in the epidemic dynamics. The basic reproduction number $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ is a decreasing function of parameter $p$ when parameter $k$ is smaller than a critical value while $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ is an increasing function of $p$ when $k$ is greater than the critical value. $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ is an increasing function of $k$ for any value of $p$. When $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ passes through 1 as $p$ or $k$ varies, the dynamics of epidemics is shifted. If asymptomatic transmissions are not counted, $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ will be underestimated while the final size may be overestimated or underestimated. Our study provides a theoretical example for investigating other asymptomatic transmissions and useful information for public health measurements in waterborne infectious diseases.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2020-Nov,"Lv J, Guo S, Cui JA, Tian JP",4,1451,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

This article focuses on the risk of irregular outbreaks of infectious diseases. On the one hand, a method based on information gain is proposed to calculate the weight of environmental factors directly related to infectious disease risk, to clarify the correlation between environmental factors and infectious disease risk. On the other hand, the risk calculation method based on risk weight number is proposed to calculate the risk level of different infectious diseases under the influence of specific environmental factors. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method are verified through case analysis and discussion.

35065303,"Threat, challenges, and preparedness for future pandemics: A descriptive review of phylogenetic analysis based predictions.","For centuries the world has been confronted with many infectious diseases, with a potential to turn into a pandemic posing a constant threat to human lives. Some of these pandemics occurred due to the emergence of new disease or re-emergence of previously known diseases with a few mutations. In such scenarios their optimal prevention and control options were not adequately developed. Most of these diseases are highly contagious and for their timely control, knowledge about the pathogens and disease progression is the basic necessity. In this review, we have presented a documented chronology of the earlier pandemics, evolutionary analysis of the infectious disease with pandemic potential, the role of RNA, difficulties in controlling pandemics, and the likely pathogens that could trigger future pandemics. In this study, the evolutionary history of the pathogens was identified by carrying out phylogenetic analysis. The percentage similarity between different infectious diseases is critically analysed for the identification of their correlation using online sequence matcher tools. The Baltimore classification system was used for finding the genomic nature of the viruses. It was observed that most of the infectious pathogens rise from their animal hosts with some mutations in their genome composition. The phylogenetic tree shows that the single-stranded RNA diseases have a common origin and many of them are having high similarity percentage. The outcomes of this study will help in the identification of potential pathogens that can cause future pandemics. This information will be helpful in the development of early detection techniques, devising preventive mechanism to limit their spread, prophylactic measures, Infection control and therapeutic options, thereby, strengthening our approach towards global preparedness against future pandemics.","Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2022-Mar,"Behl A, Nair A, Mohagaonkar S, Yadav P, Gambhir K, Tyagi N, Sharma RK, Butola BS, Sharma N",9,1867,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

The levels and states in this model represent the stages of outbreak development and the possible number of infectious disease patients. The transfer of states between levels reflects the explosive transmission process of infectious disease. A simulation method with heterogeneous infection is proposed to solve the model rapidly. After that, simulation experiments were conducted using MATLAB according to the reported data on COVID-19 published by Johns Hopkins. Comparing the simulation results with the actual situation shows that our proposed model can well capture the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases with and without imposed interventions and evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies. Further, the influence of model parameters on transmission dynamics is analyzed, which helps to develop reasonable intervention strategies. The proposed approach extends the theoretical study of mathematical modeling of infectious diseases and contributes to developing models that can describe an infinite number of infected persons.",PloS one,2023-,"Wang C, Mustafa S",2,1471,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22

37392149,Estimating contact network properties by integrating multiple data sources associated with infectious diseases.,"To effectively mitigate the spread of communicable diseases, it is necessary to understand the interactions that enable disease transmission among individuals in a population; we refer to the set of these interactions as a contact network. The structure of the contact network can have profound effects on both the spread of infectious diseases and the effectiveness of control programs. Therefore, understanding the contact network permits more efficient use of resources. Measuring the structure of the network, however, is a challenging problem. We present a Bayesian approach to integrate multiple data sources associated with the transmission of infectious diseases to more precisely and accurately estimate important properties of the contact network. An important aspect of the approach is the use of the congruence class models for networks. We conduct simulation studies modeling pathogens resembling SARS-CoV-2 and HIV to assess the method; subsequently, we apply our approach to HIV data from the University of California San Diego Primary Infection Resource Consortium. Based on simulation studies, we demonstrate that the integration of epidemiological and viral genetic data with risk behavior survey data can lead to large decreases in mean squared error (MSE) in contact network estimates compared to estimates based strictly on risk behavior information. This decrease in MSE is present even in settings where the risk behavior surveys contain measurement error. Through these simulations, we also highlight certain settings where the approach does not improve MSE.",Statistics in medicine,2023-Sep,"Goyal R, Carnegie N, Slipher S, Turk P, Little SJ, De Gruttola V",6,1582,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
33148723,WeChat-based health education to improve health knowledge in three major infectious diseases among residents: a multicentre case-controlled protocol.,"Health literacy (HL) in infectious diseases is inadequate in China. Since the first nationwide survey of HL conducted in China, great efforts have been made. However, the rate of HL in infectious diseases was 16.06% in 2017. In contrast, with an HL rate of 15.85% in 2008, no significant effect was observed over 10 years. With an increasing number of internet users, we aim to assess the effects of WeChat-based health education for the promotion of partial HL-health knowledge in infectious diseases. A total of 2160 residents aged 15-69 years old will be enrolled in this study. The primary outcome measures will be the rate of health knowledge in infectious disease. The follow-up period is 3 years. The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University. The findings of this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.",BMJ open,2020-Nov,"Qiu Y, Qin H, Ying M, Xu K, Ren J",5,917,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
32759252,Inferred duration of infectious period of SARS-CoV-2: rapid scoping review and analysis of available evidence for asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 cases.,"Our objective was to review the literature on the inferred duration of the infectious period of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, and provide an overview of the variation depending on the methodological approach. Rapid scoping review. Literature review with fixed search terms, up to 1 April 2020. Central tendency and variation of the parameter estimates for infectious period in (A) asymptomatic and (B) symptomatic cases from (1) virological studies (repeated testing), (2) tracing studies and (3) modelling studies were gathered. Narrative review of viral dynamics. Search strategies developed and the following searched: PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Additionally, the Health Information Quality Authority (Ireland) viral load synthesis was used, which screened literature from PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, NHS evidence, Cochrane, medRxiv and bioRxiv, and HRB open databases. There was substantial variation in the estimates, and how infectious period was inferred. One study provided approximate median infectious period for asymptomatic cases of 6.5-9.5 days. Median presymptomatic infectious period across studies varied over <1-4 days. Estimated mean time from symptom onset to two negative RT-PCR tests was 13.4 days (95% CI 10.9 to 15.8) but was shorter when studies included children or less severe cases. Estimated mean duration from symptom onset to hospital discharge or death (potential maximal infectious period) was 18.1 days (95% CI 15.1 to 21.0); time to discharge was on average 4 days shorter than time to death. Viral dynamic data and model infectious parameters were often shorter than repeated diagnostic data. There are limitations of inferring infectiousness from repeated diagnosis, viral loads and viral replication data alone and also potential patient recall bias relevant to estimating exposure and symptom onset times. Despite this, available data provide a preliminary evidence base to inform models of central tendency for key parameters and variation for exploring parameter space and sensitivity analysis.",BMJ open,2020-Aug,"Byrne AW, McEvoy D, Collins AB, Hunt K, Casey M, Barber A, Butler F, Griffin J, Lane EA, McAloon C, O'Brien K, Wall P, Walsh KA, More SJ",14,2113,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
36912383,Health Lifestyle Theory in a Changing Society: The Rise of Infectious Diseases and Digitalization.,"Social change produces alterations in society that necessitate changes in sociological theories. Two significant changes affecting health lifestyle theory are the behaviors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the digitalization of society. The health-protective practices emerging from the ongoing pandemic and the recent parade of other newly emerging infectious diseases need to be included in the theory's framework. Moreover, the extensive digitalization of today's society leads to the addition of connectivities (electronic networks) as a structural variable. Connectivities serve as a computational authority influencing health lifestyle practices through health apps and other digital resources in contrast to collectivities (human social networks) as a normative authority. The recent literature supporting these features in an updated and expanded model of health lifestyle theory is discussed.",Journal of health and social behavior,2023-Sep,Cockerham WC,1,910,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
39016620,"Early-Life Disease Exposure and Its Heterogeneous Effects on Mortality Throughout Life: Sweden, 1905-2016.","Exposure to infectious diseases in early life has been linked to increased mortality risk in later life in high-disease settings, such as eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe. Less is known about the long-term effects of early-life disease exposure in milder disease environments. This study estimates heterogeneous effects from disease exposure in infancy on later-life mortality in twentieth-century Sweden, by socioeconomic status at birth and sex. Using historical population data for southern Sweden, we study 11,515 individuals who were born in 1905-1929 from age 1 until age 85. We measure exposure to disease using the local post-early neonatal mortality rate in the first 12 months after birth and apply flexible parametric survival models. For females, we find a negative effect on life expectancy (scarring) at ages 1-85 following high disease exposure in infancy, particularly for those born to unskilled workers. For males, we find no negative effect on later-life survival, likely because stronger mortality selection in infancy outweighs scarring. Thus, even as the incidence of infectious diseases declined at the start of the twentieth century, early-life disease exposure generated long-lasting negative but heterogeneous population health effects.",Demography,2024-Aug,"Cormack L, Lazuka V, Quaranta L",3,1271,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
38052538,Markov modeling and performance analysis of infectious diseases with asymptomatic patients.,"After over three years of COVID-19, it has become clear that infectious diseases are difficult to eradicate, and humans remain vulnerable under their influence in a long period. The presence of presymptomatic and asymptomatic patients is a significant obstacle to preventing and eliminating infectious diseases. However, the long-term transmission of infectious diseases involving asymptomatic patients still remains unclear. To address this issue, this paper develops a novel Markov process for infectious diseases with asymptomatic patients by means of a continuous-time level-dependent quasi-birth-and-death (QBD) process. The model accurately captures the transmission of infectious diseases by specifying several key parameters (or factors). To analyze the role of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients in the infectious disease transmission process, a simple sufficient condition for the stability of the Markov process of infectious diseases is derived using the mean drift technique. Then, the stationary probability vector of the QBD process is obtained by using RG-factorizations. A method of using the stationary probability vector is provided to obtain important performance measures of the model. Finally, some numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the model's feasibility through analyzing COVID-19 as an example. The impact of key parameters on the system performance evaluation and the infectious disease transmission process are analyzed. The methodology and results of this paper can provide theoretical and technical support for the scientific control of the long-term transmission of infectious diseases, and we believe that they can serve as a foundation for developing more general models of infectious disease transmission.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2023-Sep,"Li QL, Wang C, Yang F, Zhang C",4,1759,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
32434483,Migrants and imported disease: Trends of admission in an Italian infectious disease ward during the migration crisis of 2015-2017.,"Since 2014, the migrant population residing in Europe has dramatically increased. Migrants' unmet health needs represent a barrier to integration and should be promptly addressed, without stigma, in order to favour resettlement. All-cause of admissions in the migrant population at the Infectious Disease Clinic of Policlinico San Martino Hospital in Genoa between 2015 and 2017 were analysed. Patients were classified by duration of residence in Italy according to the Recommendation on Statistics of International Migration, cause of hospitalization, and region of origin. All data were evaluated with SPSS Statistics. Two hundred thirty-five people were admitted, 86 (36.5%) of them residing in Italy for less than 1 year. Except for a significant increase in migrants from Africa, there was no change considering the area of origin, hospitalization reason or by comparing residency in Italy for more or less than 1 year. A considerable number of hospitalizations were related to non-communicable pathologies and latent tuberculosis infection. Residents in Italy for less than 1 year or with active tuberculosis had prolonged hospitalizations, while HIV-infected had shorter hospital stays. No difference in terms of diagnosis were found between migrants with longer or shorter period of residence in Italy. Adequate outpatient services for the management of communicable diseases could significantly reduce the length of hospitalizations in the migrant population.",BMC public health,2020-May,"Del Puente F, Riccardi N, Taramasso L, Sarteschi G, Pincino R, Di Biagio A",6,1468,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
37976680,Mathematical methods for scaling from within-host to population-scale in infectious disease systems.,"Mathematical modellers model infectious disease dynamics at different scales. Within-host models represent the spread of pathogens inside an individual, whilst between-host models track transmission between individuals. However, pathogen dynamics at one scale affect those at another. This has led to the development of multiscale models that connect within-host and between-host dynamics. In this article, we systematically review the literature on multiscale infectious disease modelling according to PRISMA guidelines, dividing previously published models into five categories governing their methodological approaches (Garira (2017)), explaining their benefits and limitations. We provide a primer on developing multiscale models of infectious diseases.",Epidemics,2023-Dec,"Doran JWG, Thompson RN, Yates CA, Bowness R",4,757,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
31963174,Virus Metagenomics in Farm Animals: A Systematic Review.,"A majority of emerging infectious diseases are of zoonotic origin. Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) has been employed to identify uncommon and novel infectious etiologies and characterize virus diversity in human, animal, and environmental samples. Here, we systematically reviewed studies that performed viral mNGS in common livestock (cattle, small ruminants, poultry, and pigs). We identified 2481 records and 120 records were ultimately included after a first and second screening. Pigs were the most frequently studied livestock and the virus diversity found in samples from poultry was the highest. Known animal viruses, zoonotic viruses, and novel viruses were reported in available literature, demonstrating the capacity of mNGS to identify both known and novel viruses. However, the coverage of metagenomic studies was patchy, with few data on the virome of small ruminants and respiratory virome of studied livestock. Essential metadata such as age of livestock and farm types were rarely mentioned in available literature, and only 10.8% of the datasets were publicly available. Developing a deeper understanding of livestock virome is crucial for detection of potential zoonotic and animal pathogens and One Health preparedness. Metagenomic studies can provide this background but only when combined with essential metadata and following the ""FAIR"" (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles.",Viruses,2020-Jan,"Kwok KTT, Nieuwenhuijse DF, Phan MVT, Koopmans MPG",4,1442,infectious_diseases,2025-11-22
