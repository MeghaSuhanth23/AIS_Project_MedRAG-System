39189413,European Society of Cardiology: the 2023 Atlas of Cardiovascular Disease Statistics.,"This report from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Atlas Project updates and expands upon the 2021 report in presenting cardiovascular disease (CVD) statistics for the ESC member countries. This paper examines inequalities in cardiovascular healthcare and outcomes in ESC member countries utilizing mortality and risk factor data from the World Health Organization and the Global Burden of Disease study with additional economic data from the World Bank. Cardiovascular healthcare data were collected by questionnaire circulated to the national cardiac societies of ESC member countries. Statistics pertaining to 2022, or latest available year, are presented. New material in this report includes contemporary estimates of the economic burden of CVD and mortality statistics for a range of CVD phenotypes. CVD accounts for 11% of the EU's total healthcare expenditure. It remains the most common cause of death in ESC member countries with over 3 million deaths per year. Proportionately more deaths from CVD occur in middle-income compared with high-income countries in both females (53% vs. 34%) and males (46% vs. 30%). Between 1990 and 2021, median age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) for CVD decreased by median >50% in high-income ESC member countries but in middle-income countries the median decrease was <12%. These inequalities between middle- and high-income ESC member countries likely reflect heterogeneous exposures to a range of environmental, socioeconomic, and clinical risk factors. The 2023 survey suggests that treatment factors may also contribute with middle-income countries reporting lower rates per million of percutaneous coronary intervention (1355 vs. 2330), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (4.0 vs. 153.4) and pacemaker implantation (147.0 vs. 831.9) compared with high-income countries. The ESC Atlas 2023 report shows continuing inequalities in the epidemiology and management of CVD between middle-income and high-income ESC member countries. These inequalities are exemplified by the changes in CVD ASMRs during the last 30 years. In the high-income ESC member countries, ASMRs have been in steep decline during this period but in the middle-income countries declines have been very small. There is now an important need for targeted action to reduce the burden of CVD, particularly in those countries where the burden is greatest.",European heart journal,2024-Oct,"Timmis A, Aboyans V, Vardas P, Townsend N, Torbica A, Kavousi M, Boriani G, Huculeci R, Kazakiewicz D, Scherr D, Karagiannidis E, Cvijic M, Kapłon-Cieślicka A, Ignatiuk B, Raatikainen P, De Smedt D, Wood A, Dudek D, Van Belle E, Weidinger F",20,2384,cardiology,2025-11-22
37059409,Cardiology and lifestyle medicine.,"Poor lifestyle habits, such as physical inactivity and poor diets, are highly prevalent within society and even more so among patients with chronic disease. The need to stem poor lifestyle habits has led to the development of a new field of Lifestyle Medicine, whose mission is to prevent, treat, and even reverse chronic diseases through lifestyle interventions. Three fields within Cardiology relate to this mission: Cardiac Rehabilitation, Preventive Cardiology, and Behavioral Cardiology. Each of these three fields have contributed substantially to the reduction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. The historic contributions of these three cardiac fields are reviewed as well as the challenges each of these fields has faced in optimizing the application of lifestyle medicine practices. A shared agenda between Cardiology and the American College of Lifestyle Medicine could further the utilization of behavioral interventions. This review suggests seven steps that could be shared by these organizations and other medical societies. First, there is a need to develop and promulgate the assessment of lifestyle factors as ""vital signs"" during patient visits. Second, developing a strong partnership between the fields of Cardiology and Physiatry could improve important aspects of cardiac care, including a potential redesign of cardiac stress testing. Third, behavioral evaluations should be optimized at patients' entrée points into medical care since these may be considered ""windows of opportunity"". Fourth, there is a need to broaden cardiac rehabilitation into inexpensive programs and make this program eligible for patients with risk factors but no known CVD. Fifth, lifestyle medicine education should be integrated into the core competencies for relevant specialties. Sixth, there is a need for inter-societal advocacy to promote lifestyle medicine practices. Seventh, the well-being effects of healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as their impact on one's sense of vitality, should be emphasized.",Progress in cardiovascular diseases,2023-,"Rozanski A, Blumenthal JA, Hinderliter AL, Cole S, Lavie CJ",5,2032,cardiology,2025-11-22

36921651,Bullying in Cardiology: Pakistan's Perspective.,"This survey aimed to investigate the extent of bullying among junior physicians in cardiology departments, by way of an anonymous web-based questionnaire in Pakistan. A survey of Pakistan cardiology trainees was piloted as a cross-sectional qualitative survey of junior cardiologists (including resident physicians and senior registrars) from teaching institutes all over Pakistan. Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised was used as the tool for monitoring and reporting bullying nationwide. Of 1852 trainees, bullying was reported by 10.2% of males and 13.4% of females. Women had higher odds of reporting being bullied (odds ratio [OR] {95% confidence interval [CI]}: 1.42 [1.07-2.36]; P-value = 0.018), and the religious minority group (Hindu) reported more bullying (OR [95% CI]: 3.27 [2.16-4.73]; P-value < 0.001). Women were more likely than men to report sexist language (24.1% vs 7.5%; P-value < 0.001) while men reported more racist language (4.2% vs 16.5%; P-value < 0.001). Consultants in cardiology (75.4%) and other specialties (68.3%) commonly perpetrated bullying on cardiology trainees. Bullying in cardiology is a common finding and proportionally affects both males and females, religious minorities, and trainees working in tertiary care hospitals. In addition, females are reporting more sexist language being used by consultants as the majority.",Current problems in cardiology,2023-Jul,"Rashid S, Ullah A, Satti DI, Malik J, Iqbal H, Mehmoodi A, Ashraf W",7,1363,cardiology,2025-11-22

38637261,Development and evolution of nuclear cardiology and cardiac PET in Canada.,"Gated radionuclide angiography and myocardial perfusion imaging were developed in the United States and Europe in the 1970's and soon adopted in Canadian centers. Much of the early development of nuclear cardiology in Canada was in Toronto, Ontario and was quickly followed by new programs across the country. Clinical research in Canada contributed to the further development of nuclear cardiology and cardiac PET. The Canadian Nuclear Cardiology Society (CNCS) was formed in 1995 and became the Canadian Society of Cardiovascular Nuclear and CT Imaging (CNCT) in 2014. The CNCS had a major role in education and advocacy for cardiovascular nuclear medicine testing. The CNCS established the Dr Robert Burns Lecture and CNCT named the Canadian Society of Cardiovascular Nuclear and CT Imaging Annual Achievement Award for Dr Michael Freeman in memoriam of these two outstanding Canadian leaders in nuclear cardiology. The future of nuclear cardiology in Canada is exciting with the expanding use of SPECT imaging to include Tc-99m-pyrophosphate for diagnosis of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis and the ongoing introduction of cardiac PET imaging.",Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences,2024-Jun,"Ruddy TD, Davies RA, Kiess MC",3,1149,cardiology,2025-11-22

37088174,Artificial Intelligence in Cardiology: Applications and Obstacles.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is poised to alter the flow of daily life, and in particular, medicine, where it may eventually complement the physician's work in diagnosing and treating disease. Despite the recent frenzy and uptick in AI research over the past decade, the integration of AI into medical practice is in its early stages. Cardiology stands to benefit due to its many diagnostic modalities and diverse treatments. AI methods have been applied to various domains within cardiology: imaging, electrocardiography, wearable devices, risk prediction, and disease classification. While many AI-based approaches have been developed that perform equal to or better than the state-of-the-art, few prospective randomized studies have evaluated their use. Furthermore, obstacles at the intersection of medicine and AI remain unsolved, including model understanding, bias, model evaluation, relevance and reproducibility, and legal and ethical dilemmas. We summarize recent and current applications of AI in cardiology, followed by a discussion of the aforementioned complications.",Current problems in cardiology,2023-Sep,"Danilov A, Aronow WS",2,1092,cardiology,2025-11-22
32370835,Artificial Intelligence in Cardiology: Present and Future.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a nontechnical, popular term that refers to machine learning of various types but most often to deep neural networks. Cardiology is at the forefront of AI in medicine. For this review, we searched PubMed and MEDLINE databases with no date restriction using search terms related to AI and cardiology. Articles were selected for inclusion on the basis of relevance. We highlight the major achievements in recent years in nearly all areas of cardiology and underscore the mounting evidence suggesting how AI will take center stage in the field. Artificial intelligence requires a close collaboration among computer scientists, clinical investigators, clinicians, and other users in order to identify the most relevant problems to be solved. Best practices in the generation and implementation of AI include the selection of ideal data sources, taking into account common challenges during the interpretation, validation, and generalizability of findings, and addressing safety and ethical concerns before final implementation. The future of AI in cardiology and in medicine in general is bright as the collaboration between investigators and clinicians continues to excel.",Mayo Clinic proceedings,2020-May,"Lopez-Jimenez F, Attia Z, Arruda-Olson AM, Carter R, Chareonthaitawee P, Jouni H, Kapa S, Lerman A, Luong C, Medina-Inojosa JR, Noseworthy PA, Pellikka PA, Redfield MM, Roger VL, Sandhu GS, Senecal C, Friedman PA",17,1201,cardiology,2025-11-22
33599803,Gender and career in cardiology-a cross-sectional study.,"The proportion of women as leading physicians in cardiology in university medicine has stagnated and the share of women in senior positions in cardiology is low compared with other medical specialist fields. Here, we analyze the typical barriers for women as doctors in cardiology and point to issues that make the discipline less attractive for both genders. In a cross-sectional study, a standardized online questionnaire was sent to 3873 members of the German Cardiac Society (DGK). Answers from 567 (278 women, 289 men) were analyzed, using comparisons between groups, correlation analyses, and tests of normal distribution. For 47.4% of respondents (52.0%, of women; 42.8%, of men; p = 0.049), training had lasted longer than anticipated. Average monthly gross income (full-time work) differed significantly between women and men as specialists (p = 0.004) and assistant doctors (p = 0.030). Of women, 32.1% had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace. The main arguments against a career in university medicine were an extremely competitive working climate (66.7% of women, 63.2% of men), lack of work-life balance (66.7% women, 55.3% men), and excessive workload (57.8% women, 62.5% men). As strategies to increase job attractiveness, both mentioned measures to improve the work-life balance, and the flexibility of working times and improved financial provision. Women asked for gender balance at management level (76.3% vs. 32.9% of men) and opportunities for sharing management tasks (82.4% vs. 57.9%). Flatter hierarchies were requested by more men (67.1 vs. 54.8%). Further development of the work culture in cardiology seems necessary. In order to increase the attractiveness of the field overall and to provide equal opportunities in cardiology, more targeted support should be provided to young doctors and more flexibility introduced into work.",Herz,2021-Mar,"Dettmer S, Wenzel A, Trenkwalder T, Tiefenbacher C, Regitz-Zagrosek V",5,1867,cardiology,2025-11-22

36538996,Gender Parity in High Impact Cardiology Journals.,"Despite increased female representation in medical training, women physicians continue to be under-represented in academic cardiology, particularly in senior roles of authorship and leadership. We analyzed the top 20 most-cited cardiology journals (31,540 total articles) between January 1, 2018 and October 31, 2021 for gender distribution of editorial staff and authorship. Our data demonstrated that only 27% of articles had women as first authors and 20% as senior authors. Women constituted 23% of editorial staff. There is a statistically significant negative correlation (R = 0.67, P = 0.0011) between the percentage of women as first authors and the percentage of men on editorial boards. Overall, female authorship increased from 26% first and 19% senior authors in 2018, to 29% first and 22% senior authors in 2021. Women authors are significantly under-represented in academic cardiology publications, and additional work is needed to identify and address barriers to publishing and academic advancement for women in cardiology.",Current problems in cardiology,2023-Mar,"Petrechko O, Faturos AS, Pal S, Khan U, Majeed H, Sagheer S, Khalid S, Farook S, Khan S, Shuja H, Zaidi SH, Wasty N, Shekhar R, Sheikh AB",14,1039,cardiology,2025-11-22

Pediatric cardiology is both a perceptual and a cognitive subspecialty that involves complex decision-making, so AI is a particularly attractive tool for this medical discipline. This review summarizes the foundational work and incremental progress made as AI applications have emerged in pediatric cardiology since 2020. AI-based algorithms can be useful for pediatric cardiology in many areas, including: (1) clinical examination and diagnosis, (2) image processing, (3) planning and management of cardiac interventions, (4) prognosis and risk stratification, (5) omics and precision medicine, and (6) fetal cardiology. Most AI initiatives showcased in medical journals seem to work well in silico, but progress toward implementation in actual clinical practice has been more limited. Several barriers to implementation are identified, some encountered throughout medicine generally, and others specific to pediatric cardiology. Despite barriers to acceptance in clinical practice, AI is already establishing a durable role in pediatric cardiology. Its potential remains great, but to fully realize its benefits, substantial investment to develop and refine AI for pediatric cardiology applications will be necessary to overcome the challenges of implementation.",Current opinion in cardiology,2022-Jan,"Van den Eynde J, Kutty S, Danford DA, Manlhiot C",4,1374,cardiology,2025-11-22

34482327,How did COVID-19 affect medical and cardiology journals? A pandemic in literature.,"The spreading speed of the COVID-19 pandemic forced the medical community to produce efforts in updating and sharing the evidence about this new disease, trying to preserve the accuracy of the data but at the same time avoiding the potentially harmful delay from discovery to implementation. The aim of our analysis was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical literature in terms of proportion of COVID-19-related published papers and temporal patterns of publications within a sample of general/internal medicine and cardiology journals. We searched through PubMed scientific papers published from 1 January 2020 to 31 January 2021 about COVID-19 in ten major medical journals, of which five were in general/internal medicine and five in the cardiology field. We analyzed the proportion of COVID-19-related papers, and we examined temporal trends in the number of published papers. Overall, the proportion of COVID-19-related papers was 18.5% (1986/10 756). This proportion was higher among the five selected general/internal medicine journals, compared with cardiology journals (23.8% vs 9.5%). The vast majority of papers were not original articles; in particular, in cardiology journals, there were 28% 'original articles', 17% 'review articles' and 55.1% 'miscellaneous', compared with 20.2%, 5.1% and 74.7% in general/internal medicine journals, respectively. Our analysis highlights the big impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on international scientific literature.

Vlachadis Castles <i>et al</i> report the results from their online survey of 452 female doctors (both trainees and specialists) from Australia and New Zealand, 13% of whom were women in cardiology. Female cardiologists reported working longer hours and more on-call commitments; significantly fewer women in cardiology reported a balanced life, or that cardiology was family friendly or female friendly, despite a greater earning capacity and an overwhelming majority agreeing that they were professionally challenged whilst intellectually stimulated in their jobs.

36691819,"Paediatric cardiology training: burnout, fulfilment, and fears.","Burnout is well characterised in physicians and residents but not in paediatric cardiology fellows, and few studies follow burnout longitudinally. Training-specific fears have been described in paediatric cardiology fellows but also have not been studied at multiple time points. This study aimed to measure burnout, training-specific fears, and professional fulfilment in paediatric cardiology fellows with the attention to time of year and year-of-training. This survey-based study included the Professional Fulfillment Index and the Impact of Events Scale as well as an investigator-designed Fellow Fears Questionnaire. Surveys were distributed at three-time points during the academic year to paediatric cardiology fellows at a large Midwestern training programme. Fellow self-reported gender and year-of-training were collected. Descriptive analyses were performed. 10/17 (59%) of fellows completed all surveys; 60% were female, 40% in the first-year class, 40% in the second-year class, and 20% in the third-year class. At least half of the fellows reported burnout at each survey time point, with lower mean professional fulfilment scores. The second-year class, who rotate primarily in the cardiac ICU, had higher proportions of burnout than the other two classes. At least half of fellows reported that they ""often"" or ""always"" worried about not having enough clinical knowledge or skills and about work-life balance. Paediatric cardiology fellows exhibit high proportions of burnout and training-specific fears. Interventions to mitigate burnout should be targeted specifically to training needs, including during high-acuity rotations.",Cardiology in the young,2023-Nov,"McCormick AD, Lim HM, Strohacker CM, Yu S, Lowery R, Vitale C, Ligsay A, Aiyagari R, Schumacher KR, Fifer CG, Owens ST, Cousino MK",12,1646,cardiology,2025-11-22

Advances in head-mounted display technology, processing, and rendering power have demonstrated the increasing utility of immersive technology in medicine and the healthcare environment. There are a growing number of publications on using immersive technology in cardiology. We reviewed the articles published within the last decade that reported case studies or research that uses or investigates the application of immersive technology in the broad field of cardiology - from education to preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance. We summarized the advantages and disadvantages of using AR and VR for various application categories. Our review highlights the need for a robust assessment of the effectiveness of the methods and discusses the technical limitations that hinder the complete integration of AR and VR in cardiology, including cost-effectiveness and regulatory compliance.

39298665,2024 updated European Heart Rhythm Association core curriculum for physicians and allied professionals: a statement of the European Heart Rhythm Association of the European Society of Cardiology.,"Heart rhythm management is a continuously evolving sub-speciality of cardiology. Every year, many physicians and allied professionals (APs) start and complete their training in cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) or electrophysiology (EP) across the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) member countries. While this training ideally ends with an EHRA certification, the description of the learning pathway (what, how, when, and where) through an EHRA core curriculum is also a prerequisite for a successful training. The first EHRA core curriculum for physicians was published in 2009. Due to the huge developments in the field of EP and device therapy, this document needed updating. In addition, a certification process for APs has been introduced, as well as a recertification process and accreditation of EHRA recognized training centres. Learning pathways are more individualized now, with Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) to monitor learning progression of trainees. The 2024 updated EHRA core curriculum for physicians and APs describes, for both CIED and EP, the syllabus, OSATS, training programme and certification, and recertification for physicians and APs and stresses the importance of continued medical education after certification. In addition, requirements for accreditation of training centres and trainers are given. Finally, suggested reading lists for CIED and EP are attached as online supplements.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",2024-Nov,"Trines SA, Moore P, Burri H, Gonçalves Nunes S, Massoullié G, Merino JL, Paton MF, Porta-Sánchez A, Sommer P, Steven D, Whittaker-Axon S, Yorgun H, Arribas F, Claude Deharo J, Steffel J, Wolpert C",16,1463,cardiology,2025-11-22

Describing the current representation of women and minorities has been a critical step in improving diversity across several fields. To address the lack of data specific to pediatric cardiology, the authors conducted a national survey. U.S. academic pediatric cardiology programs with fellowship training programs were surveyed. Division directors were invited (July 2021 to September 2021) to complete an e-survey of program composition. Underrepresented minorities in medicine (URMM) were characterized using standard definitions. Descriptive analyses at the hospital, faculty, and fellow level were performed. Altogether, 52 of 61 programs (85%) completed the survey, representing 1,570 total faculty and 438 fellows, with a wide range in program size (7-109 faculty, 1-32 fellows). Although women comprise approximately 60% of faculty in pediatrics overall, they made up 55% of fellows and 45% of faculty in pediatric cardiology. Representation of women in leadership roles was notably less, including 39% of clinical subspecialty directors, 25% of endowed chairs, and 16% of division directors. URMM comprise approximately 35% of the U.S. population; however, they made up only 14% of pediatric cardiology fellows and 10% of faculty, with very few in leadership roles. These national data suggest a ""leaky pipeline"" for women in pediatric cardiology and very limited presence of URRM overall. Our findings can inform efforts to elucidate underlying mechanisms for persistent disparity and reduce barriers to improving diversity in the field.",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2023-Mar,"Balasubramanian S, Pasquali SK, Cousino MK, Lowery RE, Les AS, Yu S, McCormick AD, West CL, Fifer CG, Goldberg CS, Romano JC, Owens ST",12,1616,cardiology,2025-11-22

Although the principles of exercise medicine have become an integral component in pediatric cardiology, there are no standardized training recommendations for exercise physiology during pediatric cardiology fellowship at this time. Thus, the Pediatric Cardiology Exercise Medicine Curriculum Committee (PCEMCC) was formed to establish core and advanced exercise physiology training recommendations for pediatric cardiology trainees.

38718932,Trends in female representation in cardiology and its subspecialties: The current state and the desired state.,"Women have been historically underrepresented in Cardiology and its subspecialties. However, limited research has been done to examine the trends of representation of women in cardiology and its subspecialties over time. Our study aims to examine these trends and compare them to other internal medicine subspecialties. We used data from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) to conduct a retrospective analysis of the gender trends of cardiology and its subspecialties over a decade from 2013 to 2023. Chi-square statistical testing was used to compare representation percentages across groups. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Compared to all internal medicine subspecialties, cardiology and its subspecialties continues to remain the least represented by women. We found a statistically significant increase in women's representation in cardiovascular disease and interventional cardiology. However, there was no statistically significant changes in the representation of women in electrophysiology and advanced heart failure. We have found over the last decade that there was a positive trend in overall women fellows choosing cardiology and its subspecialties, especially since 2018. While strides have been made in increasing the number of female fellows in cardiology, it still lags compared to other internal medicine subspecialties. As we celebrate this minor milestone, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of persistently overcoming obstacles and fostering a supportive environment throughout all training phases to attract, retain, and mentor female trainees.",Current problems in cardiology,2024-Aug,"Naser A, Puttur A, Saleh S, Ta'ani OA, Caudill A, Radhakrishnan A",6,1628,cardiology,2025-11-22

33277408,Sacred hearts and pumps: cardiology and the conflicted body politic (1500-1900).,"This article examines how conflicting notions of the body politic between the natural and the spiritual have contextualised the evolution of cardiology. After a brief look at the place of the heart in biblical, patristic and medieval notions of the church, the article turns to the Reformation period. While Martin Luther moved theological gravity to the individual's heart and conscience, his contemporary Michael Servetus described the pulmonary cycle in the context of an antitrinitarian theology condemned as theological and political heresy. In the early modern period, nature conceived as creation grounded sovereign political authority, which science could then align with. Whereas William Harvey still adhered to an Aristotelian teleology, René Descartes and subsequent mechanistic contributions to cardiology were flanked by an intense 'cardiolatry'. Both, it is argued, are two sides of the same, almost non-corporeal coin. The emerging Enlightened epistemology allowed for a position distinct from both sovereign and ecclesial powers. The French Revolution was a paradigm shift: the ancien régime falls, and its Sacred Heart devotion is mocked; the new 'Erastian' state-university emerges as the context of cardiology. These developments are reflected in the life of René Laënnec and in cultural interpretations of the heart later in the 19th century. It is shown that the heart as a doubly inscribed, both biological and spiritual organ, played a central role in theological, and therefore political and scientific notions of the body politic. These continue to haunt the present, allowing us to interpret normative appeals to the heart particularly in political contexts.",Medical humanities,2020-Dec,Feiler T,1,1684,cardiology,2025-11-22

However, comparatively little is known about intellectual COI in CPGs. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of intellectual COI and corresponding management strategies among cardiology and pulmonology CPGs. We conducted a retrospective document review of CPGs published by cardiology or pulmonology professional societies from the United States, Canada, or Europe from 2018 to 2019 available via the Emergency Care Research Institute, Guidelines International Network, or Medscape databases. We assessed the percentage of authors with an intellectual COI, defined as i) authorship on a study reviewed by the CPG, ii) authorship of a prior editorial related to a CPG recommendation, or iii) authorship of a prior related CPG. Management strategies assessed included use of GRADE methodology, inclusion of a methodologist, and recusals due to intellectual COI. Outcomes were assessed overall and compared between cardiology and pulmonology CPGs. Among the 39 CPGs identified (14 cardiology, 25 pulmonology), there were a total of 737 authors, of whom 473 (64%) had at least one intellectual COI. Among all CPGs, a median of 67% (Interquartile Range 50%-76%) of authors had at least one intellectual COI, and COI was more prevalent among cardiology compared with pulmonology CPGs (84% vs 57%, p<0.001). There was variable use of management strategies among the CPGs, including use of GRADE methodology (64% of CPGs), inclusion of a methodologist (49%), and recusals due to intellectual COI (0%).

Cardiologists and sport physicians are required to identify high-risk individuals harbouring such conditions and provide appropriate advice regarding participation in regular exercise programmes and competitive sport. The three aspects that need to be considered are: (a) the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias by participating in sports; (b) control of symptoms due to arrhythmias that are not life-threatening but may hamper performance and/or reduce the quality of life; and (c) the impact of sports on the natural progression of the underlying arrhythmogenic condition. In many cases, there is no unequivocal answer to each aspect and therefore an open discussion with the athlete is necessary, in order to reach a balanced decision.

33516090,Gender Equity Imbalance in Cardiology Scientific Sessions in the Americas.,"Women remain largely under-represented in cardiology worldwide. This is especially reflected in scientific sessions where panelists have a male preponderant representation. The amount of gender equity in cardiology during scientific activities in the American continent is unknown. The objective was to compare gender distribution of invited panelists in cardiology scientific sessions across the Americas during the period 2019-2020. A retrospective analysis of the cardiology scientific sessions held in North, Central, and South America was conducted. Sessions published on the official site and social networks of the national cardiology societies from January 1, 2019 to August 10, 2020 were included. Gender distribution and all-male panels were compared according to geographic regions, year, roles in the panel, and the main topics of the session. Seven hundred fifty-two scientific sessions were analyzed, with 3786 participants. The median participation of women was 20% (IQR 0%-37.5%). Specifically, the statistics reflected a female participation of 25% (IQR 0%-43.6%) in North America, 12.5% (IQR 0%-43%) in Central America and 10% (IQR 0%-33.3%) in South America (P < 0.0001). Women participation in the panels was different according to the main topic of the session (P < 0.0001), with higher proportions in topics such as cardiovascular diseases in women, congenital heart disease and cardio oncology. The frequency of all-male panels was 36.8% (CI95% 33.3-40.1), and it increased over time (2019: 30.9% vs 2020: 40.3%; P = 0.012). There is gender inequity in cardiology scientific sessions held in different regions of the Americas, with low participation of women especially in interventionist panels and leadership roles.",Current problems in cardiology,2021-Apr,"Burgos LM, Farina J, Sauce Perez AL, Ortiz Lopez HIA, Gupta SD, Baranchuk A, Saldarriaga Giraldo CI",7,1740,cardiology,2025-11-22
34617426,Open Access and Article Processing Charges in Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery Journals: a Cross-Sectional Analysis.,"Open access (OA) publishing often requires article processing charges (APCs). While OA provides opportunities for broader readership, authors able to afford APCs are more commonly associated with well-funded, high-income country institutions, skewing knowledge dissemination. Here, we evaluate publishing models, OA practices, and APCs in cardiology and cardiac surgery. The InCites Journal Citation Reports 2019 directory by Clarivate Analytics was searched for ""Cardiac and Cardiovascular Systems"" journals. Sister journals of included journals were identified. All journals were categorized as predominantly cardiology or cardiac surgery. Publishing models, APCs, and APC waivers were defined for all journals. One hundred sixty-one journals were identified (139 cardiology, 22 cardiac surgery). APCs ranged from $244 to $5,000 ($244-5,000 cardiology; $383-3,300 cardiac surgery), with mean $2,911±891 and median $3,000 (interquartile range [IQR]: $2,500-3,425) across 139 journals with non-zero available APCs ($2,970±890, median $3,000, IQR: $2,573-3,450, cardiology; $2,491±799, median $2,740, IQR: $2,300-3,000, cardiac surgery). Average APCs were $3,307±566 and median $3,250 (IQR: $3,000-3,500) for hybrid journals ($3,344±583, median $3,260, IQR: $3,000-3,690, cardiology; $2,983±221, median $2,975, IQR: $2,780-3,149, cardiac surgery) and $1,997±832 and median $2,100 (IQR: $1,404-2,538) for fully OA journals ($2,039±843, median $2,100, IQR: $1,419-2,604, cardiology; $1,788±805, median $2,000, IQR: $1,475-2,345, cardiac surgery). Waivers were available for 51 (86.4%) fully OA and 37 (37.4%) hybrid journals. Seventeen journals were fully OA without APCs, one journal did not yet release APCs, and four journals were subscription-only. OA publishing is common in cardiology and cardiac surgery with substantial APCs.

34353409,A paediatric cardiology handbook for the digital age.,"Paediatric cardiology fellows, tasked with studying a large and dynamic field, may benefit from a quick-access digital resource that reflects contemporary practice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a paediatric cardiology handbook smartphone app in enhancing the accessibility of information such as guidelines and recommendations for paediatric cardiology fellows. The Peds Cardiology Handbook app (iOS) was designed using XCode and Swift programming. A pre-app survey and download instructions were sent to the US paediatric cardiology fellows, followed by a post-app survey. Fellows were asked to rate the ease of rapid access to various types of information. Responses were compared pre- and post-app using McNemar's test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Two-hundred and thirty paediatric cardiology fellows were contacted; 23% (n = 53) completed both the pre- and post-app surveys and were included for analysis. After using the app, fellows found it easier to quickly access information in eight out of nine domains evaluated (p < 0.05). All fellows found the app easy to use (100%), most felt that the app was well-organised (98%), contained reliable information (92%), and was useful for finding quick answers to clinical questions (87%). The Peds Cardiology Handbook iPhone app is a useful, reliable tool that provides quick access to high-yield information, including guidelines and references. Overall, paediatric cardiology fellows found it easier to rapidly access clinically relevant information after using the app. Future studies may be necessary to evaluate long-term use and impact on evidence-based practice.",Cardiology in the young,2022-May,"Rochelson E, Clark BC, Motonaga KS",3,1657,cardiology,2025-11-22
33843546,Medical education and training within congenital cardiology: current global status and future directions in a post COVID-19 world.,"Despite enormous strides in our field with respect to patient care, there has been surprisingly limited dialogue on how to train and educate the next generation of congenital cardiologists. This paper reviews the current status of training and evolving developments in medical education pertinent to congenital cardiology. The adoption of competency-based medical education has been lauded as a robust framework for contemporary medical education over the last two decades. However, inconsistencies in frameworks across different jurisdictions remain, and bridging gaps between competency frameworks and clinical practice has proved challenging. Entrustable professional activities have been proposed as a solution, but integration of such activities into busy clinical cardiology practices will present its own challenges. Consequently, this pivot towards a more structured approach to medical education necessitates the widespread availability of appropriately trained medical educationalists, a development that will better inform curriculum development, instructional design, and assessment. Differentiation between superficial and deep learning, the vital role of rich formative feedback and coaching, should guide our trainees to become self-regulated learners, capable of critical reasoning yet retaining an awareness of uncertainty and ambiguity. Furthermore, disruptive innovations such as ""technology enhanced learning"" may be leveraged to improve education, especially for trainees from low- and middle-income countries. Each of these initiatives will require resources, widespread advocacy and raised awareness, and publication of supporting data, and so it is especially gratifying that Cardiology in the Young has fostered a progressive approach, agreeing to publish one or two articles in each journal issue in this domain.",Cardiology in the young,2022-Feb,"McMahon CJ, Tretter JT, Redington AN, Bu'Lock F, Zühlke L, Heying R, Mattos S, Krishna Kumar R, Jacobs JP, Windram JD",10,1838,cardiology,2025-11-22
32013834,Women in Cardiology: Role of Social Media in Advocacy.,"Digital and social media have transformed the field of medicine. They are powerful tools that academic and non-academic physicians and healthcare providers are using to influence others, promote ideas, obtain knowledge, disseminate research and communicate with others. The history of advocacy for women in medicine and the role of social media in influencing the choice of women to choose Cardiology as a career and its role in advocacy for Women in Cardiology (WIC) have been reviewed. It has changed the way cardiologists learn, educate, and interact with each other. Social media has proven especially useful in advocating for WIC, but whether it can help improve the numbers of female doctors going into Cardiology remains to be seen. In addition to encouraging women to pursue cardiology, social media has drawn attention to key women's rights issues affecting practicing female cardiologists.",Current cardiology reviews,2021-,"Patel H, Volgman AS",2,899,cardiology,2025-11-22
32495652,Machine Learning in Cardiology-Ensuring Clinical Impact Lives Up to the Hype.,"Despite substantial advances in the study, treatment, and prevention of cardiovascular disease, numerous challenges relating to optimally screening, diagnosing, and managing patients remain. Simultaneous improvements in computing power, data storage, and data analytics have led to the development of new techniques to address these challenges. One powerful tool to this end is machine learning (ML), which aims to algorithmically identify and represent structure within data. Machine learning's ability to efficiently analyze large and highly complex data sets make it a desirable investigative approach in modern biomedical research. Despite this potential and enormous public and private sector investment, few prospective studies have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes from this technology. This is particularly true in cardiology, despite its emphasis on objective, data-driven results. This threatens to stifle ML's growth and use in mainstream medicine. We outline the current state of ML in cardiology and outline methods through which impactful and sustainable ML research can occur. Following these steps can ensure ML reaches its potential as a transformative technology in medicine.",Journal of cardiovascular pharmacology and therapeutics,2020-Sep,"Russak AJ, Chaudhry F, De Freitas JK, Baron G, Chaudhry FF, Bienstock S, Paranjpe I, Vaid A, Ali M, Zhao S, Somani S, Richter F, Bawa T, Levy PD, Miotto R, Nadkarni GN, Johnson KW, Glicksberg BS",18,1200,cardiology,2025-11-22
37101328,The Role of Nurses in Fetal Cardiology Programs: An Integrative Review.,"Fetal cardiology programs are evolving quickly and include multiple interdisciplinary health care professionals whose roles could benefit from clear definition. Nurses provide an essential function in this field; however, descriptions or definitions of nursing practice, education and knowledge requirements, and responsibilities are limited and vary across institutions and disciplines. To conduct an integrative review summarizing the literature to determine the role of nurses in fetal cardiology programs. We conducted an integrative review as per Whittemore and Knafl's (2005) methodology of current literature to reveal strengths and opportunities in describing nursing practice as fetal cardiology nurses. The search strategy included five electronic databases: CINAHL, Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Peer-reviewed English-language articles discussing nursing practices in fetal cardiology published between 2015 and 2022 were selected. Data extraction and analysis were completed on a final sample of 26 articles. Four themes were identified on fetal cardiac nursing practice from nursing and medical perspectives: multidisciplinary key team member, psychosocial family support and counselor, coordinator or navigator, and role description. More discussion in the literature is needed to better understand and define fetal cardiac nursing practice. Although most experts agree nurses are an important member of the interdisciplinary fetal cardiology team, their roles and educational requirements are poorly described and defined. Quality metrics and benchmarks are needed to ensure safe and effective fetal cardiology care.",MCN.

34215364,"Cardiology, Research and Training: An Interview With Professor Eugene Braunwald.","Professor Eugene Braunwald, often referred to as the 'Father of Modern Cardiology', has contributed significantly to medicine and cardiology. He is best known for the acclaimed textbook Braunwald's Heart Disease and for being the founding chairman of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Study Group. Our primary aim is to highlight his experiences and the guidance that he has to offer to future generations of medical trainees and professionals. An interview with Prof. Braunwald provided the authors with an insight into his journey in medicine. A range of questions were posed pertaining to his struggles and accomplishments in cardiology, his perspectives on the future of cardiology and research, as well as his advice to current and future medical professionals.<sup>1</sup> Positive role models are an inspiration to all, regardless of the stage in their career. With hard work, unwavering dedication and a strong desire to make a positive difference to patients and the field, the opportunities are endless. Whether it is clinical or bench research, advances in clinical cardiology and research usually go hand-in-hand. Although primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease remain of critical importance, it is now time to focus on primordial prevention to step back and reduce the development of the risk factors for the future development of cardiovascular disease in the first place. There have been significant advances in cardiology over the past two-thirds of the century during which Prof. Braunwald trained and then led the field. However, there is still much work to be done. Mentors and medical institutions alike must work towards a common goal of 'igniting the fire' within the new generation of clinicians and investigators who will then propel this important specialty to ever greater heights.","Heart, lung & circulation",2021-Aug,"Sabharwal N, Dev H, Sinha M, Saxena P, Raman J",5,1842,cardiology,2025-11-22

38062686,Cardiology residents' attitudes towards clinical supervision: a multi-centered study.,"Residents' gender, residency level, and hospital types might influence their attitudes towards clinical supervision (CS); however, reports of its impact on cardiology residency are nonexistent. We explore the effect of gender, residency level, and hospital location's effect on Indonesian cardiology trainees' attitudes towards CS. A multi-centered, cross-sectional study was conducted. We invited 490 Indonesian cardiology residents in September- October 2019 to complete the Cardiology CS Scale. Residents' attitudes, gender, university, and residency year were expressed using descriptive statistics. A Mann-Whitney test analyzed the gender and university location effect on residents' attitudes. Training year and university's impact were subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis test; a p-value of &lt;0.05 reflected a significant result. A total of 388 residents agreed to participate (response rate=79.18%). Most of them were male (n=229 [59,02%]), attended universities in Java Island (n=262 [67,52%]), and were in their 2nd-3rd year of training (n=95 [24.48%], each). There were no significant differences in residents' attitudes between genders (U [Nmale=229, Nfemale=159]=17,908.50, z=-0.27, p=0.78). Generally, their attitudes were significantly affected by the university (H(7)=47.38, p&lt;0.01). However, the university location (located in Java Island or outside Java Island) does not affect residents' attitude towards CS (U [NJava=262, Nnon-Java=126]=15,237.00, z=-1.23, p=0.22). In addition, the residents' training year also affected the residents' response (H(2)=14.278, p&lt;0.01). Cardiology residents' attitudes towards CS are significantly influenced by training year and university but not gender or university location. The results might provide insightful information for further improvement of CS in cardiology training and guide further evaluation.",Korean journal of medical education,2023-Dec,"Allo IJT, Findyartini A, Santoso A, Iqbal M",4,1868,cardiology,2025-11-22

39212427,Artificial Intelligence and Cardiology Practice in Nigeria: Are We Ready?,"Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. As cardiovascular risk factors continuously rise to pandemic levels, there is intense pressure worldwide to improve cardiac care in preventive cardiology, cardio-diagnostics, therapeutics, and interventional cardiology. Artificial intelligence (AI), an advanced branch of computer science has ushered in the fourth industrial revolution with myriad opportunities in healthcare including cardiology. The developed world has embraced the technology, and the pressure not to be left behind is intense for both policymakers and practicing physicians/cardiologists in low to middle-income countries (LMICs) like Nigeria. This is especially daunting for LMICs who are already plagued with a high burden of infectious disease, unemployment, physician burnt, brain drain, and a developing cardiac practice. Should the focus of cardiovascular care be on men or machines? Is the technology sustainable in a low-resource setting? What lessons did we learn from the COVID-19 pandemic? We attempt to zero in on the dilemmas of AI in the Nigerian setting including AI acceptance, the bottlenecks of cardiology practice in Nigeria, the role of AI, and the type of AI that may be adapted to strengthen cardiovascular care of Nigerians.",Nigerian journal of clinical practice,2024-Aug,"Antia SE, Ajaero CC, Kalu AU, Odili AN, Ugwu CN, Isiguzo GC",6,1284,cardiology,2025-11-22

Pediatric cardiology fellowship training now recognizes the importance of palliative care, but rarely includes CL education, despite its fragile patient population. To address this professionalism gap, a formal CL writing curriculum was created and implemented in a pediatric cardiology fellowship. This study investigated the impact of the curriculum on pediatric cardiology CL writing, and broader CL practices and beliefs. Pediatric cardiology fellows at a high volume urban academic program from 2000 to 2022 were divided into two cohorts (exposure to CL curriculum [2014-2022] vs. no exposure [2000-2013]) and responded by anonymous electronic multiple choice and open ended survey to assess the CL curriculum and describe current CL practices and beliefs. Impact of curriculum elements was determined by ordinal ranking. A 5-point Likert scale was used to report physician behaviors. Chi-square tests of independence were utilized for group comparisons. The overall survey response rate was 59% (63/107). Cardiologists who participated in the curriculum (64%, 35/55) were more likely to report writing CLs (80% vs. 40%; P < 0.01). Impactful curriculum elements included the opportunity for all fellows to contribute to a CL (78%) and identifying a primary fellow to write the CL (66%). A majority (>75%) of curriculum participants agreed that formal teaching increased their frequency, ability, and comfort in writing CLs.

38245457,JCL roundtable: Evolution of preventive cardiology and clinical lipidology.,"It's a privilege to discuss preventive cardiology with 3 of the foremost U.S. leaders in this growing subspecialty. Preventive cardiology is the practice of primordial, primary, and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. It employs an integrated team of clinicians committed to preventing all forms of cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and other conditions. Thus, contemporary preventive cardiology extends management beyond dyslipidemic risk reduction and now commonly includes treatment of hypertension, diabetes and other related cardiometabolic disorders, novel cardiovascular risk factors, thrombotic risk, some cardiac genetic disorders, and cardiac disorders specific to women's health, as well as attention to tobacco- and drug-related risks. Preventive cardiologists may simultaneously manage cardiac rehabilitation programs. Among significant innovations are the launch of the American Journal of Preventive Cardiology in 2020, increasing validation and use of coronary artery calcium scoring, prescription of obesity and diabetes pharmaceuticals by cardiologists, and focus on pregnancy as a natural cardiovascular stress test for women with implications for future cardiovascular events. A continuing major barrier is that reimbursement for preventive cardiology services currently does not match the value benefit which accrues to patients and society. Preventive care too often is added late in the course of disease management. In addition to ongoing pharmaceutical and lifestyle research, future directions include incorporation of specific training goals for preventive cardiology in general clinical cardiology training programs and support for registered dietitian reimbursement for services to patients with clinically manifest atherosclerosis.",Journal of clinical lipidology,2024-,"Gulati M, Michos ED, Boden WE, Guyton JR",4,1833,cardiology,2025-11-22

In Spain, there are multidisciplinary HF units coordinated by cardiology and internal medicine. Our objective is to describe its current organizational model and their adherence to the latest scientific recommendations. In late 2021, a scientific committee (with cardiology and internal medicine specialists) developed a questionnaire that was sent as an online survey to 110 HF units. 73 from cardiology (accredited by SEC-Excelente) and 37 from internal medicine, (integrated in UMIPIC program). We received 83 answers (75.5% total: 49 from cardiology and 34 from internal medicine). The results showed that HF units are mostly integrated by specialists from cardiology, internal medicine and specialized nurse practitioners (34.9%). Patient characteristics from HF units are widely different when comparing those in cardiology to UMIPIC, being the latter older, more frequently with preserved ejection fraction and higher comorbidity burden. Most HF units (73.5%) currently use a hybrid face-to-face/virtual model to perform patient follow-up. Natriuretic peptides are the biomarkers most commonly used (90%). All four disease-modifying drug classes are mainly implemented at the same time (85%). Only 24% of HF units hold fluent communication with primary care. Both models from cardiology and internal medicine HF units are complementary, they include specialized nursing, they use hybrid approach for patient follow-up and they display a high adherence to the latest guideline recommendations.

35029784,Cardiac Outpatient Care in a Digital Age: Remote Cardiology Clinic Visits in the Era of COVID-19.,"The worldwide pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus disease transformed healthcare in many ways. The impact of the pandemic was also noted in outpatient settings with various clinics adopting telehealth as the new normal. The goal of this paper is to investigate how the pandemic impacted the outpatient cardiology setting, specifically regarding the use of telehealth, and can the lessons learned from the adoption of telehealth in the backdrop of COVID-19 be applied to facilitate the wider and routine use of telemedicine in the outpatient cardiology clinic. Several studies have been conducted showcasing COVID-19's impact on the telehealth field of cardiology. Studies showed advantages for patients. Among these advantages are reduction in wait and travel time, easier medication reconciliation, and convenience. They also showed a general comfortability with the transition to telehealth among cardiologists. Furthermore, the adoption of telehealth in the outpatient cardiology setting, specifically with respect to the management of common cardiac conditions of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic heart disease, revealed the potential of telemedicine to be used to adequately address these conditions. The transition to telehealth was not without its challenges, such as lack of a physical exam, barriers with certain patient populations to adopting the technology, and changes were noted in frequencies of medication ordering and cardiology-specific laboratory and diagnostic imaging. This transition to telehealth during the pandemic allowed for various studies to be conducted on how telehealth impacted the field of cardiology in the outpatient setting. While patient and practitioner advantages were revealed when compared to traditional outpatient cardiology visits, barriers to the adoption of the technology among specific patient populations were noted as were changes in practice among cardiologists. The use of telemedicine to adequately address common cardiac conditions was also shown. Further investigation into understanding the barriers of specific patient populations and overcoming these barriers, understanding the reason for the changes in practice of cardiologists with the use telemedicine, and investigating the use and incorporation of existing technology such as smart watches and patient portals or apps to make the transition to telehealth not only simpler, but to also optimize the cardiologist management of common cardiac conditions, have the potential to lead to the wider and routine use of telemedicine in the outpatient cardiology clinic.",Current cardiology reports,2022-Jan,"Mishra K, Edwards B",2,2608,cardiology,2025-11-22

Although medical schools and internal medicine residency programs have witnessed major improvements in diversity, the field of cardiology has not emulated these patterns. Gender, race, and ethnicity data from the graduate medical education supplements published annually in the Journal of the American Medical Association from 2014 through 2020 were analyzed. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the recruitment of female trainees in cardiology was also investigated. Women represented 24.6% of cardiology trainees in the year 2020, which is a minor increase from 21.2% in 2014. The percentage of Hispanic trainees has slightly decreased from 6.90% in 2014 to 6.26% in 2020, while the percentage of Black trainees has only increased from 5.45% in 2014 to 5.50% in 2020. The data demonstrate a clear disparity and a desperate need for diversification of the cardiology trainee workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate this lack of diversity in upcoming years due to the reemergence of inequities in social responsibilities between male and female trainees. Strong action must be taken on an institutional level to shift the culture in cardiology to one that is more appealing to women and underrepresented minorities in order to better serve an increasingly diverse population.",Journal of the National Medical Association,2022-Aug,"Aoun M, Dekhou A, Jahshan A, Chinnaiyan K",4,1515,cardiology,2025-11-22
39624885,Emerging Educational and Networking Platforms in Interventional Cardiology: Expanding Beyond Traditional Social Media.,"With ubiquitous use of smartphones and other Internet-enabled devices, clinicians have access to a plethora of multimedia platforms that enable them to network, share educational content, and learn. Several platforms also enable resources that support clinical decision making. Traditional social media has been used extensively by cardiologists for several years and now extends to the entire care team including trainees, advanced practitioners, nurses and technologists. Numerous challenges include concerns about patient privacy and security, lack of peer-review and organization, and chances of propagating misinformation. More recently, newer networking platforms have emerged within cardiology to overcome several of the limitations of traditional social media. Additionally, mobile applications have emerged as an educational tool that provides clinicians with easy access to the latest information including guidelines, consensus documents, risk estimators and treatment algorithms. These point-of-care learning and decision-making tools are especially relevant and impactful in a procedural field like interventional cardiology. While professional societies are major drivers of these emerging platforms, there are also other stakeholders including educational institutions and the medical device industry. In this review article, we examine the role of traditional social media and describe newer networking platforms as well as mobile applications applicable to interventional cardiology with a discussion about their relative advantages and disadvantages.",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2024-Dec,"Bharadwaj AS, Cader FA, Goldsweig AM, Kini A, Sharma S, Gluckman TJ, O'Leary J, Cohen D, Cigarroa JE, Alasnag M",10,1568,cardiology,2025-11-22
34032156,Core Cardiology Training Symposium (COCATS) Standards and Board Certifications: Implications for Fellows-in-Training Seeking Employment.,"The Core Cardiology Training Symposium (COCATS) standards are recommendations endorsed by the American College of Cardiology to assist cardiology fellowship program training directors in curricular design. In addition to seeking COCATS standards as evidence of proficiency in cardiovascular skills, Fellows-In-Training (FITs) often pursue board certifications to maximize their hiring potential. The costs and barriers with COCATS standards and board certification processes are not insignificant, however the degree to which the job marketplace demands them has not been well characterized. The intent of this investigation study was to estimate the demand for COCATS standards and board certification in cardiology job advertisements. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of job listings on the American College of Cardiology's ""Cardiology Careers"" page, to establish how often advanced COCATS standards and certifications are requested. Of a total of 314 total cardiology job postings (including 133 academic positions), only eight (2.5%) job postings explicitly noted COCATS standards. Aside from American Board of Internal Medicine subspecialty certification, only 8.60% required certification in another cardiology related board certification. Despite the perception that COCATS standards and subspecialty certifications are vital to the cardiology job application process, our analysis suggests that few job postings require them. Concern regarding COCATS standards and subspecialty certification of FITs may be out of proportion to the relevance of these achievements on the current job market.",Evaluation & the health professions,2022-Dec,"Betageri O, Winchester D",2,1603,cardiology,2025-11-22
36440543,The development and efficacy of a paediatric cardiology fellowship online preparatory course.,"The transition from residency to paediatric cardiology fellowship is challenging due to the new knowledge and technical skills required. Online learning can be an effective didactic modality that can be widely accessed by trainees. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a paediatric cardiology Fellowship Online Preparatory Course prior to the start of fellowship. The Online Preparatory Course contained 18 online learning modules covering basic concepts in anatomy, auscultation, echocardiography, catheterisation, cardiovascular intensive care, electrophysiology, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and cardiac surgery. Each online learning module included an instructional video with pre-and post-video tests. Participants completed pre- and post-Online Preparatory Course knowledge-based exams and surveys. Pre- and post-Online Preparatory Course survey and knowledge-based examination results were compared via Wilcoxon sign and paired t-tests. 151 incoming paediatric cardiology fellows from programmes across the USA participated in the 3 months prior to starting fellowship training between 2017 and 2019. There was significant improvement between pre- and post-video test scores for all 18 online learning modules. There was also significant improvement between pre- and post-Online Preparatory Course exam scores (PRE 43.6 ± 11% versus POST 60.3 ± 10%, p < 0.001). Comparing pre- and post-Online Preparatory Course surveys, there was a statistically significant improvement in the participants' comfort level in 35 of 36 (97%) assessment areas. Nearly all participants (98%) agreed or strongly agreed that the Online Preparatory Course was a valuable learning experience and helped alleviate some anxieties (77% agreed or strongly agreed) related to starting fellowship. An Online Preparatory Course prior to starting fellowship can provide a foundation of knowledge, decrease anxiety, and serve as an effective educational springboard for paediatric cardiology fellows.",Cardiology in the young,2023-Oct,"Motonaga KS, Sacks L, Olson I, Balasubramanian S, Chen S, Peng L, Feinstein JA, Silverman NH, Hanley FL, Axelrod DM, Krawczeski CD, Arunamata A, Kwiatkowski DM, Ceresnak SR",14,1990,cardiology,2025-11-22

36223091,Professional Preferences and Perceptions of Cardiology Among Internal Medicine Residents: Temporal Trends Over the Past Decade.,"Internal medicine residents' professional development preferences were discordant with their perceptions of cardiology in a survey circulated a decade ago; no contemporary data exist. This information is important for effective recruitment and retention of a highly talented and diverse future cardiology workforce. To identify residents' professional development preferences and cardiology perceptions, in relation to specialty choice, and compare the findings with those from a decade prior. The original survey from the 2010 study was updated and sent to US internal medicine programs. Respondents (ie, internal medicine residents) rated 38 professional development preferences and 20 cardiology perceptions. Data were collected in 2020 and compared with survey results from the prior 2010 study. Multivariable models were created for specialty choice using scaled independent variables dichotomized using the top 2 options; categorical variables were recoded into binary variables for analysis. Multivariable models were used to determine the association of demographic characterisitcs and survey responses with prospective career choice. Responses were examined by total group, by gender, by self-reported consideration of entering cardiology as a profession, and by comparison with a decade prior both as a group and by gender. A total of 840 residents (mean [SD] age, 29.24 [2.82] years; 49.8% male; 55.4% White) completed the survey. The survey incorporated a 5-point Likert scale of 1 (not important) to 5 (extremely important) for some of the questions, with additional questions on demographic characteristics. The most important professional development preferences by descending Likert score were as follows: positive role models (4.56), stimulating career (3.81), and family friendly (3.78). The cardiology perception statements with the highest agreement were as follows: interferes with family life during training (3.93) and having met positive role models or having positive views of cardiovascular disease as a topic (3.85). Multivariable analysis yielded a 22-element model predicting cardiology as career choice. Compared with the 2010 survey, the findings of this survey indicated increased importance of work-life balance components for both male and female residents, with a greater change in male residents. Contemporary residents were more likely than their predecessors to agree with negative perceptions of cardiology. This survey study found that both male and female residents place a high value on support for optimal work-life balance; these preferences have intensified over the past decade and factor into career choice.

This online educational module included various important topics related to ATTR-CA (e.g., the cause of ATTR-CA, endomyocardial biopsy, and noninvasive methods to diagnose ATTR-CA) and SDM (e.g., benefits of SDM, the role of SDM in the diagnosis of ATTR-CA, implementation of SDM in cardiology practice, and the 3-talk model). There were 34 survey respondents, over one-third of whom were cardiologists. Most respondents agreed on the importance of diagnosing ATTR-CA at an early stage, and about three-quarters of the survey takers agreed that bone scintigraphy can reliably diagnose ATTR-CA without the need for endomyocardial biopsy. Concern over increased time commitment was the leading barrier to the implementation of SDM in respondents' clinical practice. The majority of respondents identified the correct answer regarding ATTR-CA and SDM after reading the online educational module. This improvement in scores after exposure to the online educational module was statistically significant. Baseline knowledge and awareness of various issues related to ATTR-CA was relatively low among cardiology team members. Participants' knowledge was enhanced through our effective online educational program. Prospective educational projects focused on various methods of detecting ATTR-CA as well as other amyloid conditions in diverse clinical settings will remain important.",Hospital practice (1995),2022-Feb,"Ismailov RM, Lerut J, Aceña Á, Khasanova ZD",4,1871,cardiology,2025-11-22
35975463,Advanced fellowship training for cardiology fellows in acute care cardiology.,"Hospitalised children have become more medically complex and increasingly require specialised teams and units properly equipped to care for them. Within paediatric cardiology, this trend, which is well demonstrated by the expansion of cardiology-specific ICUs, has more recently led to the development of acute care cardiology units to deliver team-based and condition-focused inpatient care. These care teams are now led by paediatric cardiologists with particular investment in the acute care cardiology environment. Herein, we describe the foundation and development of an Acute Care Cardiology Advanced Training Fellowship to meet the clinical, scholarly, and leadership training needs of this emerging care environment.",Cardiology in the young,2023-Aug,"Pater CM, Wilmot I, Russell JL, Madsen NL",4,724,cardiology,2025-11-22
34923161,Women in procedural leadership roles in cardiology: The Women In Local Leadership (WILL) observational study.,"Although 50% of U.S. medical students are women, this percentage fails to translate to cardiology. Gender disparities are striking in interventional cardiology (IC) and electrophysiology (EP) and in leadership. Left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device, as a novel procedure, is a lens into inequities. The purpose of this study was to identify the characteristics and prevalence of women (1) as early WATCHMAN implanters and (2) in related leadership. Data were collected on WATCHMAN implanters and hospitals from January 2017 to December 2018. The gender of physicians in leadership positions was identified via survey as Director of IC, Director of EP, and Chief of Cardiology. The Firth logistic model controlling for covariates modeled the rare event of a woman implanter. Data were obtained for 100% of the cohort. Men comprised 97% of implanters (860/886). No differences in subspecialty or implants by gender were observed. There were 414 hospitals performing WATCHMAN: 24% academic, 97% urban, and most medium/large size (94%). EP made up 61% of implanters. Only 4.8% of hospitals had women in selected leadership roles. Women represented <1% of Directors of IC and only 2.6% of both Directors of EP and Chiefs of Cardiology. Hospitals with a woman in leadership had a 4 times greater odds of a woman implanter (odds ratio 4.24; 95% confidence interval 1.16-15.41; P = .028). Women are underrepresented in cardiology procedural subspecialties in the use of novel technology and in key leadership roles. There was a greater odds of women early implanters of WATCHMAN if a woman led locally. Increasing women in leadership may improve gender diversity through visibility of role models.",Heart rhythm,2022-Apr,"Coylewright M, Dodge SE, Bachour K, Hossain S, Zeitler EP, Kearing S, Douglas PS, Holmes D, Reddy VY, Nair D",10,1706,cardiology,2025-11-22
34918040,Cardiovascular risk in high-hazard occupations: the role of occupational cardiology.,"Work is beneficial for health, but many individuals develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) during their working lives. Occupational cardiology is an emerging field that combines traditional cardiology sub-specialisms with prevention and risk management unique to specific employment characteristics and conditions. In some occupational settings incapacitation through CVD has the potential to be catastrophic due to the nature of work and/or the working environment. These are often termed 'hazardous' or 'high-hazard' occupations. Consequently, many organizations that employ individuals in high-hazard roles undertake pre-employment medicals and periodic medical examinations to screen for CVD. The identification of CVD that exceeds predefined employer (or regulatory body) risk thresholds can result in occupational restriction, or disqualification, which may be temporary or permanent. This article will review the evidence related to occupational cardiology for several high-hazard occupations related to aviation and space, diving, high altitude, emergency workers, commercial transportation, and the military. The article will focus on environmental risk, screening, surveillance, and risk management for the prevention of events precipitated by CVD. Occupational cardiology is a challenging field that requires a broad understanding of general cardiology, environmental, and occupational medicine principles. There is a current lack of consensus and contemporary evidence which requires further research. Provision of evidence-based, but individualized, risk stratification and treatment plans is required from specialists that understand the complex interaction between work and the cardiovascular system.

35356933,Diversity of academic general medicine: A cross-sectional bibliometric study of original English-language research articles in general medicine and cardiology in Japan.,"Although research in general medicine is diverse, it has not been compared with research in a different medical specialty. The study aim was to understand the characteristics of research produced at Japanese university departments of general medicine and published in English-language journals, via comparison with another academic specialty, cardiology.In this cross-sectional study, a nationwide survey of the official websites of 82 university-affiliated medical schools in Japan was conducted in April 2020 to identify the heads of general medicine departments. We then surveyed the research output of these individuals in terms of original article output and research field diversity for journals listed in the Web of Science Core Collection of journals from 2010 to 2019. A similar survey of cardiology department publications was also conducted to provide a reference for intergroup comparisons and analysis of covariance.The analysis included 128 researchers from 78 general medicine departments and 96 researchers from 81 cardiology departments. The dominant research field of general medicine was general and internal medicine; that of cardiology was cardiac/cardiovascular systems. Data stratification by research field showed that general medicine researchers published significantly more articles than researchers in cardiology, a field that contains relatively few researchers. Furthermore, a comparison of individual researchers with the same number of published articles showed that researchers in general medicine departments published across a significantly wider range of fields than those in cardiology.This is the first study to describe the research characteristics of general medicine university departments in Japan through comparison with research in a different academic specialty. General medicine researchers in Japan comprise a heterogeneous group that mainly publishes research on general and internal medicine.

Fifty-seven cardiology fellows together interpreted a total of 1719 EKGs with a correct rate of 52%. Sixty-four fellows completed a total of 1363 echocardiography interpretations with an accuracy rate of nearly 75%. Based on the studies discussed, it is evident that a cardiology fellow, particularly in their early years of training, may be limited due to a lack of experience.

A total of 221 graduates agreed to participate, accounting for 46.7% of the total number of graduates. Among the participants, 85.2% were male. The majority of graduates (82.4%) held Mexican nationality, while the remaining individuals represented various Latin-American nationalities. Following the completion of the cardiology fellowship, 89% of graduates pursued further postgraduate degrees. Within this group, 95.4% completed at least one additional fellowship, while 4.6% pursued a master's or PhD program. The most popular fellowship program chosen was Interventional Cardiology. On average, NIC graduates dedicate 10.8 hours per day to their work, with 6.4 hours dedicated to cardiology and 4.3 hours to their other postgraduate degree. Those employed in both public and private health systems allocate 6.1 hours and 5.2 hours per day, respectively. Additionally, 75% of graduates are involved in teaching activities. Currently, 84% of graduates are employed in Mexico. The majority of NIC graduates are physicians who further their academic training by pursuing additional postgraduate programs.

Among physician specialties evaluated, cardiology (15%, 4,152 of 27,328), gastroenterology (20%, 3,765 of 18,893), and respiratory/critical care (24%, 5,255 of 21,870) had the lowest representations of women compared with men (p <0.001 for all). Cardiology and particularly the subspecialty of interventional cardiology were clear outliers as the internal medicine specialties with the lowest representation of women at practicing specialist and trainee levels. In conclusion, this study is the largest international study of women in internal medicine specialties. It found that cardiology, gastroenterology, and respiratory/critical care specialties have the most substantial underrepresentation of women.

An online questionnaire including 62 questions (SurveyMonkey) was developed by the ""Junges Forum"" of the German Society of Pediatric Cardiology. Fellows and residents during training and up to 3 years after completing their pediatric cardiology fellowship were invited to participate. A total of 102 pediatric cardiology fellows and residents completed the questionnaire. Many participants complained about their training as being unstructured (47%) and non-transparent (37%). The numbers of technical and catheter interventions required by the national medical board in Germany cannot be achieved, especially regarding invasive procedures. Sixty per cent work more than contractually agreed, usually in Germany it is 40 hours daytime work plus on calls, while 90% of all participants prefer less than 50 weekly working hours; 50% of the participants are engaged in research that is usually done during their spare time. More than 90% are satisfied with their professional relationships with colleagues and coworkers. Seventy-eight per cent describe their career perspectives as promising, and 84% would start a fellowship in pediatric cardiology again. The majority of pediatric cardiology fellows and residents are satisfied with their working environment and with their choice of a career in pediatric cardiology.

37797176,Dr Graham Steell and monaural stethoscopes: Cardiology before the ECG.,"Dr Graham Steell, MB CM MD FRCP (1851-1942), an Edinburgh graduate, was a physician at the Manchester Royal Infirmary (1878-1911) and professor of medicine at the Victoria Manchester University (1907-1911). He is mainly remembered for describing the 'Graham Steel murmur', however his name is also associated with the 'Graham Steell monaural stethoscope', which he designed. His clinical examination of the cardiovascular system at the bedside was meticulous, using only his stethoscope, percussion hammer, and a sphygmograph to record the radial pulse. His work is described in his monograph, <i>Diseases of the Heart</i> (1906) and other numerous papers. The University of Manchester Museum of Medicine and Health has a collection of monaural stethoscopes, percussors and sphygmographs. This article explores Dr Steell's clinical techniques and contribution to cardiology in an era before chest X-rays and electrocardiography, and also discusses the use of monaural stethoscopes and percussion hammers by the wider medical profession during the Victorian and Edwardian period.",Journal of medical biography,2024-Aug,Mohr PD,1,1078,cardiology,2025-11-22
37414678,Gender Differences in Medical Student Perceptions of a Career in Cardiology.,"Worldwide, the cardiology profession has an under-representation of women. We assessed medical students' perceptions of cardiology as a career choice with the aim of identifying barriers to gender diversity. An anonymous survey was distributed to medical students studying at three Australian medical universities. Questions pertained to demographics, year and stage of medical training, desire to pursue cardiology, and perceived barriers to a cardiology career. Results were analysed according to identified gender and desire to pursue or not pursue a cardiology career. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated for independent associations. The primary outcome were barriers identified to pursuing a career in cardiology. From 127 medical student respondents (86.6% female, mean age 25.9±4.8 years), 37.0% stated they wanted to pursue a career in cardiology (39.1% of women versus 23.5% of men, p=0.54). The top four perceived barriers to a cardiology career included: poor work-life balance (92/127, 72.4%), physician training process (63/127, 49.6%), on-call requirements (50/127, 39.4%) and lack of flexibility (49/127, 38.6%), with no gender differences. Women were more likely to report gender-related barriers (37.3% versus 5.9%, p=0.01) and less likely to identify procedural aspects as a barrier (5.5% women versus 29.4% men, p=0.001). Students in their pre-clinical years were more likely to want a career in cardiology (odds ratio 3.0, 95% confidence interval 1.2-7.7, p=0.02). A high proportion of female and male medical students want to pursue a career in cardiology with both genders identifying major barriers of poor work-life balance, lack of flexibility, on-call requirements and the training process.","Heart, lung & circulation",2023-Oct,"Perera S, Aslam A, Burgess S, Castles AV, Segan L, Mukherjee S, Beale AL, Gutman SJ, Biswas S, Leet A, Zaman S",11,1725,cardiology,2025-11-22

Despite this, cardiology research commonly comes from affluent regions. This study assessed the authorship trends from LICs/LMICs in cardiology journals listed in PubMed from 2000 to 2022. The World Bank list was used to classify countries. The total number of articles published in the 138 cardiology journals was 529,359. The percentage of articles that included at least one author affiliated with LICs/LMICs institutions was 0.11 % and 2.23 %, respectively. Over the last decade, there has been an increase in the author's representation from LICs/LMICs; however, it is uneven, with some countries experiencing more significant increases (Zambia, Yemen, and Uganda for LICs, and India, Iran, and Lebanon for LMICs).

The American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) were created to standardize preoperative cardiology consultation and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). This study's purpose is to determine if these practices are over used and delay time to surgery at a safety net hospital. Retrospective review. Level 1 trauma center and safety net hospital. Charts were reviewed for indications of preoperative cardiology consultation or TTE per AHA and ACC CPG in 412 patients admitted with geriatric hip fracture. Criteria meeting the AHA/ACC guidelines for preoperative TTE and cardiac consultations. Time to surgical intervention. Despite 17.7% of patients meeting criteria, 44.4% of patients received cardiology consultation. Of those patients, 33.8% met criteria for receiving preoperative TTE but 89.4% received one. Time to surgery was greater for patients receiving cardiology consultation (25.42 ± 14.54 hours, P-value <0.001) versus those who did not (19.27 ± 13.76, P-value <0.001) and for those receiving preoperative TTE (26.00 ± 15.33 hours, P-value <0.001) versus those who did not (18.94 ± 12.92, P-value <0.001). Cardiology consultation and TTE are frequently used against AHA/ACC CPG. These measures are expensive and delay surgery, which can increase morbidity and mortality. These findings persisted despite limited resources available in a safety net hospital. Hospitals should improve adherence to CPG, or modify protocols. Prognostic Level II.

35148880,The Road Not Yet Traveled: Distinction in Critical Care Cardiology through the Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Cardiology Training Pathway.,"As the acuity, complexity, and illness severity of patients admitted to cardiac intensive care units have increased, the need to recognize critical care cardiology (CCC) as a dedicated subspecialty in cardiovascular disease has received increasing support. Differing viewpoints exist regarding the optimal pathway for CCC training. Currently, all proposed CCC training pathways involve permutations of individual training years culminating in subspecialty certification across multiple disciplines; however, there are significant disadvantages to these training paradigms. We propose an innovative, pragmatic approach to CCC training through tailored subspecialty training in advanced heart failure and transplant cardiology (AHFTC), using elective time to enrich AHFTC training with skills and experiences necessary to become a highly skilled critical care cardiologist. The completion of this pathway would lead to completion of AHFTC training with a novel designation: distinction in critical care cardiology.",Journal of cardiac failure,2022-Feb,"Carnicelli AP, Blumer V, Genovese L, Gage A, Agarwal R, Lakdawala NK, Bohula E, Katz JN",8,1012,cardiology,2025-11-22
37870730,"Association Between Race, Cardiology Care, and the Receipt of Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy in Peripartum Cardiomyopathy.","Black patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) have disproportionately worse outcomes than White patients, possibly related to variable involvement of cardiovascular specialists in their clinical care. We sought to determine whether race was associated with cardiology involvement in clinical care during inpatient admission and whether cardiology involvement in care was associated with higher claims of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) a week after hospital discharge. Using Optum's de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart (CDM), we included Black and White patients' first hospital admission for PPCM from 2008 to 2021. Cardiology involvement in clinical care was defined as the receipt of attending care from a cardiovascular specialist during admission. GDMT included beta-blockers (BB) for all patients and triple therapy (BB, angiotensin-responsive medications, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) for non-pregnant patients. Logistic regression was used to determine the associations between cardiology involvement in clinical care during admission and (1) patient race and (2) GDMT prescription, adjusting for age and comorbidities. Among 668 patients (32.6% Black, 67.4% White, 93.3% commercially insured), there was no significant difference in the odds of cardiology involvement in clinical care by race (aOR: 1.41; 95%CI: 0.87-2.33, P=0.17). Inpatient cardiology care was associated with 2.75 times increased odds of having a prescription claim for GDMT (BB) for White patients (aOR: 2.75; 95%CI 1.50-5.06, P=0.001), and the estimated effect size was similar but not statistically significant for Black patients (aOR: 2.20, 95% CI, 0.84-5.71, P=0.11). The interaction between race and cardiology involvement in clinical care was not statistically significant for the receipt of BB prescription. Among 274 non-pregnant patients with PPCM (37.2% Black, 62.8% White), 5.8% received triple GDMT. Of these, none of the Black patients lacking cardiology care had triple GDMT. However, cardiology involvement in care was not significantly associated with triple GDMT for either race. Among a commercially insured population within PPCM, race was not associated with cardiology involvement in clinical care during hospitalization. However, cardiology involvement in care was associated with significantly higher odds of prescription claims for BB for only White patients.

There is a lack of consensus surrounding the assessments used to measure the impact of pharmacist care. This heterogeneity may undermine confidence and limit utilisation of pharmacists in cardiology ambulatory care. A systematic review was conducted to understand how pharmacist interventions in cardiology ambulatory care were assessed and the impacts of these interventions on patient-centred outcomes. A comprehensive search was conducted of MEDLINE, CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Register of Randomised Controlled Trials and EMBASE from 2000 to 2020 with search terms involving pharmacist interventions among cardiology patients in the ambulatory care setting; with studies restricted to randomised controlled trials. Search results were independently screened by two reviewers. The Cochrane Risk of Bias in Randomised Trials tool was used for quality assessment of the included studies. Assessments of pharmacist impact were analysed and compared to established quality indicators of cardiology care. The search produced 3380 individual studies, following screening, 26 studies involving 9013 participants met inclusion criteria. Across the 26 included studies, eleven different intervention types were identified. Four main outcome measures assessing the impact of these interventions were identified: direct measure of cardiovascular disease risk factor, major adverse cardiovascular events, medication adherence, validated risk score for cardiovascular events. There was a high degree of variance in both the way these interventions influenced the outcome as well the outcome measures selected to assess the impact of the intervention. Of the 26 studies, sixteen listed positive impacts on primary outcomes and the remaining 10 listed neutral effects. Several outcome measures have been used to assess the impact of pharmacist intervention in cardiology ambulatory care. Aligning outcome measures with known indicators of cardiology care quality, as well as more detailed descriptions of intervention, will provide clinicians vital information in designing effective and measurable interventions in cardiology ambulatory care.",Research in social & administrative pharmacy : RSAP,2023-Mar,"Livori AC, Prosser A, Levkovich B",3,2283,cardiology,2025-11-22

To evaluate the psychometric properties of the 2019 Cardiology Certification Exam in relation to the IR parameters. This was an observational study, with psychometric analysis of the 120 questions of the exam taken by 1,120 candidates for the title of Cardiologist in 2019. The IRT analysis revealed that 32.2% of the items had a ""high"" or ""very high"" discriminating power, 49.2% were categorized as ""easy"" or ""very easy"", and 41.5% showed a high probability of a correct guessing. Sixty-nine deficient items in terms of the IRT parameters were identified, which were then considered poorly effective in evaluating the candidate's ability. The psychometric analysis of the 2019 Cardiology Certification Exam by the IRT revealed a high percentage of easy questions, with nearly two thirds of the items with a high probability of correct guessing.

We use the perspective of a physician who is underrepresented in medicine (URiM), and has chosen to pursue a career in pediatric cardiology, to initiate an analysis of the current path toward pediatric cardiology and the factors in undergraduate and graduate medical education which could currently be optimized to improve diversity in training. We argue that a lack of diversity among physicians leads to worse patient outcomes, and we describe steps to improve representation in the field. In order to improve representation in pediatric cardiology, we must reflect upon our current practices and implement systemic changes within cardiology training program recruitment and retention practices. These changes should include continuous mentorship of URiM trainees interested in cardiology and prioritization of research that investigates social determinants of health which may disproportionally affect minority patients.",Pediatric cardiology,2024-Aug,"Ezeoke OM, Williams J, Ogueri V, Hills BK",4,1036,cardiology,2025-11-22

33622441,Publishing patterns and citation performance of manuscripts relating to paediatric cardiology and congenital heart disease: comparison of paediatric and adult cardiology journals.,"Manuscripts pertaining to paediatric cardiology and CHD have been published in a variety of different journals. Some of these journals are journals dedicated to paediatric cardiology, while others are focused on adult cardiology. Historically, it has been considered that manuscripts published in journals devoted to adult cardiology have greater citation potential. Our objective was to compare citation performance between manuscripts related to paediatric cardiology and CHD published in paediatric as opposed to adult cardiology journals. We identified manuscripts related to paediatric cardiology and CHD published in five journals of interest during 2014. Of these journals, two were primarily concerned with adult cardiology, while the other three focused on paediatric cardiology. The number of citations for these identified manuscripts was gathered from Google Scholar. We compared the number of citations (median, mean, and 25th, 75th, 90th, and 95th percentiles), the potential for citation, and the h-index for the identified manuscripts. We identified a total of 828 manuscripts related to paediatric cardiology and congenital heart as published in the 5 journals during 2014. Of these, 783 (95%) were published in journals focused on paediatric cardiology, and the remaining 45 (5%) were published in journals focused on adult cardiology. The median number of citations was 41 in the manuscripts published in the journals focused on adult cardiology, as opposed to 7 in journals focused on paediatric cardiology (p < 0.001). The h-index, however, was greater for the journals dedicated to paediatric cardiology (36 versus 27). Approximately one-twentieth of the work relating to paediatric cardiology and CHD is published in journals that focus predominantly on adult cardiology. The median number of citations is greater when manuscripts concerning paediatric cardiology and CHD are published in these journals focused on adult cardiology. The h-index, however, is higher when the manuscripts are published in journals dedicated to paediatric cardiology. While such publications in journals that focus on adult cardiology tend to generate a greater number of citations than those achieved for works published in specialised paediatric cardiology journals, the potential for citation is no different between the journals. Due to the drastically lower number of manuscripts published in journals dedicated to adult cardiology, however, median performance is different.",Cardiology in the young,2021-Oct,"Loomba RS, Sheikholeslami D, Dyson A, Flores S, Villarreal E, Torres J, Jacobs JP, Anderson RH",8,2482,cardiology,2025-11-22

Under the auspice of the Clinical Practice Guideline Quality Indicator Committee of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), the Working Group for cardiac pacing QIs was formed. The Group comprised Task Force members of the 2021 ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines on Cardiac Pacing and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy, members of the European Heart Rhythm Association, international cardiac device experts, and patient representatives. We followed the ESC methodology for QI development, which involved (i) the identification of the key domains of care by constructing a conceptual framework of the management of patients receiving cardiac pacing, (ii) the development of candidate QIs by conducting a systematic review of the literature, (iii) the selection of the final set of QIs using a modified-Delphi method, and (iv) the evaluation of the feasibility of the developed QIs. Four domains of care were identified: (i) structural framework, (ii) patient assessment, (iii) pacing strategy, and (iv) clinical outcomes. In total, seven main and four secondary QIs were selected across these domains and were embedded within the 2021 ESC Guidelines on Cardiac Pacing and Cardiac Resynchronization therapy. By way of a standardized process, 11 QIs for cardiac pacing were developed. These indicators may be used to quantify adherence to guideline-recommended clinical practice and have the potential to improve the care and outcomes of patients receiving cardiac pacemakers.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",2022-Jan,"Aktaa S, Abdin A, Arbelo E, Burri H, Vernooy K, Blomström-Lundqvist C, Boriani G, Defaye P, Deharo JC, Drossart I, Foldager D, Gold MR, Johansen JB, Leyva F, Linde C, Michowitz Y, Kronborg MB, Slotwiner D, Steen T, Tolosana JM, Tzeis S, Varma N, Glikson M, Nielsen JC, Gale CP",25,1602,cardiology,2025-11-22

This systematic review explores the integration of AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) in ECG analysis, focusing on their impact on predictive diagnostics and treatment support in cardiology. A systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 framework, using four high-impact databases to identify studies from 2014 to -2024. The inclusion criteria included English-language journal articles and research papers that focused on AI applications in cardiology, specifically ECG analysis. Records were screened, duplicates were removed, and final selections were made on the basis of their relevance to AI-ECG integration for cardiac health. The review included 46 studies that met the inclusion criteria, covering diverse AI models such as CNNs, RNNs, and hybrid models. These models were applied to ECG data to detect and predict heart conditions such as arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. These findings indicate that AI-driven ECG analysis improves diagnostic accuracy and provides significant support for early diagnosis and personalized treatment. AI technologies, especially ML and DL, enhance ECG-based cardiology diagnostics by increasing accuracy, reducing diagnosis time, and supporting timely interventions and personalized care.

This results in discrepancies between starting levels of medical residents and expected standards in clinical practice. Another side effect is the international decline in interest in a career in these cardiovascular fields. To compensate for this, extracurricular education programs focused on cardiothoracic surgery and cardiology have been set up. This study aims to evaluate the impact and benefits of an extracurricular education program on students' knowledge of cardiothoracic surgery and cardiology and to explore possible factors involved in (academic) career decision making. 66 participants were enrolled in the extracurricular education program VECTOR and were included in a cross-sectional cohort study. All participants scored their familiarity with different aspects of cardiothoracic surgery and cardiology prior to and after the course. Data was analyzed using Linear regression and Wilcoxon Signed Rank testing. Participants demonstrated a significant trend towards improved familiarity with cardiothoracic surgery and cardiology after the program (p = < .001). Significant increased knowledge scores were reported for all specified subdomains after the course with an increase in academic interest in cardiology (p = < .001) and cardiothoracic surgery (p = < .001). Students revealed that clinical responsibilities and a healthy work-life balance were considered most important when deciding upon their future career. This study highlights the benefit of an extracurricular education program in cardiothoracic surgery and cardiology for undergraduates and could possibly aid students in preparing for clinical practice.",Journal of medical systems,2023-Sep,"El Mathari S, Arrouby A, Boulidam N, Kluin J",4,1747,cardiology,2025-11-22

The personality of J.E. Purkynje caused this field to reach unprecedented peak at the very beginning of its modern history. The development of experimental cardiology after the death of the great scholar was certainly not linear. Just when it seemed to be raising its head, the German occupation came. Its second hopeful awakening was delayed for a long time by forty years of isolation. The significant limitation of foreign contacts gradually led to the loss of hopefully developing contacts, to professional isolation and lagging behind the stormy development of world science. At the moment of greatest depression, in 1971, in Prague there was created a professional forum that was supposed to enable its intellectual survival and reduce the negative consequences of the ""splendid isolation"". The Society of Experimental Cardiology (SEC) was founded at the Czechoslovak Physiological Society of the Czechoslovak Medical Society J.E. Purkynje, with the main task of introducing theoretical and clinical cardiologists to the advances in world cardiology. The first meeting was held in 1973 and in 2023 we celebrated already the 50th anniversary of SEC. Moreover, nowadays we see the increasing interest of the young researchers, both experimental and clinical cardiologists, who consider SEC a very attractive platform for their education and professional growth.

39526423,Precision of artificial intelligence in paediatric cardiology multimodal image interpretation.,"Multimodal imaging is crucial for diagnosis and treatment in paediatric cardiology. However, the proficiency of artificial intelligence chatbots, like ChatGPT-4, in interpreting these images has not been assessed. This cross-sectional study evaluates the precision of ChatGPT-4 in interpreting multimodal images for paediatric cardiology knowledge assessment, including echocardiograms, angiograms, X-rays, and electrocardiograms. One hundred multiple-choice questions with accompanying images from the textbook <i>Pediatric Cardiology Board Review</i> were randomly selected. The chatbot was prompted to answer these questions with and without the accompanying images. Statistical analysis was done using <i>X</i><sup>2</sup>, Fisher's exact, and McNemar tests. Results showed that ChatGPT-4 answered 41% of questions with images correctly, performing best on those with electrocardiograms (54%) and worst on those with angiograms (29%). Without the images, ChatGPT-4's performance was similar at 37% (difference = 4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -9.4% to 17.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.56). The chatbot performed significantly better when provided the image of an electrocardiogram than without (difference = 18, 95% CI 4.0% to 31.9%, <i>p</i> < 0.04). In cases of incorrect answers, ChatGPT-4 was more inconsistent with an image than without (difference = 21%, 95% CI 3.5% to 36.9%, <i>p</i> < 0.02). In conclusion, ChatGPT-4 performed poorly in answering image-based multiple-choice questions in paediatric cardiology. Its accuracy in answering questions with images was similar to without, indicating limited multimodal image interpretation capabilities. Substantial training is required before clinical integration can be considered. Further research is needed to assess the clinical reasoning skills and progression of ChatGPT in paediatric cardiology for clinical and academic utility.",Cardiology in the young,2024-Nov,"Gritti MN, Prajapati R, Yissar D, Morgan CT",4,1883,cardiology,2025-11-22
33929288,Use of Online Resources to Study Cardiology by Clinical Veterinary Students in the United Kingdom.,"Online resources are being increasingly used by veterinary students to complement their learning. However, their use by veterinary students, especially for cardiology learning, remains poorly understood. This article investigates the extent to which clinical veterinary students use online resources to study cardiology and whether this is affected by factors of gender, age, year of study, or entry status. This was a questionnaire-based study distributed to clinical veterinary students across eight UK universities and achieved 213 respondents. The lecturer was the most preferred resource except for direct entry students and students aged 27 or more, who preferred recommended textbooks. Some 95.3% of students use search engines to research cardiology topics, and 93.4% indicated that they would first search for answers online rather than contacting their instructor. Online video clips were popular as 71.8% of students accessed them at least once per week for cardiology learning. Of those students, 89.3% found online videos useful for understanding cardiological concepts. Social media was only rarely used (6.6%) to discuss cardiology information. Nonetheless, most students (64.3%) stated that they would enjoy interacting with course material on an instructor-led social media page. Despite most students (62%) not automatically trusting online resources, only 46.9% of students indicated that they verify online cardiology information. Online resources play an important role in complementing traditional resources in cardiology learning and suggest that some level of academic oversight may be necessary to ensure students use these resources in an appropriate manner.",Journal of veterinary medical education,2022-Apr,"Saadeh K, Henderson V, Julita Paramasivam S, Jeevaratnam K",4,1684,cardiology,2025-11-22

Whether cardiac injury, including myocarditis, also occurs with asymptomatic or mild-severity COVID-19 infection is uncertain. There is an ongoing concern about COVID-19-associated cardiac pathology among athletes because myocarditis is an important cause of sudden cardiac death during exercise. Prior to relaxation of stay-at-home orders in the US, the American College of Cardiology's Sports and Exercise Cardiology Section endorsed empirical consensus recommendations advising a conservative return-to-play approach, including cardiac risk stratification, for athletes in competitive sports who have recovered from COVID-19. Emerging observational data coupled with widely publicized reports of athletes in competitive sports with reported COVID-19-associated cardiac pathology suggest that myocardial injury may occur in cases of COVID-19 that are asymptomatic and of mild severity. In the absence of definitive data, there is ongoing uncertainty about the optimal approach to cardiovascular risk stratification of athletes in competitive sports following COVID-19 infection. This report was designed to address the most common questions regarding COVID-19 and cardiac pathology in athletes in competitive sports, including the extension of return-to-play considerations to discrete populations of athletes not addressed in prior recommendations. Multicenter registry data documenting cardiovascular outcomes among athletes in competitive sports who have recovered from COVID-19 are currently being collected to determine the prevalence, severity, and clinical relevance of COVID-19-associated cardiac pathology and efficacy of targeted cardiovascular risk stratification. While we await these critical data, early experiences in the clinical oversight of athletes following COVID-19 infection provide an opportunity to address key areas of uncertainty relevant to cardiology and sports medicine practitioners.",JAMA cardiology,2021-Feb,"Kim JH, Levine BD, Phelan D, Emery MS, Martinez MW, Chung EH, Thompson PD, Baggish AL",8,2068,cardiology,2025-11-22

Verani Lectureship has traditionally been an opportunity for presenters to reflect on the state of nuclear cardiology in clinical practice and expound on new innovations in the field. Mario Verani was a visionary who embraced change and, as a cardiologist, sought to define where other cardiac imaging techniques might complement nuclear cardiology for improving patient care. Over the last decade, nuclear cardiology and cardiac computed tomography (CT) have developed in parallel with both expanding beyond the evaluation of coronary artery disease. However, many consider cardiac CT a formidable threat to nuclear cardiology due to pivotal technical innovations and its subsequent exponential growth in recent years. It is only fitting that this year's lectureship explore the relative value of both techniques in evaluating and managing cardiac disease, their relative strengths and weaknesses, and the potential value of combining nuclear cardiology and cardiac CT imaging for enhancing patient management.

Some surveys have been performed in other countries, but in Portugal, the situation is largely unknown. An online survey on perceptions of cardiology and professional preferences was sent to 1371 members of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology, of whom 18.2% completed the survey. We included 219 cardiologists or cardiology trainees, of whom 50.2% were female, with decreasing proportions from younger to older age groups, in which males still predominate. Women are less often married and more frequently childless, particularly those working in an invasive subspecialty, where they represent only 16% of all respondents working in these areas. Men's perception is that women do not choose these areas due to family reasons, radiation concerns and difficult working conditions, but from the female perspective, male dominance, lack of female role models and restricted access are the main barriers. Women consider it is difficult for them to obtain a leadership role, but men do not think the same (75.5% vs. 27.5%). In Portugal, females predominate in younger age groups, suggesting a paradigm change. Women are less frequently married and more frequently childless, particularly women working in invasive subspecialties. Women consider that it is more difficult for them to obtain a leadership role.

32826286,Evaluation of indicators supporting reproducibility and transparency within cardiology literature.,"It has been suggested that biomedical research is facing a reproducibility issue, yet the extent of reproducible research within the cardiology literature remains unclear. Thus, our main objective was to assess the quality of research published in cardiology journals by assessing for the presence of eight indicators of reproducibility and transparency. Using a cross-sectional study design, we conducted an advanced search of the National Library of Medicine catalogue for publications in cardiology journals. We included publications published between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2019. After the initial list of eligible cardiology publications was generated, we searched for full-text PDF versions using Open Access, Google Scholar and PubMed. Using a pilot-tested Google Form, a random sample of 532 publications were assessed for the presence of eight indicators of reproducibility and transparency. A total of 232 eligible publications were included in our final analysis. The majority of publications (224/232, 96.6%) did not provide access to complete and unmodified data sets, all 229/232 (98.7%) failed to provide step-by-step analysis scripts and 228/232 (98.3%) did not provide access to complete study protocols. The presentation of studies published in cardiology journals would make reproducing study outcomes challenging, at best. Solutions to increase the reproducibility and transparency of publications in cardiology journals is needed.

33421284,Impact of emergency short-stay unit opening on in-hospital global and cardiology indicators.,"Emergency short-stay unit (SSU) alleviates emergency department (ED) overcrowding, but may affect in-hospital indicators. Cardiology patients comprise a substantial part of patients admitted at SSU. This study evaluated whether SSU opening differentially modified in-hospital indicators at a whole general hospital and at its cardiology division (CARD). We retrospectively analysed indicators based on 859 686 ED visits, and 171 547 hospital admissions, including 12 110 CARD admissions, from 2007 to 2018 at a general tertiary hospital, and compared global ED indicators and in-hospital indicators at the hospital and CARD before (2007-2011) and after (2011-2018) SSU opening. After SSU opening, monthly ED bed occupancy rate decreased (mean ± SD 200 ± 18% vs 187 ± 22%; P < .001) and in-hospital admissions from ED increased at the hospital (median [interquartile range] 460 [81] vs 524 [41], P < .001) and CARD (50 [12] vs 54 [12], P = .004). In parallel, monthly in-hospital elective admissions decreased at CARD (34 [18] vs 28 [17], P = .019), but not at the hospital (712 [73] vs 700 [104], P = .54). Average length of stay (LOS) increased at both hospital (8.5 ± 0.3 vs 8.7 ± 0.4 days, P < .001) and CARD (9.2 ± 1.5 vs 10.3 ± 2.3 days, P = .002) after SSU opening, but percent admissions at SSU showed a direct relationship with LOS solely at CARD. Furthermore, cardiology patients admitted at SSU had greater LOS, prevalence of coronary heart disease and age than those admitted at the conventional cardiology ward. SSU opening improved ED crowding, but was associated with changes in in-hospital indicators, particularly at CARD, and in the characteristics of hospitalized cardiology patients. These findings suggest that in-hospital cardiology services may need re-evaluation following SSU opening at a general hospital.",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,2021-Dec,"Cirillo W, Freitas LRC, Kitaka EL, Matos-Souza JR, Silva MR, Coelho OR, Coelho-Filho OR, Sposito AC, Nadruz W",9,1830,cardiology,2025-11-22

38648917,Exploring the impact of cardiologists expertise on publication metrics.,"In the field of academic cardiology, the assessment of an author's scholarly impact and professional progression heavily relies on publications and citations. This study investigates whether specific cardiology expertise correlates with accelerated professional growth. Using data from the 2023 European Society of Cardiology congress, 948 faculty attendees with an h-index of 30 or higher were analyzed. Expertises were categorized into six groups, and their association with publications and citations peaks was explored. Interventional cardiologists exhibited the highest annual publication peak, followed by imaging and electrophysiology experts. However, no significant differences were observed in citation peaks among expertise groups. While imaging experts initially appeared to reach citation peaks faster, this effect diminished after statistical adjustments. Additionally, holding multiple expertise areas prolonged the time to reach publication and citation peaks by approximately six years. This study underscores the influence of expertise in interventional cardiology on publication peaks but suggests that citation peaks and career progression velocity remain unaffected by expertise type. Furthermore, it highlights that holding multiple areas of expertise slowers the attainment of career peak for scholarly authors.",International journal of cardiology,2024-Jul,"Mauro MS, Laudani C, Landolina D, Sangiorgio G, Capodanno D",5,1334,cardiology,2025-11-22
38445448,Feasibility of alcohol interventions in cardiology: a qualitative study of clinician perspectives in Sweden.,"This study aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to implementing alcohol screening and brief interventions (SBI) in cardiology services. This was a qualitative study. Individual, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 clinical cardiology staff (doctors, nurses, and assistant nurses) of varying experience levels and from various clinical settings (high-dependency unit, ward, and outpatient clinic), in three regions of Sweden. Reflexive thematic analysis was used, with deductive coding applying the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation (COM-B) theoretical framework. A total of 41 barriers and facilitators were identified, including 12 related to capability, 9 to opportunity, and 20 to motivation. Four themes were developed: (i) uncharted territory, where clinicians expressed a need to address alcohol use but lacked knowledge and a roadmap for implementing SBI; (ii) cardiology as a cardiovascular specialty, where tasks were prioritized according to established roles; (iii) alcohol stigma, where alcohol was reported to be a sensitive topic that staff avoid discussing with patients; and (iv) window of opportunity, where staff expressed potential for implementing SBI in routine cardiology care. Findings suggest that opportunities exist for early identification and follow-up of hazardous alcohol use within routine cardiology care. Several barriers, including low knowledge, stigma, a lack of ownership, and a greater focus on other risk factors, must be addressed prior to the implementation of SBI in cardiology. To meet current clinical guidelines, there is a need to increase awareness and to improve pathways to addiction care. In addition, there may be a need for clinicians dedicated to alcohol interventions within cardiology services.

The implications are unknown. In a nationwide HF cohort with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), we compared demographics, clinical characteristics, guideline-based therapy use and outcomes in non-cardiology vs. cardiology in-patient and out-patient care. Between 2000 and 2016, 36,076 patients with HFrEF were enrolled in the Swedish HF registry (19,337 [54%] in-patients overall), with 44% of in-patients and 45% of out-patients managed in non-cardiology settings. Predictors of treatment in non-cardiology were age > 75 years (adjusted odds ratio for non-cardiology 1.20; 95% confidence interval 1.14-1.27), lower education level (0.71; 0.66-0.76 for university vs. compulsory), valve disease (1.24; 1.18-1.31) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) >120 mmHg (1.05; 1.00-1.10). Non-cardiology care was significantly associated with lower use of beta-blockers (0.80; 0.74-0.86) and devices (intracardiac defibrillator [ICD] and/or cardiac resynchronization therapy [CRT]: 0.63; 0.56-0.71), and less frequent specialist follow-up (0.61; 0.57-0.65). Over 1-year follow-up the risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.09; 1.03-1.15) was higher but the risk of first HF (re-) hospitalization was lower (0.93; 0.89-0.97) in non-cardiology vs. cardiology care. In HFrEF, non-cardiology care was independently associated with older ageand lower education. After covariate adjustment, non-cardiology care was associated with lower use of beta-blockers and devices, higher mortality, and lower risk of HF hospitalization.

39133268,Preoperative cardiology consultations for geriatric patients with hip fractures rarely provide additional recommendations and are associated with prolonged hospital stays and delayed surgery: a retrospective case control study.,"Hip fractures are increasingly common among the elderly population, who often present with a high burden of comorbidities necessitating preoperative stabilization. As a result, preoperative cardiology consultations are frequently conducted in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the additional recommendations provided by preoperative cardiology consultations and the impact of consultations on the management and outcomes of elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. This matched cohort study was performed to retrospectively assess the clinical data of patients who were treated for hip fractures at our institution between January 2016 and December 2017. Individuals who were 60 years old or older with available clinical and radiological data were included. A total of 262 patients who met these criteria were included, with 192 undergoing cardiology consultation and 70 not. Through matching for age, sex, ASA grade, fracture type, and surgery type, two groups (Group A, preoperative cardiology consultation requested; Group B, preoperative cardiology consultation not requested) of 50 patients each were formed. The duration between hospital admission and surgery, recommendations provided by cardiology consultation, type of anaesthesia and surgery, length of hospital stay, incidence of medical and orthopaedic complications, and one-year mortality status were compared between the groups. The mean age of Group A was 78.5 (± 7.4) years, whereas that of Group B was 78.4 (± 7.4) years (p = 0.99). Both groups included 30 female patients and 20 male patients each. There were no significant differences in anaesthesia type or the incidence of medical or orthopaedic complications between the groups. However, Group A experienced a significantly longer duration between admission and surgery (5 [1/9] days vs. 3 [0/7] days; p = 0.00) and a longer hospital stay (7 [3/15] days vs. 5 [1/19] days; p = 0.01) than did Group B. The one-year mortality rate did not significantly differ between the groups (30% vs. 20%; p = 0.36). Notably, only 3 out of 50 patients received additional treatments following cardiology consultation beyond routine recommendations. Preoperative cardiology consultations before hip fracture surgery rarely leads to a change in treatment.

Eligibility for intensive proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9i) in secondary prevention was also assessed. Following 2021 ESC guidelines, 62.5% of individuals aged <55 years old would have been eligible for statins before their first STEMI, similarly to older age categories. In comparison, only 17% and 18% of young individuals would have been eligible for primary prevention statins prior to their first STEMI with 2016 and 2019 guidelines, compared with group 55-65 years (41% and 35%) and >65 years old (19% and 72%), p<0.01. After their first STEMI, 25% of patients <55 years would be eligible for PCSK9i, compared with 23.2% and 15% in patients aged 55-65 years and >65 years. The 2021 ESC guidelines allowed a much better detection of young individuals before their first STEMI than prior ESC guidelines.

35640917,"Wearables, telemedicine, and artificial intelligence in arrhythmias and heart failure: Proceedings of the European Society of Cardiology Cardiovascular Round Table.","Digital technology is now an integral part of medicine. Tools for detecting, screening, diagnosis, and monitoring health-related parameters have improved patient care and enabled individuals to identify issues leading to better management of their own health. Wearable technologies have integrated sensors and can measure physical activity, heart rate and rhythm, and glucose and electrolytes. For individuals at risk, wearables or other devices may be useful for early detection of atrial fibrillation or sub-clinical states of cardiovascular disease, disease management of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart failure, and lifestyle modification. Health data are available from a multitude of sources, namely clinical, laboratory and imaging data, genetic profiles, wearables, implantable devices, patient-generated measurements, and social and environmental data. Artificial intelligence is needed to efficiently extract value from this constantly increasing volume and variety of data and to help in its interpretation. Indeed, it is not the acquisition of digital information, but rather the smart handling and analysis that is challenging. There are multiple stakeholder groups involved in the development and effective implementation of digital tools. While the needs of these groups may vary, they also have many commonalities, including the following: a desire for data privacy and security; the need for understandable, trustworthy, and transparent systems; standardized processes for regulatory and reimbursement assessments; and better ways of rapidly assessing value.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",2022-Oct,"Leclercq C, Witt H, Hindricks G, Katra RP, Albert D, Belliger A, Cowie MR, Deneke T, Friedman P, Haschemi M, Lobban T, Lordereau I, McConnell MV, Rapallini L, Samset E, Turakhia MP, Singh JP, Svennberg E, Wadhwa M, Weidinger F",20,1598,cardiology,2025-11-22

Despite its importance, medical practitioners often face challenges in communicating effectively. Because of these gaps, we aim to introduce a simulation-based training protocol to improve pediatric cardiology trainee's communication skills. This study will be conducted in collaboration with associations supporting caregivers of children with congenital heart disease. It strives to demonstrate how specific training programs can efficiently foster humanistic, patient-centered care in standard medical practice. This multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial will be conducted in pediatric cardiac units and simulation centers of across 10 universities in France. The study population comprises pediatric cardiologists in training (including pediatric cardiac fellows or specialist assistants). The SIMUL-CHD intervention will consist of simulation-based training with standardized patients, focusing on improving communication skills for pediatric cardiology trainees during diagnostic counselling. Patients and caregivers have been recruited from a National Patient Association named ""Petit Cœur de Beurre"". The primary outcome is the quality of physicians' communication skills. The evaluation committee, which will review video recordings of the sessions, will be blinded to which participants received simulation-based training (group of interest) and which received theory-based training (control group). Secondary outcomes are the effect of SIMUL-CHD on empathy and anxiety levels in young pediatric cardiologists. Baseline scores pre and post-intervention will be compared, and skill improvement resulting from the intervention measured. Simulation-based training has proven efficacy in teaching technical skills in various scenarios however its application to communication skills in pediatric cardiology remains unexplored. The involvement of experienced parents provides a unique perspective, incorporating their profound understanding of the emotional challenges and specific hurdles faced by families dealing with congenital heart disease.

Medical staff is exposed to ionising radiations with difficulties to accurately estimate the absorbed dose, on the other hand, it is well known that eye lens and extremities are the most exposed. In most IC units, radiological monitoring is performed by measuring the personal dose equivalent with a dosemeter worn under the operator's apron. The ambient dose equivalent is, usually, also measured. Furthermore, doses to the lens and extremities are often not measured because of the absence or difficulty of wearing the appropriate dosemeters. The main aim of our study is to estimate the extremities doses, of the interventional cardiologists, from the personal dose equivalent, the patient's received doses or to the ambient dose equivalent. For this purpose, we use a radiological monitoring, of four (04) interventional cardiologists, carried out at Algiers hospital. A Monte Carlo calculation is performed for comparison.

38388330,Competency based medical education in nuclear cardiology: A tale of two axes.,"Across medical specialties, including nuclear cardiology, competency based medical education (CBME) changes the emphasis of learning from a time or experiential emphasis to a proficiency focused approached. Plotted on a learning-curve graph the emphasis on learning has shifted from the duration/ volume-based x-axis to the performance-based y-axis. It has proven difficult to establish y-axis-based standards within nuclear cardiology to assess learning. As such there is a paucity of data to verify current experiential training targets and only recently is data emerging that seeks to find CBME targets by which proficiency (y-axis units) can be evaluated. Initial reports from such CBME-oriented studies indicate that in current nuclear cardiology practice, the number of studies required to achieve competency is dependent upon the chosen measure of competency that is assessed (summed stress score versus % LV ischemia), the case mix, and the modality being learnt (PET versus SPECT). Recent findings have also suggested that prior levels of experiential training may be an underestimation of the number of supervised studies learners need to interpret before they achieve competency. Nuclear cardiology training has adopted the concept of CBME and is progressing toward a more modern approach to trainee assessment. This brief review provides the background, current requirements and insights into new developments in nuclear cardiology training.",Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences,2024-Jun,"Small GR, Chow BJW",2,1453,cardiology,2025-11-22

A bibliometric review of all full-length articles published between January 2014 and March 2020 in the top four cardiovascular journals (Circulation, European Heart Journal (EHJ), Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC), and JAMA Cardiology) was conducted. For each eligible article in the four journals, the journal of publication, study design, area of interest, country of origin, and type of intervention tested (for cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology studies) were extracted. The affiliations of all editorial board members were identified from journal websites or from online searches and recorded as from cardiac surgery, cardiology, or another discipline. Correlations between variables were evaluated. A total of 4835 articles were reviewed. Cardiac surgery studies amounted to 6.2% (104) of total research publications in JACC, 4.4% (74) in Circulation, 3.6% (13) in JAMA Cardiology, and 2.0% (22) in EHJ (P < .001). The percentage of cardiac surgery publications was significantly less than interventional cardiology publications (P < .001). Cardiac surgery studies represent only a small minority of the articles published in the top cardiovascular journals over the last 5 years, with significant differences between individual journals.

To examine female representation within Australia and New Zealand (NZ) among physician specialties and certain comparator surgical specialties with a focus on cardiology as an outlier of workforce gender equality. Data of practising medical specialists, new consultants and trainees were sought from the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, the Medical Council of NZ and the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (2015-2017). The stratified data pertaining to interventional cardiologists were obtained through direct contact with individual hospitals (from 2017 to 2018) and derived from state-based cardiac registries. In Australia and NZ, there were fewer female practising adult medicine physician consultants (n = 8956, 32%, P < 0.001), with gender disparities seen across most physician specialties. Cardiology (15%) was the only physician specialty with <20% representation; gastroenterology (23%), neurology (27%) and respiratory medicine (29%) had <30% female representation at the consultant level. The rates of cardiology (15%) and interventional cardiology (5%) were similar to general surgery (15%) and orthopaedics (4%). Although more than half of physician trainees are female, and most physician specialties are approaching or have equal gender ratios at the trainee level, cardiology (23%) and interventional cardiology (9%) remain significantly underrepresented. Cardiology is the only physician specialty with <20% female consultants, and this disparity is reflected throughout every stage of the cardiology training programme.

Little is known about how factors specific to patients, clinicians, and facilities contribute to variation in cardiology telehealth use. The aim of this study is to estimate the relative extent to which patient-, clinician-, and facility-level factors affect cardiology telehealth use in VHA. This was a retrospective, nation-wide cohort study of veterans' use of VHA cardiology telehealth care during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 11, 2020, to March 10, 2022). We constructed multilevel, multivariable, logistic regression models of patient-level cardiology telehealth use (telephone or video-based care). Models included random effects for the patient, the patient's main cardiology provider, and the patient's primary facility (ie, VHA medical center) for specialty care and fixed effects for patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Our analytic cohort comprised 223,809 veterans with 989,271 encounters among 2235 unique clinicians. The veterans' average age was 70.2 years, and 3.4% (n=7616) were women. Of the 989,271 encounters, 4.2% (n=41,480) were video based and 34.3% (n=338,834) were phone based. Adjusted odds of telehealth use were slightly higher for women versus men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.08, 95% CI 1.05-1.10), individuals identifying as Hispanic or Latino versus not Hispanic or Latino (AOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.43-1.49), and those with medium and long drive times versus short drive time (AOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.10-1.12 and AOR 1.09, 95% CI 1.07-1.10, respectively). Further, 40.5% of the variation in a veteran's likelihood of using cardiology telehealth care was found at the patient level, 30.8% at the clinician level, and 7% at the facility level. The largest share of the attributable variability in VHA cardiology telehealth use in this cohort was explained by the patient, followed closely by the clinician. Little variability was attributed to the primary facility through which the veteran received their cardiology care. These results suggest that policy solutions intended to improve equity of cardiology telehealth care use in VHA may be most impactful when directed at patients and clinicians.",Journal of medical Internet research,2024-Oct,"Tisdale RL, Ferguson JM, Van Campen J, Greene L, Wray CM, Zulman DM",6,2313,cardiology,2025-11-22

We conducted a retrospective chart review for patients less than 18 years of age who were referred to cardiology clinics at a single quaternary referral centre from 2017 to 2019. We collected patient demographic data including race, an index of neighbourhood socio-economic deprivation linked to a patient's geocoded address, referral information, and cardiology clinic information. The primary outcome was an incomplete clinic visit. The secondary outcome was an unscheduled appointment. Independent associations were identified using multivariable logistic regression. There were 10,610 new referrals; 6954 (66%) completed new cardiology clinic visits. Black race (OR 1.41; 95% CI 1.22-1.63), public insurance (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.14-1.46), and a higher deprivation index (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.08-1.61) were associated with higher odds of incomplete visit compared to the respective reference groups of White race, private insurance, and a lower deprivation index. The findings for unscheduled visit were similar. A shorter time elapsed from the initial referral to when the appointment was made was associated with lower odds of incomplete visit (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.52-0.74).

We sought to characterize referring clinician perceptions of NP-performed outpatient pediatric cardiology consultations. We electronically distributed to pediatric and family medicine physicians and NPs in Arkansas our 11-item survey assessing the acceptability of pediatric cardiology consultations being completed by an NP under varying circumstances. Circumstances included seven common referral indications, and the scale offered five answer choices ranging from ""definitely unacceptable"" to ""definitely acceptable"". A total of 292 of 1756 (16.6% response rate) referring clinicians responded to the survey. Overall, 57% of responses indicated that NP-completed pediatric cardiology evaluations were either definitely or probably unacceptable. Acceptability was varied by referral indication and referring clinician characteristics. Unacceptability of NP-completed pediatric cardiology evaluations was greatest among family medicine physicians (81%), pediatricians (66%), and clinicians working in solo or two-physician practices (77%) or community hospitals/clinics (71%). If NP evaluation of a murmur included required review with a cardiologist, the unacceptability rate dropped from 50 to 24% (p < 0.0001). Unacceptability was higher in physicians who do not work with NPs (69%) compared to those who do (60%) (pp < 0.0001). Many referring physicians were willing to send patients ≥ 100 miles to ensure evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist. Most referring physicians find pediatric cardiology evaluations performed by NPs to be unacceptable. Requisite review with a cardiologist improved acceptability of NP evaluations.

Preventive Cardiology has evolved into a dynamic sub-speciality focused on the promotion of CV health through all stages of life, and on the management of individuals at risk of developing CVD or experiencing recurrent CV events, through interdisciplinary care in different settings. As the level of knowledge, specialized skills, experience, and committed attitudes related to CV prevention has exceeded core cardiology training, the European Association of Preventive Cardiology (EAPC) has placed major emphasis on continuous education and training of physicians and allied professionals involved in CV prevention, with the aim of setting standards for practice and improving quality of care. The EAPC recognizes the need for a comprehensive educational offer across different levels of training (from core cardiology to sub-speciality to expert training) as well as the need for interdisciplinary approaches that will promote synergies among allied professionals involved in CV prevention. This statement by the EAPC aims to highlight current gaps and unmet needs and to describe the framework to help standardize, structure, and deliver comprehensive, up-to-date, interactive, and high-quality education using a combination of traditional and novel educational tools. The document aims to form the basis for ongoing refinements of the EAPC educational offer, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that new evidence in the field will translate to better CV practice and improved outcomes for our patients.",European journal of preventive cardiology,2024-Nov,"Koskinas KC, Wilhelm M, Halle M, Biffi A, Cavarretta E, Davos CH, Frederix I, Gaber MH, Hansen D, Jones JL, Malhotra A, Papadakis M",12,1874,cardiology,2025-11-22
33619976,Women in Cardiology Twitter Network: An Analysis of a Global Professional Virtual Community From 2016 to 2019.,"Background Social media is an effective channel for the advancement of women physicians; however, its use by women in cardiology has not been systematically studied. Our study seeks to characterize the current Women in Cardiology Twitter network. Methods and Results Six women-specific cardiology Twitter hashtags were analyzed: #ACCWIC (American College of Cardiology Women in Cardiology), #AHAWIC (American Heart Association Women in Cardiology), #ilooklikeacardiologist, #SCAIWIN (Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions Women in Innovations), #WomeninCardiology, and #WomeninEP (Women in Electrophysiology). Twitter data from 2016 to 2019 were obtained from Symplur Signals. Quantitative and descriptive content analyses were performed. The Women in Cardiology Twitter network generated 48 236 tweets, 266 180 903 impressions, and 12 485 users. Tweets increased by 706% (from 2083 to 16 780), impressions by 207% (from 26 755 476 to 82 080 472), and users by 440% (from 796 to 4300), including a 471% user increase internationally. The network generated 6530 (13%) original tweets and 43 103 (86%) amplification tweets. Most original and amplification tweets were authored by women (81% and 62%, respectively) and women physicians (76% and 52%, respectively), with an increase in original and amplification tweets authored by academic women physicians (98% and 109%, respectively) and trainees (390% and 249%, respectively) over time. Community building, professional development, and gender advocacy were the most common tweet contents over the study period. Community building was the most common tweet category for #ACCWIC, #AHAWIC, #ilooklikeacardiologist, #SCAIWIN, and #WomeninCardiology, whereas professional development was most common for #WomeninEP. Conclusions The Women in Cardiology Twitter network has grown immensely from 2016 to 2019, with women physicians as the driving contributors.

32912474,Proposed Requirements for Cardiovascular Imaging-Related Machine Learning Evaluation (PRIME): A Checklist: Reviewed by the American College of Cardiology Healthcare Innovation Council.,"Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly used within cardiology, particularly in the domain of cardiovascular imaging. Due to the inherent complexity and flexibility of ML algorithms, inconsistencies in the model performance and interpretation may occur. Several review articles have been recently published that introduce the fundamental principles and clinical application of ML for cardiologists. This paper builds on these introductory principles and outlines a more comprehensive list of crucial responsibilities that need to be completed when developing ML models. This paper aims to serve as a scientific foundation to aid investigators, data scientists, authors, editors, and reviewers involved in machine learning research with the intent of uniform reporting of ML investigations. An independent multidisciplinary panel of ML experts, clinicians, and statisticians worked together to review the theoretical rationale underlying 7 sets of requirements that may reduce algorithmic errors and biases. Finally, the paper summarizes a list of reporting items as an itemized checklist that highlights steps for ensuring correct application of ML models and the consistent reporting of model specifications and results. It is expected that the rapid pace of research and development and the increased availability of real-world evidence may require periodic updates to the checklist.",JACC.

39672298,Your Heart Can't See What Sneakers You Are Wearing: Exercise Training Load in Endurance Athletes Is Inadequately Quantified in Sports Cardiology.,"Training load may be an important factor underlying the (patho-)physiologic cardiovascular adaptations from endurance exercise. Yet, quantifying training load remains challenging due to the complexity of its components (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type [FITT]). In this systematic review we evaluate how training load has been quantified in sports cardiology studies and provide recommendations for how this can be improved. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed and EMBASE up to October 2024. Studies involving ""sports cardiology,"" ""training load,"" and ""endurance sport"" were included. Data extraction included study characteristics, training load assessment methods, cardiovascular outcomes, and athlete profiles. A total of 62 studies with 1,060,700 participants were included in our review. The majority of studies (59.7%) focused on exercise-induced cardiac remodelling, with other topics being cardiac arrhythmias (12.9%), cardiac autonomic adaptation (3.2%), exercise dose-response (6.5%), and coronary heart disease (17.7%). Training load was primarily quantified by questionnaires (58.1%), whereas heart rate monitoring, a more objective measure, was used in only 1.6% of the studies. All studies reported exercise type, but only 19.4% measured all FITT components. There is a lack of uniformity in the assessment of key FITT variables to quantify training load within the field of sports cardiology, with many studies relying on subjective or incomplete methods. As cardiology moves into the precision medicine era, researchers and clinicians should seek to obtain objective training load information from their athletes according to the FITT framework, and data from use of objective wearable devices represent the optimal way to do this.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-Mar,"Dausin C, Tironi RM, Cornelissen V, Hespel P, Willems R, Haykowsky M, La Gerche A, Claessen G, Foulkes S",9,1766,cardiology,2025-11-22
33772563,Cardiology trainees' attitudes towards clinical supervision: a scale development study.,"This study aims to explore the construct validity, dimensionality, and internal consistency of a new attitude scale for measuring cardiology trainees' attitudes towards clinical supervision. A multi-centred, cross-sectional study involving 388 Indonesian cardiology trainees from eight universities was conducted using convenience sampling. Twenty-nine items have been generated based on an extensive literature review and conceptual framework of effective clinical supervision. Ten clinical experts reviewed the items to ensure the Cardiology Clinical Supervision Scale (CCSS) adequately represents the construct under study. An exploratory factor analysis using principal axis factoring (PAF) with oblique rotation was run to identify the internal structure of the scale. Items with factor loading <0.50 were deleted. In addition, inter-item correlations and items' communalities were analysed. Each subscale's internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's alpha score. The content validity index provided evidence for CCSS' validity (G-coefficient=0.71). Scrutinising the experts' comments, we finalised the scale to include 27 items. Further, four items were deleted due to low inter-item correlation and communality. PAF analysis resulted in a two-factor model comprising the ""Supervisory Interaction and Facilitation"" factor (n=10 items) and the ""Role Modelling"" factor (n=9 items); four items were deleted due to low factor loading. The Cronbach's alpha score for SIF and RM factors were 0.93 and 0.89, respectively. The study's results support the validity, internal structure, and internal consistency of the new clinical supervision scale for cardiology training. Further studies are required to investigate other validity and reliability evidence for CCSS, including its cross-cultural validity.",International journal of medical education,2021-Mar,"Turu' Allo IJ, Santoso A, Findyartini A",3,1811,cardiology,2025-11-22
32838627,Perceptions on Diversity in Cardiology: A Survey of Cardiology Fellowship Training Program Directors.,"Background The lack of diversity in the cardiovascular physician workforce is thought to be an important driver of racial and sex disparities in cardiac care. Cardiology fellowship program directors play a critical role in shaping the cardiology workforce. Methods and Results To assess program directors' perceptions about diversity and barriers to enhancing diversity, the authors conducted a survey of 513 fellowship program directors or associate directors from 193 unique adult cardiology fellowship training programs. The response rate was 21% of all individuals (110/513) representing 57% of US general adult cardiology training programs (110/193). While 69% of respondents endorsed the belief that diversity is a driver of excellence in health care, only 26% could quote 1 to 2 references to support this statement. Sixty-three percent of respondents agreed that ""our program is diverse already so diversity does not need to be increased."" Only 6% of respondents listed diversity as a top 3 priority when creating the cardiovascular fellowship rank list. Conclusions These findings suggest that while program directors generally believe that diversity enhances quality, they are less familiar with the literature that supports that contention and they may not share a unified definition of ""diversity."" This may result in diversity enhancement having a low priority. The authors propose several strategies to engage fellowship training program directors in efforts to diversify cardiology fellowship training programs.",Journal of the American Heart Association,2020-Sep,"Crowley AL, Damp J, Sulistio MS, Berlacher K, Polk DM, Hong RA, Weissman G, Jackson D, Sivaram CA, Arrighi JA, Kates AM, Duvernoy CS, Lewis SJ, Capers Q",14,1526,cardiology,2025-11-22

It is not a future anymore, and there are many particular problems in cardiology that are already being solved via machine learning (ML), and many more are to come. AI cannot solve complex tasks yet, and probably this will not change in the upcoming years. Therefore, cardiologists do not have to be afraid that computers will replace them. However, cardiologists who will not be able to use ML algorithms in their clinical practice will be replaced by those who will. (Fig. 2, Ref. 50).

32676637,Cardiology consultation in oncology practice: a 5-year survey.,"Onco-cardiology services are expanding rapidly in Japan. To provide a better service, it is important to consider the needs of oncologists. However, little is known regarding specific needs for which oncologists should consult cardiologists to manage cardiovascular problems of their patients. We analysed cardiology consultations sought by oncologists to evaluate the role of cardiologists in cancer treatment. We retrospectively investigated consecutive 2064 cardiology consultations of cancer patients in the University of Tsukuba Hospital, Tsukuba, Japan, between January 2014 and December 2018. The most common timing of cardiology consultation was before the commencement of cancer treatment (n = 1355; 65.7%), followed by after the commencement of cancer treatment (n = 686; 33.2%). Among the 361 consultations before the administration of anticancer drugs, 235 (65.1%) were for anthracycline-based regimens. There were 506 (24.5%) consultations for the management of cardiovascular emergencies developing after the commencement of cancer treatment; venous thromboembolism was the most frequent (n = 125; 24.7%), followed by atrial fibrillation (n = 110; 21.7%) and heart failure (n = 74; 14.6%). There were marked differences in the types of cardiovascular emergencies depending on the type of cancer. This survey revealed the various cardiovascular problems for which oncologists sought interventions by cardiologists.

38000732,Perceived Gaps in Knowledge for the Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Cardiology Fellow: the Results of a National Needs-Assessment Survey.,"The field of Advanced Heart Failure and Transplant Cardiology has evolved greatly since it was first established. We sought to elicit program directors' and fellows' viewpoints on potential curricular deficits so we can better meet the educational goals of current and future fellows. We surveyed advanced heart failure and transplant cardiology program directors and fellows concerning their perceptions of the current adequacy of training and their desire for additional training needed to achieve medical competency in advanced heart failure and transplant cardiology at their institutions, as defined by the 2017 ACC Advanced Training Statement. Survey results identified key competencies deemed to be inadequately addressed during training and those in which a moderate or significant additional amount of training was desired. These competencies were identified within the 4 main domains of the fellowship: heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, mechanical circulatory support, and heart transplantation. This study highlights key medical-knowledge competencies that are inadequately addressed by current fellowship training in advanced heart failure and transplant cardiology. Fellowship programs should develop curricula that focus on the integration of these competencies into training to ensure that fellows are well equipped to care for patients.",Journal of cardiac failure,2024-Mar,"Nabi W, Windish D, Beasley MH",3,1357,cardiology,2025-11-22
33856499,American College of Cardiology Body Mass Index Counseling Quality Improvement Initiative.,"Overweight/obesity, prevalent cardiovascular risk factors in children, can be associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes in children with heart disease. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) developed quality metrics including a BMI metric related to identifying and counseling overweight and obese children presenting to cardiology clinics. This metric was used for a multicenter collaborative learning Quality improvement (QI) Project through the ACC Quality Network (QNet). Our aim was to increase the percentage of children between ages 3 and 18 years presenting to cardiology clinics at participating centers with BMI > 85th percentile who received appropriate counseling. Participating centers submitted data quarterly to QNet for a sample of patients who received counseling. A Key Driver Diagram was created to help teams drive improvement. Individual centers customized interventions and participated in network-wide educational learning sessions about QI and shared experience. Statistical process control charts were used. From 04/01/2017 to 09/30/2019, 27,511 patient visits were included. Among 32 participating centers, overall counseling rate was 54%. The BMI counseling rate increased from 25% in 2017Q2 to 54% in 2019Q3. There was a wide variation from 10 to 100% in the performance of individual centers. The overall rate of identification and counseling of overweight and obese children presenting to ambulatory cardiology clinics in participating centers is low. There is wide variation in the performance of centers, providing an opportunity for improvement. Using this multicenter learning approach, individual centers have demonstrated improvement. This demonstrates that collaborative learning approaches in QI can increase implementation of the metric.",Pediatric cardiology,2021-Jun,"Harahsheh AS, Sabati A, Anderson J, Jenkins K, Wilhelm CM, Jedeikin R, Chowdhury D",7,1788,cardiology,2025-11-22
36404398,Sequencing and titrating approach of therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction following the 2021 European Society of Cardiology guidelines: an international cardiology survey.,"In symptomatic patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), recent international guidelines recommend initiating four major therapeutic classes rather than sequential initiation. It remains unclear how this change in guidelines is perceived by practicing cardiologists versus heart failure (HF) specialists. An independent academic web-based survey was designed by a group of HF specialists and posted by email and through various social networks to a broad community of cardiologists worldwide 1 year after the publication of the latest European HF guidelines. Overall, 615 cardiologists (38 [32-47] years old, 63% male) completed the survey, of which 58% were working in a university hospital and 26% were HF specialists. The threshold to define HFrEF was ≤40% for 61% of the physicians. Preferred drug prescription for the sequential approach was angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors first (74%), beta-blockers second (55%), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists third (52%), and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (53%) fourth. Eighty-four percent of participants felt that starting all four classes was feasible within the initial hospitalization, and 58% felt that titration is less important than introducing a new class. Age, status in training, and specialization in HF field were the principal characteristics that significantly impacted the answers. In a broad international cardiology community, the 'historical approach' to HFrEF therapies remains the preferred sequencing approach. However, accelerated introduction and uptitration are also major treatment goals.

33506483,Antithrombotic Therapy in Acute Coronary Syndromes: Current Evidence and Ongoing Issues Regarding Early and Late Management.,"A few decades ago, the understanding of the pathophysiological processes involved in the coronary artery thrombus formation has placed anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents at the core of the management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Increasingly potent antithrombotic agents have since been evaluated, in various association, timing, or dosage, in numerous randomized controlled trials to interrupt the initial thrombus formation, prevent ischemic complications, and ultimately improve survival. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention, initial parenteral anticoagulation, and dual antiplatelet therapy with potent P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors have become the hallmark of ACS management revolutionizing its prognosis. Despite these many improvements, much more remains to be done to optimize the onset of action of the various antithrombotic therapies, for further treating and preventing thrombotic events without exposing the patients to an unbearable hemorrhagic risk. The availability of various potent P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors has opened the door for individualized therapeutic strategies based on the clinical setting as well as the ischemic and bleeding risk of the patients, while the added value of aspirin has been recently challenged. The strategy of dual-pathway inhibition with P2Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors and low-dose non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant has brought promising results for the early and late management of patients presenting with ACS with and without indication for oral anticoagulation. In this updated review, we aimed at describing the evidence supporting the current gold standard of antithrombotic management of ACS. More importantly, we provide an overview of some of the ongoing issues and promising therapeutic strategies of this ever-evolving topic.",Thrombosis and haemostasis,2021-Jul,"Guedeney P, Collet JP",2,1805,cardiology,2025-11-22

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) EURObservational Research Programme (EORP) Chronic Ischemic Cardiovascular Disease Long-Term (CICD-LT) registry is a prospective European registry, and was designed to describe the profile, management, and outcomes of patients with CCS across the ESC countries. We aimed to investigate clinical events at 1-year follow-up from the ESC EORP CICD-LT registry.One-year outcomes of 6655 patients from the 9174 recruited in this European registry were analysed. Overall, 168 patients (2.5%) died, mostly from cardiovascular (CV) causes (n = 97, 1.5%). Northern Europe had the lowest CV mortality rate, while southern Europe had the highest (0.5 vs. 2.0%, P = 0.04). Women had a higher rate of CV mortality compared with men (2.0 vs. 1.3%, P = 0.02). During follow-up, 1606 patients (27.1%) were hospitalized at least once, predominantly for CV indications (n = 1220, 20.6%). Among the population with measured low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level at 1 year, 1434 patients (66.5%) were above the recommended target. Age, history of atrial fibrillation, previous stroke, liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, increased serum creatinine, and impaired left ventricular function were associated with an increased risk of CV death or hospitalization. In the CICD registry, the majority of patients with CCS have uncontrolled CV-risk factors. The 1-year mortality rate is low, but these patients are frequently hospitalized for CV causes. Early identification of comorbidities may represent an opportunity for enhanced care and better outcomes.",European journal of preventive cardiology,2022-Nov,"Kerneis M, Cosentino F, Ferrari R, Georges JL, Kosmachova E, Laroche C, Maggioni AP, Rittger H, Steg PG, Maczynska J, Tavazzi L, Valgimigli M, Gale CP, Komajda M",14,1778,cardiology,2025-11-22

We employ a sociological approach to globalisation in order to reconstruct how cardiology, with our special focus being on heart failure research, has become global, and thereby placed cardiovascular diseases on the agenda of global health. Following sociological theories of world-society and world-polity, we identify a number of preconditions that had to be met so that the globalisation of cardiology could set in. Amongst them were technological innovations, the emergence of an organisational infrastructure on the national level, the appearance of cardiological journals, and an internationally standardised nomenclature. More recently, new drugs and treatment strategies, new specialist journals, and new international standards allowed the subspeciality of heart failure to globalise. Our findings are based on the history and sociology of cardiology, and on our analysis of a broad range of other documents, including scientific articles, guidelines, and policy documents. Additionally, our analysis included two datasets, one containing information on national cardiac societies, and the other containing data on publication output in cardiology.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020-Apr,"Quasinowski B, Liu T",2,1372,cardiology,2025-11-22

In 2011, >100 national and affiliated member cardiac societies of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) were contacted to contribute to a global registry on PPCM, under the auspices of the ESC EURObservational Research Programme. These societies were tasked with identifying centres who could participate in this registry. In low-income countries, e.g. Mozambique or Burkina Faso, where there are no national societies due to a shortage of cardiologists, we identified potential participants through abstracts and publications and encouraged participation into the study. Seven hundred and thirty-nine women were enrolled in 49 countries in Europe (33%), Africa (29%), Asia-Pacific (15%), and the Middle East (22%). Mean age was 31 ± 6 years, mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 31 ± 10%, and 10% had a previous pregnancy complicated by PPCM. Symptom-onset occurred most often within 1 month of delivery (44%). At diagnosis, 67% of patients had severe (NYHA III/IV) symptoms and 67% had a LVEF ≤35%.

The Registry collected baseline and 1-year follow-up data in the eight main domains: patient demographic/enrolment setting, AF diagnosis/characterization, diagnostic assessment, stroke prevention treatments, arrhythmia-directed therapies, integrated AF management, major outcomes (death, non-fatal stroke or systemic embolic event, and non-fatal bleeding event), and the quality of life questionnaire. The EORP-AF III Registry is an international, prospective registry of care and outcomes of patients treated for AF, which will provide insights into the contemporary patterns in AF management, ESC AF Guidelines implementation in routine practice and barriers to optimal management of this highly prevalent arrhythmia.",European heart journal.

36123701,Variable exposure to echocardiography core competencies when applying minimum recommended procedural numbers for cardiology fellows in training.,"The American College of Cardiology Core Cardiovascular Training Statement (COCATS) defined echocardiography core competencies and set the minimum recommend number of echocardiograms to perform (150) and interpret (300) for independent practice in echocardiography (level 2 training). Fellows may lack exposure to key pathologies that are relatively infrequent, however, even when achieving an adequate number of studies performed and interpreted. We hypothesized that cardiology fellows would lack exposure to 1 or more cardiac pathologies related to core competencies in COCATS when performing and interpreting the minimum recommend number of studies for level 2 training. We retrospectively reviewed 11,250 reports from consecutive echocardiograms interpreted (7,500) and performed (3,750) by 25 cardiology fellows at a University tertiary referral hospital who graduated between 2015 and 2019. The first 300 echocardiograms interpreted and the first 150 echocardiograms performed by each fellow were included in the analysis. Echocardiography reports were reviewed for cardiac pathologies relating to core competencies defined in COCATS. All 25 fellows lacked exposure to 1 or more cardiac pathologies related to echocardiography core competencies despite meeting COCATS minimum recommended numbers for echocardiograms performed and interpreted. Pathologies for which 1 or more fellows encountered 0 cases despite meeting the minimum recommended numbers for both echocardiograms performed and interpreted included: pericardial constriction (16/25 fellows), aortic dissection (15/25 fellows), pericardial tamponade (4/25 fellows), valvular mass/thrombus (2/25 fellows), prosthetic valve dysfunction (1/25 fellows), and cardiac chamber mass/thrombus (1/25 fellows). Cardiology fellows who completed the minimum recommend number of echocardiograms performed and interpreted for COCATS level 2 training frequently lacked exposure to cardiac pathologies, even in a University tertiary referral hospital setting. These data suggest that fellowship programs should monitor pathology case counts for each fellow in training, in addition to the minimum recommend number of echocardiograms defined by COCATS, to ensure competency for independent practice in echocardiography.",Cardiovascular ultrasound,2022-Sep,"Bierowski MJ, Qureshi U, Ramedani S, Grewal S, Shah R, Park R, Peterson BR",7,2268,cardiology,2025-11-22
38262740,European Society of Cardiology quality indicators for the care and outcomes of adults undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,"To develop a suite of quality indicators (QIs) for the evaluation of the care and outcomes for adults undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We followed the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) methodology for the development of QIs. Key domains were identified by constructing a conceptual framework for the delivery of TAVI care. A list of candidate QIs was developed by conducting a systematic review of the literature. A modified Delphi method was then used to select the final set of QIs. Finally, we mapped the QIs to the EuroHeart (European Unified Registries on Heart Care Evaluation and Randomized Trials) data standards for TAVI to ascertain the extent to which the EuroHeart TAVI registry captures information to calculate the QIs. We formed an international group of experts in quality improvement and TAVI, including representatives from the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions, the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging, and the Association of Cardiovascular Nursing and Allied Professions. In total, 27 QIs were selected across 8 domains of TAVI care, comprising 22 main (81%) and 5 secondary (19%) QIs. Of these, 19/27 (70%) are now being utilized in the EuroHeart TAVI registry. We present the 2023 ESC QIs for TAVI, developed using a standard methodology and in collaboration with ESC Associations.

32978090,"Reperfusion therapies in pulmonary embolism-state of the art and expert opinion: A position paper from the ""Unité de Soins Intensifs de Cardiologie"" group of the French Society of Cardiology.","Acute pulmonary embolism is a frequent cardiovascular emergency with an increasing incidence. The prognosis of patients with high-risk and intermediate-high-risk pulmonary embolism has not improved over the last decade. The current treatment strategies are mainly based on anticoagulation to prevent recurrence and reduce pulmonary vasculature obstruction. However, the slow rate of thrombus lysis under anticoagulation is unable to acutely decrease right ventricle overload and pulmonary vasculature resistance in patients with severe obstruction and right ventricle dysfunction. Therefore, patients with high-risk and intermediate-high-risk pulmonary embolism remain a therapeutic challenge. Reperfusion therapies may be discussed for these patients, and include systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed therapies and surgical thrombectomy. High-risk patients require systemic thrombolysis, but may have contraindications as a result of the high risk of bleeding. In addition, intermediate-high-risk patients should not receive systemic thrombolysis, despite its high efficacy, because of prohibitive bleeding complications. Recently, percutaneous reperfusion techniques have been developed to acutely decrease pulmonary vascular obstruction with lower-dose or no thrombolytic agents and, thus, potentially higher safety than systemic thrombolysis. Some of these techniques improve key haemodynamic variables. Cardiac surgical techniques and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as temporary circulatory support may be useful in selected cases. The development of pulmonary embolism centres with multidisciplinary pulmonary embolism teams is mandatory to enable adequate use of reperfusion and improve outcomes. We aim to present the state of the art regarding reperfusion therapies in pulmonary embolism, but also to provide guidance on their indications and patient selection.",Archives of cardiovascular diseases,2020-Nov,"Delmas C, Aissaoui N, Meneveau N, Bouvaist H, Rousseau H, Puymirat E, Sapoval M, Flecher E, Meyer G, Sanchez O, Del Giudice C, Roubille F, Bonello L",13,1892,cardiology,2025-11-22

The prevalence and outcome of patients using these drugs at the time of admission to an intensive cardiac care unit is unknown. To assess the prevalence of psychoactive drugs detected in consecutive patients hospitalized in an intensive cardiac care unit for an acute cardiovascular event. This is a nationwide prospective multicentre study, involving 39 centres throughout France, including all consecutive patients hospitalized in an intensive cardiac care unit within 2weeks. Psychoactive drug use will be assessed systematically by urine drug assay within 2hours of intensive cardiac care unit admission, to detect illicit (cannabinoids, cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy, heroin and other opioids) and non-illicit (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, methadone and buprenorphine) psychoactive drugs. Smoking will be investigated systematically by exhaled carbon monoxide measurement, and alcohol consumption using a standardized questionnaire. In-hospital major adverse events, including death, resuscitated cardiac arrest and cardiogenic shock, will be recorded. After discharge, all-cause death and major adverse cardiovascular events will be recorded systematically and adjudicated at 12months of follow-up. The primary outcome will be the prevalence of psychoactive drugs detected by systematic screening among all patients hospitalized in an intensive cardiac care unit. The in-hospital major adverse events will be analysed according to the presence or absence of detected psychoactive drugs.

We explore the definition, physiological characteristics, prevalence, and guidelines of SB, contrasting it with physical activity (PA). The discussion encompasses: (1) the association between SB and mortality, with a specific focus on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes; (2) biological mechanisms that link SB to CV health, additionally differentiating between the effects of acute and chronic sitting; (3) sex and gender differences in SB; and (4) SB as an independent CV risk factor is explored. The review concludes with an examination of the potential beneficial effects of PA on mitigating the detrimental effects of SB and an analysis of evidence that supports the use of break-up strategies in preventive cardiology. This analysis sheds light on the significant deleterious consequences of SB on CV health. It highlights the potential of incorporating strategies to reduce and interrupt prolonged sitting alongside existing guidelines that promote PA. These findings suggest considering SB as a major CV risk factor, and emphasize the importance of targeting SB reduction and interruption as a valuable approach for preventing and managing CV disease. However, further research is needed to determine the long-term effectiveness of SB interventions, to inform the development of optimal guidelines for CV health management.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-Mar,"Riopel-Meunier J, Poirier P, Després JP, Piché ME",4,1464,cardiology,2025-11-22

The CICD-LT registry is investigating short- and long-term outcomes and management in patients in European Society of Cardiology (ESC) member countries, in a longitudinal ESC EURObservational Research Programme aimed at improving CCS management. Between 1 May 2015 and 31 July 2018, 9174 patients with previous ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI or coronary revascularisation, or other CCS, were recruited during a routine ambulatory visit or elective revascularisation procedure. Baseline clinical data were recorded and prescribed medications analysed at initial contact and discharge, and according to patient gender and age (<75 vs. ≥75 years). Poorly controlled cardiovascular risk factors, including current smoking (18.5%), obesity (33.9%), diabetes (25.8%), raised low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (73.3%) and persistent hypertension (24.7%), were common across all cohorts. At ambulatory visit or admission, the guidelines-recommended combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, beta-blocker, aspirin, statin and any antiplatelet agent was prescribed to 57.8% of patients with STEMI/NSTEMI. Differences in prescribing rates, including for combination therapies, were observed based on age and gender and persisted after adjustment for demographic factors. Cardiovascular risk factors were common in contemporary CCS patients and secondary prevention prescribing was suboptimal. Patients aged ≥75 years and, to some extent, female patients were less likely to receive guidelines-recommended drug combinations than younger and male patients. One- and two-year follow-up will study prescribing changes and associations between baseline characteristics/prescribing and subsequent clinical outcomes.",European journal of preventive cardiology,2021-May,"Komajda M, Cosentino F, Ferrari R, Kerneis M, Kosmachova E, Laroche C, Maggioni AP, Rittger H, Steg PG, Szwed H, Tavazzi L, Valgimigli M, Gale CP",13,1911,cardiology,2025-11-22

39465318,Experimental assessment of the performance of artificial intelligence in solving multiple-choice board exams in cardiology.,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the performance of various artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots (commercially available in Switzerland up to June 2023) in solving a theoretical cardiology board exam and to compare their accuracy with that of human cardiology fellows. For the study, a set of 88 multiple-choice cardiology exam questions was used. The participating cardiology fellows and selected chatbots were presented with these questions. The evaluation metrics included Top-1 and Top-2 accuracy, assessing the ability of chatbots and fellows to select the correct answer. Among the cardiology fellows, all 36 participants successfully passed the exam with a median accuracy of 98% (IQR 91-99%, range from 78% to 100%). However, the performance of the chatbots varied. Only one chatbot, Jasper quality, achieved the minimum pass rate of 73% correct answers. Most chatbots demonstrated a median Top-1 accuracy of 47% (IQR 44-53%, range from 42% to 73%), while Top-2 accuracy provided a modest improvement, resulting in a median accuracy of 67% (IQR 65-72%, range from 61% to 82%). Even with this advantage, only two chatbots, Jasper quality and ChatGPT plus 4.0, would have passed the exam. Similar results were observed when picture-based questions were excluded from the dataset. Overall, the study suggests that most current language-based chatbots have limitations in accurately solving theoretical medical board exams. In general, currently widely available chatbots fell short of achieving a passing score in a theoretical cardiology board exam. Nevertheless, a few showed promising results. Further improvements in artificial intelligence language models may lead to better performance in medical knowledge applications in the future.",Swiss medical weekly,2024-Oct,"Huwiler J, Oechslin L, Biaggi P, Tanner FC, Wyss CA",5,1766,cardiology,2025-11-22

We aimed to report the experience of a teaching hospital, and discuss our practice in the context of recently published guidelines. We identified all consecutive CIED recipients (12,736 patients) who underwent RT between March 2006 and June 2017. Among them, 90 (1%) patients (78.2 ± 10 years, 73% male) had a CIED: 82 pacemakers and 8 implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. Two patients required CIED extraction prior to RT for ipsilateral breast cancer (no device replacement in 1 patient). Four patients (5%) were considered at high-risk, 35 (39%) at intermediate-risk, and the remaining 50 (56%) at low-risk for CIED dysfunction. Overall, only a minority of patients followed recommended local protocol during RT delivery (31%) and during follow-up (56%). CIED malfunction was detected in 5 patients (6%), mainly back-up mode resetting (80%), with 4 (including 3 pelvic cancer location) patients initially classified as being at intermediate-risk and 1 at low-risk. Four out of the 5 patients with CEID malfunction had received neutron producing beams. In conclusion, our findings underline the lack of rigorous monitoring of patients undergoing RT (though CIED malfunction appears to be rare and relatively benign in nature), and emphasize the interest of considering neutron producing beam for risk stratification as recommended in recent guidelines.

Older patients have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular (CV) disease, high rates of CV risk factors, and multiple age-related comorbidities. Although prevention and management strategies have been shown to be effective in older people, they continue to be under-used, and under-studied. In addition to hard endpoints, frailty, cognitive impairments, and patients' re-assessment of important outcomes (e.g. quality of life vs. longevity) are important aspects for older patients and emphasize the need to include a substantial proportion of older patients in CV clinical trials. To complement the often skewed age distribution in clinical trials, greater emphasis should be placed on real-world studies to assess longer-term outcomes, especially safety and quality of life outcomes. In the complex environment of the older patient, a multidisciplinary care team approach with the involvement of the individual patient in the decision-making process can help optimize prevention and management strategies.

In this prospective study, we applied the European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm and the HEART score in 1355 consecutive patients who presented to the emergency department with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation. Patients were followed for non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions and major adverse cardiac events at 30 days: death, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, or unplanned coronary revascularization. The European Society of Cardiology 0/1-hour algorithm classified 921 (68.0%) patients as ""rule-out"" and the HEART score classified 686 (50.6%) patients as ""low-risk"".

Haiti represents a resource-constrained setting, limited by a paucity of resources and trained cardiovascular professionals equipped to address the increasing burden of CVD. Here, we describe the creation of a comprehensive cardiology curriculum delivered through a virtual classroom. The curriculum was created to augment cardiovascular education in LMICs such as Haiti. Over one academic year (May 2019-2020), International Cardiology Curriculum Accessible by Remote Distance Learning-Haiti consisted of biweekly, live-streamed, synchronous didactic lectures, seminars and case presentations broadcasted to 16 internal medicine (IM) residents at Hôpital Universitaire de Mirebalais, one of only four IM training programmes in Haiti. The virtual classroom was created using commercially available videoconferencing and data-sharing platforms. Prelecture and postlecture surveys and an end of the year survey were administered to assess the impact of the curriculum. Participant performance analysis revealed that 80% of the curriculum demonstrated a positive trend in knowledge acquisition postintervention. Based on the end of the year evaluation, 94% of participants reported that the curriculum was educational and relevant to medical practice in Haiti and 100% reported that the curriculum was good to excellent. Additionally, the curriculum was cited as an effective means of maintaining trainee education during the COVID-19 pandemic.

35523670,"Temporal trends in characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of heart failure in octogenarians over two decades.","Octogenarians represent the most rapidly expanding population segment in Europe. The prevalence of heart failure (HF) in this group exceeds 10%. We assessed changes in clinical characteristics, therapy, and 1-year outcomes over 2 decades in chronic HF outpatients aged ≥ 80 years enrolled in a nationwide cardiology registry. We included 2520 octogenarians with baseline echocardiographic ejection fraction measurements and available 1-year follow-up, who were recruited at 138 HF outpatient clinics (21% of national hospitals with cardiology units), across 3 enrolment periods (1999-2005, 2006-2011, 2012-2018). At recruitment, over the 3 study periods, there was an increase in age, body mass index, ejection fraction, the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, pre-existing hypertension, and atrial fibrillation history. The proportion of patients with preserved ejection fraction rose from 19.4% to 32.7% (P for trend <.0001). Markers of advanced disease became less prevalent. Prescription of beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists increased over time. During the 1-year follow-up, 308 patients died (12.2%) and 360 (14.3%) were admitted for cardiovascular causes; overall, 591 (23.5%) met the combined primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization.

33622616,Towards OPtimising Care of Regionally-Based Cardiac Patients With a Telehealth Cardiology Pharmacist Clinic (TOPCare Cardiology).,"Cardiovascular disease is a major burden on the health of Australians, and cardiac health disparities exist for those who live outside of metropolitan areas. Poor patient medication literacy was identified by cardiologists at a regional Victorian health service as a barrier to medication optimisation and a factor in inefficiency in their service. Studies in Australia and overseas have shown pharmacists involved in multi-disciplinary and pre-admission models result in more accurate medication histories, increased patient medication knowledge and lower medication related adverse events. This study introduced a telehealth cardiology pharmacist clinic, with the primary aim of reducing cardiologist time gathering medication information and secondary aims of investigating the patient and cardiologist experience. A cardiology pharmacist clinic was introduced where a pharmacist undertook a consultation with a patient in the days preceding their appointment with their cardiologist. The primary outcome of this study was to determine whether a cardiology pharmacist consultation undertaken prior to a cardiologist consultation reduces the time spent by the cardiologist gathering medication information. This was measured via direct observation of cardiologist consultations with and without a prior cardiology pharmacist clinic consultation. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed to assess differences in time spent gathering the patient's medication information by the cardiologist. The secondary outcomes included differences between: the total length of cardiologist consultations, the number of cardiologist appointments with a medication uncertainty, and attendance rates for cardiologist consultations with and without a prior cardiology pharmacist clinic consultation. Other secondary outcomes included a quantitative survey assessing patient satisfaction with the pharmacist consultation, satisfaction with telehealth, confidence in medication management. Finally, clinician perceptions of the value of the pharmacist consultation were explored via semi-structured interviews. The time spent gathering medication information immediately before, and during, the cardiologist appointment reduced from 4.66 minutes without a prior cardiology pharmacist clinic consultation to 0.66 minutes with a prior cardiology pharmacist clinic consultation (difference 4 min, 95% CI: 3.27-4.77 p≤001). There was a 4.1-minute reduction in the mean consultation length of the cardiologist appointment if a cardiology pharmacist clinic consultation occurred prior (95% CI: 1.9-6.3, p<0.001). There were zero medication uncertainties (0/44) in the cardiologist appointment when the patient had a cardiology pharmacist clinic consultation compared to 51% (22/43) when no cardiology pharmacist clinic consultation had occurred. Patients with a cardiology pharmacist clinic consultation had a 5% (17/340) 'did not attend' (DNA) rate for their next cardiologist appointment. Patients who did not have a cardiology pharmacist clinic consultation had a 24% (202/855) DNA rate to their next cardiologist appointment. There was 100% patient satisfaction with the consultation provided by the cardiology pharmacist (100/100) and telehealth was considered an acceptable mode of delivery by 99% (95/96) of patients. Patients expressed an increase in their confidence to discuss their medications with their cardiologist (84% [81/96]). Benefits described by the clinicians whose patients received the service were greater confidence and ability to make treatment decisions within consultations, as well as improved patient health literacy. A cardiology pharmacist consultation undertaken prior to a cardiologist consultation reduced the time spent by the cardiologist gathering medication information. Importantly, it reduced medication uncertainty in cardiologist consultations which clinicians indicated provided them with greater confidence and ability to make treatment decisions within consultations. Patients who undertook a cardiology pharmacist clinic consultation were more likely to attend their cardiologist consultation, reducing wasted appointments. Patients were highly satisfied with the cardiology pharmacist consultation and considered telehealth an acceptable mode of delivery.","Heart, lung & circulation",2021-Jul,"Livori AC, Bishop JL, Ping SE, Oqueli E, Aldrich R, Fitzpatrick AM, Kong DCM",7,4293,cardiology,2025-11-22

A survey was sent via email to all (N = 63) pediatric cardiology training program directors in the United States to evaluate the perceived exercise training needs of pediatric cardiology fellows. The survey consisted of multiple-choice responses as well as a few open-ended responses. A 60% response rate was achieved. 74% of programs did not have a pre-existing exercise core program. This type of training was felt to be important or very important in 84%. A wide variability of time allotted for exercise training exists amongst programs from < 1 week to > 4 weeks, with 2 weeks being most common. There was no consensus on a target number of total exercise tests nor types of tests in which fellows should participate. Preferred methods in training consisted of lectures and online media. Less preferred methods of teaching methods included dedicated reading of a handbook, a dedicated rotation, or live webinars. There was general support to develop exercise training competencies as well as the associated online learning materials with a focus on competency rather than target numbers.

35381063,"ESC/EAS guidelines for the detection, prevention, and treatment of individuals at risk of a first myocardial infarction: effect of 5 years of updates and the new SCORE2.","The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has released three consecutive guidelines within 5 years addressing cardiovascular prevention, risk scores, and cholesterol treatment. This study aims to evaluate whether the 2021 ESC guidelines improved the eligibility of individuals for primary prevention statin therapy before their first ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and for intensive lipid-lowering treatments in secondary prevention. The cardiovascular risk category of 2757 consecutive individuals admitted for a first STEMI was evaluated to assess whether they would have been eligible for primary prevention statins according to 2021 vs. 2019 and 2016 ESC guidelines. Eligibility for intensive lipid-lowering therapy in secondary prevention was assessed according to the real-life follow-up low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and the expected follow-up LDL-C. More individuals would have been eligible for primary prevention statins according to 2021 and 2019 vs. 2016 guidelines (61.8% vs. 38.7% vs. 23.6%, P &lt; 0.01), a finding observed in both men (62.3% vs. 35.0% vs. 24.9%, P &lt; 0.01) and women (60.2% vs. 50.7% vs. 19.3%, P = 0.18). Only 27% of individuals reached the LDL-C objective of 55 mg/L in secondary prevention: using the ESC stepwise approach, 61.7% were eligible for higher doses of statins, 26.2% for ezetimibe, and 12.1% for a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor (PCSK9i). Based on expected LDL-C reductions, eligibility for a PCSK9i in secondary prevention was greater with 2021 vs. 2016 guidelines (44.5% vs. 22.5%, P &lt; 0.01). The 2021 ESC guidelines improved the detection and treatment of individuals at risk for a first myocardial infarction.

39622018,Instituto y no hospital. La distintiva organización que Ignacio Chávez concibió para combatir integralmente a las enfermedades del corazón en México. En el octogésimo aniversario del Instituto Nacional de Cardiología.,"In 1936, Ignacio Chávez submitted a proposal to the Mexican government for the creation of a cardiology institute. He had studied in Paris, Berlin, and other European cities in 1926. Upon his return to Mexico, he founded the Cardiology Service at the General Hospital in Mexico City, the first of its kind in the country. The National Institute of Cardiology of Mexico was inaugurated on April 18, 1944, becoming one of the first cardiology institutes in the world. Chávez explained the purpose of this new institute: ""We were born with the purpose of studying, researching, and controlling heart diseases."" According to him, the institute should be a place where cardiovascular diseases could be addressed comprehensively, combining clinical practice with research and teaching to provide effective knowledge for patient care and scientific advancement. ""A health center is for the patient, of course; but something more than that is necessary: a great school for doctors, a great laboratory for researchers, and a social instrument of human help,"" he said. This vision was summarized in the words: love and science at the service of the heart. Chávez successfully institutionalized cardiology in Mexico. From its inception, the institute became an internationally recognized center, attracting students from various countries. Alfredo de Micheli noted that under Chávez's influence and example, new institutions emerged in the national medical field and expanded onto the international stage. The institute founded by Chávez became a model for similar institutions on other continents and a driving force in the international cardiology movement.

36938629,The Congenital Cardiology Cloud: Proof of feasibility of Germany's first tele-medical network for pediatric cardiology.,"For an optimal interplay based on the data-secure exchange of diagnostic data between patients, ambulatory care, and hospital care, we implemented the first tele-medical network for pediatric cardiology in Germany, the Congenital Cardiology Cloud. This study focuses on its feasibility, technical characteristics, and implementation in routine clinical work. Tele-medical traffic comprised numbers of incoming/outgoing data, related file types, treatment options for tele-medically processed patients, and patient classification with respect to the severity of disease. Proof of feasibility was related to the number of successful tele-medical transmissions of discharge documents at the end of the observation period (02/2020-10/2020). Analysis of Congenital Cardiology Cloud's data communication showed a number of 1178 files for a total of 349 patients, favoring transmissions towards the clinic. Incoming traffic was predominantly characterized by diagnostic data regarding tele-consultations (76.6%), consisting of a multitude of file types, whereas 93.4% of the dispatched data corresponded to discharge letters. The number of tele-consultations counted up to 61, with a necessary subsequent treatment or diagnostic procedure in 90.2% of the presented cases. Tele-medically processed patients generally showed to be more complex (severe chronic heart disease 42.4% vs. 23.7%). At the end of the observation period, 97.6% of the discharge documents were transmitted via telemedicine. The implementation of the first tele-medical network for pediatric cardiology in Germany proves recent technological developments to successfully enable innovative patient care, connecting the ambulatory and hospital sector for a joint patient advice, predominantly in more complex cases. Possible governmentally guided refinancing concepts will show its long-term feasibility.",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,2024-Dec,"Klais M, Doll U, Purbojo A, Dittrich S, Rottermann K",5,1866,cardiology,2025-11-22
36449742,The Impact of Bedside Cardiac Point-of-Care Ultrasound on the Utilization of Cardiology Subspecialty Resources in a Pediatric Emergency Department.,"This study sought to determine the impact of cardiac point-of-care ultrasound (cPOCUS) in a pediatric emergency department (ED) on cardiology subspecialty utilization for subjects with chest pain or syncope. Diagnostic yield of cPOCUS and transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) for these subjects was also examined. A retrospective chart review of subjects presenting to a tertiary pediatric ED with chest pain or syncope 1 year before (2015, pre-cPOCUS group) and 1 year after (2017, cPOCUS group) introduction of cPOCUS was conducted. Subjects aged 2 to 18 years evaluated for these symptoms were included. Those with known heart defects, prior abnormal TTE, or asthma exacerbation at presentation were excluded. In both groups, cardiology subspecialty utilization was assessed by determining whether cardiology referrals, cardiology consultations, or follow-up TTEs were completed. Results of TTEs were reviewed and classified as incidental (no follow-up needed), minor (follow-up needed, but intervention unlikely), moderate (nonurgent intervention needed), and severe (hospitalization/urgent intervention needed). Cardiac point-of-care ultrasound results were compared with any follow-up TTEs. Data were analyzed using χ 2 or Student t test as appropriate. A total of 1230 subjects were analyzed: 595 pre-cPOCUS and 635 cPOCUS group. There was no significant difference in TTEs (42 vs 46), cardiology consultations (36 vs 37), or cardiology referrals (47 vs 37) between groups. Of 67 cPOCUS scans performed, 63 were normal, 3 showed small pericardial effusion, and 2 demonstrated left ventricular dysfunction. Of 88 TTEs in both groups (0.7% subjects), 76 were normal, 5 had incidental, 6 had minor, and 1 had a severe finding present on cPOCUS (0.08% subjects; 95% confidence interval, 0%-0.45%). The introduction of cPOCUS did not increase cardiology subspecialty utilization in subjects presenting to the pediatric ED with chest pain or syncope. Cardiac point-of-care ultrasound may be useful in evaluating global biventricular systolic function and effusion in this population.",Pediatric emergency care,2022-Dec,"Singh A, Starr-Seal RL, Caperell KS, Warkentine FH, Neal AE",5,2084,cardiology,2025-11-22
38366821,Device innovation in cardiovascular medicine: a report from the European Society of Cardiology Cardiovascular Round Table.,"Research performed in Europe has driven cardiovascular device innovation. This includes, but is not limited to, percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiac imaging, transcatheter heart valve implantation, and device therapy of cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. An important part of future medical progress involves the evolution of medical technology and the ongoing development of artificial intelligence and machine learning. There is a need to foster an environment conducive to medical technology development and validation so that Europe can continue to play a major role in device innovation while providing high standards of safety. This paper summarizes viewpoints on the topic of device innovation in cardiovascular medicine at the European Society of Cardiology Cardiovascular Round Table, a strategic forum for high-level dialogue to discuss issues related to the future of cardiovascular health in Europe. Devices are developed and improved through an iterative process throughout their lifecycle. Early feasibility studies demonstrate proof of concept and help to optimize the design of a device. If successful, this should ideally be followed by randomized clinical trials comparing novel devices vs. accepted standards of care when available and the collection of post-market real-world evidence through registries. Unfortunately, standardized procedures for feasibility studies across various device categories have not yet been implemented in Europe. Cardiovascular imaging can be used to diagnose and characterize patients for interventions to improve procedural results and to monitor devices long term after implantation. Randomized clinical trials often use cardiac imaging-based inclusion criteria, while less frequently trials randomize patients to compare the diagnostic or prognostic value of different modalities. Applications using machine learning are increasingly important, but specific regulatory standards and pathways remain in development in both Europe and the USA. Standards are also needed for smart devices and digital technologies that support device-driven biomonitoring. Changes in device regulation introduced by the European Union aim to improve clinical evidence, transparency, and safety, but they may impact the speed of innovation, access, and availability. Device development programmes including dialogue on unmet needs and advice on study designs must be driven by a community of physicians, trialists, patients, regulators, payers, and industry to ensure that patients have access to innovative care.",European heart journal,2024-Apr,"Windecker S, Gilard M, Achenbach S, Cribier A, Delgado V, Deych N, Drossart I, Eltchaninoff H, Fraser AG, Goncalves A, Hindricks G, Holborow R, Kappetein AP, Kilmartin J, Kurucova J, Lüscher TF, Mehran R, O'Connor DB, Perkins M, Samset E, von Bardeleben RS, Weidinger F",22,2556,cardiology,2025-11-22
31787326,Reprint of : Transcatheter closure of patent foramen ovale to prevent stroke recurrence in patients with otherwise unexplained ischaemic stroke: Expert consensus of the French Neurovascular Society and the French Society of Cardiology.,"Unlike previous randomized clinical trials (RCTs), recent trials and meta-analyses have shown that transcatheter closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) reduces stroke recurrence risk in young and middle-aged adults with an otherwise unexplained PFO-associated ischaemic stroke. To produce an expert consensus on the role of transcatheter PFO closure and antithrombotic drugs for secondary stroke prevention in patients with PFO-associated ischaemic stroke. Five neurologists and five cardiologists with extensive experience in the relevant field were nominated by the French Neurovascular Society and the French Society of Cardiology to make recommendations based on evidence from RCTs and meta-analyses. The experts recommend that any decision concerning treatment of patients with PFO-associated ischaemic stroke should be taken after neurological and cardiological evaluation, bringing together the necessary neurovascular, echocardiography and interventional cardiology expertise. Transcatheter PFO closure is recommended in patients fulfilling all the following criteria: age 16-60 years; recent (≤6 months) ischaemic stroke; PFO associated with atrial septal aneurysm (>10mm) or with a right-to-left shunt>20 microbubbles or with a diameter≥2mm; PFO felt to be the most likely cause of stroke after thorough aetiological evaluation by a stroke specialist. Long-term oral anticoagulation may be considered in the event of contraindication to or patient refusal of PFO closure, in the absence of a high bleeding risk. After PFO closure, dual anti-platelet therapy with aspirin (75mg/day) and clopidogrel (75mg/day) is recommended for 3 months, followed by monotherapy with aspirin or clopidogrel for≥5 years. Although a big step forward that will benefit many patients has been taken with recent trials, many questions remain unanswered. Pending results from further studies, decision-making regarding management of patients with PFO-associated ischaemic stroke should be based on a close coordination between neurologists/stroke specialists and cardiologists.",Revue neurologique,2020-,"Mas JL, Derex L, Guérin P, Guillon B, Habib G, Juliard JM, Marijon E, Massardier E, Meneveau N, Vuillier F",10,2063,cardiology,2025-11-22

33992489,The Need for Telemedicine Integration Into Adult Cardiology Training Curricula in Canada.,"COVID-19 brought telemedicine to the forefront of clinical cardiology. We aimed to examine the extent of trainees' involvement in and comfort with telemedicine practices in Canada with the use of a web-based self-administered survey. Eighty-six trainees from 12 training programs completed the survey (65% response rate). Results showed that before COVID-19, 39 trainees (45%) had telemedicine exposure, compared with 67 (78%) after COVID-19 (P < 0.001). However, only 44 trainees (51%) reported being comfortable or very comfortable with the use of telemedicine. Of the 67 trainees who were involved in telemedicine, 4 (6%) had full supervision during virtual visits, 13 (19%) had partial supervision, and 50 (75%) had minimal or no supervision. Importantly, 67 trainees (78%) expressed the need for telemedicine-specific training and 64 (74%) were willing to have their virtual visits recorded for the purpose of evaluation and feedback. Furthermore, 47 (55%) felt strongly or very strongly positive about incorporating telemedicine into their future practice. The main perceived barriers to telemedicine use were concerns about patients' engagement, fear of weakening the patient-physician relationship, and unfamiliarity with telemedicine technology. These barriers, together with training in virtual physical examination skills and medicolegal aspects of telemedicine, are addressed in several established internal medicine telemedicine curricula that could be adapted by cardiology programs. In conclusion, while the degree of telemedicine involvement since COVID-19 was high, the trainees' comfort level with telemedicine practice remains suboptimal likely due to lack of training and inadequate staff supervision. Therefore, a cardiology telemedicine curriculum is needed to ensure that trainees are equipped to embrace telemedicine in cardiovascular clinical care.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2021-Jun,"Almufleh A, Lee C, Tsang MY, Gin K, Tsang TSM, Nair P",6,1873,cardiology,2025-11-22

The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment. The transmission of the disease poses a risk to both patients and healthcare workers. The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions. This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe. Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge. Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described. In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries.

Rapid implementation of video consultations in outpatient clinics for patients with heart disease can be challenging. We employed a design thinking tool called a customer journey to explore challenges and opportunities when using video communication software in the cardiology department of a regional hospital. Interviews were conducted with 5 patients with implanted devices, a nurse, an information technology manager and two cardiologists. Three lessons were identified based on these challenges and opportunities. Attention should be given to the ease of use of the technology, the meeting features, and the establishment of the connection between the cardiologist and the patient.

We quantified the input-output characteristics, and determined the modulation transfer function (MTF) and normalized noise power spectrum (NNPS) of the equipment used in cardiology at 7.5, 10, 15, and 30 frames per second (fps). We also calculated the noise power spectrum for still images and videos at all frame rates and obtained the image lag correction factor r. The input-output characteristics and the MTF agreed even when the frame rate was varied. The NNPS tended to decrease uniformly as a function of frequency at increasing frame rates. The factor r decreased as a function of the frame rate, and its minimum value was 30 fps. Our results suggest that high-frame-rate imaging in cardiology using indirect conversion dynamic FPDs is affected by image lag.",Radiological physics and technology,2024-Dec,"Hasegawa A, Kondo Y",2,903,cardiology,2025-11-22

This study assesses four LLMs-GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4omni (GPT-4o) (Open AI), and Gemini (Google Inc.)-in responding to questions from the 2023 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology Board Preparation Exam, reflecting the scope of the Certification Board of Nuclear Cardiology (CBNC) examination. We used 168 questions: 141 text-only and 27 image-based, categorized into four sections mirroring the CBNC exam. Each LLM was presented with the same standardized prompt and applied to each section 30 times to account for stochasticity. Performance over six weeks was assessed for all models except GPT-4o. McNemar's test compared correct response proportions. GPT-4, Gemini, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o correctly answered median percentages of 56.8% (95% confidence interval 55.4% - 58.0%), 40.5% (39.9% - 42.9%), 60.7% (59.5% - 61.3%), and 63.1% (62.5%-64.3%) of questions, respectively.

To provide comprehensive contemporary information on the access and use of cardiac arrhythmia services in Africa. Data on human resources, drug availability, cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED), and ablation procedures were sought from member countries of Pan African Society of Cardiology. Data were received from 23 out of 31 countries. In most countries, healthcare services are primarily supported by household incomes. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), digoxin, and amiodarone were available in all countries, while the availability of other drugs varied widely. Non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were unequally present in the African markets, while International Normalized Ratio monitoring was challenging. Four countries (18%) did not provide pacemaker implantations while, where available, the implantation and operator rates were 2.79 and 0.772 per million population, respectively. The countries with the highest pacemaker implantation rate/million population in descending order were Tunisia, Mauritius, South Africa, Algeria, and Morocco. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) were performed in 15 (65%) and 12 (52%) countries, respectively. Reconditioned CIED were used in 5 (22%) countries. Electrophysiology was performed in 8 (35%) countries, but complex ablations only in countries from the Maghreb and South Africa. Marked variation in costs of CIED that severely mismatched the gross domestic product per capita was observed in Africa. From the first report, three countries have started performing simple ablations. The access to arrhythmia treatments varied widely in Africa where hundreds of millions of people remain at risk of dying from heart block. Increased economic and human resources as well as infrastructures are the critical targets for improving arrhythmia services in Africa.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",2020-Mar,"Bonny A, Ngantcha M, Yuyun MF, Karaye KM, Scholtz W, Suliman A, Nel G, Aoudia Y, Kane A, Moustaghfi A, Okello E, Houenassi M, Sonou A, Niakara A, Lubenga YR, Adoubi A, Russel J, Damasceno A, Touré AI, Kane A, Tabane A, Jeilan M, Mbaye A, Tibazarwa K, Ben Ameur Y, Diakité M, Subahi S, Kaviraj B, Sani MU, Ajijola OA, Chin A, Sliwa K",32,1939,cardiology,2025-11-22

Cases of patients treated for IE between January 2017 and October 2022 were adjudicated as certain IE or not. Each case was also categorized as either definite or possible/rejected within each classification. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were estimated with 95% confidence intervals. Of the 1194 patients analyzed (mean age, 66.1 years; 71.2% males), 414 (34.7%) had a prosthetic valve and 284 (23.8%) had a cardiac implanted electronic device (CIED); 946 (79.2%) were adjudicated as certain IE; 978 (81.9%), 997 (83.5%), and 1057 (88.5%) were classified as definite IE in the 2000 modified Duke, 2015 ESC, and 2023 Duke-ISCVID criteria, respectively.

38198766,Cardiovascular multimodality imaging in women: a scientific statement of the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging of the European Society of Cardiology.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) represent an important cause of mortality and morbidity in women. It is now recognized that there are sex differences regarding the prevalence and the clinical significance of the traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors as well as the pathology underlying a range of CVDs. Unfortunately, women have been under-represented in most CVD imaging studies and trials regarding diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics. There is therefore a clear need for further investigation of how CVD affects women along their life span. Multimodality CV imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis of CVD in women as well as in prognosis, decision-making, and monitoring of therapeutics and interventions. However, multimodality imaging in women requires specific consideration given the differences in CVD between the sexes. These differences relate to physiological changes that only women experience (e.g. pregnancy and menopause) as well as variation in the underlying pathophysiology of CVD and also differences in the prevalence of certain conditions such as connective tissue disorders, Takotsubo, and spontaneous coronary artery dissection, which are all more common in women.

39252033,How to improve medical students' ECG interpretation skills ? Multicenter survey and results of a comparative study evaluating a new educational approach.,"Learning to interpret electrocardiograms (ECGs) is a crucial objective in medical education. Despite its importance, errors in ECGs interpretation are common, and the optimal teaching methods have not yet been clearly established. To evaluate students' confidence in ECGs analysis and their opinion on current teaching methods, and to assess the effectiveness of a new ECG educational approach. First, we conducted a survey on ECG learning among fourth to sixth-year medical students. Second, a 5-week multicenter comparative study was conducted with fourth-year medical students during their cardiology internship. Two different teaching methods were used, assigned by center. The first group participated in 5-minutes workshops 4 times a week using a ""reversed classroom"" method, supervised by a cardiologist, where students took turns selecting, presenting and discussing ECGs. The control group attended a single 2-hour face-to-face ECG course. All participants completed a 30-minute ECGs analysis test at baseline and after 5 weeks. Out of 401 survey respondents, the confidence levels in ECG interpretation were 3/5 (IQR 2-3) for routine situations and 2/5 (IQR 1-3) for emergency situations. Satisfaction with ECG teaching was low (2/5, IQR 1-3) and 96.3% of respondents favored more extensive ECG training. In the comparative study, 52 students from 3 medical schools were enrolled (control group: n = 27; workshop group: n = 25). Both groups showed significant improvement in exam scores from baseline to 5-week (33/100 ± 12/100 to 44/100 ± 12/100, p < 0.0001 for the control group and 36/100 ± 13/100 to 62/100 ± 12/100, p < 0.0001 for the workshop group). The improvement was significantly greater in the workshop group compared to the control group (+ 26 ± 11 vs. + 11 ± 6, p < 0.001).

Propelled by recent advances in technology-catalyzed by COVID-19-and the requirement to adapt age-old methods of both teaching and health care delivery, many aspects, or 'domains', of learning have changed. These include the environments in which FITs work (outpatient clinics, 'on-call' inpatient service) and procedures in which they need clinical competency. Further advances in virtual reality are also changing the way FITs learn and interact. The proliferation of technology into the cardiology curriculum has led to some describing the need for FITs to develop into 'digital cardiologists', namely those who comfortably use digital tools to aid clinical practice, teaching, and training whilst, at the same time, retain the ability for human analysis and nuanced assessment so important to patient-centred training and clinical care.",Current problems in cardiology,2022-Dec,"Vandermolen S, Ricci F, Chahal CAA, Capelli C, Barakat K, Fedorowski A, Westwood M, Patel RS, Petersen SE, Gallina S, Pugliese F, Khanji MY",12,986,cardiology,2025-11-22

Questions assessed the availability of family planning counseling training within their training program, current practices of contraception and preconception counseling, and use of available tools for risk stratification of patients. Bivariate logistic regressions were utilized to predict demographic variables associated with survey responses, and associations between hours of training or perceived preparedness and clinical use of training. <b><i>Results:</i></b> There were 101 survey responses. Most participating fellows disagreed that their fellowship training had prepared them to counsel patients on contraception (69%) and preconception planning (62%). Sixty-one percent of participants do not routinely discuss contraception options and 55% do not routinely discuss preconception counseling with reproductive-age female patients at routine visits. Having more than 1 hour of training was predictive of more consistent counseling for both contraception and preconception counseling. Approximately 40% of participants routinely refer patients to an OB/Gyn for contraception or preconception counseling. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> This study highlights the need for increased training in contraceptive and preconception counseling within adult and pediatric cardiology fellowship programs.",Journal of women's health (2002),2020-Feb,"Brown AE, Bradbrook KE, Casey FE",3,1576,cardiology,2025-11-22
38565665,Twinning International Pediatric Cardiology Fellowship Programs: A Transformative Educational Experience for Trainees with Potential for Global Adoption.,"Over the last decade, having endured the COVID-19 pandemic, education and training in pediatric cardiology have undergone a profound disruptive transformation. Trainees experience considerable stress achieving all the competencies required to become a competent pediatric cardiologist. Often the quality of the training experienced by trainees, the approach to patients, and potential institutional preference in management strategy is heavily influenced by the center in which they train. We developed an online live twin program of education between Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, Texas and Children's Health at Crumlin Dublin Ireland in 2019. We explored using grounded theory whether a regular scheduled shared teaching program improved fellow education and training between both centers. Trainees were surveyed to evaluate the benefits and disadvantages of such a twin program. The majority (93%) found the sessions helpful from an educational standpoint with many trainees reporting it to be a transformative experience. Three important learning themes emerged: practice variation between centers, managing uncertainty in clinical practice and cognitive overload. This pedagogical model could be replicated across multiple international pediatric cardiology units and facilitate ""collaborative learning"" among centers across the globe.

While women have become the majority of students in medicine we do not know about female presence and scientific activity in cardiac surgery. We thus aimed to compare scientific output of women and men in German University departments of cardiac surgery with cardiology departments focusing on the same organ and surgical departments not addressing the heart (general surgery) of 34 universities in Germany.  Personnel working at University departments was identified on the institutions internet homepage in 2014. Publications in 2011 to 2013 on PubMed were identified. Author and manuscript characteristics were determined.  A lower proportion of women were working in cardiac surgery (25%) compared with cardiology (35%) and general (32%) surgery independent of executive function or academic degree. Scientifically active women published fewer manuscripts per capita than men both, in total and as first author. Additionally, the mean and the cumulated journal impact factor of the journals chosen was lower for women compared with men in cardiology but not in cardiac and general surgery.  We conclude that the differences in scientific activity between women and men are more pronounced in cardiology compared with general and cardiac surgery, indicating that a higher proportion of women in a field does not result in reduced differences between sexes.

Materials and Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. ESC and ACC/AHA guidelines published until May 2023 were systematically screened for recommendations related to cardiac MRI. The class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) for cardiac MRI recommendations were compared between the two guidelines and between newer versus older versions of each guideline using χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher exact tests. Results ESC guidelines included 109 recommendations regarding cardiac MRI, and ACC/AHA guidelines included 90 recommendations. The proportion of COR I and LOE B was higher in ACC/AHA versus ESC guidelines (60% [54 of 90] vs 46.8% [51 of 109]; <i>P</i> = .06 and 53% [48 of 90] vs 35.8% [39 of 109], respectively; <i>P</i> = .01). The increase in the number of cardiac MRI recommendations over time was significantly higher in ESC guidelines (from 63 to 109 for ESC vs from 65 to 90 for ACC/AHA; <i>P</i> = .03). The main areas of consensus were found in heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, while the main divergences were in valvular heart disease, arrhythmias, and aortic disease. Conclusion ESC guidelines included more recommendations related to cardiac MRI use, whereas the ACC/AHA recommendations had higher COR and LOE. The number of cardiac MRI recommendations increased significantly over time in both guidelines, indicating the increasing role of cardiac MRI evaluation and management of cardiovascular disease. <b>Keywords:</b> Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, Guideline, European Society of Cardiology, ESC, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, ACC/AHA <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> © RSNA, 2024.",Radiology.

32627666,A Systematic Review of Methods Used for Confounding Adjustment in Observational Economic Evaluations in Cardiology Conducted between 2013 and 2017.,"<b>Background.</b> Observational economic evaluations (i.e., economic evaluations in which treatment allocation is not randomized) are prone to confounding bias. Prior reviews published in 2013 have shown that adjusting for confounding is poorly done, if done at all. Although these reviews raised awareness on the issues, it is unclear if their results improved the methodological quality of future work. We therefore aimed to investigate whether and how confounding was accounted for in recently published observational economic evaluations in the field of cardiology. <b>Methods.</b> We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and PsycInfo databases using a set of Medical Subject Headings and keywords covering topics in ""observational economic evaluations in health within humans"" and ""cardiovascular diseases."" Any study published in either English or French between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2017, addressing our search criteria was eligible for inclusion in our review.

This study aims to determine the assessment and evaluation methods used in cardiology residency training in Türkiye and to reach the opinions of the institutions on the applicability of the workplace-based assessments. In this descriptive study, a Google Survey was sent to the heads/trainers of residency educational centers and their opinions about the currently used assessment and evaluation methods, applicability of cardiology competency exams, and the workplace-based assessments were asked. Responses were received from 65 (76.5%) of 85 training centers.

About 74% of responders gave a positive opinion on the requirement of being successful in the Turkish Cardiology Competency knowledge exam before specialty. Case-based discussion was the most common work-place-based assessments that the centers think could be applied as suggested by the current literature. A common idea was the adaptation of workplace-based assessments based on international standards and our national norms. The trainers supported a nationwide examination for all training centers to ensure standardization. In Türkiye, it was promising to see that the trainers are positive about the applicability of workplace-based assessments, but they commonly thought that the proposed workplace-based assessments should be adapted before nationwide applicability.

This expansion creates an ever-growing workload for clinicians, which has led to workflow and staffing issues that need to be addressed. The objective of this study was the development of a novel tool to measure the clinical workload of a paediatric cardiology service in Cape Town, South Africa: The patient encounter index is a tool designed to quantify clinical workload. It is defined as a ratio of the measured duration of clinical work to the total time available for such work. This index was implemented as part of a prospective cross-sectional study design. Clinical workload data were collected over a 10-day period using time-and-motion sampling. Clinicians were contractually expected to spend 50% of their daily workload on patient care. The median patient encounter index for the Western Cape Paediatric Cardiac Service was 0.81 (range 0.19-1.09), reflecting that 81% of total contractual working time was spent on clinical activities. This study describes the development and implementation of a novel tool for clinical workload quantification and describes its application to a busy paediatric cardiology service in Cape Town, South Africa. This tool prospectively quantifies clinical workload which may directly influence patient outcomes. Implementation of this novel tool in the described setting clearly demonstrated the excessive workload of the clinical service and facilitated effective motivation for improved allocation of resources.",Cardiology in the young,2020-Jan,"Harrison MJ, Barry OM, Hounsell RA, De Decker R",4,1582,cardiology,2025-11-22

Cerebral angiography, in contrast, is still performed almost exclusively in a hospital-based setting, despite sharing many features with other endovascular procedures commonly performed in outpatient centers. As interest grows in performing cerebral angiography in outpatient endovascular centers, much can be learned from the decades of experience that our interventional colleagues have in the outpatient setting. In this article we examine the outpatient experience of other interventional fields and apply key principles to evaluate the prospect of outpatient neurointervention. The literature suggests that cerebral angiography can feasibly be performed in an outpatient center in both private and academic settings, as some groups have begun to do. Outpatient endovascular centers have helped to improve the patient experience, liberate inpatient resources, and control costs in other interventional fields, and might offer neurointerventionalists an opportunity to do the same.",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,2024-Jul,"Silva MA, Peterson EC",2,1405,cardiology,2025-11-22
32469191,Nuclear cardiology: an overview of radioisotope techniques used in the diagnostic workup of cardiovascular disorders.,"Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death in patients over 60 years old. Pivotal imaging modalities in cardiac diagnostic workup are echocardiography, magnetic resonance, multi‑row detector computed tomography, coronary angiography, and radioisotope tests. In this study, we summarize the techniques of nuclear medicine (positron emission tomography, single‑photon emission computed tomography, radionuclide ventriculography) that could be implemented in the cardiovascular diagnostic algorithms. Despite being acknowledged in a few cardiology guidelines, these imaging methods are still underestimated by practitioners. Nevertheless, noninvasive diagnostic tools are of increasing potential and should be implemented whenever possible. We discuss the usefulness of particular techniques in the management of patients with obstructive and nonobstructive coronary artery disease, including assessment of myocardial perfusion, contractility, viability, and detection of unstable atherosclerotic plaques. Radioisotope imaging can also be valuable in the diagnostic workup of infective endocarditis, as well as cardiac sarcoidosis and amyloidosis. Apart from theoretical principles of nuclear cardiology, we also provide 3 case reports illustrating a practical implementation of these imaging modalities.",Kardiologia polska,2020-Jun,"Cegła P, Ciepłucha A, Pachowicz M, Chrapko B, Piotrowski T, Lesiak M",6,1317,cardiology,2025-11-22

This is a teachable skill through simulation-based communication. While studies have shown the use of communication courses in pediatrics, there have been none in pediatric cardiology. Pediatric cardiologists recognize the importance of good communication and desire further development of these skills. Based on an internal needs assessment, three cases were developed; fetal hypoplastic left heart syndrome, teenager with new hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and young-adult with Fontan failure. A 4-h simulation course using evidence-based methods to teach delivering serious news was designed, consisting of a didactic session, case demonstration and small group case-based encounters with simulated patients. Trainees completed standardized pre/post-course surveys to assess perception of skill and preparedness. Paired survey responses were compared. Six pediatric cardiology fellows participated. Only 33% had received formal training in delivering serious news and 17% in techniques of responding to patient's emotions. The proportion of participants who felt good about their ability to deliver serious news and deal with a family's emotions increased from 0 to 83%. The proportion of participants who felt prepared to provide serious news about a patient's illness increased from 17 to 67%. Given the small number of participants, results were not statistically significant. All participants felt that the course was valuable in improving communication skills. A formal communication course increased perception of skill and preparedness among trainees.

32173068,The New ESC Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Coronary Syndromes: the Good and the Not So Good.,"During the annual meeting in Paris, the European Society of Cardiology released the new guidelines for the diagnosis and management of chronic coronary syndromes that will replace the 2013 guidelines on stable coronary artery disease. We intend to provide a brief commentary on what, in our opinion, is good and what is not as good. Our careful analysis shows that the 2019 guidelines contain a number of positive innovations, including a new definition, a central role of non-invasive testing for myocardial ischaemia, the most contemporary prevalence of the disease, the fact that medical therapy remains paramount despite the important advances in revascularisation and many other good issues as well as some limitations. The section on medical therapy of chronic coronary syndromes patients shows some inconsistency between text and the suggested scheme as well as contradictions with recommendations of regulatory agencies. It is not immediate to appreciate what is good and what is not so good in guidelines, which are often read in a hurry. We have provided a short commentary for the readers who usually concentrate more on the figures and flowcharts rather than on the text.",Current problems in cardiology,2021-Mar,"Ferrari R, Pavasini R, Censi S, Squeri A, Rosano G",5,1183,cardiology,2025-11-22

While out-of-hours specialist cardiology cover and regional arrhythmia pathways are increasingly established, they are not universal, and the management of arrhythmia remains an important facet of clinical medicine for the general physician. This article discusses core recommendations from international guidelines with respect to heart rhythm diagnostics, pacing for bradycardia, cardiac resynchronisation and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, along with common complications.

However, the extent of these disparities across different types of cardiovascular literature is not well understood. We investigated gender differences in authorship across various cardiovascular publications over a decade and examined geographic variations in the representation of women authors. All papers published from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019, in 4 major cardiovascular journals (Journal of the American College of Cardiology, European Heart Journal, Journal of the American Medical Association Cardiology, and Nature Reviews Cardiology) were reviewed. Of the 18,535 papers with 111,562 authors, 20.6% of the authors were women, and 47.7% of the papers had no women authors. Over 10 years, the proportion of women authors remained low (20.7% in 2010 to 21.4% in 2019), with the lowest proportion in editorial papers (14.8%) and the highest in research papers (21.8%). More women as first (34.6%) and last (47.6%) authors were affiliated with institutions in the United States compared with other countries. The proportion of women middle-order authors was higher on papers with women as first authors (29.4% vs 20.5%) or last authors (30.6% vs 21.3%), compared with papers with men as first or last authors, respectively.

37186563,Systematic basic and advanced resuscitation training in medical students and fellows: a proposal from the Working Group on Cardiovascular Urgences and Emergencies of the Italian Society of Cardiology.,"Sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in Europe. High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and guidelines compliance of rescuers have been associated with better outcomes after cardiac arrest. However, wide variability in attempting bystander CPR manoeuvres has been reported. Educational programmes for teaching CPR to medical students and fellows are highly advisable in this context. However, there is no homogeneity regarding the CPR education offered by academic institutions. We surveyed 208 Italian medical students and 162 fellows in cardiology regarding the educational offer and needs in CPR. Among the 11 medical schools surveyed, 8 (73%) offer basic (BLS) courses but only 3 (38%) with formal certification of 'BLS provider', while none offers advanced (ACLS/ALS) courses. Among the 30 specialization schools in cardiology surveyed, 10 (33%) offer a BLS course (6 with formal certification of 'BLS provider'), and 8 (27%) offer an ACLS/ALS course (5 with formal certification). Only a minority of students and fellows perceive themselves as highly proficient either in BLS or ACLS/ALS, although most of the fellows were involved at least once in rescuing a cardiac arrest. The present position paper analyses and suggests the strategies that should be adopted by Italian medical and specialization schools to spread the CPR culture and increase the long-standing retention of CPR-related technical and nontechnical skills.","Journal of cardiovascular medicine (Hagerstown, Md.)",2023-May,"Saba PS, Canonico ME, Gambaro A, Gazale G, Piga S, Santomauro M, Roscio G",7,1453,cardiology,2025-11-22

We searched Embase (OVID), the Cochrane library, PubMed and Web of Science electronic databases from inception to January 2021 for randomised controlled trials that investigated the effects of interventions to increase SDM in cardiology. The primary outcomes were decisional conflict, decisional anxiety, decisional satisfaction or decisional regret; a secondary outcome was knowledge gained by the patients. Eighteen studies which reported on at least one outcome measure were identified, including a total of 4419 patients. Interventions to increase SDM had a significant effect on reducing decisional conflict (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.211, 95% CI -0.316 to -0.107) and increasing patient knowledge (SMD 0.476, 95% CI 0.351 to 0.600) compared with standard care. Interventions to increase SDM are effective in reducing decisional conflict and increasing patient knowledge in the field of cardiology.

33793792,The cardiology training needs of general practice-based pharmacists.,"As the role of the general practice clinical pharmacist (GPCP) evolves, there has been a shift towards patient-facing roles across multiple conditions. This study aimed to measure the self-reported cardiology training needs of GPCPs. An online survey was developed. Participants were shown a list of statements on cardiac conditions and medication across seven sub-domains. Participants self-reported their knowledge against each statement using a Likert Scale. Participants were considered to require training in that topic where they had 'disagreed', 'strongly disagreed' or expressed a 'neutral' rating in ≥3/7 areas. Participants were shown a list of single statements around cardiology test result knowledge and clinical assessment skills. Respondents who 'disagreed', 'strongly disagreed' or declared a 'neutral' position with the statement were judged to need training in that topic. Seventy-three out of 135 (54%) GPCPs responded. Acute coronary syndrome had the highest training requirement (38/73, 52%) within conditions. Fifty-nine out of 73 (81%) required training on sacubitril/valsartan and 57/73 (78%) with ivabradine. Fifty-four out of 73 (74%) and 44/73 (60%) required training on how to interpret natriuretic peptides and troponin, respectively. Fifty-nine out of 73 (81%), 48/73 (66%) and 55/73 (75%) required training on interpreting ECG, echocardiogram and coronary angiography, respectively. Reduced length of experience in general practice (<2 years) was commonly associated with increased training needs. There are areas of unmet cardiology training needs within GPCPs that require further support. As the GPCP role evolves, discussion is needed with national pharmacy stakeholders to decide how to incorporate this learning into routine training programmes.",The International journal of pharmacy practice,2021-May,"Clarke C, Tennant S, Greenlaw N, Girvin B, Forsyth P",5,1782,cardiology,2025-11-22
33652203,Monte Carlo study of patient and medical staff radiation exposures during interventional cardiology.,"The aim of this study is to assess the radiation exposure of the patient and the medical staff during interventional cardiology procedures. Realistic exposure scenarios were developed using the adult reference anthropomorphic phantoms adopted by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP110<sub>Male</sub> and ICRP110<sub>Female</sub>), and the radiation transport code Geant4 (version 10.3). The calculated equivalent and effective doses were normalised by the simulated Kerma-Area Product (KAP), resulting in two conversion coefficients H<sub>T</sub>/KAP and E/KAP. To properly evaluate the risk of exposure, several dose-dependent parameters have been investigated, namely: radiological parameters (tube kilovoltage peak (kVp), type of projection, field size (FOV)), and operator positions. Four projections (AP,PA,LAO25° and RAO25°) were simulated for three X-ray energy spectra (80,100 and 120 kVp) with four different values of FOV (15×15 cm<sup>2</sup>,20×20 cm<sup>2</sup>,25×25 cm<sup>2</sup> and 30×30 cm<sup>2</sup>). The results showed that the conversion coefficients values increase with increasing tube voltage as well as the FOV size. Recommended projection during the interventional cardiology procedures, whenever possible, should be the PA projection rather than AP projection. The most critical projection for the patient and the main operator is the RAO25° projection and the LAO25° projection respectively. The comparison of our results with the literature data showed good agreement allowing their use in the dosimetric characterization of interventional cardiology procedures.",Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB),2021-Feb,"Bhar M, Mora S, Kadri O, Zein S, Manai K, Incerti S",6,1620,cardiology,2025-11-22
31865443,Fears and Stressors of Trainees Starting Fellowship in Pediatric Cardiology.,"Post-graduate training for physicians involves a high level of stress. High stress during training has the potential to cause burnout, a well-studied phenomenon in medical trainees. Burnout has previously been shown to increase the risk of mental health problems and medical error in trainees. Little research has been done on the impact of stress on new fellows in general and pediatric cardiology fellows in particular; understanding common sources of stress offers the opportunity to design targeted interventions to support trainee wellness. New trainees in Boston Children's Hospital's Pediatric Cardiology Fellowship program were asked to answer to the following question at the beginning of their training: ""What are you afraid of in the coming year?"" A qualitative content analysis was done on their anonymous responses. Responses were coded and analyzed for common themes. The overall analysis found that 83% of fellows reported fear of ""fellowship/career responsibilities."" The second most common theme was ""failure/disappointment"" (78%) followed by ""personal life"" (74%), ""emotional exhaustion"" (61%); least common was ""new hospital environment"" (37%). The most common individual fear was ""increased clinical responsibility"" reported by 65% of the new fellows, while 62% reported fears of ""imposter syndrome,"" and 58% about ""burnout."" We found that fellows commonly report fears about both clinical and personal responsibilities, similar to stressors found in studies on residency. It is important for pediatric cardiology fellowships to develop early and specific interventions designed to assist fellows in managing both their new clinical responsibilities and their other stressors.",Pediatric cardiology,2020-Apr,"Brown DW, Binney G, Gauthier Z, Blume ED",4,1696,cardiology,2025-11-22

A structured and approved questionnaire was circulated to educationalists/trainers in 95 Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology training centres. Trainers from 46 centres responded with complete data in 41 centres. Instructional design included bedside teaching (41/41), didactic teaching (38/41), problem-based learning (28/41), cardiac catheterisation calculations (34/41), journal club (31/41), fellows presenting in the multidisciplinary meeting (41/41), fellows reporting on echocardiograms (34/41), clinical simulation (17/41), echocardiography simulation (10/41), and catheterisation simulation (3/41). Assessment included case-based discussion (n = 27), mini-clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX) (n = 12), directly observed procedures (n = 12), oral examination (n = 16), long cases (n = 11), written essay questions (n = 6), multiple choice questions (n = 5), and objective structured clinical examination (n = 2). Entrustable professional activities were utilised in 10 (24%) centres.

Currently, there is no clear perception about the needs in cardiac electrophysiology and pacing among early-career cardiologists. To address these concerns, the Young Committee of the Italian Association of Arrhythmology and Cardiac Pacing (AIAC) carried out a survey among those under the age of 40 years to obtain detailed information on practical activities and formal lessons during the fellowship in cardiology and their satisfaction and proficiency level at the end of the fellowship. We obtained 334 answers to the survey. In invasive cardiac electrophysiology and pacing, the percentage of participants attending the activity for a longer time (3-6 months) is lower compared with those in noninvasive subspecialties. About 40% of participants did not receive lessons on interventional cardiology, cardiac electrophysiology and pacing. On the contrary, 71% of participants received an adequate number of lessons on clinical arrhythmology. The vast majority of the participants expressed satisfaction for the education received in the echocardiographic, cardiac interventional laboratories and clinical arrhythmology, but about half of the participants were unsatisfied with the education received in cardiac electrophysiology and pacing. In interventional arrhythmology, the majority of the participants declare their lack of proficiency with two peaks for more complex procedures, namely interventional electrophysiology procedures (82%) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) procedures (76%). The present survey among Italian early-career cardiologists suggests that the majority of participants consider themselves not confident in performing cardiac electrophysiology and pacing procedures. Due to the complexity of the treatment for heart rhythm disorders and the long learning curve, structured additional training in cardiac electrophysiology and pacing procedures is required after cardiology fellowship.","Journal of cardiovascular medicine (Hagerstown, Md.)",2021-Oct,"Russo V, Nesti M, Brunacci M, Tola G, Santobuono VE, Dendramis G, Picciolo G, Lucciola MT, D'Onofrio A, Ricci R, de Ponti R",11,2110,cardiology,2025-11-22
35272659,Developing a curriculum to improve cardiology fellows' training in pregnancy and cardiovascular disease.,"Exposure to pregnant women with cardiovascular disease (CVD) during cardiology fellowship training is limited and without a standard curriculum in the United States. The authors sought to evaluate a dedicated curriculum to teach management of CVD in pregnancy to improve general cardiology fellowship training. The authors developed a dedicated CVD in pregnancy curriculum for the general cardiology fellows at a large academic medical center in the fall of 2019. Fellows' knowledge was assessed via a board-style examination and exposure and attitudes related to the care of pregnant women with CVD were evaluated with a needs assessment questionnaire before and after the curriculum. Of the 17 fellows who participated in the curriculum, 12 completed the needs assessment pre-curriculum and 9 post-curriculum. The mean (SD) number of pregnant women with CVD cared for by each fellow in the inpatient and outpatient settings were 0.75 (1.29) and 0.56 (0.73), respectively. After the curriculum, all fellows reported awareness of available resources to treat pregnant women with CVD, while a majority disagreed that they receive regular exposure to pregnant patients with CVD in their training. The authors observed significant increases in fellows' confidence in their knowledge of normal cardiovascular physiology of pregnancy, physical exam skills, and ability to care for pregnant women with valvular disease and arrhythmias from pre to post-curriculum. A total of 15 fellows completed the board-style exam pre-curriculum and 15 post-curriculum. Fellows' performance on the board-style examination improved slightly from before to after the curriculum (64.0 to 75.3% correct, p = 0.02).

36918867,Health care providers' perspectives on providing end-of-life psychiatric care in cardiology and oncology hospitals: a cross-sectional questionnaire survey.,"Psychological distress is a major concern for patients with end-stage heart failure (HF). However, psychiatric care for patients with HF is not as organized as that for patients with cancer. Therefore, the aim of this study was to elucidate and compare the barriers faced by health care providers of cardiology and oncology hospitals in providing end-of-life psychiatric care to patients with HF and cancer, respectively. We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire survey among the health care providers of Japan. Questionnaires were mailed to physicians and nurses of 427 cardiology and 347 oncology hospitals in March 2018 to assess health care providers' perspectives. First, we compared the scores of the Palliative Care Difficulties Scale and the original scale of end-of-life psychiatric care difficulties between health care providers of cardiology and oncology hospitals. Second, we asked the health care providers to describe the barriers to providing end-of-life psychiatric care with an open-ended question and then compared the freely-provided descriptions using content analysis. A total of 213 cardiology and 224 oncology health care providers responded to the questionnaire. No significant differences were found between health care providers of cardiology and oncology hospitals in the frequency of experiencing barriers to providing end-of-life psychiatric care (59.8% and 62.2%, respectively). A content analysis identified the following eight barriers: ""patients' personal problems,"" ""family members' problems,"" ""professionals' personal problems,"" ""communication problems between professionals and patients,"" ""problems specific to end-of-life care,"" ""problems specific to psychiatric care,"" ""problems of institution or system,"" and ""problems specific to non-cancer patients."" The ""problems specific to noncancer patients"" was described more frequently by health care providers in cardiology hospitals than that in oncology hospitals. However, there were no significant differences in other items between the two. Although health care providers of both cardiology and oncology hospitals faced barriers to providing end-of-life psychiatric care, those of cardiology hospitals particularly faced challenges pertaining to non-cancer patients, such as unpredictability of prognosis or insufficiency of guideline development.

Published exercise recommendations for individuals with CHD are predominantly centred on anatomic lesions, hampering an individualized approach to exercise advice in this heterogeneous population. This document presents an update of the recommendations for competitive sports participation in athletes with cardiovascular disease published by the Sports Cardiology & Exercise section of the European Association of Preventive Cardiology (EAPC) in 2005. It introduces an approach which is based on the assessment of haemodynamic, electrophysiological and functional parameters, rather than anatomic lesions. The recommendations provide a comprehensive assessment algorithm which allows for patient-specific assessment and risk stratification of athletes with CHD who wish to participate in competitive sports.",European heart journal,2020-Nov,"Budts W, Pieles GE, Roos-Hesselink JW, Sanz de la Garza M, D'Ascenzi F, Giannakoulas G, Müller J, Oberhoffer R, Ehringer-Schetitska D, Herceg-Cavrak V, Gabriel H, Corrado D, van Buuren F, Niebauer J, Börjesson M, Caselli S, Fritsch P, Pelliccia A, Heidbuchel H, Sharma S, Stuart AG, Papadakis M",22,1122,cardiology,2025-11-22
32608175,Improving cardiology fellow education of right heart catheterization using a simulation based curriculum.,"Medical procedures are traditionally taught informally at patients' bedside through observation and practice using the adage ""see one, do one, teach one."" This lack of formalized training can cause trainees to be unprepared to perform procedures independently. Simulation based education (SBE) increases competence, reduces complications, and decreases costs. We developed, implemented, and evaluated the efficacy of a right heart catheterization (RHC) SBE curriculum. The RHC curriculum consisted of a pretest, video didactics, deliberate practice, and a posttest. Pre-and posttest skills examinations consisted of a dichotomous 43-item checklist on RHC skills and a 14-item hemodynamic waveform quiz. We enrolled two groups of fellows: 6 first-year, novice cardiology fellows at Northwestern University in their first month of training, and 11 second- and third-year fellows who had completed traditional required, level I training in RHC. We trained the first-year fellows at the beginning of the 2018-2019 year using the SBE curriculum and compared them to the traditionally-trained cardiology fellows who did not complete SBE. The SBE-trained fellows significantly improved RHC skills, hemodynamic knowledge, and confidence from pre- to posttesting. SBE-trained fellows performed similarly to traditionally-trained fellows on simulated RHC skills checklists (88.4% correct vs. 89.2%, p = .84), hemodynamic quizzes (94.0% correct vs. 86.4%, p = .12), and confidence (79.4 vs. 85.9 out of 100, p = .15) despite less clinical experience. A SBE curriculum for RHC allowed novice cardiology fellows to achieve level I skills and knowledge at the beginning of fellowship and can train cardiology fellows before patient contact.",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2021-Feb,"Davidson LJ, Chow KY, Jivan A, Prenner SB, Cohen ER, Schimmel DR, McGaghie WC, Barsuk JH, Wayne DB, Sweis RN",10,1726,cardiology,2025-11-22
37460995,Flipped learning as an educational model in a cardiology residency program.,"Flipped learning (FL) is a model which allows students to adjust their study rhythm by taking advantage of class time to apply their knowledge. Although FL meets many of the needs of the traditional lecture-based model and the exclusively virtual model, its effectiveness in medical residency programs has not been thoroughly studied. Our study evaluates the efficacy of an FL model in a cardiology residency program based on the satisfaction and academic performance of the participants. A prospective, observational, and descriptive study was conducted at Ignacio Chávez National Institute of Cardiology in Mexico City to evaluate the satisfaction and effectiveness of an FL model for acquiring competencies in electrocardiographic diagnosis among thirty-one first-year cardiology residents. The Advanced Electrocardiography Workshop and a virtual classroom were designed for the intervention. Four teachers taught the workshop and video classes, and ten medical specialists from the participants' areas of work performed evaluations of practical skills before and after the intervention. 75% of the participants rated the intervention as very favorable compared to the traditional and virtual models. The main advantages offered by the FL model were identified. An improvement of high statistical significance was observed in participants' academic performance after the intervention (P value < 0.001). The FL model has a high degree of acceptance among participants and teachers. Our study shows an improvement in academic performance after the intervention. Considering that the FL model is flexible and reproducible in other areas of medicine, it represents an excellent educational alternative that meets current needs.",BMC medical education,2023-Jul,"Sierra-Fernández CR, Alejandra HD, Trevethan-Cravioto SA, Azar-Manzur FJ, Mauricio LM, Garnica-Geronimo LR",6,1726,cardiology,2025-11-22
38852909,Financial barriers to attending international cardiology conferences: 2022-24 analysis of registration fees.,"Cardiology conferences represent a major avenue for learning, career advancement, and professional networking. Yet, costs of attending these conferences represent a major barrier, particularly for trainees and participants from low-middle-income countries (LMICs). Our study aimed to analyze the registration fees of major cardiology conferences worldwide. We included conferences organized by international cardiovascular societies and those representing global regions. We did not include individual national or institutional conferences due to inability to systematically identify them. We collected 2024 registration fees from official conference websites, taking 2023 or 2022 fees if unavailable, and categorized them according to career stage and society membership status. Where specified, we chose 'early-bird' fees. All fees were converted to US dollars according to currency exchange rates per the International Monetary Fund on December 4, 2023, or if unavailable, per the last reported US Treasury Data. Other data collected included host country, virtual option availability, and LMIC discounts. 30 (65.2 %) conferences provided discounts for medical students, regardless of membership status, while 1 (2.2 %) provided discounts only for student-members. 36 (78.2 %) conferences offered discounts for residents/fellows, while 2 (4.3 %) offered discounts only for resident/fellow-members. Median fees for students and residents/fellows with membership were $255 and $287 (in US dollars), respectively while median fees for non-members were $303.5 and $397, respectively. 31 (67.4 %) conferences provided discounts for staff- members. Median fees for staff were $701 and $800 for members and non-members, respectively. Only 12 (26.1 %) conferences mentioned a virtual component, with 11 offering discounted registration compared with in-person rates. 7 (15.2 %) conferences had special in-person fees for LMIC-based registrants. 5 offered the same discounted rate regardless of training stage, while 2 offered additional discounts for trainees. We found that conference registration costs were substantial, including for trainees, with only a minority of conferences providing discounted rates for LMICs. Professional societies must reduce registration costs, potentially by implementing a tiered system based on training stage and country of origin. Further, to augment LMIC participation, dedicated scholarships and mentorship programs for LMIC-based registrants are needed.",Current problems in cardiology,2024-Sep,"Bhat V, Bellur S, Kumar A, Anavekar N, Kalra A",5,2487,cardiology,2025-11-22
34872975,Bullying in UK cardiology: a systemic problem requiring systemic solutions.,"Bullying of trainee doctors has been shown to be associated with detrimental outcomes for both doctors and patients. However, there is limited evidence regarding the level of bullying of trainees within medical specialties. An annual survey of UK cardiology trainees was conducted through the British Junior Cardiologists' Association between 2017 and 2020 and asked questions about experiencing and witnessing bullying, and exposure to inappropriate language/behaviour in cardiology departments. Fisher's exact tests and univariable logistic regression models were used to describe associations between trainee characteristics, and reports of bullying and inappropriate language/behaviour. Of 1358 trainees, bullying was reported by 152 (11%). Women had 55% higher odds of reporting being bullied (OR: 1.55 95% CI (1.08 to 2.21)). Non-UK medical school graduates were substantially more likely to be bullied (European Economic Area (EEA) OR: 2.22 (1.31 to 3.76), non-EEA/UK OR: 3.16 (2.13 to 4.68)) compared with those graduating from UK-based medical schools. Women were more likely than men to report sexist language (14% vs 4%, p<0.001). Non-UK medical school graduates were more likely to experience racist language (UK 1.5%, EEA 6%, other locations 7%, p=0.006). One-third of trainees (33%) reported at least one inappropriate behaviour with 8% reporting being shouted at or targeted with spontaneous anger. Consultants in cardiology (82%) and other specialties (70%) were most commonly implicated by those reporting bullying. Bullying and inappropriate language are commonly experienced by cardiology trainees and disproportionately affect women and those who attended non-UK medical schools. Consultants both in cardiology and other specialties are the most commonly reported perpetrators.",Heart (British Cardiac Society),2022-Feb,"Camm CF, Joshi A, Moore A, Sinclair HC, Westwood M, Greenwood JP, Calver A, Ray S, Allen C",9,1797,cardiology,2025-11-22

36274241,The Application of Quantitative Flow Ratio via 3-dimensional Coronary Angiography in Clinical Cardiology: A Review.,"Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is a gold standard for the assessment of hemodynamic change during coronary stenosis, but it has several limitations such as high cost, the requirement of invasive pressure wire, and adverse drug reactions, which limit the wide application of FFR in clinical practice. In contrast, quantitative flow ratio (QFR) is a recently developed method for rapid calculation of FFR through 3-dimensional quantitative coronary angiography without the use of vasodilators and pressure wire. In this review we provide an updated summary of the principle of QFR, the correlation between QFR and FFR, and current applications of QFR in clinical cardiology. In conclusion, QFR provides a platform for functional evaluation of coronary stenoses based on angiographic data without invasive procedures; further development and optimization of QFR techniques will expand the application of QFR in clinical cardiology, ranging from diagnosis to coronary intervention to cardiac surgery, and benefit more patients.",Discovery medicine,2022-,"Li Y, Chen H",2,1022,cardiology,2025-11-22
34917308,Influence of Diversity Nursing on Patients' Rehabilitation in Cardiology Treatment.,"With the improvement of living standards, people have more and more physical health problems. Among them, high-risk cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease are the most prominent. The number of cardiology patients is increasing year by year. Effectively improving the treatment of cardiology patients and speeding up the recovery of cardiology patients have become a social problem. This article aims to explore the impact of diverse nursing care on patients in cardiology treatment. This article first gives a detailed introduction to the treatment of diverse nursing and cardiology diseases, then takes 300 cardiology patients in our hospital as experimental subjects, and conducts a controlled experiment of nursing intervention, which is categorized into an experimental group of 150 cases (including 35 cases of hypertension, 46 cases of diabetes, 28 cases of coronary heart disease, 24 cases of angina pectoris, and 17 cases of multiple complications) and a control group of 150 cases (including 30 cases of hypertension, 47 cases of diabetes, 39 cases of coronary heart disease, 21 cases of angina pectoris, and 13 cases of multiple complications). The experimental results showed the following: the general information of the two groups of patients was not statistically different (<i>P</i> > 0.05); after the nursing intervention, the blood glucose levels of the two groups of patients decreased, but the experimental group decreased more significantly and the blood glucose control effect was more obvious; after the intervention, in the experimental group that implemented diversified nursing interventions, the patient's condition management effect was better and their scores were between 8 and 10; the mental state self-evaluation of the two groups of patients was significantly different from the domestic reference value (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and there is a very significant statistical difference between the two groups after nursing intervention (<i>P</i> < 0.01); after nursing intervention, compared with the control group, the quality of life of the experimental group improved more significantly and the highest score reached about 70; the overall satisfaction of the experimental group with nursing work reached 92%, while the satisfaction of the control group with nursing work was only 44.67%.

37244509,Gender Disparity in Work Distribution Among Cardiology Trainees: Pakistan's Perspective.,"Gender disparity in work distribution among cardiology trainees is a crucial issue that can impact career development and the overall representation of women in the field. This cross-sectional survey aimed to examine the gender disparity in work distribution among cardiology trainees in Pakistan. A total of 1156 trainees from various medical institutions across the country participated in the study, with 687 male trainees (59.4%) and 469 female trainees (40.5%). Demographic characteristics, baseline characteristics, work distribution patterns, perceptions of gender disparity, and career aspirations were assessed. The findings revealed that male trainees reported being assigned more complex procedures compared to female trainees (75% vs 47%, P < 0.001), while female trainees reported a higher frequency of being assigned administrative tasks compared to male trainees (61% vs 35%, P = 0.001). Both genders reported similar perceptions of the overall workload. However, female trainees experienced significantly higher rates of perceived bias and discrimination compared to male trainees (70% vs 25%, P < 0.001). Moreover, female trainees expressed a higher perception of unequal opportunities for career advancement due to gender disparities (80% vs 67%, P < 0.001). While male and female trainees showed similar aspirations for pursuing advanced subspecialties within cardiology, male trainees expressed a higher intention to pursue leadership positions within the field (60% vs 30%, P = 0.003). These findings shed light on the existing gender disparities in work distribution and perceptions within cardiology training programs in Pakistan.",Current problems in cardiology,2023-Oct,"Rashid S, Saidullah S, Hashmi MO, Talat F, Gilani SGA, Malik J, Akhtar W",7,1653,cardiology,2025-11-22
39375650,Teaching pediatric cardiology fellows to communicate serious news: a pilot study.,"Pediatric cardiology fellows often deliver serious news to families. Effective clinician-patient communication is the basis of strong therapeutic relationships and improves health outcomes, increases patient adherence, and enhances patient satisfaction. Communication training improves physicians' communication skills, ability to deliver serious news, and meet the informational and emotional needs of patients and family members. However, there is little data surrounding pediatric cardiology fellows competencies or training in communication skills. Pediatric cardiology fellows participated in a 3-hour communication training session. The session used VitalTalk methodology and was facilitated by two VitalTalk facilitators. Fellows spent 1 h learning the skills of delivering serious news and responding to emotion and 2 h in role play with standardized actors followed by a brief group wrap-up activity. Participants took an anonymous, electronic pre- and post-survey and an 8-month follow-up survey via REDCap. Participants were asked about their preparedness and comfort performing certain communication skills and leading challenging conversations specific to pediatric cardiology. Response options used a combination of 0 (low comfort/preparedness) to 100 (high comfort/preparedness) point scales and multiple choice. 9 fellows participated in the training and 100% completed all three surveys. Eight were first-year fellows and 1 was a third-year fellow. Finding the right words, balancing honesty with hope, and clinical and prognostic uncertainty were the top three factors that contributed to making conversations difficult. Following the course, there was a significant increase in fellow preparedness to communicate a new diagnosis of congenital heart disease, discuss poor prognoses, check understanding, and respond to emotion and an increase in fellow comfort responding to emotions. Four fellows reported using the skills from this training course in various clinical settings at 8-month follow up. Communicating serious news effectively is a skill that can be learned in a sustainable way and is essential in the field of pediatric cardiology. Our study demonstrates that an interactive, VitalTalk course can improve preparedness and comfort to deliver serious news in a cohort of pediatric cardiology trainees. Future studies are needed to evaluate translation of skills to clinical practice and durability of these skills in larger cohorts.",BMC medical education,2024-Oct,"Crafts LS, Teng C, Irwin M, Feraco AM, Lawton AJ, Snaman JM, Blume ED, Ronai C",8,2463,cardiology,2025-11-22
35291997,An e-learning pediatric cardiology curriculum for Pediatric Postgraduate trainees in Rwanda: implementation and evaluation.,"Access to pediatric sub-specialty training is a critical unmet need in many resource-limited settings. In Rwanda, only two pediatric cardiologists are responsible for the country's clinical care of a population of 12 million, along with the medical education of all pediatric trainees. To strengthen physician training opportunities, we developed an e-learning curriculum in pediatric cardiology. This curriculum aimed to ""flip the classroom"", allowing residents to learn key pediatric cardiology concepts digitally before an in-person session with the specialist, thus efficiently utilizing the specialist for additional case based and bedside teaching. We surveyed Rwandan and US faculty and residents using a modified Delphi approach to identify key topics in pediatric cardiology. Lead authors from Rwanda and the USA collaborated with OPENPediatrics™, a free digital knowledge-sharing platform, to produce ten core topics presented in structured videos spanning 4.5 h. A mixed methods evaluation was completed with Rwandan pediatric residents, including surveys assessing knowledge, utilization, and satisfaction. Qualitative analysis of structured interviews was conducted using NVivo. Among the 43 residents who participated in the OPENPediatrics™ cardiology curriculum, 33 (77%) completed the curriculum assessment. Residents reported using the curriculum for a median of 8 h. Thirty-eight (88%) reported viewing the curriculum on their personal or hospital computer via pre-downloaded materials on a USB flash drive, with another seven (16%) reporting viewing it online. Twenty-seven residents viewed the course during core lecture time (63%). Commonly reported barriers to utilization included lack of time (70%), access to internet (40%) and language (24%). Scores on knowledge assessment improved from 66.2% to 76.7% upon completion of the curriculum (p < 0.001) across all levels of training, with most significant improvement in scores for PGY-1 and PGY-2 residents. Residents reported high satisfaction with the visuals, engaging presentation, and organization of the curriculum. Residents opined the need for expanded training material in cardiac electrocardiogram and echocardiogram and requested for slower narration by foreign presenters. Video-based e-learning via OPENPediatrics™ in a resource-limited setting was effective in improving resident's knowledge in pediatric cardiology with high levels of utilization and satisfaction. Expanding access to digital curriculums for other pediatric sub-specialties may be both an effective and efficient strategy for improving training in settings with limited access to subspecialist faculty.",BMC medical education,2022-Mar,"Rusingiza E, Alizadeh F, Wolbrink T, Mutamba B, Vinci S, Profita EL, Rulisa S, DelSignore L, Solis J, Geggel R, Wilson K",11,2657,cardiology,2025-11-22
35291995,Validity of a cardiology fellow performance assessment: reliability and associations with standardized examinations and awards.,"Most work on the validity of clinical assessments for measuring learner performance in graduate medical education has occurred at the residency level. Minimal research exists on the validity of clinical assessments for measuring learner performance in advanced subspecialties. We sought to determine validity characteristics of cardiology fellows' assessment scores during subspecialty training, which represents the largest subspecialty of internal medicine. Validity evidence included item content, internal consistency reliability, and associations between faculty-of-fellow clinical assessments and other pertinent variables. This was a retrospective validation study exploring the domains of content, internal structure, and relations to other variables validity evidence for scores on faculty-of-fellow clinical assessments that include the 10-item Mayo Cardiology Fellows Assessment (MCFA-10). Participants included 7 cardiology fellowship classes. The MCFA-10 item content included questions previously validated in the assessment of internal medicine residents. Internal structure evidence was assessed through Cronbach's α. The outcome for relations to other variables evidence was overall mean of faculty-of-fellow assessment score (scale 1-5). Independent variables included common measures of fellow performance. Participants included 65 cardiology fellows. The overall mean ± standard deviation faculty-of-fellow assessment score was 4.07 ± 0.18. Content evidence for the MCFA-10 scores was based on published literature and core competencies. Cronbach's α was 0.98, suggesting high internal consistency reliability and offering evidence for internal structure validity. In multivariable analysis to provide relations to other variables evidence, mean assessment scores were independently associated with in-training examination scores (beta = 0.088 per 10-point increase; p = 0.05) and receiving a departmental or institutional award (beta = 0.152; p = 0.001). Assessment scores were not associated with educational conference attendance, compliance with completion of required evaluations, faculty appointment upon completion of training, or performance on the board certification exam. R<sup>2</sup> for the multivariable model was 0.25. These findings provide sound validity evidence establishing item content, internal consistency reliability, and associations with other variables for faculty-of-fellow clinical assessment scores that include MCFA-10 items during cardiology fellowship. Relations to other variables evidence included associations of assessment scores with performance on the in-training examination and receipt of competitive awards. These data support the utility of the MCFA-10 as a measure of performance during cardiology training and could serve as the foundation for future research on the assessment of subspecialty learners.",BMC medical education,2022-Mar,"Cullen MW, Klarich KW, Baldwin KM, Engstler GJ, Mandrekar J, Scott CG, Beckman TJ",7,2869,cardiology,2025-11-22

This study aims to assess the accuracy of the over-apron single dosimetric approach compared with double dosimetric methods and explore the relationship between under-apron and over-apron doses. This investigation showed that the prescribed annual dose constraint of 20 mSv year-1 was not exceeded by the maximum annual occupational doses determined by dosimetric algorithms, which were 0.13 ± 0.02, 0.15 ± 0.02 and 0.27 ± 0.04 mSv, respectively. The study demonstrated excellent statistically significant correlations among single and double dosimetric algorithms and between direct under-apron and over-apron doses. Consequently, single dosimetric algorithms could effectively estimate doses for double dosimetric algorithms, highlighting the limited added value of under-apron measurements.

Surgeons, however, faced a difficult choice. Some wanted to invest in generalist surgeons to make basic surgical care available to all Indians. Others wanted to invest in specialists to ensure that India participated in cutting-edge surgical research and care. These debates shaped the emergence of cardiac surgery at two centres: the Christian Medical College in Vellore and the King Edward Memorial Hospital in Bombay. CMC invested in thoracic surgery in the 1940s to offer new treatments for tuberculosis. This gave surgeons the opportunity to explore new techniques of cardiac surgery. Debate quickly emerged about whether investments in cardiology and cardiac surgery made sense. In the end, the specialities were supported in order to attract paying patients. A parallel controversy took place at KEM, where the dean debated the Bombay Municipal Corporation about the role of surgical research at a public hospital.

In nuclear cardiology, there are many clinical, stress, and imaging variables potentially available, which need to be optimally integrated to predict the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) or predict the risk of cardiovascular events. In spite of clinical awareness of a large number of potential variables, it is difficult for physicians to integrate multiple features consistently and objectively. Machine learning (ML) is particularly well suited to integrating this vast array of information to provide patient-specific predictions.

A cohort of 305 patients aged 2-29 years (<i>M</i> = 11.97 years; SD = 6.00 years; 50.49% female), representing a variety of indications for a cardiology clinic visit, or a parent, completed a survey of 14 common behavioural health concerns. Behavioural health concerns were included based on practice patterns within paediatric psychology. Respondents indicated if they were currently receiving behavioural health services and if they were interested in behavioural health follow-up. Surveys were administered during check in and collected by clinic staff. A behavioural health provider attempted to reach all those who indicated interest by phone. Approximately 45% of the sample endorsed one or more behavioural health concerns and 30.16% of the sample endorsed at least one concern but were not already connected to services. Only 27.17% of this group requested follow-up. Most commonly endorsed concerns were anxiety, sleep problems, depressed/irritable mood, and somatic complaints. Survey results converge with existing literature to indicate that behavioural health concerns are common among youth seen in a paediatric cardiology clinic but most patients are not connected to appropriate services.

Female pediatric cardiologists experience inequities in scholarship opportunities, promotion, leadership positions, and compensation. Mentorship groups have been successfully implemented in other subspecialities with promising results. We created a peer mentorship group for female pediatric cardiologists in the Northeast and completed a needs assessment survey of eligible participants. Our goal was to better understand the current challenges and identify resources to overcome these barriers. Our objectives were to (1) describe the creation of a novel mentorship program for female pediatric cardiologists and trainees in the Northeast United States, and (2) report the results of a formal needs assessment survey of all eligible participants. All female pediatric cardiology fellows and practicing pediatric and adult congenital heart disease specialists from 15 academic centers in New England were invited to join a free group with virtual meetings. A formal needs assessment survey was provided electronically to all eligible members. The vast majority of respondents agreed that the Women in Pediatric Cardiology (WIPC) group is a valuable networking and mentorship experience (90%) and would recommend this group to a colleague (95%). Members have witnessed or experienced inequities in a broad range of settings. Common challenges experienced by respondents include dependent care demands, lack of mentorship, inadequate research support, and inequitable clinical responsibilities. Resources suggested to overcome these barriers include mentorship, sponsorship, transparency in compensation, and physician coaching.

36508019,Applying Practice Analysis to Develop a New Test Content Outline for the Pediatric Cardiology Certification Examination.,"The evolving breadth and complexity of the contemporary pediatric cardiology specialty requires regular, systematic analysis of the practice to ensure that training and certification requirements address the demands of real-world clinical experience. We report the process of the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) for conducting such a practice analysis and revising the test content outline (TCO) for the pediatric cardiology subspecialty certification exam. A panel of 15 pediatric cardiologists conducted seven 2-h virtual meetings, during which they identified 37 unique tasks that represent the work a pediatric cardiologist may reasonably expect to perform within the first 5 years after training. These tasks were grouped into nine performance domains, similar to the entrustable professional activities (EPA), previously endorsed by the ABP in collaboration with the pediatric cardiology education community, and which represent the critical activities of the profession. The panel then enumerated the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform each task. These deliberations resulted in two work products: a practice analysis document (PAD) and subspecialty board TCO based on testable knowledge, skills, and abilities. Survey assessments of the panel's work were then distributed to pediatric cardiology fellowship program directors and to practicing pediatric cardiologists for their input, which largely aligned with the panel's recommendations. Survey responses were considered in the final revisions of the PAD and TCO. This approach to practice analysis proved to be an efficient process for describing the work performed by today's pediatric cardiologists and the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to competently perform that work.",Pediatric cardiology,2023-Jun,"Brucia RC, Taggart NW, Sagiv E, Kohli U, Tisma-Dupanovic S, Sutton NJ, McDaniel GM, Rossano JW, Dwyer AC, Marshall AC",10,1765,cardiology,2025-11-22
33365389,Neonatal Cardiac Emergencies: A Multidisciplinary Simulation Curriculum for Neonatology and Pediatric Cardiology Fellows.,"Although care for neonates with cardiac disease is frequently provided by neonatologists and pediatric cardiologists, training in the multidisciplinary management of neonatal cardiac emergencies is not often included in fellowship training. We created a multidisciplinary simulation curriculum to address the skills needed for neonatal cardiac care. Neonatology and pediatric cardiology fellows participated in 1-hour simulations on 3 different days. They managed a neonate with: (1) cyanosis, (2) cardiogenic shock, and (3) an unstable arrhythmia. Using both remote consultation and bedside evaluation, the participants diagnosed and jointly established a management plan for the infant. During the debrief, facilitators reviewed the clinical decisions and multidisciplinary management skills of the participants. Participants completed pre- and postparticipation surveys to evaluate the curriculum's effect on their confidence in the management of neonatal cardiac disease. Thirty-three paired survey responses from 20 participants (11 neonatology and 9 pediatric cardiology) reported a mean overall satisfaction score of 4.6 (<i>SD</i> = 0.7) based on a 5-point Likert scale. Postparticipation confidence scores improved significantly in: (1) the recognition of the signs of congenital heart disease (pre = 4.1, post = 4.5, <i>p</i> = .01), (2) differentiation of cardiac cyanosis from noncardiac cyanosis (pre = 3.9, post = 4.2, <i>p</i> = .05), and (3) confidence in discussing cardiac concerns with consultants (pre = 3.3, post = 4.1, <i>p</i> = .02). This multidisciplinary simulation improved fellows' confidence in the management of neonates with cardiac disease and provided an opportunity to practice team work, remote consultation, and cross-disciplinary communication.",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,2020-Dec,"Simmons MA, Otero-Luna A, Redmond B, Fahey J, Beach C, Bruno C, Johnston L",7,1781,cardiology,2025-11-22

Each technique is introduced with enough details to allow the understanding of how it works and its intent, but without delving into details that do not add immediate benefits and require expertise in the field. We specifically focus on the principal Machine learning based risk scores used in cardiovascular research. After introducing them and summarizing their assumptions and biases, we discuss their merits and shortcomings. We report on how frequently they are adopted in the field and suggest why this is the case based on our expertise in machine learning. We complete the analysis by reviewing how corresponding statistical approaches compare with them. Finally, we discuss the main open issues in applying machine learning tools to cardiology tasks, also drafting possible future directions. Despite the growing interest in these tools, we argue that there are many still underutilized techniques: while neural networks are slowly being incorporated in cardiovascular research, other important techniques such as semi-supervised learning and federated learning are still underutilized. The former would allow practitioners to harness the information contained in large datasets that are only partially labeled, while the latter would foster collaboration between institutions allowing building larger and better models.",Minerva cardiology and angiology,2022-Feb,"Arfat Y, Mittone G, Esposito R, Cantalupo B, DE Ferrari GM, Aldinucci M",6,1510,cardiology,2025-11-22

37493038,Enhanced congenital cardiac surgery knowledge with multidisciplinary collaborative education series for paediatric cardiology fellows and nurse practitioners.,"Paediatric cardiologists and nurse practitioners lack structured education tools focused on basic cardiac surgery principles. However, non-surgical specialties caring for surgical patients require this knowledge for comprehensive clinical care. We created a cardiac surgical educational curriculum focused on improving knowledge and attitudes towards communication for non-surgical trainees and advanced practice providers. Over one academic year, six paediatric cardiology fellows and seven paediatric cardiac surgery nurse practitioners at Seattle Children's Hospital participated in this study. With surgical supervision, six lectures were prepared by each fellow and delivered monthly. Sessions were hybrid and recorded for later viewing. Pre- and post-intervention survey of attitudes regarding surgical topics and pre- and post- test-based knowledge assessments were administered. Participants positively rated the usefulness of the lecture series (4.2/5) and would recommend it to a colleague (4.5/5). Self-reported confidence discussing surgical concepts with patients increased from 2.3 to 3.4 among paediatric cardiology fellows (p < 0.001) and from 2.8 to 3.9 among nurse practitioners (p < 0.001), out of 5. In both groups, knowledge assessment scores improved from 54 to 79% post-intervention (p < 0.001). After a six-part educational series taught by paediatric cardiology fellows, both paediatric cardiology fellows and paediatric cardiac surgery nurse practitioners demonstrated improved knowledge and reported increased comfort counselling families on basic cardiac surgery topics. Structured, active-learning lessons taught by fellows for non-surgical audiences can improve attitudes and build clinically relevant knowledge. Creating an effective level-appropriate multidisciplinary curriculum accessible to various types of medical providers could enhance comprehensive care of complex congenital cardiac surgery patients.",Cardiology in the young,2024-Mar,"Lee ME, Price J, Schauer J, Carlozzi L, Virk K, Freeman K, Lee J, Johnston TA, Bhat A",9,1941,cardiology,2025-11-22

From this perspective, the role of Legal Medicine in assessing medical liability has become increasingly specific and a homogenization of the methods of ascertainment is increasingly necessary, since such a process can contribute to strengthening the guarantees in professional liability procedures. Focusing on malpractice claims in the field of cardiology, the complexity of the management of cardiac pathologies and the frequency of severe adverse events implies the importance of a multi-disciplinary approach, together with the application of a shared ascertainment methodology. In particular, it is essential for the forensic pathologist to collaborate with experts in cardio-pathology, cardiology and/or cardiac surgery in cases of alleged medical liability in the cardiologic field and to follow the guidelines which have been produced to assist the expert dealing with deaths reflecting cardiac disease, in order to prevent criticism of case analysis in medico-legal environments and to promote the standardization of the structure of the juridical-legislative medical malpractice lawsuits.","Legal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2023-Nov,"Montisci R, Licciardi M, Cecchi R, Kondo T, Gerosa G, Casula R, Cecchetto G, Montisci M",8,1271,cardiology,2025-11-22

TTE is a cost-effective first-line imaging modality to evaluate the cardiac remodeling due to long-term, intense training, previously known as the athlete's heart, and to rule out the presence of conditions at risk of sudden cardiac death, including cardiomyopathies, coronary artery anomalies, congenital, aortic and heart valve diseases. Moreover, TTE is useful for distinguishing physiological cardiac adaptations during intense exercise from pathological behavior due to an underlying CVD. In this expert opinion statement endorsed by the Italian Society of Sports Cardiology, we discussed common clinical scenarios where a TTE is required and conditions falling in the grey zone between the athlete's heart and underlying cardiomyopathies or other CVD.

Racial, ethnic, and gender disparities exist along the path to cardiology residency, beginning as early as medical school admissions. Approximately 65.62% White, 4.71% Black, 18.06% Asian, and 8.86% Hispanic are cardiologists, while there are a total of 60.1% White, 12.2% Black, 5.6% Asian, and 18.5% Hispanic people in the United States in 2019, showing evident underrepresentation. Gender disparities have an inevitable role in the lack of a diverse cardiovascular workforce. According to a recent study, only 13% of practicing cardiologists in the United States are women, even though the female population in the United States is 50.52% as compared to 49.48% of men. These disparities led to under-represented physicians earning less than their similarly qualified counterparts, decreased equity, increased workplace harassment, and also results in patients facing unconscious bias from their physicians leading to deteriorated clinical outcomes. Implications in the field of research include the under-representation of minorities and the female population despite the increased burden of cardiovascular disease they face.

Using a mixed-methods approach and a modified time-driven, activity-based, costing framework, we retrospectively analysed cardiology electronic consultations. A random subset of 500 electronic consultations referred between 2013-2017 were reviewed. Accessibility was determined based upon increased number of patients served without the need for an in-person clinic visit. To assess safety, medical records were reviewed for emergency room visits or hospital admission at six months from the initial electronic consultation date. Responding cardiologist satisfaction was assessed by voluntary completion of an online survey. The majority of electronic consultations were related to medication advice, clearance for surgery, evaluation of images, or guidance after abnormal testing. Recommendations included echo (10.8%), stress testing (5.0%), other imaging (4.0%) and other subspecialist referrals (3.8%). Electronic consultations were completed within 0.7±0.5 days of the request, with a time to completion of 5-30 min. Over a six-month follow-up, 13.9% of patients had an in-person visit and 2.2% of patients were hospitalised, but none were directly related to the electronic consultation question.

Among competitive athletes, disparities in health outcomes potentially influenced by social determinants of health (SDOH) and structural racism remain inadequately understood. This narrative review centers on race in sports cardiology, addressing racial disparities in SCD risk, false-positive cardiac screening rates among athletes, and the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and encourages a reexamination of race-based practices in sports cardiology, such as the interpretation of screening 12-lead electrocardiogram findings. Drawing from an array of sources, including epidemiological data and broader medical literature, this narrative review discusses racial disparities in sports cardiology and calls for a paradigm shift in approach that encompasses 3 key principles: race-conscious awareness, clinical inclusivity, and research-driven refinement of clinical practice. These proposed principles call for a shift away from race-based assumptions towards individualized, health-focused care in sports cardiology. This shift would include fostering awareness of sociopolitical constructs, diversifying the medical team workforce, and conducting diverse, evidence-based research to better understand disparities and address inequities in sports cardiology care. In sports cardiology, inadequate consideration of the impact of structural racism and SDOH on racial disparities in health outcomes among athletes has resulted in potential biases in current normative standards and in the clinical approach to the cardiovascular care of athletes.

There was no difference in age (61 vs 60), case mix or new vs return appointments in virtual vs traditional clinics. There were similar rates of clinic participation, 71.8% vs 74.2%. A lower proportion of investigations (e.g. imaging) were booked in virtual (38.5%) vs traditional (55.7%) clinics, p < 0.00001. Management changes (e.g. medication changes) were less frequent in virtual (19.9%) vs traditional (38.5%) clinics, p < 0.00001. However, the discharge rate was higher in virtual (28.8%) vs traditional (19.5%) clinics, p = 0.00003. This study highlights that virtual clinic consultations are associated with fewer investigations, fewer management changes, and increased discharge rates compared with traditional consultations. These practice changes would reduce costs and hospital outpatient congestion by avoiding unnecessary hospital reviews. Nonetheless, it is unknown whether patients requiring face-to-face consultations could be missed as a result of this virtual approach.

Appropriateness of the referral was assessed by comparing with the 2014 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. Any recommendations made, major adverse cardiac events and perioperative outcome were also noted. Results Only 71 (15.5%) referrals were appropriate according to the guidelines. A majority of them were for preoperative clearance. The most common recommendation was to withhold antiplatelet medications. None of the consultations made any change in the anaesthetic or surgical plan. Six patients had major perioperative adverse cardiac events. Conclusion The majority of consultations were by surgeons and were not indicated according to the guidelines and did not have any impact on patient outcome.

38837338,The impact of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines and whole exome sequencing on genetic testing in hereditary cardiac diseases.,"In the last decade, an incredible improvement has been made in elucidating the genetic bases of cardiomyopathies. Here we report the impact of either the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines or the use of whole exome sequencing (WES) in terms of a number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) and missed diagnoses in a series of 260 patients affected by inherited cardiac disorders. Samples were analyzed using a targeted gene panel of 128 cardiac-related genes and/or WES in a subset of patients, with a three-tier approach. Analyzing (i) only a subset of genes related to the clinical presentation, strictly following the ESC guidelines, 20.77% positive test were assessed. The incremental diagnostic rate for (ii) the whole gene panel, and (iii) the WES was 4.71% and 11.67%, respectively. The diverse analytical approaches increased the number of VUSs and incidental findings. Indeed, the use of WES highlights that there is a small percentage of syndromic conditions that standard analysis would not have detected. Moreover, the use of targeted sequencing coupled with ""narrow"" analytical approach prevents the detection of variants in actionable genes that could allow for preventive treatment. Our data suggest that genetic testing might aid clinicians in the diagnosis of inheritable cardiac disorders.",Clinical genetics,2024-Oct,"Mio C, Zucco J, Fabbro D, Bregant E, Baldan F, Allegri L, D'Elia AV, Collini V, Imazio M, Damante G, Faletra F",11,1327,cardiology,2025-11-22

A clinical consensus statement from the ESC Council for Cardiology Practice/Taskforce on Geriatric Cardiology, the ESC Digital Health Committee and the ESC Working Group on e-Cardiology.","Digital health technology is receiving increasing attention in cardiology. The rise of accessibility of digital health tools including wearable technologies and smart phone applications used in medical practice has created a new era in healthcare. The coronavirus pandemic has provided a new impetus for changes in delivering medical assistance across the world. This Consensus document discusses the potential implementation of digital health technology in older adults, suggesting a practical approach to general cardiologists working in an ambulatory outpatient clinic, highlighting the potential benefit and challenges of digital health in older patients with, or at risk of, cardiovascular disease. Advancing age may lead to a progressive loss of independence, to frailty, and to increasing degrees of disability. In geriatric cardiology, digital health technology may serve as an additional tool both in cardiovascular prevention and treatment that may help by (i) supporting self-caring patients with cardiovascular disease to maintain their independence and improve the management of their cardiovascular disease and (ii) improving the prevention, detection, and management of frailty and supporting collaboration with caregivers. Digital health technology has the potential to be useful for every field of cardiology, but notably in an office-based setting with frequent contact with ambulatory older adults who may be pre-frail or frail but who are still able to live at home.

37905328,Contemporary transesophageal echocardiography practice patterns among paediatric cardiology centres in the United States and Canada.,"To characterise transesophageal echocardiography practice patterns among paediatric cardiac surgical centres in the United States and Canada. A 42-question survey was sent to 80 echocardiography laboratory directors at paediatric cardiology centres with surgical programmes in the United States and Canada. Question domains included transesophageal echocardiography centre characteristics, performance and reporting, equipment use, trainee participation, and quality assurance. Fifty of the 80 centres (62.5%) responded to the survey. Most settings were academic (86.0%) with 42.0% of centres performing > 350 surgical cases/year. The median number of transesophageal echocardiograms performed/cardiologist/year was 50 (26, 73). Pre-operative transesophageal echocardiography was performed in most surgical cases by 91.7% of centres. Transesophageal echocardiography was always performed by most centres following Norwood, Glenn, and Fontan procedures and by < 10% of centres following coarctation repair. Many centres with a written guideline allowed transesophageal echocardiography transducer use at weights below manufacturer recommendations (50.0 and 61.1% for neonatal and paediatric transducers, respectively). Most centres (36/37, 97.3%) with categorical fellowships had rotations which included transesophageal echocardiography participation. Large surgical centres (>350 cases/year) had higher median number of transesophageal echocardiograms/cardiologist/year (75.5 [53, 86] versus 35 [20, 52], p < 0.001) and more frequently used anaesthesia for diagnostic transesophageal echocardiography ≥ 67% of time (100.0 versus 62.1%, p = 0.001). There is significant variability in transesophageal echocardiography practice patterns and training requirements among paediatric cardiology centres in the United States and Canada.

37657785,Chargemaster Pricing Variation for Commonly Billed Procedures in Interventional Cardiology.,"A chargemaster is a database of all of the billable items offered by a hospital with their base price listings. A 2018 executive order required all American hospitals to publish their chargemasters to increase price transparency and reduce healthcare expenditures. Chargemaster listings, however, demonstrate marked variability and inconsistency and have not been associated with consumer benefit. The objective of this study was to analyze chargemasters for commonly billed interventional cardiology procedures across five diverse states to explore relationships between price listings and hospital characteristics, ownership, location, and hospital quality. Chargemasters were downloaded from hospitals in five states selected to represent the nation's healthcare diversity. Price listings for five interventional cardiology procedures (percutaneous coronary angiography, coronary angiography, single-vessel angioplasty, single-vessel stent, and percutaneous coronary intervention of acute myocardial infarction) were extracted. Statistical analyses such as the Kruskal-Wallis test were performed to explore relationships between mean chargemaster price listings for each procedure and hospital characteristics, ownership, location, and quality ratings. The median mean chargemaster price of four of the five interventional cardiology procedures significantly differed across all states. Price listings were significantly higher in urban versus rural areas and in general acute care hospitals and state government-owned facilities. The highest prices were found with the highest hospital quality rating. Chargemaster price listings for common interventional cardiology procedures varied significantly across these five states. Urban and metropolitan hospital location, hospital type, and hospital ownership could be factors driving increased chargemaster procedure prices. Prices were highest at hospitals with the highest quality rating.",Southern medical journal,2023-Sep,"Chaudhary RS, Kadesh A, Baban S, Lui A, Shi J, Ahluwalia J, White M, Giles D, Petersen TR, Block AE, Basman C, Grimes CL",12,1940,cardiology,2025-11-22
34252834,Cardiology perspective on seizure-related bradyarrhythmias and SUDEP: A survey study.,"To determine cardiologist knowledge of and experience with seizure-related bradyarrhythmias and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Autonomic changes related to acute seizures are common and can occur during the ictal or postictal period. Two concerning changes in these periods are significant bradycardia and asystole. Postictal asystole has been investigated as a potential mechanism for SUDEP. A 27-question survey delivered to cardiologists and cardiology fellows assessed demographics, personal experience, and training involving SUDEP and seizure-related bradycardia and asystole. Following IRB approval, a list of US cardiology fellowships was constructed using the AAMC public website. Surveys were distributed by email to all programs whose program director or coordinator's email was readily available on their website. They were asked to forward the survey to both cardiology fellows and practicing cardiologists. Fifty one surveys were completed: 23 from fellows and 28 from practicing cardiologists. Forty nine were from academic centers. Twenty four respondents (47%) reported being consulted for ictal bradycardia or asystole. Nine and 13 recommended treatment for ictal bradycardia or ictal asystole, respectively. Nineteen respondents (37%) reported being consulted for postictal bradycardia or asystole. Eight recommended treatment for postictal bradycardia or asystole, respectively. Treatment recommendations included medical management and/or pacemaker. None reported a substantial knowledge of SUDEP. The most common response interrogating SUDEP awareness (63%) was ""no knowledge of SUDEP"". Formal SUDEP education was not reported by any participant with only one reporting formal didactics regarding seizure-related arrhythmias. Our results suggest ictal bradyarrhythmias are less commonly known to cardiologists, with SUDEP awareness being far less. Formal education to cardiologists on these two topics could prove beneficial at the intersection of cardiology and care for patients with epilepsy.",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2021-Sep,"Farrenburg M, Rali A, Grodzinsky A, Landazuri P",4,2031,cardiology,2025-11-22

Reflecting the development of digital health over the past few years, this trend is also seen in medicine. The field of cardiovascular medicine uses a wide variety and a large amount of biosignals, so there are many situations where AI can contribute. The development of AI is in progress for all aspects of the healthcare system, including the prevention, screening, and treatment of diseases and the prediction of the prognosis. AI is expected to be used to provide specialist-level medical care, even in a situation where medical resources are scarce. However, like other medical devices, the concept and mechanism of AI must be fully understood when used; otherwise, it may be used inappropriately, resulting in detriment to the patient. Therefore, it is important to understand what we need to know as a cardiologist handling AI. This review introduces the basics and principles of AI, then shows how far the current development of AI has come, and finally gives a brief introduction of how to start the AI development for those who want to develop their own AI.",Journal of cardiology,2022-Mar,"Nakamura T, Sasano T",2,1199,cardiology,2025-11-22

37952927,A report on a survey among Portuguese Association of Interventional Cardiology associates regarding ionizing radiation protection practices in national interventional cath-labs.,"Concerns surrounding the consequences of ionizing radiation (IR) have increased in interventional cardiology (IC). Despite this, the ever-growing complexity of diseases as well as procedures can lead to greater exposure to radiation. The aim of this survey, led by Portuguese Association of Interventional Cardiology (APIC), was to evaluate the level of awareness and current practices on IR protection among its members. An online survey was emailed to all APIC members, between August and November 2021. The questionnaire consisted of 50 questions focusing on knowledge and measures of IR protection in the catheterization laboratory. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. From a response rate of 46.9%, the study obtained a total sample of 159 responses (156 selected for analysis). Most survey respondents (66.0%) were unaware of the radiation exposure category, and only 60.4% reported systematically using a dosimeter. A large majority (90.4%) employed techniques to minimize exposure to radiation. All participants used personal protective equipment, despite eyewear protection only being used frequently by 49.2% of main operators. Ceiling suspended shields and table protectors were often used. Only two-thirds were familiar with the legally established limit on radiation doses for workers or the dose that should trigger patient follow-up. Most of the survey respondents had a non-certified training in IR procedures and only 32.0% had attended their yearly occupational health consultation. Safety methods and protective equipment are largely adopted among interventional cardiologists, who have shown some IR awareness. Despite this, there is room for improvement, especially concerning the use of eyewear protection, monitoring, and certification.",Revista portuguesa de cardiologia : orgao oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia = Portuguese journal of cardiology : an official journal of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology,2024-Apr,"Costa H, Vinhas H, Calé R, Pereira E, Santos J, Paulo G, Jorge E, Brochado B, Melica B, Baptista Gonçalves R, Infante de Oliveira E",11,1775,cardiology,2025-11-22
32687882,Gastrointestinal bleeding in patients admitted to cardiology: risk factors and a new risk score.,"Although the early use of a risk stratification score in gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is recommended, so far there has been no risk score for GIB in patients admitted to the cardiology department. To describe the risk factors of GIB and develop a new risk score model in patients admitted to the cardiology department. A total of 633 inpatients with GIB from January 2014 to December 2018 were recruited, 4,231 inpatients with non-GIB were recruited as the control group. Multivariate logistic regression was used to describe the risk factors of GIB. A new risk score model was developed in the derivation cohort. Accuracy to predict GIB was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve in the validation cohort. Male, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, systolic blood pressure, hematocrit, plasma albumin, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were associated with GIB. The model had a high predictive accuracy (AUROC 0.816 and 95% CI, 0.792-0.839), which was supported by the validation cohort (AUROC 0.841 and 95% CI, 0.807~0.874). Besides, the prediction of the model was better than HAS-BLED score (AUROC 0.557; 95% CI, 0.513~0.602) and CRUSADE score (AUROC 0.791; 95%CI, 0.757~0.825), respectively. Among the inpatients with a score of 0-3, 4-7, and ≥8 points, the incidence of GIB, the proportion of inpatients requiring suspended red blood cells transfusion, length of stay, and in-hospital mortality all increased gradually (P< 0.001). Male, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, systolic blood pressure, hematocrit, plasma albumin, and ALT are associated with GIB.

The breadth of anatomic and physiologic variations, patient ages, and genetic syndromes and noncardiac comorbid conditions all represent sources of potential confounding and effect modification that are major obstacles to this goal. If not accounted for, these factors can obscure the ""true"" treatment effect and lead to spurious conclusions about the relative efficacy and/or safety of therapies. In this review, we discuss the importance of confounding and effect modification in pediatric/congenital interventional cardiology research. We define these terms and discuss strategies (both in study design and data analysis) to mitigate error introduced by confounding and effect modification.

39692330,Patient and physician exposure to X-rays at pediatric interventional cardiology - from world to Poland.,"Ionizing radiation is considered as a harmful factor to health. However, X‑rays are widely used in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures such as those performed during cardiac interventions. Their use is particularly invaluable in saving life procedures when the risk of adverse effects of radiation is relatively low compared to the consequences of non-treated or treated with other invasive methods diseases. One branch of these types of medical procedures is interventional cardiology in pediatrics due to possible higher than in adults risks of developing cancer in exposed to ionizing radiation children. On the other hand, medical staff in particular physician, may be exposed to relatively high radiation levels during their work. Parallel with enlarging workload (growing number of procedures per year), high levels of cumulative doses to most exposed, and often not protected, parts of operator's body as eye lenses and brain may be achieved. Exposure to X‑rays in pediatric interventional cardiology is a worldwide point of scientific interest from around 65 years, however assessment and simulating low level doses is still developing. In this review found data presents various trials of evaluating doses or levels of exposure to both medical staff and patient as well as methods of optimization and protection against X‑rays in pediatric cardiac interventional procedures. The issue of establishing diagnostic reference levels was also taken into consideration during analysis. Thirty papers from period 2013 to 2023 were analyzed.

39267595,Are paediatric cardiology textbooks obsolete in the current digital era?,"With the rise of online references, podcasts, webinars, self-test tools, and social media, it is worthwhile to understand whether textbooks continue to provide value in medical education, and to assess the capacity they serve during fellowship training. A prospective mixed-methods study based on surveys that were disseminated to seven paediatric cardiology fellowship programmes around the world. Participants were asked to read an assigned chapter of <i>Anderson's Pediatric Cardiology 4th Edition</i> textbook, followed by the completion of the survey. Open-ended questions included theming and grouping responses as appropriate. The survey was completed by 36 participants. When asked about the content, organisation, and utility of the chapter, responses were generally positive, at greater than 89%. The chapters, overall, were rated relatively easy to read, scoring at 6.91, with standard deviations plus or minus 1.72, on a scale from 1 to 10, with higher values meaning better results. When asked to rank their preferences in where they obtain educational content, textbooks were ranked the second highest, with in-person teaching ranking first. Several themes were identified including the limitations of the use of textbook use, their value, and ways to enhance learning from their reading. There was also a near-unanimous desire for more time to self-learn and read during fellowship. Textbooks are still highly valued by trainees. Many opportunities exist, nonetheless, to improve how they can be organised to deliver information optimally. Future efforts should look towards making them more accessible, and to include more resources for asynchronous learning.",Cardiology in the young,2024-Aug,"Kim ME, Tretter JT, Anderson RH, Spicer DE, Penny DJ, Kumar RK, McMahon CJ",7,1675,cardiology,2025-11-22

We selected 61,306 patients (30,312 women and 30,994 men) who visited the cardiology service at least once between 2010 and 2021: 69.1% (19,997 women and 20,462 men) were attended in e-consultation (from 2013 to 2021) and 30.9% (8920 women and 9136 men) in in-person consultations (from 2010 to 2012) without gender differences in the proportion of patients attended in each period. Using an interrupted time series regression model, we analysed the impact of incorporating e-consultation into the healthcare model and evaluated the elapsed time to cardiology care, heart failure (HF), cardiovascular (CV), and all-cause hospital admissions and mortality during the one-year after cardiology consultation. The introduction of e-consultation substantially decreased waiting times to cardiology care; during the in-person consultation period, the mean delay for cardiology care was 57.9 (24.8) days in men and 55.8 (22.8) days in women. During the e-consultation period, the waiting time to cardiology care was markedly reduced to 9.41 (4.02) days in men and 9.46 (4.18) in women. After e-consultation implantation, there was a significant reduction in the 1-year rate of hospital admissions and mortality, both in women and men iRR [IC 95%]: 0.95 [0.93-0.96] for HF, 0.90 [0.89-0.91] for CV and 0.70 [0.69-0.71] for all-cause hospitalization; and 0.93 [0.92-0.95] for HF, 0.86 [0.86-0.87] for CV and 0.88 [0.87-0.89] for all-cause mortality in women; and 0.91 [0.89-0.92] for HF, 0.90 [0.89-0.91] for CV and 0.72 [0.71-0.73] for all-cause hospitalization; and 0.96 [0.93-0.97] for HF, 0.87 [95% CI: 0.86-0.87] for CV and 0.87 [0.86-0.87] for all-cause mortality, in men.

39561232,Electronic Health Record Alert to Promote Adoption of Limited Transthoracic Echocardiograms in Primary Care and Cardiology Clinics: A Mixed Methods Evaluation.,"A limited transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) can be an appropriate, lower-cost substitute for a full TTE. We assessed the impact of an electronic health record alternative alert promoting the adoption of limited TTEs on the ordering practices of cardiology clinicians and primary care providers and captured their perspectives on the initiative. The alert was deployed in a cardiology clinic and 4 primary care clinics at an academic medical center. The alert provided clinical guidance on the appropriate use of limited TTEs when a clinician selected a full TTE order. We used logistic regression to estimate the change in the proportion of limited versus full TTEs ordered between the baseline and intervention periods in clinics with and without the alert. We also conducted interviews with 24 clinicians (5 cardiologists and 19 primary care providers) to identify implementation barriers and facilitators. Cardiology clinicians ordered 10 654 and 3761 TTEs during the baseline and intervention periods, respectively, for 9100 patients. Primary care providers ordered 723 and 617 TTEs during the baseline and intervention periods for 1273 patients. The model estimated that the percentage of limited TTEs ordered increased by 16.1±2.3 percentage points (<i>P</i><0.0001) in the cardiology clinic with the alert and by 13.2±1.5 percentage points (<i>P</i><0.0001) in the primary care clinics with the alert from baseline to post-intervention. Ordering practices did not change in the cardiology (0.7±0.6 percentage points; <i>P</i>=0.24) or primary care (0.7±1.0 percentage points; <i>P</i>=0.52) clinics without the alert. Clinicians viewed the alert as acceptable. Cardiologists appreciated that the alert was concise, whereas primary care providers wanted more information from the alert. An alternative alert providing clinical guidance on the use of limited TTEs at the point of care increased the selection of this lower-cost test in cardiology and primary care clinics. Perspectives on the alert differed between specialists and nonspecialists, highlighting the importance of tailoring intervention design to clinical expertise.",Circulation.

We describe temporal changes in triage of HF patients with preserved, mildly reduced, and reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF, HFmrEF, and HFrEF) hospitalized for AHF to cardiology versus noncardiology wards in Sweden. We analyzed temporal changes in ward type for AHF for HFrEF versus HFmrEF versus HFpEF between 2000 and 2016. Among 37 918 patients with AHF, 19 777 (52%) had HFrEF, 7712 (20%) had HFmrEF, and 10 429 (28%) had HFpEF. Overall, 19 646 (52%) were hospitalized in cardiology and 18 272 (48%) in noncardiology. The proportions hospitalized in noncardiology in 2000 to 2004 versus in 2013 to 2016 were for HFrEF: 45 versus 47%, for HFmrEF: 52 versus 56%, and for HFpEF: 46 versus 64%, respectively. The overall proportion of HFrEF in 2000 to 2004 versus in 2013 to 2016 decreased (60% versus 49%) especially in noncardiology (58% versus 41%), whereas the overall proportion of HFpEF increased (20% versus 30%) especially in noncardiology (21% versus 37%). The average age and prevalence of comorbidities also increased over time, with older patients with multiple comorbidities being more frequently admitted to noncardiology wards. Over time, AHF hospitalization for HFpEF occurred increasingly in noncardiology, whereas for HFrEF and HFmrEF the proportions of patients treated in cardiology versus noncardiology were substantially unchanged over time. This may have implications for implementation of emerging HFpEF therapy.",Circulation. Heart failure,2022-Aug,"Canepa M, Kapelios CJ, Benson L, Savarese G, Lund LH",5,1542,cardiology,2025-11-22
39242188,"Health, burnout and well-being of UK cardiology trainees: insights from the British Junior Cardiologists' Association Survey.","Cardiology training is demanding and associated with high workloads. Poor lifestyle and health among clinicians may stretch workforces and impact patient care. It has not been established what impact training in cardiology has on the doctors undertaking it. We aimed to establish the prevalence of physical and mental illness, burnout and the ability to maintain a healthy lifestyle among cardiology trainees in the United Kingdom (UK). The 2023 British Junior Cardiologists' Association training survey included questions on ill health, burnout, healthy living and invited responders to complete screening questionnaires for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire 9; PHQ-9) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7; GAD-7). Significant anxiety and depression were defined as scoring within the moderate or severe range (PHQ-9≥10; GAD-7≥10). Burnout was a self-reported outcome. Poisson regression was used to determine prevalence ratios (PR) between univariate predictors of anxiety, depression and burnout. Of 398 responders, 212 consented to answer health and well-being questions. Prior physical and mental health conditions were reported by 9% and 7% of trainees, respectively. Significant depression and anxiety symptoms were reported by 25% and 18% of trainees, respectively. Burnout was reported by 76% of trainees. Less than full-time trainees reported greater anxiety (PR 2.92, 95% CI 1.39 to 6.16, p<0.01) and depression (PR 3.66, 95% CI 2.24 to 5.98, p<0.01), while trainees with dependents reported less burnout (PR 0.77, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.92, p<0.01). Exercise, good sleep quality and maintaining a healthy diet were associated with less burnout and depressive symptoms (p<0.05). Half of trainees reported training having a negative impact on well-being, driven by the amount of service provision, curriculum requirements and lack of training opportunities. The prevalence of anxiety, depression and burnout is high among UK cardiology trainees. Further work should establish the impact of cardiology trainee health on the quality of patient care. Training bodies should consider how occupational factors may contribute to health.",Heart (British Cardiac Society),2024-Oct,"Jenner WJ, Brown OI, Moore A, Gilpin T, Morgan H, Bowater S, Braganza D, Camm CF",8,2148,cardiology,2025-11-22
37966519,Efficacy of a Longitudinal Project-Based Quality Improvement Curriculum in Pediatric Cardiology Fellowship.,"Quality improvement knowledge is a requirement of fellowship training. Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of a 3-year quality improvement and patient safety (QI/PS) curriculum that gives fellows both didactic knowledge and first-hand experience with improvement science, and meets Clinical Learning Environment Review (CLER) requirements. Knowledge assessment is obtained through pre- and post-surveys. A secondary measure of success is academic products resulting from fellows' QI/PS work, and future participation in QI/PS efforts. Since 2019, 51 pre-tests and 36 post-tests were completed, showing improvement across all competencies. Fellows have produced one published manuscript, two poster presentations, and two oral presentations describing their improvement work. Additionally, mentoring faculty members have gone on to lead other QI work throughout the division. This longitudinal QI/PS curriculum provides both knowledge and experience in QI/PS work. It also creates opportunities for academic publications and presentations, builds faculty expertise, and most importantly, works to improve multiple aspects of patient care. This curriculum can serve as a model for other cardiology fellowships working to meet CLER requirements.",Pediatric cardiology,2025-Jan,"Bird CM, Kaushal S, Trivedi MK, Moore JA, Sheth SS",5,1244,cardiology,2025-11-22

This review focuses on recent advancements in applying machine learning (ML) in ECG and echocardiography and potential synergistic ML integration of ECG and echocardiography. ML algorithms have been used in ECG for technical quality assurance, arrhythmia identification, and prognostic predictions, and in echocardiography to recognize image views, quantify measurements, and identify pathologic patterns. Synergistic application of ML in ECG and echocardiograph has demonstrated the potential to optimize therapeutic response, improve risk stratification, and generate new disease classification. There is mounting evidence that ML potentially outperforms in disease diagnoses and outcome prediction with ECG and echocardiography when compared with trained healthcare professionals. The applications of ML in ECG and echocardiography are playing increasingly greater roles in medical research and clinical practice, particularly for their contributions to developing novel diagnostic/prognostic prediction models.

33580774,Current status and needs for changes in critical care training: the voice of the young cardiologists.,"The implementation of the 2013 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Core Curriculum guidelines for acute cardiovascular care (acc) training among European countries is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the current status of acc training among cardiology trainees and young cardiologists (<40 years) from ESC countries. The survey (March-July 2019) asked about details of cardiology training, self-confidence in acc technical and non-technical skills, access to training opportunities, and needs for further training in the field. Overall 614 young doctors, 31 (26-43) years old, 55% males were surveyed. Place and duration of acc training differed between countries and between centres in the same country. Although the majority of the respondents (91%) had completed their acc training, the average self-confidence to perform invasive procedures and to manage acc clinical scenarios was low-44% (27.3-70.4). The opportunities for simulation-based learning were scarce-18% (5.8-51.3), as it was previous leadership training (32%) and knowledge about key teamwork principles was poor (48%). The need for further acc training was high-81% (61.9-94.3). Male gender, higher level of training centres, professional qualifications of respondents, longer duration of acc/intensive care training, debriefings, and previous leadership training as well as knowledge about teamwork were related to higher self-confidence in all investigated aspects. The current cardiology training program is burdened by deficits in acc technical/non-technical skills, substantial variability in programs across ESC countries, and a clear gender-related disparity in outcomes.

33268053,The Impact of Cardiology Consultation on Medical Intensive Care Unit Patients with Elevated Troponin Levels.,"Cardiac troponin (cTn) is mainly used to diagnose acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, cTn can also be elevated in critically ill patients secondary to demand ischemia or myocardial injury. The impact of cardiology consultation on the clinical outcomes of patients admitted to medical intensive care unit (ICU) with elevated cTn is unclear. A retrospective analysis of medical ICU patients with elevated cTn without evidence of ACS between January 2013 through December 2018. Patients were stratified based on documentation of cardiology consultation. The primary outcome was 1-year mortality. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital and 30-day mortality, the length of stay (LOS), further cardiac testing, 30-day readmission rate, new prescription of cardiac medications, and the predictors of a cardiology consultation. Of 846 patients screened, 766 patients were included, of whom 63.2% had cardiology consultation. Cardiology consultation group had longer median LOS (7 vs. 5 days, P = 0.007), additional cardiac testing (90.3% vs. 67.7%, P < 0.001), and more new cardiac medications (52.1% vs. 16.3%, P < 0.001). No difference was noted in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.6, 95% CI, 0.4-1.1, P = .117), 30-day mortality (aOR = 0.8, 95% CI, 0.5-1.4, P = .425), 1- year mortality (aOR, 1.4, 95% CI, 0.9-2.2, P = .193), or cardiac-specific 30-day readmission rate (aOR, 7.0, 95% CI, 0.7-14.9, P = .137). History of coronary artery disease (CAD) was the most independent predictor for a cardiology consult (aOR, 2.2, 95% CI, 1.3-3.8, P < .001).

37272324,Practical approach to referral from primary health care to a cardiology hospital consultation in 2022.,"In Portugal, up to 38% of the population has cardiovascular disease, which highlights the importance of primary health care (PHC) in its management. Adequate management of people with cardiovascular disease often requires hospital referral for a cardiology consultation. However, it is not always easy to ascertain which situations should be referred, especially given that PHC does not have access to all diagnostic exams recommended by international guidelines, such as natriuretic peptides in heart failure or computed tomography coronary angiogram in chronic coronary syndromes, among others. The aim of this document is to describe a practical approach to the most frequent heart diseases that may require a referral for a hospital cardiology consultation. Thus, in the different chapters, the recommendations for referral are highlighted generically according to group of disease, as well as, albeit briefly, the initial clinical approach within the scope of PHC for a differential diagnosis and more efficient follow-up. A modified Metaplan methodology was used. A panel of 4 cardiology specialists and 3 specialists in General and Family Medicine developed this document, which should not be taken as an official guideline, but as additional guidance for the correct referral of patients. It is therefore advisable to validate these recommendations locally with the referral hospital, as well as to be aware of the respective international and national guidelines.",Revista portuguesa de cardiologia : orgao oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia = Portuguese journal of cardiology : an official journal of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology,2023-Jun,"Baptista R, Maricoto T, Monteiro S, Dias J, Gonçalves S, Febra H, Gil V",7,1472,cardiology,2025-11-22
34170086,Late phase of COVID-19 pandemic in General Cardiology. A position paper of the ESC Council for Cardiology Practice.,"Cardiovascular (CV) engagement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a huge determinant of prognosis during the acute phase of the disease. However, little is known about the potential chronic implications of the late phase of COVID-19 and about the appropriate approach to these patients. Heart failure, type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, myocarditis, pulmonary fibrosis, and thrombosis have been shown to be related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and a 'long COVID-19' illness has been recognized with fatigue, chest pain, and dyspnoea among the most frequent symptoms reported after discharge from hospital. This paper focuses on some open questions that cardiologists are going to face during the next months in a general cardiology outpatient clinic, in particular how to evaluate a 'post-COVID' patient during follow-up of CV complications of the acute phase and how to manage new CV symptoms that could be the consequence, at least in part, of heart/vessels and/or lung involvement of the previous virus infection. Present symptoms and signs, history of previous CV disease (both preceding COVID-19 and occurring during viral infection), and specific laboratory and imaging measurements during the acute phase may be of interest in focusing on how to approach the clinical evaluation of a post-COVID patient and how to integrate in our standard of care the new information on COVID-19, possibly in a multidisciplinary view.

Recent technical advances such as radial access, third generation drug-eluting stents and highly effective antiplatelet therapy have substantially improved the safety profile of coronary procedures. Despite several practice guidelines and a clear patient preference of early hospital discharge, the percentage of coronary procedures performed in an outpatient setting in Austria remains low, mostly due to safety concerns. The aim of this consensus statement is to provide a practical framework for the safe and effective implementation of coronary outpatient clinics in Austria. Based on a structured literature review and an in-depth analysis of available practice guidelines a consensus statement was developed and peer-reviewed within the working group of interventional cardiology (AGIK) of the Austrian Society of Cardiology. Based on the available literature same-day discharge coronary procedures show a favorable safety profile with no increase in the risk of major adverse events compared to an overnight stay. This document provides a detailed consensus in various clinical settings.

35227341,Paediatric and adult congenital cardiology education and training in Europe.,"Limited data exist on training of European paediatric and adult congenital cardiologists. A structured and approved questionnaire was circulated to national delegates of Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology in 33 European countries. Delegates from 30 countries (91%) responded. Paediatric cardiology was not recognised as a distinct speciality by the respective ministry of Health in seven countries (23%). Twenty countries (67%) have formally accredited paediatric cardiology training programmes, seven (23%) have substantial informal (not accredited or certified) training, and three (10%) have very limited or no programme. Twenty-two countries have a curriculum. Twelve countries have a national training director. There was one paediatric cardiology centre per 2.66 million population (range 0.87-9.64 million), one cardiac surgical centre per 4.73 million population (range 1.63-10.72 million), and one training centre per 4.29 million population (range 1.63-10.72 million population). The median number of paediatric cardiology fellows per training programme was 4 (range 1-17), and duration of training was 3 years (range 2-5 years). An exit examination in paediatric cardiology was conducted in 16 countries (53%) and certification provided by 20 countries (67%). Paediatric cardiologist number is affected by gross domestic product (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.41). Training varies markedly across European countries.

33140984,Clinical effectiveness of a cardiology outpatient management plan to reduce inefficiency in consultations.,"<b>Objectives</b>: Longer delays in carrying out complementary tests in cardiology services have resulted in patients arriving for consultation without these tests being performed (inefficient consultations). To ameliorate this situation, a management-based intervention was designed, optimizing the available resources and modifying the appointment system. Therefore, our objective was to determine the effectiveness of this intervention to reduce the number of inefficient consultations and improve the clinical care process.<b>Methods</b>: A non-randomized experimental study comparing two periods (pre- and post-intervention) was designed, analyzing a total of 473 outpatients attending cardiology consultations in a Spanish region in February 2014 (pre-intervention) and 441 patients attending cardiology consultations in November 2014 (post-intervention). The outcome of management measures aimed at optimizing coordination in outpatient care to reduce inefficient consultations was analyzed. After the visit, treatment modifications, requests for new examinations or tests, outpatient discharges, and new diagnoses were evaluated.<b>Results</b>: In the pre-intervention period, 37.2% of the patients had not had the tests performed, while in the post-intervention period, this figure dropped to 10.7% (p < 0.001). When the patients had all the tests completed, there was an increase in the number of new examinations (p < 0.001), outpatient discharges (p < 0.001) and new diagnoses (p = 0.004).

38145820,Chronic hypertension diagnosed by the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology criteria is associated with increased risk of developing hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.,"ACOG uses a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥140 or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 documented at <20 weeks of gestation to define chronic hypertension. In the nonpregnant state, the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) define chronic hypertension using lower diagnostic thresholds of SBP ≥130 or DBP ≥80. It remains unclear whether using more conservative guidelines in pregnancy improves identification of those at risk for gestational hypertension (GHTN) or preeclampsia (PRE). We sought to investigate whether subjects with chronic hypertension based on the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology criteria had an increased risk for gestational hypertension and preeclampsia than those without chronic hypertension. We conducted a retrospective cohort study utilizing a clinical database at a diverse, large urban, safety-net hospital. Subjects aged 18 to 40 years with singleton gestations and first trimester prenatal care were included. We defined subjects that met the criteria for stage 1 chronic hypertension based on first trimester systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure cutoffs satisfying the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology criteria (systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥80 mm Hg). Those who did not meet these criteria had a systolic blood pressure <130 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg. We did not include those with chronic hypertension based on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists criteria in this cohort (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg at <20 weeks); therefore, those who met the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology criteria solely consisted of subjects with systolic blood pressure of 130 to 139 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 80 of 89 mm Hg. By doing this, we were able to specifically investigate the increased risk for this specific population, which remains unclear. Diagnoses of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia were based on the established American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists criteria. Preeclampsia included those with and without severe features. Tests for normality were performed. Student t-tests or rank sum tests were performed as appropriate for continuous variables; chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were performed for categorical variables. Generalized linear models were performed to calculate risk ratios while controlling for appropriate confounders. Of N=3354 subjects, 18% (n=629) were diagnosed with stage 1 chronic hypertension based on American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology criteria. Those with American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology stage 1 chronic hypertension had increased rates of gestational hypertension (35.4% vs 20%; P<.001) and preeclampsia (22.3% vs 10%; P<.001) than those without Stage 1 chronic hypertension based on these criteria. When controlling for maternal age, race, first trimester body mass index, pregestational diabetes, and substance use, those with the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology stage 1 chronic hypertension had an almost 1.5-fold higher adjusted risk ratio of experiencing gestational hypertension (adjusted risk ratio, 1.49±0.10; P<.001) and almost 2-fold increased adjusted risk ratio of experiencing preeclampsia (adjusted risk ratio, 1.98±0.19; P<.001). Our data suggest an increased risk for developing gestational hypertension and preeclampsia for subjects satisfying the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology cutoff for stage 1 chronic hypertension. Future studies need to consider whether diagnosis of chronic hypertension in pregnancy should conform with American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology criteria, and if those with stage 1 chronic hypertension based on American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology criteria require the same preventative measures and interventions utilized by those diagnosed by American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists criteria.",American journal of obstetrics & gynecology MFM,2024-Mar,"Advani R, Chandrasekaran S",2,4161,cardiology,2025-11-22

38395022,Discriminatory and valuing communication behaviors in cardiology encounters.,"Many have found racial differences in clinician-patient communication using validated codebooks that represent effective communication. No codebooks used for examining racial differences, however, have included patient input. In this paper, we describe creating codebook with Black patient advocates to determine if we could reliably code discriminatory/valuing communication and assess racial differences in these behaviors. We created a codebook for discriminatory/valuing communication behaviors with the input of Black patient advocates. We used the codebook to analyze data from 101 audio recorded encounters between White cardiologists and Black and White patients. We examined the differences in the prevalence of behaviors in cardiology encounters. In comparison to White patients, cardiologists made fewer tailoring statements to their Black patients (68% vs. 49%, p = 0.07). Coders found 4 instances of stereotyping behaviors and only Black patients (p = 0.12). We found no significant associations between any of the other outcomes and patient race.

37253631,"Joint British Societies' position statement on bullying, harassment and discrimination in cardiology.","Inappropriate behaviour is an umbrella term including discrimination, harassment and bullying. This includes both actions and language and can affect any member of the cardiovascular workforce/team. Evidence has suggested that such behaviour is regularly experienced within UK cardiology departments, where inappropriate behaviour may represent longstanding cultural and practice issues within the unit. Inappropriate behaviour has negative effects on the workforce community as a whole, including impacts on recruitment and retention of staff and patient care. While only some members of the cardiology team may be directly impacted by inappropriate behaviour in individual departments, a wider group are significantly impacted as bystanders. As such, improving the culture and professional behaviours within UK cardiology departments is of paramount importance. As a negative workplace culture is felt to be a major driver of inappropriate behaviour, all members of the cardiovascular team have a role to play in ensuring a positive workplace culture is developed. Episodes of inappropriate behaviour should be challenged by cardiovascular team members. Informal feedback may be appropriate where 'one-off' episodes of inappropriate behaviour occur, but serious events or repeated behaviour should be escalated following formal human resources protocols.",Heart (British Cardiac Society),2023-Jul,"Camm CF, Joshi A, Eftekhari H, O'Flynn R, Dobson R, Curzen N, Lloyd G, Greenwood JP, Allen C",9,1356,cardiology,2025-11-22

36921654,Role of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Interventional Cardiology.,"Directed by 2 decades of technological processes and remodeling, the dynamic quality of healthcare data combined with the progress of computational power has allowed for rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI). In interventional cardiology, artificial intelligence has shown potential in providing data interpretation and automated analysis from electrocardiogram, echocardiography, computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and electronic patient data. Clinical decision support has the potential to assist in improving patient safety and making prognostic and diagnostic conjectures in interventional cardiology procedures. Robot-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention, along with functional and quantitative assessment of coronary artery ischemia and plaque burden on intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), are the major applications of AI. Machine learning algorithms are used in these applications, and they have the potential to bring a paradigm shift in intervention. Recently, an efficient branch of machine learning has emerged as a deep learning algorithm for numerous cardiovascular applications. However, the impact deep learning on the future of cardiology practice is not clear. Predictive models based on deep learning have several limitations including low generalizability and decision processing in cardiac anatomy.",Current problems in cardiology,2023-Jul,"Subhan S, Malik J, Haq AU, Qadeer MS, Zaidi SMJ, Orooj F, Zaman H, Mehmoodi A, Majeedi U",9,1358,cardiology,2025-11-22
38421905,Team-Based Care Model Improves Timely Access to Care and Patient Satisfaction in General Cardiology.,"Appointment wait times have increased nationally since 2014, especially in cardiology. At a mid-Atlantic academic medical center, access to care in the general cardiology clinic was below national standards, which can negatively affect patient outcomes and satisfaction. Adopting a team-based care (TBC) model, advanced practice providers (APPs) were added to care teams with general cardiologists to provide timely outpatient management of cardiac conditions. This aimed to increase access to care and, consequently, patient satisfaction. A formative program evaluation using the Agency for Clinical Innovation framework assessed TBC's impact on these outcomes. Access to care and patient satisfaction measures for TBC and nonteam providers were compared with one another and national benchmarks. Nine months after implementation, the average time to new patient appointment for TBC providers was 31 days (47% decrease) and for nonteam providers was 41 days (20% decrease). TBC had a higher percentage of new patient appointments within 14 days than nonteam providers (39% and 20%, respectively). Patient satisfaction improved to the 98th percentile nationally for TBC but decreased to the 71st percentile for nonteam. These findings suggest that a TBC model using APPs can improve access to care and patient satisfaction in the outpatient general cardiology setting.",Journal for healthcare quality : official publication of the National Association for Healthcare Quality,,"Sharpe CM, Eastham L",2,1368,cardiology,2025-11-22
35221077,Electrophysiology and Interventional Cardiology Procedure Volumes During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has imposed an unprecedented health care crisis across the globe. Health care efforts across the world have been diverted to tackling the pandemic since early 2020. Hospitals and health care systems have undertaken major restructuring in an effort to deliver health care to an increasing number of patients affected by COVID-19. Although great focus has been placed on treating those individuals suffering from COVID-19, clinicians must simultaneously balance caring for patients who are not actively infected. In anticipation of an exponential increase in COVID-19 cases, health care systems developed strategies to channel available resources to meet the rapidly rising demands of COVID-19. This change was noticed significantly in the field of invasive cardiology as well. Many cardiac catheterization and electrophysiology (EP) laboratories canceled elective procedures to limit the burden on hospital resources and preserve personal protective equipment (PPE). Major societies published guidance statements delineating patient selection for procedures during the exponential phase of the pandemic growth. Patient care was triaged and those waiting for elective procedures were managed with expectant care or noninvasive approaches to preserve hospital resources and personnel. In the current article, we review the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its response to the volume of interventional cardiology (IC) and EP procedures across the world.",Cardiac electrophysiology clinics,2022-Mar,"Pothineni NVK, Santangeli P",2,1578,cardiology,2025-11-22

Despite this, dissemination into widespread routine clinical practice has been slow, largely restricted to large academic centers and urban settings. The reasons of this are multifactorial, but one of the most impactful of these reasons is undeniably reimbursement. Currently, there is marked discrepancy between the costs of performing cardiac CT and the renumeration provided for this. Until this is addressed, cardiac CT will not reach its potential for the benefit of patients. It is for this reason that the SCCT continues to dedicate significant efforts to represent the need of the cardiology and radiology communities in bringing about changes in policy and billing. Significant momentum has been gained in recent years with the engagement of both congress and Medicare in moving towards a system of payment that recognizes the time and expertise required to acquire high quality cardiac CT.

The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology released a set of guidelines that advise the type and level of sports participation based primarily on anatomical defects with secondary consideration given to hemodynamic effects. Recently, the European Association of Preventive Cardiology/European Society of Cardiology/Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology offered a contrasting approach to sports participation that is based on hemodynamic and electrophysiological profiles of each patient, regardless of anatomical consideration. These guidelines are drastically different in their approaches but do have some similarities. In this review, we compare both documents, focusing on the aim, population, classification of sports, and the methodology of making recommendations. This review aims to assist practicing cardiologists in integrating the available published data and recommendations when counseling patients for sports participation.",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2024-Feb,"Shibbani K, Abdulkarim A, Budts W, Roos-Hesselink J, Müller J, Shafer K, Porayette P, Zaidi A, Kreutzer J, Alsaied T",10,1067,cardiology,2025-11-22
35974225,Cardiology co-management of rheumatoid arthritis patients with coronary artery disease as an intervention reduces hospitalization rates and adverse event occurrence.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease with important cardiovascular (CV) implications. CV disease represents over half of RA patient deaths and causes significant morbidity. CV manifestations in RA can be complex, raising concerns for adequate patient management and provider-dependent roles. This is a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with RA and coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients were identified and filtered via EPIC Database search engine. Parameters were set from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2020. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients who met diagnostic criteria for both RA and CAD. A total of 399 patients met criteria. Of the 399 identified patients, 272 were female (68.2%) and 127 were male (31.8%) with a median age of 73 (range 26-98). The population was further divided into two groups: those with established cardiology care versus those without. Patients without cardiology follow-up experienced significantly more hospitalizations (RR 1.63 95% CI 1.12, 2.38), higher rates of adverse events including myocardial infarction (MI) (RR 4.82 95% CI 1.94, 11.98), heart failure (HF) (OR 15.81 95% CI 3.54, 70.52), and stroke (RR 2.55 95% CI 1.29, 5.03). Patients not followed by cardiology also had numerical increases in CV death (4 deaths compared to none in those with cardiology follow) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.03 95% CI 0.63, 1.67). Patients with regular cardiology follow-up demonstrated fewer cardiac-related adverse events. This suggests that co-management may have a role in adverse cardiac event risk reduction and should therefore be an early consideration. Key Points • Rheumatoid arthritis patients demonstrate higher rates of coronary disease compared to the general population. Traditional cardiac risk factors may not be entirely responsible for this phenomenon • Hospitalization rates and adverse event occurrence are significantly higher in patients with single-provider care (rheumatology only) compared to dual provider care (rheumatology and cardiology) • Cardiology co-management should be an early consideration in the management of RA patients • Early screening, risk stratification of coronary disease, and utilization of appropriate treatment algorithms are important to decrease morbidity and mortality.",Clinical rheumatology,2022-Dec,"Guerra JD, De Santiago AB, Reed S, Hammonds KP, Shaver C, Widmer RJ, Scholz BA",7,2291,cardiology,2025-11-22
37138526,Initiative to increase family presence and participation in daily rounds on a paediatric acute care cardiology unit.,"Family-centred rounds benefit families and clinicians and improve outcomes in general paediatrics, but are understudied in subspecialty settings. We sought to improve family presence and participation in rounds in a paediatric acute care cardiology unit. We created operational definitions for family presence, our process measure, and participation, our outcome measure, and gathered baseline data over 4 months of 2021. Our SMART aim was to increase mean family presence from 43 to 75% and mean family participation from 81 to 90% by 30 May, 2022. We tested interventions with iterative plan-do-study-act cycles between 6 January, 2022 and 20 May, 2022, including provider education, calling families not at bedside, and adjustment to rounding presentations. We visualised change over time relative to interventions with statistical control charts. We conducted a high census days subanalysis. Length of stay and time of transfer from the ICU served as balancing measures. Mean presence increased from 43 to 83%, demonstrating special cause variation twice. Mean participation increased from 81 to 96%, demonstrating special cause variation once. Mean presence and participation were lower during high census (61 and 93% at project end) but improved with special cause variation. Length of stay and time of transfer remained stable. Through our interventions, family presence and participation in rounds improved without apparent unintended consequences. Family presence and participation may improve family and staff experience and outcomes; future research is warranted to evaluate this. Development of high level of reliability interventions may further improve family presence and participation, particularly on high census days.",Cardiology in the young,2024-Jan,"Gal DB, Pater CM, McGinty M, Lobes G, Tuemler C, Eldridge PM, Frakes B, Marcuccio E, Hanke SP, Gaies MG",10,1735,cardiology,2025-11-22

We aimed to determine the frequency of IDU and multiple drug use in elderly patients in the cardiology outpatient clinic. : In this prospective, cross-sectional study, a total of 513 patients aged 65 years and above who were admitted to the Cardiology Policlinic between December 2017 and January 2018 were included. To determine the prevalence of IDU, we investigated the suitability of the drugs used by the patients (according to the criteria of Beers 2015 and Screening Tool of Older People's Prescriptions [STOPP] version 2), the number of violated criteria in both the guidelines and which criterion was violated by the inappropriate drugs. : The 513 patients (mean age: 73.18 ± 5.99) in this study included females (n = 235; 45.8%) and males (n = 278; 54.2%). A total of 2,910 drugs were used by the 513 patients (mean per patient: 5.67 ± 2.51); 52.8% of the patients were using more than five drugs. The Beers criteria revealed that 304 IDUs were detected among the drugs and showed that 38.6% (n = 198) of the patients had IDU. According to the STOPP criteria, 366 IDUs were identified among the drugs used, and 45.6% (n = 234) of the patients had IDU. IDU frequencies of the elderly patients are similar to the world literature in our study. As the number of chronic illnesses the patients had increases, the frequency of IDU increases according to Beers and STOPP criteria in our study.",Nigerian journal of clinical practice,2021-Nov,"Sari YE, Unluoglu I, Cavusoglu Y, Bilge U",4,1525,cardiology,2025-11-22

In this review, we aimed to compare recommendations suggested by these guidelines highlighting the differences and latest evidence mentioned in each of the guidelines. While the staging of HF depends on left ventricular ejection fraction, the Universal Definition of HF, suggested in 2021, is described in 2022 ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines. Both guidelines recommend invasive and non-invasive tests to diagnose. Despite being identical in the backbone, some differences exist in medical therapy and devices, which can be partially attributed to the recent trials published that are presented in the American guidelines. The recommendation of implantable cardioverter defibrillator for prevention in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients, made by ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines, is among the bold differences. It seems that ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines emphasize the quality of life, cost-effectiveness, and optimization of care given to patients. On the other hand, the ESC guidelines provide recommendations for certain comorbidities. This comparison can guide clinicians in choosing the proper approach for their own settings and the writing committees in addressing the differences in order to have better consistency in future guidelines.",ESC heart failure,2023-Jun,"Behnoush AH, Khalaji A, Naderi N, Ashraf H, von Haehling S",5,1493,cardiology,2025-11-22
37212751,Profiles of patients referred to specialized palliative care from the cardiology department at a university hospital: an 11-year longitudinal retrospective study.,"Although the majority of patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have a significant symptom burden and progressive course towards the end of life, only a small proportion of patients currently receive palliative care. The current referral practices to palliative care from the cardiology department need to be scrutinized. The current study aimed to examine: 1) the clinical profile; 2) time between referral to palliative care and death; and 3) place of death for CVD patients who were referred to palliative care from a cardiology department. This retrospective descriptive study included all patients who were referred to the mobile palliative care team from the cardiology unit in the University Hospital of Besançon in France between January 2010 and December 2020. Information was extracted from the medical hospital files. A total of 142 patients were included, of whom 135 (95%) died. The mean age at the time of death was 76±14 years. The median time between referral to palliative care and death was 9 days. Most patients had chronic heart failure (54%). A total of 17 patients (13%) died at home. This study showed that referral of patients to palliative care from the cardiology department is suboptimal and a large proportion of patients die in the hospital setting. Further prospective studies are warranted to investigate whether these dispositions correspond to patients' wishes and end-of-life care needs, and should investigate how the integration of palliative care into the care of cardiovascular patients can be improved.",Panminerva medica,2023-Dec,"Giffard M, VAN Bulck L, Seydou Sall F, Becoulet N, Quenot JP, Seronde MF, Ecarnot F",7,1546,cardiology,2025-11-22

We examined the impact of POCUS performed by consulting cardiologist (CC) during initial cardiology consult on clinical management and downstream testing. Sixty-nine study patients (pts) seen in a general cardiology outpatient clinic of a tertiary center by an expert imaging CC were compared to a control group of 65 pts seen by three different CCs without POCUS during the same time-period, in whom the first standard echo (SE) was performed after the initial visit. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups for age, cardiac risk factors, and referral diagnoses. Echo findings on POCUS and by SE (mean delay of 17.2 days after visit) in the control group were comparable for RV size and function and for valvular heart disease. More patients with lower LVEF, higher LV filling pressures, new regional wall motion abnormalities, and increased aortic root size were present among POCUS group resulting in greater yield of echo abnormalities. There were more cardiovascular medication changes at the first visit (15.3% vs. 5.7%, p < .01), less referral for noninvasive stress testing (10% vs. 29%, p < .01), more advanced cardiac testing and subspecialty referrals (29% vs. 18% pts, p = .06), in the study compared to the control group after cardiology visit. POCUS at time of consultation detects more abnormal echo findings, results in more medication adjustments, less referral for noninvasive stress testing, earlier referral for advanced cardiac diagnostic imaging, and subspecialty cardiac referrals.","Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)",2023-Jun,"Aladham R, Liu S, Naqvi TZ",3,1625,cardiology,2025-11-22

The purpose of this systematic review is to provide an understanding of NLP, review how it has been used to date within cardiology and illustrate the opportunities that this approach provides for both research and clinical care. We systematically searched six scholarly databases (ACM Digital Library, Arxiv, Embase, IEEE Explore, PubMed and Scopus) for studies published in 2015-2020 describing the development or application of NLP methods for clinical text focused on cardiac disease. Studies not published in English, lacking a description of NLP methods, non-cardiac focused and duplicates were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted general study information, clinical details and NLP details and appraised quality using a checklist of quality indicators for NLP studies. We identified 37 studies developing and applying NLP in heart failure, imaging, coronary artery disease, electrophysiology, general cardiology and valvular heart disease. Most studies used NLP to identify patients with a specific diagnosis and extract disease severity using rule-based NLP methods. Some used NLP algorithms to predict clinical outcomes. A major limitation is the inability to aggregate findings across studies due to vastly different NLP methods, evaluation and reporting. This review reveals numerous opportunities for future NLP work in cardiology with more diverse patient samples, cardiac diseases, datasets, methods and applications.",Heart (British Cardiac Society),2022-May,"Reading Turchioe M, Volodarskiy A, Pathak J, Wright DN, Tcheng JE, Slotwiner D",6,1730,cardiology,2025-11-22

Pediatric subspecialty fellows believe MH should be within their scope of practice, but few feel confident in their ability to appropriately screen, evaluate, manage, and make treatment referrals for youth with CHD and concurrent MH concerns. A 6-session, didactic-based curriculum was designed by an interprofessional team of experts. It was administered to pediatric cardiology fellows over 9 months during two academic years. Topics included the following: Introduction to MH and CHD, MH Screening and Clinic-Based Interventions, Psychopharmacology, Delirium, Trauma-Informed Care, and Adult CHD and Transitional Care. An investigator-designed survey was developed to assess fellow comfort with MH knowledge, screening, and treatment recommendation domains. Twenty-three fellows participated with 14 completing the pre-post survey (58% participation, 11/17 in year 1, 3/6 in year 2). Most participants were in their first year of training (9/14, 57%). Overall, fellow comfort with MH topics increased significantly (mean score 2.89 ± 0.46 vs. 3.4 ± 0.4, p = 0.0005), with improved comfort in the MH knowledge (p = 0.003) and treatment recommendation domains (p = 0.001). A didactic-based MH curriculum improves the comfort of pediatric cardiology fellows to address the MH concerns of their patients.

36214200,Drivers of variation in telemedicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic: The experience of a large academic cardiovascular practice.,"COVID-19 spurred rapid adoption and expansion of telemedicine. We investigated the factors driving visit modality (telemedicine vs. in-person) for outpatient visits at a large cardiovascular center. We used electronic health record data from March 2020 to February 2021 from four cardiology subspecialties (general cardiology, electrophysiology, heart failure, and interventional cardiology) at a large academic health system in Northern California. There were 21,912 new and return visits with 69% delivered by telemedicine. We used hierarchical logistic regression and cross-validation methods to estimate the variation in visit modality explained by patient, clinician, and visit factors as measured by the mean area under the curve. Across all subspecialties, the clinician seen was the strongest predictor of telemedicine usage, while primary visit diagnosis was the next most predictive. In general cardiology, the model based on clinician seen had a mean area under the curve of 0.83, the model based on the primary diagnosis had a mean area under the curve of 0.69, and the model based on all patient characteristics combined had a mean area under the curve of 0.56. There was significant variation in telemedicine use across clinicians within each subspecialty, even for visits with the same primary visit diagnosis. Individual clinician practice patterns had the largest influence on visit modality across subspecialties in a large cardiovascular medicine practice, while primary diagnosis was less predictive, and patient characteristics even less so. Cardiovascular clinics should reduce variability in visit modality selection through standardized processes that integrate clinical factors and patient preference.",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,2024-Aug,"Koos H, Parameswaran V, Claire S, Chen C, Kalwani N, Osmanlliu E, Qureshi L, Dash R, Scheinker D, Rodriguez F",10,1726,cardiology,2025-11-22

We performed an analysis of data in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome from the National Pediatric Cardiology Quality Improvement Collaborative registry. The prevalence of congenital anomalies of the airway or lung in the registry was determined. Clinical characteristics and midterm outcomes were compared between infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome with and without anomalies of the airway or lung. Fifty-seven (2.3%) of 2467 infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome enrolled in the registry had congenital airway or lung anomalies. Infants congenital anomalies of the airway or lung had significantly lower transplant-free survival at 1 year (49.5 vs 77.2%, p < 0.001). Infants with airway or lung anomalies had longer combined hospital length of stay for stage 1 and stage 2 palliation (102 vs 65.1 days, p < 0.001) and underwent more major procedures (2.04 vs 0.93 procedures, p < 0.001) than those without. There was no difference in the number of interstage readmissions (1.85 vs 1.89, p = 0.87) or need for non-oral feeding supplementation (71.4 vs 54.5%, p = 0.12) between groups.

Online self-directed learning has become increasingly utilized among medical trainees to promote competency within medical subspecialties. We sought to evaluate the impact of online learning combined with lecture-based and hands-on teaching on the acquisition of PE knowledge and confidence in pediatric cardiology and pediatric critical care fellows. We prospectively enrolled 124 learners from 2016 to 2019. These included 40 incoming cardiology and critical care fellows at Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) as well as 84 national and international participants recruited from our online echo education website. All participants completed online learning modules through our website ( www.pedecho.org ), which covers pediatric echo physics, Doppler, technique, normal anatomy, atrial septal defects, and ventricular septal defects. TCH cardiology and critical care fellows subsequently participated in an Echo Boot Camp (BC), a 3-day training program with hands-on workshops and didactic lectures. Knowledge was assessed using an 80-question pre and post-test multiple choice exams. The online learning group demonstrated improvement in exam scores following online learning (PRE 49.1 ± 15.3 vs. POST 67.8 ± 17%; p ≤ 0.01). Echo Boot Camp fellows were noted to have further incremental improvement in test scores following BC (PRE 48% ± 13% vs. POST MODULE 68.6% ± 15% vs. POST BC 75.7% ± 13%; p ≤ 0.01). Self-assessment regarding confidence in context areas showed a substantial gain in self perceived interpretive confidence across all groups as well as procedural confidence in BC participants. Online learning significantly promotes the acquisition of echocardiography knowledge. Additional lecture-based and hands-on teaching in the form of an Echo Boot Camp can further enhance knowledge and interpretative skills. Both of these learning platforms appear to work in concert as powerful and effective tools in fellow education.",Pediatric cardiology,2021-Feb,"Kailin JA, Kyle WB, Altman CA, Wood AC, Schlingmann TS",5,2098,cardiology,2025-11-22
33655790,Promoting Judicious Primary Care Referral of Patients with Chest Pain to Cardiology: A Quality Improvement Initiative.,"To decrease referrals to cardiology of patients ages 7 to 21 years with low-probability cardiac pathology who presented to primary care with chest pain by 50% within 24 months. A multidisciplinary team designed and implemented an initiative consisting of 1) a decision support tool (DST), 2) educational sessions, 3) routine feedback to improve use of referral criteria, and 4) patient family education. Four pediatric practices, comprising 34 pediatricians and 7 nurse practitioners, were included in this study. We tracked progress via statistical process control charts. A total of 421 patients ages 7 to 21 years presented with chest pain to their pediatrician. The utilization of the DST increased from baseline of 16% to 68%. Concurrently, the percentage of low-probability cardiology referrals in pediatric patients ages 7 to 21 years who presented with chest pain decreased from 17% to 5% after our interventions. At a median follow-up time of 0.9 years (interquartile range, 0.3-1.6 years), no patient had a life-threatening cardiac event.

Despite advances in interventional cardiology, the correct management of residual low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) risk continues to be crucial for improving long-term outcomes after PCI. However, several observational studies have demonstrated suboptimal LDL-C control, poor adherence to statin therapy, and underutilization of high-intensity statins, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors in real-world clinical practice despite a strong endorsement from international guidelines. Recent studies have shown that early intensive lipid-lowering therapy stabilizes atheromatous plaque and increases fibrous cap thickness in patients with acute coronary syndrome. This finding emphasizes the importance of achieving therapeutic targets by establishing an effective treatment as early as possible. The aim of this expert opinion paper of the Interventional Cardiology Working Group of the Italian Society of Cardiology is to discuss the management of lipid-lowering therapy in patients undergoing PCIs according to Italian reimbursement policies and regulations, with a particular focus on the discharge phase.","Journal of cardiovascular medicine (Hagerstown, Md.)",2023-Apr,"Calabrò P, Spaccarotella C, Cesaro A, Andò G, Piccolo R, De Rosa S, Zimarino M, Mancone M, Gragnano F, Moscarella E, Muscoli S, Romeo F, Barillà F, Filardi PP, Indolfi C, Niccoli G",16,1278,cardiology,2025-11-22

39607997,Opportunities to Address Specialty Care Deserts and the Digital Divide through the Veterans Health Administration's Telehealth Hub-and-Spoke Cardiology Clinic: Retrospective Cohort Study.,"To address geographic barriers to specialty care access for services such as cardiology, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) has implemented a novel, regionalized telehealth care hub. The Clinical Resource Hub (CRH) model extends care, including cardiology services, to individuals in low-access communities across the region. Little is known, however, about the reach of such programs. This study aimed to describe the initial CRH program implementation in terms of growth in users and clinical encounters, as well as the association between user characteristics and the use of CRH cardiology care, in VA's Sierra Pacific region (Northern California, Nevada, and the Pacific Islands). We compared patients who used CRH cardiology services (CRH users) to those using non-CRH cardiology services (CRH nonusers) in the Sierra Pacific region between July 15, 2021, and March 31, 2023. After characterizing changes in the numbers of CRH users and nonusers and clinical encounters over the study period, we used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the association between patient-level factors and the odds of being a CRH user. There were 804 CRH users over the study period, with 1961 CRH encounters concentrated at 3 main CRH sites. The CRH program comprised a minority of cardiology users and encounters in the region, with 19,583 CRH nonusers with 83,489 encounters. The numbers of CRH patients and encounters both increased at a steady-to-increasing rate over the study period, with increases of 37% (n=292 vs n=213) in users and 64% (n=584 vs n=356) in encounters in the first quarter of 2023 compared with the last quarter of 2022. Among CRH users, 8.3% (67/804) were female and 41.4% (333/804) were aged ≥75 years, compared with 4.3% (840/19,583) and 49% (9600/19,583), respectively, among CRH nonusers. The proportions of rural (users: 205/804, 25.5%; nonusers: 4936/19,583, 25.2%), highly disabled (users: 387/804, 48.1%; nonusers: 9246/19,583, 47.2%), and low-income (users: 165/804, 20.5%; nonusers: 3941/19,583, 20.1%) veterans in both groups were similar. In multivariable logistic models, adjusted odds ratios of using CRH were higher for female veterans (1.70, 95% CI 1.29-2.24) and lower for older veterans (aged ≥75 years; 0.33, 95% CI 0.23-0.47). Rural veterans also had a higher adjusted odds ratio of using CRH (1.19, 95% CI 1.00-1.42; P=.046). The VA's Sierra Pacific CRH cardiology program grew substantially in its first 2 years of operation, serving disproportionately more female and rural veterans and similar proportions of highly disabled and low-income veterans compared to conventional VA care. This model appears to be effective for overcoming specialty care access barriers for certain individuals, although targeted efforts may be required to reach older veterans. While this study focuses on a single region, specialty, and health care system, lessons from implementing regionalized telehealth hub models may be applicable to other settings.",Journal of medical Internet research,2024-Nov,"Tisdale RL, Purmal C, Kalwani N, Sandhu A, Heidenreich P, Zulman D, Hussain T",7,2985,cardiology,2025-11-22

To determine the publication rate of practice theses in the field of Cardiology at the Faculty of Medicine of Sousse (FMSo) in Tunisia and to identify predictive factors for successful publication. We conducted a descriptive bibliometric analysis of Cardiology theses defended at FMSo from 2000 to 2019. Data were extracted from the theses' cover pages, abstracts, and conclusions. The publication status was ascertained via searches in ""MEDLINE"", ""Scopus"", and ""Google Scholar"". Predictive factors for publication were identified using multivariate analysis with a 90% Confidence Interval (CI). Of the 111 Cardiology theses defended at FMSo between 2000 and 2019, 36 were published yielding 42 scientific articles (publication rate of 32%). Notably, 86% of these articles were indexed in ""MEDLINE"" and/or ""Scopus"". In 79% of cases, doctoral candidates were co-authors of the resultant publications. Publication was significantly influenced by three factors: scientific mentorship by an Assistant or Associate Professor (aOR=3.021; 90%CI: 1.06-10.14; p=0.082), a prospective study design (aOR=2.536; 90%CI: 1.07-6.02; p=0.076), and a satisfactory quality of writing (aOR=2.384; 90%CI: 1.11-5.11; p=0.061).

34186112,Unique Challenges of Randomised Controlled Trials in Pediatric Cardiology.,"Pediatric cardiology has evolved over time with reductions in childhood mortality due to congenital heart disease. Surgical innovation drove early changes in care. Increasingly, the need for more robust evidence provided by randomised controlled trials (RCTs) has been recognised. Although the number of RCTs has increased, there remains a relative paucity of truly impactful trials in the field. However, those trials that have changed practice have demonstrated the potential and importance of this work. Examples include the PRIMACORP trial, which established the safety and efficacy of milrinone after cardiac surgery, and the Single Ventricle Reconstruction trial, which was the first multicentre pediatric cardiac surgical RCT. The successful conduct and important findings emanating from these trials serve as beacons as clinicians strive to improve the evidence base in this field. The establishment of national and international networks such as the Pediatric Heart Network and the Canadian Pediatric Cardiology Research Network provide a strong foundation for future collaborative work. Despite this progress, there remain important challenges to designing and executing RCTs in pediatric cardiology. These include issues of greater disease and patient heterogeneity and increased costs. The use of innovative study designs and analytic methods and the establishment of core outcome measures have the potential to overcome some of the issues related to the smaller patient numbers compared with adult disciplines. As pediatric cardiologists look to the future, it is imperative that we work together to derive the maximum benefit from the considerable efforts directed toward conducting impactful clinical trials in pediatric cardiology.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2021-Sep,"Harris KC, Mackie AS, Dallaire F, Khoury M, Singer J, Mahle WT, Klassen TP, McCrindle BW",8,1747,cardiology,2025-11-22
34107147,Outcomes of transesophageal echocardiogram-guided electrical cardioversion in patients with atrial fibrillation greater than 48 hours treated in the emergency department versus the cardiology ward: A retrospective comparison study.,"The current emergency medicine literature on cardioversion for atrial fibrillation (AF) describes its performance on those who are hemodynamically unstable, present within 48 hours of the onset of the arrhythmia, or are on long-term anticoagulants. For patients who are not anticoagulated and present with atrial fibrillation for more than 48 hours, one option is to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram and then synchronized cardioversion in the absence of atrial clot. The objective of this study is to compare outcomes of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with atrial fibrillation (AF) of more than 48 hours who underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and subsequent cardioversion in the ED versus the cardiology ward. This was a retrospective comparison study of patients who presented to the ED with AF for more than 48 hours, underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram, and then were electrically cardioverted either in the emergency department or in the cardiology ward. Outcomes include: time to cardioversion, length of hospital stay, rate of successful cardioversion, and rate of complications. Electrical cardioversion was performed in the ED on 94 patients (62%) and the cardiology ward on 57 (38%). Over 90% of cardioversions were successful in both groups. Time to cardioversion was significantly less in the ED group versus the cardiology group (1.04 ± 0.9 days versus 3.81 ± 1.9; P < .001). Similarly, the mean length of hospital stay was less for the ED group (1.6 ± 1.6 days versus 7.3 ± 3.5; P < .001). Patients who present in atrial fibrillation for more than 48 hours and then have a TEE undergo electrical cardioversion faster in the ED compared with the cardiology ward. This clinical pathway also results in a shorter length of hospital stay without having more side effects.",International journal of clinical practice,2021-Sep,"Zaro B, Alpert EA, Kaufman N, Rosenmann D",4,1831,cardiology,2025-11-22
34097944,The inductor role of cardiac consultation in the pre-anesthetic evaluation of asymptomatic patients submitted to non-cardiac minor and intermediate-risk surgery: a cross-sectional study.,"Asymptomatic patients with moderate functional capacity do not require Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) workup in the preoperative period of non-cardiac surgeries, especially when scheduled for minor and intermediate-risk surgeries. The workup is inappropriate because it promotes over diagnosing and pointless treatments. Moreover, those patients usually undergo cardiology assessment, in addition to pre-anesthetic evaluation. Investigate the role of cardiology consultation as mediator in inappropriate assessment of CAD for preoperative of non-cardiac surgeries. Retrospective study performed in a private anesthesia service using medical charts of asymptomatic patients with a history of controlled systemic disease and moderate functional capacity, submitted to pre-anesthetic consultation for minor and intermediate risk surgeries. Cardiology consultations were identified by the presence of a consultation report by a cardiologist. CAD workup was defined as undergoing cardiac stress tests. We included 390 medical charts of patients with mean age of 48.6 ± 15.4 years, 67% women and 69% intermediate risk surgeries. CAD workup was infrequent and performed in 3.9% of patients. Besides, pre-anesthetic evaluation, 93 (24%) patients had a cardiology consultation. Among those patients, 15.1% were submitted to CAD workup, compared to 0.34% of patients without cardiology assessment (p < 0.001; RR = 4.4; 95% CI: 3.5-5.6). Inappropriate testing for CAD investigation is infrequent for asymptomatic individuals submitted to minor and intermediate risk surgeries. However, cardiology consultation increases substantially the likelihood of a patient undergoing CAD workup, suggesting that, unlike the anesthesiologist, the cardiologist is a major mediator of this kind of management.",Brazilian journal of anesthesiology (Elsevier),2021-,"Oliveira ACC, Schwingel PA, Santos LAD, Correia LCL",4,1783,cardiology,2025-11-22

Recently, LLMs have become commercialized, allowing the average person to access these incredibly powerful tools. Early adopters focused on LLM use in performing logical tasks, including-but not limited to-generating titles, identifying key words, summarizing text, initial editing of scientific work, improving statistical protocols, and performing statistical analysis. More recently, LLMs have been expanded to clinical practice and academia to perform higher cognitive and creative tasks. LLMs provide personalized assistance in learning, facilitate the management of electronic medical records, and offer valuable insights into clinical decision making in cardiology. They enhance patient education by explaining intricate medical conditions in lay terms, have a vast library of knowledge to help clinicians expedite administrative tasks, provide useful feedback regarding content of scientific writing, and assist in the peer-review process. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs are not without limitations. They are susceptible to generating incorrect or plagiarized content, face challenges in handling tasks without detailed prompts, and lack originality. These limitations underscore the importance of human oversight in using LLMs in medical science and clinical practice. As LLMs continue to evolve, addressing these challenges will be crucial in maximizing their potential benefits while mitigating risks.

36757429,Development of a Pediatric Cardiology Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing Database.,"Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides clinicians with information vital to the management of pediatric cardiology patients. CPET can also be used to measure cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in these patients. CRF is a robust marker of overall health in children. However, a complete understanding of CRF in pediatric cardiology patients is limited by lack of large, standardized CPET databases. Our purpose was to develop a standardized CPET database, describe available data at our institution, and discuss challenges and opportunities associated with this project. CPETs performed from 1993 to present in an urban pediatric hospital were collected and compiled into a research database. Historical data included demographic and clinical variables and CPET outcomes, and additional variables were calculated and coded to facilitate analyses in these cohorts. Patient diagnoses were coded to facilitate sub-analyses of specific cohorts. Quality assurance protocols were established to ensure future database contributions and promote inter-institutional collaborations. This database includes 10,319 CPETs (56.1% male), predominantly using the Bruce Protocol. Patients ranging from ages 6 to 18 years comprise 86.8% of available CPETs. Diagnosis classification scheme includes patients with structurally normal hearts (n = 3,454), congenital heart disease (n = 3,614), electrophysiological abnormalities (n = 2,082), heart transplant or cardiomyopathy (n = 833), and other diagnoses (n = 336). Historically, clinicians were provided with suboptimal interpretive resources for CPET, often generalizing inferences from these resources to non-representative clinical populations. This database supports representative CRF comparisons and establishes a framework for future CRF-based registries in pediatric patients referred for CPET, ultimately improving clinical decision-making regarding fitness in these populations.",Pediatric cardiology,2024-Aug,"Griffith G, Liem RI, Carr M, Corson T, Ward K",5,1927,cardiology,2025-11-22

33292898,Recommendations from the Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology for training in diagnostic and interventional electrophysiology.,"The field of electrophysiology (EP) in paediatric cardiology patients and adults with congenital heart disease is complex and rapidly growing. The current recommendations for diagnostic and invasive electrophysiology of the working group for Cardiac Dysrhythmias and Electrophysiology of the Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology acknowledges the diveristy of European countries and centers. These training recommendations can be fulfilled in a manageable period of time, without compromising the quality of training required to become an expert in the field of paediatric and congenital EP and are for trainees undergoing or having completed accredited paediatric cardiologist fellowship. Three levels of expertise, the training for General paediatric cardiology EP, for non-invasive EP and invasive EP have been defined.

35411842,A multimedia paediatric cardiology assessment tool for medical students and general paediatric trainees: development and validation.,"Understanding how cardiovascular structure and physiology guide management is critically important in paediatric cardiology. However, few validated educational tools are available to assess trainee knowledge. To address this deficit, paediatric cardiologists and fellows from four institutions collaborated to develop a multimedia assessment tool for use with medical students and paediatric residents. This tool was developed in support of a novel 3-dimensional virtual reality curriculum created by our group. Educational domains were identified, and questions were iteratively developed by a group of clinicians from multiple centres to assess understanding of key concepts. To evaluate content validity, content experts completed the assessment and reviewed items, rating item relevance to educational domains using a 4-point Likert scale. An item-level content validity index was calculated for each question, and a scale-level content validity index was calculated for the assessment tool, with scores of ≥0.78 and ≥0.90, respectively, representing excellent content validity. The mean content expert assessment score was 92% (range 88-97%). Two questions yielded ≤50% correct content expert answers. The item-level content validity index for 29 out of 32 questions was ≥0.78, and the scale-level content validity index was 0.92. Qualitative feedback included suggestions for future improvement. Questions with ≤50% content expert agreement and item-level content validity index scores <0.78 were removed, yielding a 27-question assessment tool. We describe a multi-centre effort to create and validate a multimedia assessment tool which may be implemented within paediatric trainee cardiology curricula. Future efforts may focus on content refinement and expansion to include additional educational domains.",Cardiology in the young,2023-Mar,"Wilson HC, Lim TR, Axelrod DM, Werho DK, Handler SS, Mullan PB, Cooke JM, Owens ST",8,1814,cardiology,2025-11-22
38519859,Enhancing patient outcomes: Integrating electronic cardiology consultation in primary care for cancer patients.,"The prevalence of cancer patients with concomitant cardiovascular (CV) disease is on the rise due to improved cancer prognoses. The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term outcomes of cancer patients referred to a cardiology department (CD) via primary care using e-consultation. We analysed data from cancer patients with prior referrals to a CD between 2010 and 2021 (n = 6889) and compared two care models: traditional in-person consultations and e-consultations. In e-consultation model, cardiologists reviewed electronic health records (e-consultation) to determine whether the demand could be addressed remotely or necessitated an in-person consultation. We used an interrupted time series regression model to assess outcomes during the two periods: (1) time to cardiology consultation, (2) rates of all-cause and CV related hospital admissions and (3) rates of all-cause and CV-related mortality within the first year after the initial consultation or e-consultation at the CD. Introduction of e-consultation for cancer patients referred to cardiology care led to a 51.8% reduction (95%CI: 51.7%-51.9%) in waiting times. Furthermore, we observed decreased 1-year incidence rates, with incidence rate ratios (iRRs) [IC95%] of .75 [.73-.77] for CV-related hospitalizations, .43 [.42-.44] for all-cause hospitalizations, and .87 [.86-.88] for all-cause mortality. Compared to traditional in-person consultations, an outpatient care program incorporating e-consultation for cancer patients significantly reduced waiting times for cardiology care and demonstrated safety, associated with lower rates of hospital admissions.",European journal of clinical investigation,2024-Aug,"Cinza-Sanjurjo S, Mazón-Ramos P, Rey-Aldana D, Garcia-Vega D, Portela-Romero M, Rodríguez-Mañero M, Sestayo-Fernández M, Lage-Fernández R, López-López R, González-Juanatey JR",10,1632,cardiology,2025-11-22
37003937,Effect of a Senior Cardiology Nursing Role on Streamlining Assessment of Emergency Cardiology Presentations During COVID-19: An Observational Study.,"The Emergency Cardiology Coordinator (ECC) was a senior nursing role implemented from 14 April 2020 to 15 September 2020 at the Gold Coast Hospital and Health Service in South-East Queensland, Australia to streamline and expedite assessment of patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with suspected cardiac problems. ECC implementation occurred in the context of the emergence of COVID-19. Evaluation of the impact of the ECC role focussed primarily on the time interval from triage to cardiology consult (TTCC). ED and Cardiology Department data were extracted from electronic medical records for the period 2 September 2019 to 1 March 2021. The TTCC for each presenting problem (chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, altered level of consciousness) was compared between patients seen by the ECC and those not seen on the days the ECC worked. The effect of COVID-19 on TTCC was assessed by an interrupted time series analysis. Data recorded by the ECC included patients seen and interventions provided. The ECC saw 378 patients. Most presented with chest pain (269/378, 71.2%). The ECC determined that 68.8% (260/378) required a cardiac assessment. Following COVID-19 the median weekly TTCC increased by 0.029 hours (1.74 min) each week on average relative to that beforehand (p=0.008). For patients seen by the ECC the median TTCC was 2.07 hours (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.44, 3.16) compared to 2.58 hours (IQR: 1.73, 3.80; p=0.007) for patients not seen by the ECC. Chest pain (ECC: 1.94 hours; no ECC: 2.41 hours; p=0.06) and non-obvious cardiac presenting problems (ECC: 1.77 hours; no ECC 3.05 hours; p=0.004) displayed the largest reductions in TTCC when the ECC was involved. Presentations with palpitations, respiratory distress and altered level of consciousness had similar TTCCs. The ECC role resulted in an overall decrease in TTCC despite the role coinciding with the emergence of COVID-19. In order to clarify the optimal strategy for the ECC role, further analyses involving patient risk factors and presenting problems along with a health economic evaluation of this model of care and the effect on patient outcomes will be required.","Heart, lung & circulation",2023-May,"Weaver MJ, Mok D, Hughes I, Hattingh HL",4,2175,cardiology,2025-11-22
31800033,Impact of cardiology follow-up care on treatment and outcomes of patients with new atrial fibrillation discharged from the emergency department.,"The first presentation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is often to an emergency department (ED). We evaluated the association of subsequent specialist care with morbidity and mortality. Retrospective cohort study of all adults in Alberta, Canada, with a new primary diagnosis of AF treated and released during an index ED visit between 2009 and 2015. Types of physician follow-up within 3 months of ED visit was analysed using Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates. Outcomes were evaluated at 1 year. Of 7986 patients, 476 (6.0%) had no physician follow-up within 3 months, whereas 2730 (34.2%) attended a non-specialist only, 1277 (16.0%) an internal medicine specialist, and 3503 (43.9%) cardiology. An increasing gradient of cardiac investigations occurred across these groups. Cardiology compared with non-cardiologist care was associated with approximately two-fold greater electrophysiology interventions and revascularization, and increased use of beta-blockers (48.9% vs. 43.0%, P < 0.0001), statins (31.4% vs. 26.7%, P < 0.0001), and oral anticoagulation in patients with CHADS2 scores ≥1 (53.7% vs. 43.6%, P < 0.0001). In the subsequent year, cardiology care was associated with fewer deaths [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.93], strokes (aHR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37-0.96), or major bleeds (aHR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53-0.89). No differences in the risk of hospitalization or ED visits were associated with cardiology care. Cardiology care after an ED visit for symptomatic new-onset AF is associated with better prognosis. The benefit may be mediated through more intensive investigation, identification, and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors and disease.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",2020-May,"Hawkins NM, Scheuermeyer FX, Youngson E, Sandhu RK, Ezekowitz JA, Kaul P, McAlister FA",7,1717,cardiology,2025-11-22
35789093,Dearth of electrophysiology fellows: perspectives from cardiology fellows-in-training.,"Over the last 6 years, there has been a high percentage of unfilled cardiac electrophysiology (EP) training spots each year. The authors aimed to investigate potential explanations for the unfilled positions based on a survey from the current Fellows-In-Training (FITs). An attempt was made to reach the current cardiology FITs across all programs of the U.S. via email. An anonymous questionnaire was created consisting of 14 questions. Questions posed were regarding factors affecting each participant's interest in or lack of pursuing an EP fellowship. Descriptive statistics of the responses were performed. A total of 26% (35/134) respondents expressed their interest in applying to an EP fellowship. The most common reasons to apply to EP were: Interest in EP, procedural specialty, and work-life balance. Of the 99 respondents that were not applying to EP, the most common reasons not to apply were: Less interest in EP, two-year training duration, and complexity of the specialty. The top reasons for the fellows to believe there is a dearth of EP FITs were: two-year training duration, lack of interest in EP, and the complexity of the specialty. The changes that would encourage EP fellowship interest were: More exposure to EP training during general cardiology fellowship, shortening the EP training duration, and having more information available regarding employment opportunities. The study was able to identify factors responsible for vacancies in EP fellowship positions from the view of current cardiology FITs. Stakeholders at the national level involved in framing policies related to fellowship education would be able to utilize this information to address the shortage of EP FITs and increase recruitment to EP fellowships.",Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE,2022-Aug,"Patel H, Zughaib M, Rajpurohit D, Whitler C, Kalaba F, Bradley C, Zughaib M",7,1746,cardiology,2025-11-22
34547752,Current Recommendations on Atrial Fibrillation: A Comparison of the Recent European and Canadian Guidelines.,"Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation (AF) are frequently published and updated, reflecting the rapid evolution in AF pathogenesis and treatment modalities. Recently, 2 important guidelines for the diagnosis and management of atrial AF have been published by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS). Although the evidence-based recommendations and statements are quite similar, there are some important differences between the ESC and CCS guidelines for AF. Herein, we compared the current recommendations and highlighted the differences from the most recent guidelines for AF. Key Messages: Specifically, key differences can be observed in methods evaluating the recommendations; classifications and the definitions; the symptom score used to guide management decisions, longitudinal patient assessment, and structured characterization; the stroke risk stratification algorithm used to determine indications for oral anticoagulation therapy; the role of acetylsalicylic acid in stroke prevention in AF; the antithrombotic regimens that are employed in the setting of chronic coronary syndromes, acute coronary syndromes, and percutaneous coronary intervention; the target heart rate for rate control; and the algorithms for integrated or holistic management of AF. Differences are observed, particularly when the quality of evidence is moderate or low. More research and randomized controlled studies on major gaps identified in current guidelines will further clarify and modify our future management strategies in AF.",Cardiology,2022-,"Okutucu S, Gorenek B",2,1593,cardiology,2025-11-22

39523944,"Relationship Between Race, Predelivery Cardiology Care, and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Preeclampsia/Eclampsia Among a Commercially Insured Population.","It is unknown whether predelivery cardiology care is associated with future risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in preeclampsia/eclampsia (PrE/E). We sought to determine the cumulative incidence of MACE by race and whether predelivery cardiology care was associated with the hazard of MACE up to 1 year post-delivery for Black and White patients with PrE/E. Using Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database, we identified Black and White patients with PrE/E who had a delivery between 2008 and 2019. MACE was defined as the composite of heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. Cumulative incidence functions were used to compare the incidence of MACE by race. Regression models were used to assess the hazard of MACE by cardiology care for each race. Separate hazards were calculated for the first 14 days and the remainder of the year. Among 29 336 patients (83.4% White patients, 16.6% Black patients, 99.5% commercially insured, mean age: 30.9 years) with PrE/E, 11.2% received cardiology care (10.9% White patients, 13.0% Black patients). Black patients had higher incidence of MACE than White patients at 1 year post-delivery (2.7% versus 1.4%) with the majority within 14 days of delivery (Black patients: 58.7%; White patients: 67.8%). After adjusting for age and comorbidities, receipt of cardiology care was associated with a lower hazard of MACE for White patients within 14 days after delivery (hazard ratio, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.21-0.46]; <i>P</i><0.001) but not Black patients (hazard ratio, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.60-1.67]; <i>P</i>=0.999). The effect of the interaction between race and cardiology care was significant in the first 14 days (<i>P</i><0.001) but not the remainder of the year (<i>P</i>=0.56).

33427883,Evaluation of Women and Underrepresented Racial and Ethnic Group Representation in a General Cardiology Fellowship After a Systematic Recruitment Initiative.,"The proportion of women and underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (UREGs) matriculating into general cardiology fellowships remains low. To assess a systematic recruitment initiative aimed at ensuring adequate matriculation of women and UREGs in a general cardiology fellowship. This quality improvement study took place at a large, tertiary academic medical center and associated Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Cardiovascular Disease fellowship. Participants included cardiology fellowship and divisional leadership and general cardiology fellow applicants to the Duke Cardiovascular Disease Fellowship Program from 2017 to 2019. Data analysis was performed from December 2019 to May 2020. Multipronged initiative that created an environment committed to ensuring equity of opportunity. This included the creation of a fellowship diversity and inclusivity task force that drafted recommendations, which included reorganization of the fellowship recruitment committee, and changes to the applicant screening process, the interview day, applicant ranking process, and postmatch interventions. The percentage of matriculating and overall women and UREGs before and after the interventions were recorded. The fellowship received a mean (SD) of 462 (55) applications annually before the interventions (2006-2016) and 611 (27) applications annually after the interventions (2017-2019). Between the 10-year period before the interventions and the 3-year period during the interventions, there was a significant increase in the annual mean (SD) percentage of women (22.4% [2.9%] vs 26.4% [0.07%]; P < .001) and UREG applicants (10.5% [1.1%] vs 12.5% [1.9%]; P = .01) to the program. Among applicants interviewed, the percentage of women increased from 20.0% to 33.5% (P = .01) and that of and UREGs increased from 14.0% to 20.0% (P = .01). Before the interventions, a mean (SD) of 23.2% (16.2%) women and 9.7% (7.8%) UREGs matriculated as first-year fellows, whereas after the interventions, a mean (SD) of 54.2% (7.2%) women and 33.3% (19.0%) UREGs matriculated as first-year fellows. The proportion of the entire fellowship who were women increased from a 5-year mean (SD) of 27.0% (8.8%) to 54.2% (7.2%) after 3 years of interventions, and that of UREGs increased from 5.6% (4.6%) to 33.3% (19.0%). Overall, the proportion of applicants in the entire population who were either women or from UREGs increased from 27.8% to 66.7%.

Therefore, our aim was to develop a recruitment support system based on FHIR R4 and evaluate its usage and features in a cardiology department. Clinical conditions, anamnesis, examinations, allergies, medication, laboratory data and echocardiography results were imported as FHIR resources. Clinical trial information, eligibility criteria and recruitment status were recorded using the appropriate FHIR resources without extensions. Eligibility criteria linked by the logical operation ""OR"" were represented by using multiple FHIR Group resources for enrollment. The system was able to identify 52 of 55 patients included in four clinical trials. In conclusion, use of FHIR for defining eligibility criteria of clinical trials may facilitate interoperability and allow automatic screening for eligible patients at multiple sites of different healthcare providers in the future. Upcoming changes in FHIR should allow easier description of ""OR""-linked eligibility criteria.",Studies in health technology and informatics,2022-May,"Scherer C, Endres S, Orban M, Kääb S, Massberg S, Winter A, Löbe M",7,1245,cardiology,2025-11-22
33125968,Review of skin dose calculation software in interventional cardiology.,"In interventional cardiology, patients may be exposed to high doses to the skin resulting in skin burns following single or multiple procedures. Reviewing and analysing available software (online or offline) may help medical physicists assessing the maximum skin dose to the patient together with the dose distribution during (or after) these procedures. Capabilities and accuracy of available software were analysed through an extensive bibliography search and contacts with both vendor and authors. Their markedly differed among developers. In total, 22 software were identified and reviewed according to their algorithms and their capabilities. Special attention was dedicated to their main features and limitations of interest for the intended clinical use. While the accuracy of the 12 software products validated with measurements on phantoms was acceptable (within ± 25%), the agreement was poor for the two products validated on patients (within ± 43% and ± 76%, respectively). In addition, no software has been validated on angiographic units from all manufacturers, though several software developers claimed vendor-independent transportability. Only one software allows for multiple procedures dose calculation. Large differences among vendors made it clear that work remains to be done before an accurate and reliable skin dose mapping is available for all patients.",Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB),2020-Dec,"Malchair F, Dabin J, Deleu M, Merce MS, Bjelac OC, Gallagher A, Maccia C",7,1378,cardiology,2025-11-22
34619340,The Evolving Role of Artificial Intelligence in Cardiac Image Analysis.,"Research in artificial intelligence (AI) has progressed over the past decade. The field of cardiac imaging has seen significant developments using newly developed deep learning methods for automated image analysis and AI tools for disease detection and prognostication. This review is aimed at those without special background in AI. We review AI concepts and survey the growing contemporary applications of AI for image analysis in echocardiography, nuclear cardiology, cardiac computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and invasive angiography.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2022-Feb,"Lauzier PT, Avram R, Dey D, Slomka P, Afilalo J, Chow BJW",6,553,cardiology,2025-11-22
34305102,New progress in elucidating the relationship between cancer therapy and cardiovascular toxicity.,"Onco-cardiology is an emerging field linking cancer with cardiovascular injury. Understanding the mechanism of cardiac injury helps improve the quality of life of cancer survivors. A series of studies on adverse reactions to cancer or oncological treatments has indicated that adverse cardiovascular events related to cancer treatments may occur over a longer period of survival, and even years after therapy has concluded. Current cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, have been found to have latent cardiovascular toxicity. These toxic effects are often progressive and irreversible and ultimately lead to cardiovascular events such as heart failure, hypertension, coronary heart diseases, arrhythmia, and thromboembolism. Therefore, more emphasis should be placed on revealing the mechanism of cancer treatment-related cardiovascular toxicity. This would help to guide prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of CVDs in cancer survivors.",Bioscience trends,2021-Sep,"Wu C, Lin D, Ma F, Jiang F, Wang Y",5,992,cardiology,2025-11-22
33673952,Role of New Technologies in Supporting the Treatment of Complex Patients.,"Cardiology represents one of the privileged disciplinary areas for the experimentation and validation of the applications of telemedicine. Telemedicine, and the health technologies that go by the name of eHealth, identify the digital exchange of social and health information in order to support and optimize the care process remotely. Telemonitoring applied to cardiovascular diseases is defined as the recording, remote transmission, storage, and interpretation of cardiovascular parameters and diagnostic images. Meta-analyses have shown that telemedicine-supported models of care not only are effective but also cost-effective.",Heart failure clinics,2021-Apr,"Pagliani L, Elisa N, Eduardo RD, Lorenza DC, Agnese DN, Antonini-Canterin F",6,631,cardiology,2025-11-22
