36075878,Non-small cell lung cancer in China.,"In China, lung cancer is a primary cancer type with high incidence and mortality. Risk factors for lung cancer include tobacco use, family history, radiation exposure, and the presence of chronic lung diseases. Most early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients miss the optimal timing for treatment due to the lack of clinical presentations. Population-based nationwide screening programs are of significant help in increasing the early detection and survival rates of NSCLC in China. The understanding of molecular carcinogenesis and the identification of oncogenic drivers dramatically facilitate the development of targeted therapy for NSCLC, thus prolonging survival in patients with positive drivers. In the exploration of immune escape mechanisms, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor monotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy have become a standard of care for advanced NSCLC in China. In the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology's guidelines for NSCLC, maintenance immunotherapy is recommended for locally advanced NSCLC after chemoradiotherapy. Adjuvant immunotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy will be approved for resectable NSCLC. In this review, we summarized recent advances in NSCLC in China in terms of epidemiology, biology, molecular pathology, pathogenesis, screening, diagnosis, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.","Cancer communications (London, England)",2022-Oct,"Chen P, Liu Y, Wen Y, Zhou C",4,1413,oncology,2025-11-22

39419054,"Induction chemotherapy followed by standard chemoradiotherapy versus standard chemoradiotherapy alone in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (GCIG INTERLACE): an international, multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial.","Locally advanced cervical cancer is treated with chemoradiotherapy (standard of care), but many patients still relapse and die from metastatic disease. We investigated chemoradiotherapy with or without induction chemotherapy to determine whether induction chemotherapy improves both progression-free survival and overall survival. The INTERLACE trial was a multicentre, randomised phase 3 trial done at 32 medical centres in Brazil, India, Italy, Mexico, and the UK. Adults (aged ≥18 years) with locally advanced cervical cancer (FIGO 2008 stage IB1 disease with nodal involvement, or stage IB2, IIA, IIB, IIIB, or IVA disease) were randomly assigned (1:1), by minimisation, using a central electronic system, to standard cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy (once-a-week intravenous cisplatin 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 5 weeks with 45·0-50·4 Gy external beam radiotherapy delivered in 20-28 fractions plus brachytherapy to achieve a minimum total 2 Gy equivalent dose of 78-86 Gy) alone or induction chemotherapy (once-a-week intravenous carboplatin area under the receiver operator curve 2 and paclitaxel 80 mg/m<sup>2</sup> for 6 weeks) followed by standard cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy. Stratification factors were recruiting site, stage, nodal status, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy or intensity modulated radiotherapy, age, tumour size, and histology (squamous vs non-squamous). Primary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival within the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01566240, and EUDRACT, 2011-001300-35. Between Nov 8, 2012, and Nov 17, 2022, 500 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the chemoradiotherapy alone group (n=250) or the induction chemotherapy with chemoradiotherapy group. Of 500 patients, 354 (70%) had stage IIB disease and 56 (11%) stage IIIB disease. Pelvic lymph nodes were positive in 215 (43%) patients. 230 (92%) patients who received induction chemotherapy had at least five cycles. Median interval between induction chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy was 7 days. Four or more cycles of cisplatin were given to 212 (85%) participants in the induction chemotherapy with chemoradiotherapy group and to 224 (90%) of participants in the chemoradiotherapy alone group. 462 (92%) participants received external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy with a median overall treatment time of 45 days. After a median follow-up of 67 months, 5-year progression-free survival rates were 72% in the induction chemotherapy with chemoradiotherapy group and 64% in the chemoradiotherapy alone group with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·65 (95% CI 0·46-0·91, p=0·013). 5-year overall survival rates were 80% in the induction chemotherapy with chemoradiotherapy group and 72% in the chemoradiotherapy alone group, with an HR of 0·60 (95% CI 0·40-0·91, p=0·015). Grade 3 or greater adverse events were reported in 147 (59%) of 250 individuals in the induction chemotherapy with chemoradiotherapy group versus 120 (48%) of 250 individuals in the chemoradiotherapy alone group. Short-course induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy significantly improves survival of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.

32489253,Radiotherapy side effects: integrating a survivorship clinical lens to better serve patients.,"The Canadian Cancer Society estimated that 220,400 new cases of cancer would be diagnosed in 2019. Of the affected patients, more than 60% will survive for 5 years or longer after their cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, nearly 40% will receive at least 1 course of radiotherapy (rt). Radiotherapy is used with both curative and palliative intent: to treat early-stage or locally advanced tumours (curative) and for symptom management in advanced disease (palliative). It can be delivered systemically (external-beam rt) or internally (brachytherapy). Although technique improvements have drastically reduced the occurrence of rt-related toxicity, most patients still experience burdensome rt side effects (seffs). Radiotherapy seffs are local or locoregional, and manifest in tissues or organs that were irradiated. Side effects manifesting within weeks after rt completion are termed ""early seffs,"" and those occurring months or years after treatment are termed ""late seffs."" In addition to radiation oncologists, general practitioners in oncology and primary care providers are involved in survivorship care and management of rt seffs. Here, we present an overview of common seffs and their respective management: anxiety, depression, fatigue, and effects related to the head-and-neck, thoracic, and pelvic treatment sites.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Dilalla V, Chaput G, Williams T, Sultanem K",4,1322,oncology,2025-11-22

39707545,Integrated machine learning reveals the role of tryptophan metabolism in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and its association with patient prognosis.,"Precision oncology's implementation in clinical practice faces significant constraints due to the inadequacies in tools for detailed patient stratification and personalized treatment methodologies. Dysregulated tryptophan metabolism has emerged as a crucial factor in tumor progression, encompassing immune suppression, proliferation, metastasis, and metabolic reprogramming. However, its precise role in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains unclear, and predictive models or signatures based on tryptophan metabolism are conspicuously lacking. The influence of tryptophan metabolism on tumor cells was explored using single-cell RNA sequencing data. Genes involved in tryptophan metabolism were identified across both single-cell and bulk-cell dimensions through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and its single-cell data variant (hdWGCNA). Subsequently, a tryptophan metabolism-related signature was developed using an integrated machine-learning approach. This signature was then examined in multi-omics data to assess its associations with patient clinical features, prognosis, cancer malignancy-related pathways, immune microenvironment, genomic characteristics, and responses to immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Finally, the genes within the signature were validated through experiments including qRT-PCR, Western blot, CCK8 assay, and transwell assay. Dysregulated tryptophan metabolism was identified as a potential driver of the malignant transformation of normal epithelial cells. The tryptophan metabolism-related signature (TMRS) demonstrated robust predictive capability for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) across multiple datasets. Moreover, a high TMRS risk score correlated with increased tumor malignancy, significant metabolic reprogramming, an inflamed yet dysfunctional immune microenvironment, heightened genomic instability, resistance to immunotherapy, and increased sensitivity to certain targeted therapeutics. Experimental validation revealed differential expression of genes within the signature between RCC and adjacent normal tissues, with reduced expression of DDAH1 linked to enhanced proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. This study investigated the potential impact of dysregulated tryptophan metabolism on clear cell renal cell carcinoma, leading to the development of a tryptophan metabolism-related signature that may provide insights into patient prognosis, tumor biological status, and personalized treatment strategies. This signature serves as a valuable reference for further exploring the role of tryptophan metabolism in renal cell carcinoma and for the development of clinical applications based on this metabolic pathway.",Biology direct,2024-Dec,"Li F, Hu H, Li L, Ding L, Lu Z, Mao X, Wang R, Luo W, Lin Y, Li Y, Chen X, Zhu Z, Lu Y, Zhou C, Wang M, Xia L, Li G, Gao L",18,2732,oncology,2025-11-22
32368174,Use of immuno-oncology in melanoma.,"Treatment options for patients with metastatic melanoma have expanded rapidly since the approval of ipilimumab by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2011. Cytokines such as interferon and interleukin-2 were approved in 1995 and 1998 respectively. However, the effect on survival was marginal, and the toxicity, substantial. Multiple vaccine studies likewise failed to show improvements in survival. The ""Holy Grail"" came with the discovery of immune checkpoints, and the first metastatic melanoma trial to show an improvement in overall survival involved the use of an immune checkpoint inhibitor against ctla-4: ipilimumab. Since then, the field of immuno-oncology has exploded, with approvals for PD-1 inhibitors and discovery, in clinical trials, of several novel checkpoints such as tim-3, lag-3, and others. In fact more than 950 novel immunotherapy drugs are currently being trialled. Recently, combinations of ctla-4 and PD-1 inhibitors have been associated with 1-year survival rates exceeding 80% and 4-year survival rates greater than 50%. In no tumour has as much progress been made in the last 5 years as in melanoma, and the efforts to unravel and exploit mechanisms used by the tumour to avoid immune detection are just beginning.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,Smylie MG,1,1250,oncology,2025-11-22
39681638,PDX models for functional precision oncology and discovery science.,"Precision oncology relies on detailed molecular analysis of how diverse tumours respond to various therapies, with the aim to optimize treatment outcomes for individual patients. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have been key to preclinical validation of precision oncology approaches, enabling the analysis of each tumour's unique genomic landscape and testing therapies that are predicted to be effective based on specific mutations, gene expression patterns or signalling abnormalities. To extend these standard precision oncology approaches, the field has strived to complement the otherwise static and often descriptive measurements with functional assays, termed functional precision oncology (FPO). By utilizing diverse PDX and PDX-derived models, FPO has gained traction as an effective preclinical and clinical tool to more precisely recapitulate patient biology using in vivo and ex vivo functional assays. Here, we explore advances and limitations of PDX and PDX-derived models for precision oncology and FPO.

However, patient privacy restrictions have historically precluded dissemination of these models beyond the centers at which they were trained. In this study, the vulnerability of text classification models trained directly on protected health information to membership inference attacks is confirmed. A teacher-student distillation approach is applied to develop shareable models for annotating outcomes from imaging reports and medical oncologist notes. 'Teacher' models trained on EHR data from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) are used to label imaging reports and discharge summaries from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV dataset. 'Student' models are trained to use these MIMIC documents to predict the labels assigned by teacher models and sent to Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) for evaluation. The student models exhibit high discrimination across outcomes in both the DFCI and MSK test sets. Leveraging private labeling of public datasets to distill publishable clinical AI models from academic centers could facilitate deployment of machine learning to accelerate precision oncology research.",Nature communications,2024-Nov,"Kehl KL, Jee J, Pichotta K, Paul MA, Trukhanov P, Fong C, Waters M, Bakouny Z, Xu W, Choueiri TK, Nichols C, Schrag D, Schultz N",13,1503,oncology,2025-11-22
33950772,Assessing the pricing and benefits of oncology products: an update.,"<b>Introduction</b>: Oncology expenditure is outperforming all other health care sectors. In particular, the cost of oncology pharmaceuticals is soaring as it is fueled both by incremental costs and the introduction rate of new products. Due to the particularities of cancer as a disease, a significant multilayer of pressure is exerted toward the reimbursement of new treatments. Nevertheless, if the expenditure increase is left unattended, it may hamper the viability of any health care system worldwide.<b>Areas covered</b>: A literature review of the expenditure on oncology pharmaceuticals and the exploration of the root causes for the increase in expenditure was performed.<b>Expert commentary</b>: The surging oncology expenditure demonstrates a multi-layer causality that encompasses prices, the uncertainty of clinical trials, the specificities of cancer as a disease, and the artificial monopoly of oncology modalities. Moreover, laxity in the regulatory approval of new products was noted. In addition, the study design should be adequately justified.

32368182,Immunotherapy in hematologic malignancies.,"The management of hematologic malignancies has traditionally relied on chemotherapy regimens, many of which are still in use today. However, with advancements in the knowledge of tumour pathophysiology, therapies are continually evolving. Monoclonal antibodies against specific targets on tumour cells are now widely used to treat hematologic malignancies, either in combination with chemotherapy or as single agents. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against the CD20 antigen, is a good example of successful monoclonal antibody therapy that has improved outcomes for patients with B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Monoclonal antibodies are now being used against the immune checkpoints that function to inhibit T cell activation and subsequent tumour eradication by those cytotoxic T cells. Such therapies enhance T cell-mediated tumour eradication and are widely successful in treating patients with solid tumours such as malignant melanoma. Now, they are slowly finding their place in the management of hematologic neoplasms. Even though, currently, immune checkpoint inhibitors are used for relapsed or refractory hematologic neoplasms, trials are ongoing to evaluate their role in frontline treatment. Our review focuses on the current use of immunotherapies in various hematologic malignancies.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Kansara RR, Speziali C",2,1297,oncology,2025-11-22

Much of that revolution in immuno-oncology has been fueled by the clinical success of immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly those targeting the PD-1 axis. Unfortunately, many patients still fail to benefit from checkpoint blockade or other immunotherapies. An inability to fully activate antitumour T cells contributes in part to the failure of those therapies. Here, we review the basic biology of T cell activation, with particular emphasis on the essential role of the dendritic cell and the innate immune system in T cell activation. The current understanding of the multiple factors that govern T cell activation and how they impinge on tumour immunotherapy are also discussed. Lastly, treatment strategies to potentially overcome barriers to T cell activation and to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy are addressed.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Saibil SD, Ohashi PS",2,967,oncology,2025-11-22

This collaboration is important given its role in ensuring greater patient satisfaction, aiding teams of clinicians in making complex treatment decision, and ensuring cardiac complications are diagnosed at an early stage. The particularities of implementing this collaboration in the field of radiation oncology and how this setting is different from other areas of cardio-oncology have not been well detailed in the literature. This paper will discuss what is currently understood about the need for and role of cardio-oncology and what a cardio-oncology services involves, with a particular emphasis on patient and clinician needs in the field of radiation oncology. The literature and recent guidelines do advocate for a detailed baseline assessment of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy, especially patients with treatment or patient risk factors that increase their risk of cancer-therapy related cardiotoxicity. Advancements in cardiac imaging techniques will be discussed as these may help to diagnose cardiac side effects of certain cancer treatments, including radiotherapy, at an early stage. A multi-disciplinary and collaborative approach is well received by patients and such an approach, guided by the aim of maintaining a patient's cancer treatment wherever possible, should be the cornerstone of cardio-oncology clinics regardless of the patient's treatment regime.",Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,2024-Dec,"Birch S, Otton J",2,1638,oncology,2025-11-22

In renal cell carcinoma (rcc), cpis have been shown to have benefit over conventional therapies in a number of settings, and they are the standard of care for many patients with metastatic disease. Based on recent data, combinations of cpis and antiangiogenic therapies are likely to become a new standard approach in rcc. In urothelial carcinoma, cpis have been shown to have a role in the second-line treatment of metastatic disease, and a number of clinical trials are actively investigating cpis for other indications. In other gu malignancies, such as prostate cancer, results to date have been less promising. Immunotherapies continue to be an area of active study for all gu disease sites, with several clinical trials ongoing. In this review, we summarize the current evidence for cpi use in rcc, urothelial carcinoma, prostate cancer, testicular germ-cell tumours, and penile carcinoma. Ongoing clinical trials of interest are highlighted, as are the challenges that clinicians and patients will potentially face as immune cpis become a prominent feature in the treatment of gu cancers.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Thana M, Wood L",2,1316,oncology,2025-11-22

Targeted therapy, and more recently immunotherapy, have revolutionized the natural history and outcomes of many solid tumors. Clinical oncology is now indissoluble from molecular oncology, a rapidly evolving field. This profound transformation is the rationale for molecular tumor board (MTB) implementation. MTBs represent a resource for the development of precision oncology and clinical practice implementation is a complex and important challenge for the future of clinical and molecular oncology. Economic sustainability of genomic tests, access to drugs or clinical trials according to the MTB recommendation, and expanded use of existing anticancer drugs are required for MTBs to become a useful tool for the governance of precision oncology in the real world. This is an ongoing process, with establishment of MTBs the first step.

Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells emerged as a powerful cell-based immunotherapy for hematological malignancies; however, it remains unclear whether CAR T-cells represent a viable therapy for brain metastases. Here, we established a syngeneic orthotopic cerebral metastasis model in mice by combining a chronic cranial window with repetitive intracerebral two-photon laser scanning-microscopy. This approach enabled <i>in vivo</i>-characterization of fluorescent CAR T-cells and tumor cells on a single-cell level over weeks. Intraparenchymal injection of Lewis lung carcinoma cells (expressing the tumor cell-antigen EpCAM) was performed, and EpCAM-directed CAR T-cells were injected either intravenously or into the adjacent brain parenchyma. In mice receiving EpCAM-directed CAR T-cells intravenously, we neither observed substantial CAR T-cell accumulation within the tumor nor relevant anti-tumor effects. Local CAR T-cell injection, however, resulted in intratumoral CAR T-cell accumulation compared to controls treated with T-cells lacking a CAR. This finding was accompanied by reduced tumorous growth as determined per <i>in vivo</i>-microscopy and immunofluorescence of excised brains and also translated into prolonged survival. However, the intratumoral number of EpCAM-directed CAR T-cells decreased during the observation period, pointing toward insufficient persistence. No CNS-specific or systemic toxicities of EpCAM-directed CAR T-cells were observed in our fully immunocompetent model. Collectively, our findings indicate that locally (but not intravenously) injected CAR T-cells may safely induce relevant anti-tumor effects in brain metastases from lung cancer.

A dedicated Global Oncology Community of Practice (CoP) can serve as a self-organizing, grassroots approach for members, with common goals and values, to coordinate efforts, maximize impact, and ensure sustainable outcomes. It is imperative, however, when outlining goals and priorities to adhere to an ethical and appropriate framework during community building efforts to avoid perpetuating inequities and power imbalances.

32905234,Chest wall toxicity after stereotactic radiation in early lung cancer: a systematic review.,"Radiation-induced chest wall pain (cwp) and rib fracture (rf) are late adverse effects after stereotactic body radiation therapy (sbrt) for stage i non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc); however, the literature about their incidence and risk factors shows variability. We performed a systematic review to determine the pooled incidence of cwp and rf in the relevant population. A literature search using the prisma (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines considered English publications in medline and embase from January 1996 to August 2017. Abstracts were screened, followed by full-text review and data extraction. The database searches identified 547 records. Twenty-eight publications comprising 3892 patients met the inclusion criteria. Median reported ages and follow-up durations fell into the ranges 67-82 years and 12-84 months. Prescriptions fell into the range of 40-70 Gy in 3-10 fractions. Despite study heterogeneity, the pooled incidences of cwp and rf were estimated to be 8.94% and 5.27% respectively. Nineteen studies reported cwp grade: 58 of 308 patients (18.8%) experienced grades 3-4 cwp (no grade 5 events reported). Thirteen studies reported rf grade: grades 3-4 rf were observed in 9 of 113 patients (7.96%). A high chest wall <i>V</i><sub>30</sub> was an important predictor of cwp and rf. In patients with stage i nsclc, rates of cwp and rf after sbrt are low; however, tumour location, accurate toxicity reporting, and dose-fractionation schemes might alter those rates. Prospective correlation with dosimetry and quality of life assessment will further improve the understanding of cwp and rf after sbrt.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Aug,"Voruganti IS, Donovan E, Walker-Dilks C, Swaminath A",4,1671,oncology,2025-11-22

39330050,Canadian Expert Recommendations on Safety Overview and Toxicity Management Strategies for Sacituzumab Govitecan Based on Use in Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.,"Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of an anti-Trop-2 IgG1 molecule conjugated to SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, via a pH-sensitive hydrolysable linker. As a result of recent Canadian funding for SG in advanced hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), experience with using SG and managing adverse events (AEs) has grown. This review presents a summary of evidence and adverse event recommendations derived from Canadian experience, with SG use in metastatic TNBC for extrapolation and guidance in all indicated settings. SG is dosed at 10 mg/kg on day 1 and day 8 of a 21-day cycle. Compared to treatment of physicians' choice (TPC) the phase III ASCENT and TROPiCS-02 studies demonstrated favorable survival data in unresectable locally advanced or metastatic TNBC and HR-positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer, respectively. The most common AEs were neutropenia, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, alopecia, and anemia. This review outlines AE management recommendations for SG based on clinical trial protocols and Canadian guidelines, incorporating treatment delay, dose reductions, and the use of prophylactic and supportive medications.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2024-Sep,"Manna M, Brabant M, Greene R, Chamberlain MD, Kumar A, Alimohamed N, Brezden-Masley C",7,1240,oncology,2025-11-22
38459814,Genomic alterations in ovarian endometriosis and subsequently diagnosed ovarian carcinoma.,"Can the alleged association between ovarian endometriosis and ovarian carcinoma be substantiated by genetic analysis of endometriosis diagnosed prior to the onset of the carcinoma? The data suggest that ovarian carcinoma does not originate from ovarian endometriosis with a cancer-like genetic profile; however, a common precursor is probable. Endometriosis has been implicated as a precursor of ovarian carcinoma based on epidemiologic studies and the discovery of common driver mutations in synchronous disease at the time of surgery. Endometrioid ovarian carcinoma and clear cell ovarian carcinoma are the most common endometriosis-associated ovarian carcinomas (EAOCs). The pathology biobanks of two university hospitals in Sweden were scrutinized to identify women with surgically removed endometrioma who subsequently developed ovarian carcinoma (1998-2016). Only 45 archival cases with EAOC and previous endometriosis were identified and after a careful pathology review, 25 cases were excluded due to reclassification into non-EAOC (n = 9) or because ovarian endometriosis could not be confirmed (n = 16). Further cases were excluded due to insufficient endometriosis tissue or poor DNA quality in either the endometriosis, carcinoma, or normal tissue (n = 9). Finally 11 cases had satisfactory DNA from all three locations and were eligible for further analysis. Epithelial cells were collected from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections by laser capture microdissection (endometrioma n = 11) or macrodissection (carcinoma n = 11) and DNA was extracted. Normal tissue from FFPE sections (n = 5) or blood samples collected at cancer diagnosis (n = 6) were used as the germline controls for each included patient. Whole-exome sequencing was performed (n = 33 samples). Somatic variants (single-nucleotide variants, indels, and copy number alterations) were characterized, and mutational signatures and kataegis were assessed. Microsatellite instability and mismatch repair status were confirmed with PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The median age for endometriosis surgery was 42 years, and 54 years for the subsequent ovarian carcinoma diagnosis. The median time between the endometriosis and ovarian carcinoma was 10 (7-30) years. The data showed that all paired samples harbored one or more shared somatic mutations. Non-silent mutations in cancer-associated genes were frequent in endometriosis; however, the same mutations were never observed in subsequent carcinomas. The degree of clonal dominance, demonstrated by variant allele frequency, showed a positive correlation with the time to cancer diagnosis (Spearman's rho 0.853, P < 0.001). Mutations in genes associated with immune escape were the most conserved between paired samples, and regions harboring these genes were frequently affected by copy number alterations in both sample types. Mutational burdens and mutation signatures suggested faulty DNA repair mechanisms in all cases. Datasets are available in the supplementary tables. Even though we located several thousands of surgically removed endometriomas between 1998 and 2016, only 45 paired samples were identified and even fewer, 11 cases, were eligible for sequencing. The observed high level of intra- and inter-heterogeneity in both groups (endometrioma and carcinoma) argues for further studies of the alleged genetic association. The observation of shared somatic mutations in all paired samples supports a common cellular origin for ovarian endometriosis and ovarian carcinoma. However, contradicting previous conclusions, our data suggest that cancer-associated mutations in endometriosis years prior to the carcinoma were not directly associated with the malignant transformation. Rather, a resilient ovarian endometriosis may delay tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the data indicate that genetic alterations affecting the immune response are early and significant events.

32368175,Cautious optimism-the current role of immunotherapy in gastrointestinal cancers.,"Immunotherapy has been described as the ""fourth pillar"" of oncology treatment, in conjunction with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, the role of immunotherapy in gastrointestinal tumours is still evolving. Data for checkpoint inhibition in esophagogastric, hepatocellular, colorectal, and anal squamous cell carcinomas are expanding. In phase iii trials in the second-line setting, PD-1 inhibitors have demonstrated positive results for the subset of esophageal cancers that are positive for PD-L1 at a combined positive score of 10 or more. Based on results of phase ii trials, PD-1 inhibitors were approved in North America for use in PD-L1-positive chemorefractory gastric cancers, in hepatocellular carcinoma after sorafenib exposure, and in treatment-refractory deficient mismatch repair (dmmr) or high microsatellite instability (msi-h) tumours, regardless of tissue site. Combination use of PD-1 and ctla-4 inhibitors has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for chemorefractory dmmr or msi-h colorectal cancer. Responses to checkpoint inhibition are durable, particularly in the dmmr or msi-h colorectal cancer cohort. As trials of combination immunotherapy, immunotherapy in combination with other systemic therapies, and immunotherapy in combination with other treatment modalities move forward in multiple tumour sites, cautious optimism is called for. The treatment landscape is continually changing, and expanded indications are likely to be just around the corner.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Mendis S, Gill S",2,1512,oncology,2025-11-22
37294048,Integrative Oncology's 30-Year Anniversary: What Have We Achieved? A North American Naturopathic Oncology Perspective.,"In 1991 the U.S. Congress mandated that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) form the Office of Alternative Medicine to study alternative medical therapies, especially in oncology care. Shortly after, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) created its own division of complementary and alternative medicine (Office of Complementary and Alternative Medicine). At the genesis of the field 30 years ago, what were we hoping to see accomplished by now? In this article we take a look back at milestones, shortfalls and future directions. Exciting opportunities exist to direct our established subspeciality's future directions and we have made valuable advances the field of integrative oncology over the last 30 years: 1, IV high dose ascorbate has clinical research-based applications when used concurrently with some chemotherapeutic agents. 2. Whole body, extracorporeal and locoregional hyperthermia are being applied in treating solid tumors, including brain tumors. 3. PDL-1 tumor microenvironment testing and PDL-1 inhibitor immunotherapies have surprisingly excellent outcomes in a subgroup of cancer patients. 4. Tumor DNA sequencing (resected tumor and circulating tumor DNA in blood) has led to personalized precision targeted treatments. 5. Glucose metabolism's role in cancer progression is better understood and better therapies are available (e.g., intermittent fasting, metformin). 6. Medical cannabis has a larger role in treating chemotherapy-related side effects and shows promise for anti-proliferative effects. 8. Greater understanding has been gained of the interdependence and mutual regulation of processes in psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology (PNEI). The burgeoning field of PNEI has exponentially expanded the discussion of tumorigenesis, apoptosis, and introduced to the field the investigation of more holistic approaches to immune regulation and cancer care. 8. Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy is gaining traction especially for cancer patients facing demoralization, existential and spiritual distress, anxiety, depression and trauma related to the diagnosis and treatment of their cancer. 9. Spiritual health of cancer patients is more commonly addressed and measurable with an NIH validated scale. 10.

37982847,Molecular diagnostics tailoring personalized cancer therapy-an oncologist's view.,"Medical oncology is rapidly evolving with the implementation of personalized, targeted therapies. Advances in molecular diagnostics and the biologic understanding of cancer pathophysiology led to the identification of specific genetic alterations as drivers of cancer progression. Further, improvements in drug development enable the direct interference with these pathways, which allow tailoring personalized treatments based on a distinct molecular characterization of tumors. Thereby, we are currently experiencing a paradigm-shift in the treatment of cancers towards cancer-type agnostic, molecularly targeted, personalized therapies. However, this concept has several important hurdles and limitations to overcome to ultimately increase the proportion of patients benefitting from the precision oncology approach. These include the assessment of clinical relevancy of identified alterations, capturing and interpreting levels of heterogeneity based on intra-tumoral or time-dependent molecular evolution, and challenges in the practical implementation of precision oncology in routine clinical care. In the present review, we summarize the current state of cancer-agnostic precision oncology, discuss the concept of molecular tumor boards, and consider current limitations of personalized cancer therapy. Further, we provide an outlook towards potential future developments including the implementation of functionality assessments of identified genetic alterations and the broader use of liquid biopsies in order to obtain more comprehensive and longitudinal genetic information that might guide personalized cancer therapy in the future.",Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,2024-Feb,"Riedl JM, Moik F, Esterl T, Kostmann SM, Gerger A, Jost PJ",6,1644,oncology,2025-11-22

Quality of life measures provide for a multi-dimensional understanding of the impact of cancer treatment on measures ranging from functional, psychological, and social aspects of a patient's health. Patient-reported outcomes provide for an assessment of physical and functional symptoms that are directly elicited from patients. Collection of PROs and HRQoL data has been shown to not only be feasible but also provide for reliable measures that correlate with established outcomes measures better than clinician-scored toxicities. The importance of HRQoL measures has been emphasized by both patients and clinicians, as well as policy makers and regulatory bodies.

33380861,A systematic review and network meta-analysis of second-line therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"In patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) following sorafenib failure, it is unclear which treatment is most efficacious, as treatments in the second-line setting have not been directly compared and no standard therapy exists. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (nma) aimed to compare the clinical benefits and toxicities of these treatments. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (rcts) was conducted to identify phase iii rcts in advanced hcc following sorafenib failure. Baseline characteristics and outcomes of placebo were examined for heterogeneity. Primary outcomes of interest were extracted for results, including overall survival (os), progression-free survival (pfs), objective response rate (orr), grade 3/4 toxicities, and subgroups. An nma was conducted to compare both drugs through the intermediate placebo. Comparisons were expressed as hazard ratios (hrs) for os and pfs, and as risk difference (rd) for orr and toxicities. Subgroup analyses for os and pfs were also performed. Two rcts were identified (1280 patients) and compared through an indirect network; celestial (cabozantinib vs. placebo) and resorce (regorafenib vs. placebo). Baseline characteristics of patients in both trials were similar. Both trials also had similar placebo outcomes. Cabozantinib, compared with regorafenib, showed similar os [hazard ratio (hr): 1.21; 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.90 to 1.62], pfs (hr: 1.02; 95% ci: 0.78 to 1.34) and orr (-3.0%; 95% ci: -7.6% to 1.7%). Both treatments showed similar toxicities, but there were marginally higher risks of grade 3/4 hand-foot syndrome (5%; 95% ci: 0.1% to 9.8%), diarrhea (4.8%; 95% ci: 1.1% to 8.5%), and anorexia (4.4%; 95% ci: 0.8% to 8.0%) for cabozantinib. Subgroup results for os and pfs were consistent with overall results. Overall, this nma determined that cabozantinib and regorafenib have similar clinical benefits and toxicities for second-line hcc.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Delos Santos S, Udayakumar S, Nguyen A, Ko YJ, Berry S, Doherty M, Chan KKW",7,1958,oncology,2025-11-22

32174755,Update on systemic therapy for advanced soft-tissue sarcoma.,"Soft-tissue sarcoma (sts) represents a rare group of mesenchymal neoplasms comprising more than 50 heterogeneous subtypes. Great efforts have been made to increase the understanding of the treatment of advanced sts (unresectable or metastatic disease). We set out to determine whether outcomes for patients with advanced sts have improved over time and to assess the current evidence for systemic therapy. In a scoping review, we evaluated the contemporary evidence for systemic treatment of advanced sts in adults (>18 years of age). Phase i, ii, and iii studies of systemic therapy for advanced sts published in the English language were included. After abstract and full-text review of seventy-seven studies, sixty-two trials met the inclusion criteria. The number of clinical trials conducted and published in advanced sts has increased over the last 30 years. Although median overall survival has increased, attempts at improving first-line therapy through dose intensification, doublet chemotherapy, or alternative backbones have not been successful. The optimal therapy beyond anthracyclines remains a challenge, especially given the heterogeneity that grouping multiple sts subtypes within clinical trials creates. However, increasing numbers of agents are being studied, and several studies had shown isolated benefit in progression-free or overall survival. First-line systemic therapy with an anthracycline remains the standard of care for advanced sts. However, choice of subsequent therapy beyond anthracyclines remains challenging. Novel systemic therapies, use of molecular diagnostics to direct therapy, subtype-specific trials, and learnings from real-world retrospective data are all important for improving outcomes in patients with advanced sts.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Feb,"Smrke A, Wang Y, Simmons C",3,1765,oncology,2025-11-22

34352703,Skip pattern approach toward the early access of innovative anticancer drugs.,"With the rapid development of innovative anticancer treatments, the optimization of tools able to accelerate the access of new drugs to the market by the regulatory authority is a major issue. The aim of the project was to propose a reliable methodological pathway for the assessment of clinical value of new therapeutic innovative options, to objectively identify drugs which deserve early access (EA) priority for solid and possibly in other cancer scenarios, such as the hematological ones. After a comprehensive review of the European Public Assessment Report of 21 drugs, to which innovation had previously been attributed by the Italian Medicines Agency (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco, AIFA), an expert panel formulated an algorithm for the balanced use of three parameters: Unmet Medical Need (UMN) according to AIFA criteria, Added Benefit (AB) according to the European Society for Medical Oncology's Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) criteria and Quality of Evidence (QE) assessed by the Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method. By sequentially combining the above indicators, a final priority status (i.e. EA or not) was obtained using the skip pattern approach (SPA). By applying the SPA to the non-curative setting in solid cancers, the EA status was obtained by 5 out of 14 investigated drugs (36%); by enhancing the role of some categories of the UMN, additional 4 drugs, for a total of 9 (64%), reached the EA status: 2 and 3 drugs were excluded for not achieving an adequate score according to AB and QE criteria, respectively. For hematology cancer, only the UMN criteria were found to be adequate. The use of this model may represent a reliable tool for assessment available to the various stakeholders involved in the EA process and may help regulatory agencies in a more comprehensive and objective definition of new treatments' value in these contexts. Its generalizability in other national contexts needs further evaluation.",ESMO open,2021-Aug,"Apolone G, Ardizzoni A, Biondi A, Bortolami A, Cardone C, Ciniselli CM, Conte P, Crippa C, de Braud F, Duca M, Gori S, Gritti G, Inno A, Luksch R, Lussana F, Maio M, Pasello G, Perrone F, Rambaldi A, Rossi G, Signorelli D, Soverini G, Valente M, Verderio P, Buzzetti G",25,2000,oncology,2025-11-22

Patients presenting with high-risk lesions associated with locally advanced or metastatic cscc face high rates of recurrence and mortality. Accurate staging and risk stratification for patients can be challenging because no system is universally accepted, and no Canadian guidelines currently exist. Patients with advanced cscc are often deemed ineligible for either or both of curative surgery and radiation therapy (rt) and, until recently, were limited to off-label systemic cisplatin-fluorouracil or cetuximab therapy, which offers modest clinical benefits and potentially severe toxicity. A new systemic therapy, cemiplimab, has been approved for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic cscc. In the present review, we provide recommendations for patient classification and staging based on current guidelines, direction for determining patient eligibility for surgery and rt, and an overview of the available systemic treatment options for advanced cscc and of the benefits of a multidisciplinary approach to patient management.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Aug,"Claveau J, Archambault J, Ernst DS, Giacomantonio C, Limacher JJ, Murray C, Parent F, Zloty D",8,1186,oncology,2025-11-22

Notably, compared with patients lacking high-risk features, those with such features-such as deletions in chromosome 17p, aberrations in the <i>TP53</i> gene, or unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes-experience inferior outcomes and responses to standard chemoimmunotherapy. Novel agents that target the B cell receptor signalling pathway, such as Bruton tyrosine kinase (btk) inhibitors, have demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety in patients with treatment-naïve cll, particularly those with high-risk features. However, given the current lack of head-to-head trials comparing btk inhibitors, selection of the optimal btk inhibitor for patients with cll is unclear and requires consideration of multiple factors. In the present review, we focus on the efficacy, safety, and pharmacologic features of the btk inhibitors that are approved or under clinical development, and we discuss the practical considerations for the use of those agents in the Canadian treatment landscape.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Banerji V, Aw A, Robinson S, Doucette S, Christofides A, Sehn LH",6,1209,oncology,2025-11-22
33516529,Endometrial cancer: A society of gynecologic oncology evidence-based review and recommendations.,"In 2014, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology's Clinical Practice Committee published a clinical update reviewing the treatment of women with endometrial cancer. At that time, there had been significant advances in the diagnosis, work-up, surgical management, and available treatment options allowing for more optimal care of affected women. Despite these advances, the incidence of endometrial cancer as well as the deaths attributable to the disease have continued to rise; from 1987 to 2014 there has been a 75% increase in cases and almost 300% increase in endometrial cancer deaths. Fortunately, since then, there has been progress in the treatment of patients with endometrial cancer with increased utilization of molecular pathology, greater understanding of genetic predisposition, enhanced methods for lymph node assessment, a broader understanding of the efficacy of radiation and chemotherapy, and a more efficient approach to survivorship and surveillance. The purpose of this document is to present a comprehensive review of this progress. The authors reviewed the available evidence, contributed to the development of this manuscript, provided critical review of the guidelines, and finalized the manuscript recommendations. The review was also presented to and approved by the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Clinical Practice Committee, SGO Publications Committee, and the SGO board members prior to submission for publication. The recommendations for this manuscript were developed by a panel of gynecologic oncologists who were members of the SGO Clinical Practice and Education Committees. Panelists reviewed and considered evidence from current uterine cancer literature. The terminology used in these guidelines was adopted from the ASCCP management guidelines [1] using a two-part rating system to grade the strength of recommendation and quality of evidence (Table 1).

37319396,Hypofractionation Adoption in Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy: Results of an International Survey.,"Hypofractionation is noninferior to conventional fractionation in the treatment of localized prostate cancer. Using results from the European Society of Radiation Oncology's (ESTRO) Global Impact of Radiotherapy in Oncology (GIRO) initiative survey on hypofractionation, this study identifies rates of adoption, facilitating factors, and barriers to adoption of hypofractionation in prostate cancer across World Bank income groups. The ESTRO-GIRO initiative administered an international, anonymous, electronic survey to radiation oncologists from 2018 to 2019. Physician demographics, clinical practice characteristics, and hypofractionation regimen use (if any) for several prostate cancer scenarios were collected. Responders were asked about specific justifications and barriers to adopting hypofractionation, and responses were stratified by World Bank income group. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze variables associated with hypofractionation preference. A total of 1,157 physician responses were included. Most respondents (60%) were from high-income countries (HICs). In the curative setting, hypofractionation was most often preferred in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancers, with 52% and 47% of respondents reporting hypofractionation use in ≥50% of patients, respectively. These rates drop to 35% and 20% in high-risk prostate cancer and where pelvic irradiation is indicated. Most respondents (89%) preferred hypofractionation in the palliative setting. Overall, respondents from upper-middle-income countries and lower-middle- and low-income countries were significantly less likely to prefer hypofractionation than those from HICs (<i>P</i> < .001). The most frequently cited justification and barrier were availability of published evidence and fear of worse late toxicity, respectively. Hypofractionation preference varies by indication and World Bank income group, with greater acceptance among providers in HICs for all indications. These results provide a basis for targeted interventions to increase provider acceptance of this treatment modality.",JCO global oncology,2023-Jun,"Sabbagh A, Weiss J, Tawk B, Mohammed MA, Abdulbaki H, Moraes FY, Grover S, Yap ML, Zubizarreta E, Lievens Y, Rodin D, Mohamad O",12,2102,oncology,2025-11-22

The Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry Study aims to identify signals of drug activity when Food and Drug Administration approved drugs are matched to pre-specified genomic targets in patients with advanced cancer outside of their approved indication(s). The objectives of the study are to generate evidence of potential signals of activity in targeted therapies prescribed in an off-label setting as well as to expose and educate community cancer centers to genomic testing and precision medicine through the study protocol. The principles of pragmatic trial design can be applied across a broad spectrum of evidence-generation strategies, from explanatory trials to real-world evidence studies, and are briefly discussed. American Society of Clinical Oncology's Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry Study falls closer to the pragmatic end of this spectrum as it seeks to assess the efficacy of Food and Drug Administration approved drugs used outside their approved indications under usual care conditions, yielding results generalizable to the population that would likely receive the intervention in practice, while still adhering to rigorous data quality standards. The Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry Study's pragmatic objectives, characteristics, strengths, and limitations in its implementation are discussed and demonstrate that a large, multi-center, precision medicine basket trial can be mounted in the context of community practice and can generate clinically useful information with minimal burden to patients and clinical trial sites.","Clinical trials (London, England)",2023-Dec,"Mangat PK, Garrett-Mayer E, Perez JK, Schilsky RL",4,1874,oncology,2025-11-22
34409769,The risks associated with the widespread use of telemedicine in oncology: Four cases and review of the literature.,"COVID-19 changed the way we practice oncology in multiple ways. Because most cancer patients are comorbid or immunocompromised, we are trying as much as possible to reduce their risk of infection. Marginal just 2 years ago, telemedicine quickly became preeminent with the pandemic to reduce hospital exposure. However, using only virtual visits in oncology patients risk delaying cancer diagnosis or the identification of a complication. We present here four cases where a serious medical problem evident on physical exam was overlooked during a virtual visit. Two of our patients experienced a delay in cancer diagnosis thus putting them at risk of local or distant spread. The two others were established oncology patients where a serious medical complication was missed on a virtual visit. Now more than a year into the pandemic, telemedicine has clearly been a useful tool by limiting unnecessary hospital visits. Yet, as our cases illustrate, its use in oncology without clear boundary can undermine the quality of care. Now that effective vaccines are reducing the transmission and the severity of infection, most oncology patients can be evaluated by a real-time visit.","Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",2022-Jul,"Panet F, Tétreault-Langlois M, Morin V, Sultanem K, Melnychuk D, Panasci L",6,1176,oncology,2025-11-22

Hepatic arterial embolotherapy techniques include transarterial chemoembolization (tace) and bland embolization (tae). The relative efficacy of the techniques is controversial. The purpose of the present study was to use a meta-analysis and systematic review to compare tace with tae in the treatment of hepatic metastases. A literature search identified studies comparing tace and tae for treatment of hepatic metastases. Outcomes of interest included overall survival (os), progression-free survival (pfs), radiographic response, complications, and symptom control.

However, there is a paucity of literature discussing experience and technique of RTS. This study aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive review of RTS for DTC, utilizing experiences from a dedicated complex thyroid surgical oncology program at the apex hospital in a developing country. A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the Department of Surgical Oncology's thyroid cancer database. The study period spanned from 2006 to 2022. Clinical presentation, prior surgical history, operative details of RTS, and post-operative outcomes were assessed. Descriptive analysis was performed. During the study period, a total of 182 patients underwent re-operative thyroid surgery (RTS). The primary surgeries performed prior to RTS included near-total or total thyroidectomy in most cases (69.2%), and approximately half of the patients (48.4%) had prior neck node interventions. The RTS procedures consisted of completion total thyroidectomy in 30.8% of cases and surgery for thyroid bed recurrence in 9.9% of cases, while central node dissection was performed in 46.2% of patients and unilateral or bilateral template neck dissection was performed in 41.8% of cases. Extended resections were required in 9.3% of patients. Post-operative complications included permanent hypoparathyroidism (2.7%) and unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (1.6%).

33805031,Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer: Review of the Evidence and Conditions That Facilitated Its Use during the Global Pandemic.,"Practice and behaviour change in healthcare is complex, and requires a set of critical steps that would be needed to implement and sustain the change. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer is traditionally used for locally advanced disease and is primarily advantageous for surgical downstaging purposes. However, it does also offer patients with certain biologic subtypes such as the triple negative or Her2 positive breast cancers the opportunity to improve survival, even in early stage disease. During the height of the pandemic, an opportunity and motivation for the increased use of neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer was identified. This paper describes the conditions that have supported this practice change at the provider and institutional levels. We also include our own institutional algorithm based on tumor biology and extent of disease that have guided our decisions on breast cancer management during the pandemic. Our processes can be adapted by other institutions and breast oncology practices in accordance with local conditions and resources, during and beyond the pandemic.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-Mar,"Tse T, Sehdev S, Seely J, Gravel DH, Clemons M, Cordeiro E, Arnaout A",7,1102,oncology,2025-11-22

A search of PubMed, grey literature, and official websites of relevant international organizations was performed from January 2022 to March 2023. Six frameworks were identified and analyzed, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology's assessment framework, European Society for Medical Oncology's Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's Evidence Blocks, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's DrugAbacus, Institute for Clinical and Economic Review's assessment framework, and the Drug Assessment Framework. Comparisons across frameworks were challenging, owing to differing approaches, objectives, perspectives, methodology, and criteria. Based on the results of the EV-301 study (NCT03474107), the European Society for Medical Oncology's Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale assigned a score of 4 out of 5 to enfortumab vedotin administered after chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network's Evidence Blocks enabled assessment of enfortumab vedotin compared with other treatments for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, resulting in the positioning of enfortumab vedotin as a preferred regimen after chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Application of value frameworks in oncology can contribute to informed value-based decision-making. However, comparisons across frameworks should be made with caution and limited to the same lines of treatment. Enfortumab vedotin may contribute to optimizing outcomes in patients previously treated with chemotherapy and immunotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma.",Journal of medical economics,2024-,"Ortiz Nunez A, Gonzalez Portela J, Zozaya N, Fernández I",4,1832,oncology,2025-11-22

Herein, we evaluate the optimal sequencing of ADT with prostate-directed RT in localized PCa. MEDLINE (1966-2018), Embase (1982-2018), ClinicalTrials.gov, and conference proceedings (1990-2018) were searched to identify randomized trials evaluating the sequencing, but not duration, of ADT with RT. Two randomized phase III trials were identified, and individual patient data were obtained: Ottawa 0101 and NRG Oncology's Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9413. Ottawa 0101 randomly assigned patients to neoadjuvant or concurrent versus concurrent or adjuvant short-term ADT. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9413, a 2 × 2 factorial trial, included a random assignment of neoadjuvant or concurrent versus adjuvant short-term ADT. The neoadjuvant or concurrent ADT arms of both trials were combined into the neoadjuvant group, and the arms receiving adjuvant ADT were combined into the adjuvant group. The primary end point of this meta-analysis was progression-free survival (PFS). The median follow-up was 14.9 years. Overall, 1,065 patients were included (531 neoadjuvant and 534 adjuvant). PFS was significantly improved in the adjuvant group (15-year PFS, 29% <i>v</i> 36%, hazard ratio [HR], 1.25 [95% CI, 1.07 to 1.47], <i>P</i> = .01). Biochemical failure (subdistribution HR [sHR], 1.37 [95% CI, 1.12 to 1.68], <i>P</i> = .002), distant metastasis (sHR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.95], <i>P</i> = .04), and metastasis-free survival (HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.37], <i>P</i> = .050) were all significantly improved in the adjuvant group. There were no differences in late grade ≥ 3 gastrointestinal (2% <i>v</i> 3%, <i>P</i> = .33) or genitourinary toxicity (5% <i>v</i> 5%, <i>P</i> = .76) between groups.

In particular, the need for real-world evidence in Canada is not matched by the necessary infrastructure and technologies required to integrate genomic and clinical data. Since healthcare systems in many developed nations face similar challenges, we adopted a solutions-based approach and conducted a search of worldwide programs in personalized medicine, with an emphasis on precision oncology. This search strategy included review articles published between 1 January 2016 and 1 March 2021 and hand-searches of their reference lists for relevant publications back to 1 December 2005. Thirty-nine initiatives across 37 countries in Europe, Australasia, Africa, and the Americas had the potential to lead to real-world data (RWD) on the clinical utility of oncology biomarkers. We highlight four initiatives with helpful lessons for Canada: Genomic Medicine France 2025, UNICANCER, the German Medical Informatics Initiative, and CANCER-ID. Among the 35 other programs evaluated, the main themes included the need for collaboration and systems to support data harmonization across multiple jurisdictions. In order to generate RWD in precision oncology that will prove acceptable to HTA bodies, Canada must take a national approach to biomarker strategy and unite all stakeholders at the highest level to overcome jurisdictional and technological barriers.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2022-Sep,"Liu G, Cheung WY, Feilotter H, Manthorne J, Stockley T, Yeung M, Renouf DJ",7,1599,oncology,2025-11-22

This editorial explores the economic barriers to pediatric oncology care in LMICs, highlighting resource scarcity, socioeconomic inequities, and health care complexities. It emphasizes the need for detailed cost analysis within health systems complicated by inadequate data and variable treatment protocols. Central to the discussion is the ""Childhood Cancers Budgeting Rapidly to Incorporate Disadvantaged Groups for Equity (CC-BRIDGE) Tool"" from the manuscript by Nancy Bolous et al., who proposed an innovative method to estimate the cost of integrating childhood cancer services into National Cancer Control Plans. This tool aligns with the World Health Organization's Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer to enhance survival rates and advocate for universal health coverage in pediatric oncology. The CC-BRIDGE tool's methodological rigor provides a structured framework for cost analysis. Yet, it is recognized as an initial step requiring further enhancements for comprehensive economic forecasting and societal cost assessments. In conclusion, the editorial highlights the tool's critical role in incorporating childhood cancer care into national strategies in LMICs, contributing to the broader fight against cancer and advocating for comprehensive, equitable health care. It signifies a vital stride toward addressing pediatric oncology's economic challenges and supporting universal health coverage for childhood cancer care.",Cancer,2024-Apr,Fuentes-Alabi S,1,1648,oncology,2025-11-22
38785472,Best Practices for Managing Patients with Unresectable Metastatic Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer in Canada.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common types of cancer and is associated with relatively low survival rates. Despite its considerable burden, there is limited guidance for Canadian clinicians on the management of unresectable metastatic GC and gastroesophageal junction cancer (GEJC). Therefore, we aimed to discuss best practices and provide expert recommendations for patient management within the current Canadian unresectable GC and GEJC landscape. A multidisciplinary group of Canadian healthcare practitioners was assembled to develop expert recommendations via a working group. The often-rapid progression of unresectable GC and GEJC and the associated malnutrition have a significant impact on the patient's quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment. Hence, recommendations include early diagnosis, identification of relevant biomarkers to improve personalized treatment, and relevant support to manage comorbidities. A multidisciplinary approach including early access to registered dietitians, personal support networks, and palliative care services, is needed to optimize possible outcomes for patients. Where possible, patients with unresectable GC and GEJC would benefit from access to clinical trials and innovative treatments.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2024-Apr,"Snow S, Gabrielson D, Lim H, Tehfe M, Brezden-Masley C",5,1256,oncology,2025-11-22
35195776,Forward to a methodological proposal to support cancer patients: the dialogics' contribution for the precision care.,"In scientific context, the first step for scientific theoretical and methodological production is the epistemological analysis. What are assumptions for interaction between oncology and psychology? What are the conditions for psycho-oncological contribution in treating cancer? Furthermore, what are epistemological observations about the current developments in cancer field? And what are implications for sciences treating patients with neoplasms? Due to advances in oncology and in sciences supporting oncology, epistemological questions focus on the object of study of the integration between oncology and psychology. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to describe a proposal of theoretical and methodological frame suitable for current clinical and research needs in cancer patients asking for psychological support. Epistemological analysis lets the health professionals and researchers observe there are sciences using formal languages and sciences using ordinary language. Currently, personalized approach is pursued by oncology, identifying specific patients' characteristics to define the proper treatment process: not only tumor characteristics but also behavioral and psychological features. Cancer patients features can be found in patients' narrations about neoplasms: narration represents the core of clinical and research in psychoncology. Therefore when formalized, language provides the connection between oncology and psychology. Language used by patients and all the roles involved in the care of cancer patients can become a measure of these patients' features. Dialogics science measuring the ordinary language allows the ordinary language formalization, pursuing a personalized medicine.","Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",2022-Feb,"Pinto E, Alfieri R, Orrù L, Dalla Riva MS, Turchi GP",5,1715,oncology,2025-11-22
33343209,Role of immunotherapy in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma: current standards and future directions.,"The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib was the only approved systemic therapy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) for about a decade. In recent years, the number of approved agents has increased significantly as a result of a number of positive phase iii clinical trials. Lenvatinib as a first-line treatment, and regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab in the second-line setting are now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (fda) and the European Medicines Agency. In phase ii studies, immunotherapy with nivolumab and monotherapy using pembrolizumab yielded impressive results for overall survival in therapy-naïve and pretreated patients, leading to the accelerated approval by the fda of nivolumab and pembrolizumab for second-line treatment. However, phase iii trials of nivolumab in the first line and pembrolizumab in the second line as single agents failed to reach statistical significance, although clinical benefit for a subset of patients with long durations of response could be demonstrated. Despite that setback, immunotherapy for hcc is a promising therapeutic approach, and the combination of immunotherapy with other treatment modalities such as monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or local therapies has the potential to increase the overall response rate and survival. Recently, the results of a phase iii trial of combination atezolizumab-bevacizumab compared with sorafenib showed a highly significant survival benefit and median overall survival that was not reached in the immunotherapy arm, making the combination the preferred standard of care in first-line therapy. Despite the impressive results and generally good toxicity profile of immunotherapy, patients who respond to therapy constitute only a subset of the overall population, and response rates are still limited. This review focuses on the currently reported results and ongoing clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapy in hcc.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Nov,"Weinmann A, Galle PR",2,1969,oncology,2025-11-22

36549346,Patient Perceptions of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Data Collection in an Outpatient Radiation Oncology Setting.,"Sexual and gender minority patients with cancer experience significant health disparities requiring tailored care. Collecting sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data in the electronic medical record (EMR) could allow care to be tailored and is in line with radiation oncology's mission to better serve diverse patients. This article describes a systematic method for collecting SOGI data for all patients starting radiation treatment in a department of radiation oncology (DRO). During a 3-month experimental period, DRO staff administered a demographic questionnaire and attitude survey to new adult patients. SOGI demographic data, entered into the EMR by nursing staff, were extracted and analyzed for all patients from the experimental period and from the 3 months prior (control period). Descriptive and categorical data completion rates were compared between the experimental and control periods using independent-samples t tests and Pearson χ<sup>2</sup> tests. A total of 788 patients were included in this analysis: 368 in the control period and 420 in the experimental period. Of the 420 patients enrolled in the experimental period, 267 (63.6%) were offered a survey, of whom 211 (79.0%) completed the survey. There were higher rates of sexual orientation responses entered into the EMR for the experimental group compared with the control group (56.9% vs 27.1%; P <.001), with the highest response rates for patients who completed a survey (82.9%). Ten patients (2.9%) identified as gay or lesbian and 100% identified as cisgender. The majority of patients were not upset by the form, with only 11 patients (5.2%) stating that any specific question caused them distress. Collecting SOGI data via a demographic form is feasible in an outpatient DRO. This approach was well received by the majority of patients and could lead to provision of higher-quality, tailored care.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",2023-May,"Doucette C, Milano MT, Kamen C",3,1893,oncology,2025-11-22
33068550,The SIOP-Renal Tumour Study Group consensus statement on flank target volume delineation for highly conformal radiotherapy.,"For decades, radiotherapy with two opposing photon beams has been the standard technique used to cover the flank target volume in paediatric patients with renal tumours. Nowadays, many institutes are implementing advanced radiotherapy techniques that spare healthy tissue. To decrease the radiotherapy dose to healthy structures while preserving oncological efficacy, the conventional approach of flank irradiation has been adapted into a guideline for highly conformal flank target-volume delineation by paediatric radiation oncologists and representatives of the International Society of Paediatric Oncology's Renal Tumour Study Group (SIOP-RTSG) board during four live international consensus meetings. The consensus was refined by delineation exercises and videoconferences by ten collaborating paediatric radiation oncologists. The final guideline includes eight chronological steps to generate the tumour bed and clinical, internal, and planning target volumes, and it describes the optional use of surgical clips to optimise treatment planning. This guideline will be added into the radiotherapy guideline of the UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG protocol for paediatric renal tumours to improve international consistency of highly conformal flank target-volume delineation.",The Lancet.

32218664,A systematic review and network meta-analysis of adjuvant therapy for curatively resected biliary tract cancers.,"Recent randomized controlled trials (rcts) have contributed high-quality data about adjuvant therapy in curatively resected biliary tract cancer (btc); however, a standard approach to treating those patients still has not been developed. We conducted a systematic review of published studies and abstracts up to and including June 2018, choosing rcts involving patients with btc receiving adjuvant chemotherapy after complete surgical resection. Network meta-analysis methods were used for indirect comparisons of overall survival (os) and relapse-free survival (rfs) for various adjuvant therapies. Five rcts were included in qualitative synthesis, and three rcts (bilcap, prodige 12-accord 18, and bcat) had data sufficient for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Results from the indirect comparison demonstrated no significant improvement in os for capecitabine compared with gemcitabine or with gemcitabine-oxaliplatin (gemox), the hazard ratios (hrs) being 0.82 [95% confidence interval (ci): 0.53 to 1.27] and 0.86 (95% ci: 0.56 to 1.34) respectively. Similarly, no significant improvement in rfs was observed for capecitabine compared with gemcitabine or gemox. Although in the present analysis, we found no statistically significant improvements in os or rfs for capecitabine compared with gemox or gemcitabine, capecitabine can-until further prospective trials are completed-be considered the standard of care in the adjuvant setting based on a single randomized phase iii study.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Feb,"Kish M, Chan K, Perry K, Ko YJ",4,1485,oncology,2025-11-22

36592721,"Five-Year Patient-Reported Outcomes in NRG Oncology RTOG 0938, Evaluating Two Ultrahypofractionated Regimens for Prostate Cancer.","There is considerable interest in very short (ultrahypofractionated) radiation therapy regimens to treat prostate cancer based on potential radiobiological advantages, patient convenience, and resource allocation benefits. Our objective is to demonstrate that detectable changes in health-related quality of life measured by the bowel and urinary domains of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-50) were not substantially worse than baseline scores. NRG Oncology's RTOG 0938 is a nonblinded randomized phase 2 study of National Comprehensive Cancer Network low-risk prostate cancer in which each arm is compared with a historical control. Patients were randomized to 5 fractions (7.25 Gy in 2 week and a day [twice a week]) or 12 fractions (4.3Gy in 2.5 weeks [5 times a week]). Secondary objectives assessed patient-reported toxicity at 5 years using the EPIC. Chi-square tests were used to assess the proportion of patients with a deterioration from baseline of >5 points for bowel, >2 points for urinary, and >11 points for sexual score. The study enrolled 127 patients to 5 fractions (121 eligible) and 128 patients to 12 fractions (125 eligible). The median follow-up for all patients at the time of analysis was 5.38 years. The 5-year frequency for >5 point change in bowel score were 38.4% (P = .27) and 23.4% (P = 0.98) for 5 and 12 fractions, respectively. The 5-year frequencies for >2 point change in urinary score were 46.6% (P = .15) and 36.4% (P = .70) for 5 and 12 fractions, respectively. For 5 fractions, 49.3% (P = .007) of patients had a drop in 5-year EPIC-50 sexual score of ≥11 points; for 12 fractions, 54% (P < .001) of patients had a drop in 5-year EPIC-50 sexual score of ≥11 points. Disease-free survival at 5 years is 89.6% (95% CI: 84.0-95.2) in the 5-fraction arm and 92.3% (95% CI: 87.4-97.1) in the 12-fraction arm. There was no late grade 4 or 5 treatment-related urinary or bowel toxicity. This study confirms that, based on long-term changes in bowel and urinary domains and toxicity, the 5- and 12-fraction regimens are well tolerated. These ultrahypofractionated approaches need to be compared with current standard radiation therapy regimens.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",2023-Jul,"Lukka HR, Deshmukh S, Bruner DW, Bahary JP, Lawton CAF, Efstathiou JA, Kudchadker RJ, Ponsky LE, Seaward SA, Dayes IS, Gopaul DD, Michalski JM, Delouya G, Kaplan ID, Horwitz EM, Roach M, Feng FY, Pugh SL, Sandler HM, Kachnic LA",20,2194,oncology,2025-11-22

Likely due to an <i>in situ</i> vaccine effect of radiotherapy, the abscopal effect may be augmented by immunotherapy. This report is the first case of the abscopal effect observed in metastatic head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (hnscc) treated with concurrent radiotherapy and single-agent nivolumab. An otherwise healthy 57-year-old man underwent craniofacial resection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for advanced sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma. Distant metastatic disease developed shortly after primary treatment, and immunotherapy in the form of nivolumab was initiated. Subsequent oligometastatic progression despite immunotherapy prompted palliative radiotherapy to a single metastasis due to pending symptomatology. Post-radiotherapy, the abscopal effect was observed with all distant sites of metastatic disease shrinking. Five months following treatment, a sustained reduction in disease burden has been demonstrated. We present the first case of the abscopal effect in a patient with metastatic hnscc treated with palliative radiotherapy concurrent with single-agent nivolumab immunotherapy, and only the third case of the abscopal effect in metastatic head-and-neck cancer. Dual treatment with immunotherapy and radiotherapy may be an important treatment option in the future, mediated through the abscopal effect.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Forner D, Horwich P, Trites JR, Hollenhorst H, Bullock M, Lamond NWD",6,1496,oncology,2025-11-22

33540881,A Multidisciplinary Approach to Implement Personalized Breast Cancer Treatment and Care Plans.,"Implementation of survivorship care plans remain a challenge. This quality improvement initiative aims to integrate personalized treatment plans (PTP) and care plans (PCP) into the existing workflow for breast cancer (BC) patients. <b>Methods:</b> Phase 1 was to identify multidisciplinary team members to generate and deliver PTP and PCP. Concurrently, Phase 2 was to deliver PTP and PCP to newly diagnosed invasive BC patients at chemotherapy initiation and completion, respectively. Iterative plan, do, study, act (PDSA) cycles were applied to refine the process. The proportion of information completed for PTP and PCP generation and its delivery by the care team were measured. Patient and provider satisfaction were also assessed. <b>Implementation Process and Results:</b> The care transfer facilitator (CTF) was identified to complete and deliver PTP, and their data entry increased from 0% to 76%, 80%, 92% consecutively during the last 4 PDSA cycles. PTP and PCP were provided to 85% of eligible BC patients. Patients agreed that PTP helped them to actively participate in their care (88%) and communicate with the oncology care team (86%). Primary care physicians agreed that PTP and PCP had the information needed to ""stay in the loop"" (80%), and oncologists agreed they should be incorporated into oncology clinics (100%). <b>Conclusions:</b> Integrating PTP and PCP generation and delivery into existing workflow has led to an increase in uptake, sustainability and provider buy-in. With limited resources, it remains difficult to find care team members to complete the forms. A dedicated personnel or survivorship clinic is required to successfully implement PTP and PCP as the standard of care.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-Feb,"Haq R, Kong A, Gulasingam P",3,1710,oncology,2025-11-22
32218663,Patient and physician perceptions of lung cancer care in a multidisciplinary clinic model.,"Lung cancer (lc) is a complex disease requiring coordination of multiple health care professionals. A recently implemented lc multidisciplinary clinic (mdc) at Kingston Health Sciences Centre, an academic tertiary care hospital, improved timeliness of oncology assessment and treatment.

Thematic design by open coding in the ATLAS.ti software application (ATLAS.ti Scientific Software Development, Berlin, Germany) was used to analyze the data. Participation by 6 of 72 identified patients from the traditional model and 6 of 40 identified patients from the mdc model was obtained. Of 9 physicians who provided care in both models, 8 were interviewed (2 respirologists, 2 medical oncologists, 4 radiation oncologists). Four themes emerged: communication and collaboration, efficiency, quality of care, and effect on patient outcomes. Patients in both models had positive impressions of their care. Patients in the mdc frequently reported convenience and a positive effect of family presence at appointments. Physicians reported that the mdc improved communication and collegiality, clinic efficiency, patient outcomes and satisfaction, and consistency of information provided to patients.

We launched a Multidisciplinary LC Clinic (MDC), where patients with a new LC diagnosis received concurrent oncology consultation, resulting in improved time to LC assessment and treatment. Here, we evaluate the impact of MDC on health resource utilization, patient and caregiver costs, and secondary patient benefits. <b>Methods</b>: We retrospectively analyzed patients in a rapid assessment clinic with a new LC diagnosis pre-MDC (September 2016-February 2017) and post-MDC implementation (February 2017-December 2018). Data are reported as means; unpaired t-tests and ANOVA were used to assess for significance. We also conducted a cost analysis. Resource utilization, out-of-pocket costs, procedure-related costs, and indirect costs were evaluated from the societal perspective and presented in 2019 Canadian dollars (CAD); multi-way worst/best case and threshold sensitivity analyses were conducted. <b>Results</b>: We reviewed 428 patients (78 traditional model, 350 MDC). Patients in the MDC model required significantly fewer oncology visits from LC diagnosis to first LC treatment (1.62 vs. 2.68, <i>p</i> < 0.001), which was significant for patients with stage 1, 3, and 4 disease. Compared with the traditional model, there was no change in mean biopsies/patient (1.32 traditional vs. 1.17 MDC, <i>p</i> = 0.18) or staging investigations/patient (2.24 traditional vs. 2.02 MDC, <i>p</i> = 0.20). Post-MDC, there was an increase in invasive mediastinal staging for patients with stage 2/3 LC (15.0% vs. 60.0%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Over 22 months, MDC resulted in savings of CAD 48,389 including CAD 24,167 CAD in direct patient out-of-pocket expenses. For the threshold analyses, MDC was estimated to cost CAD 25,708 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), considered to be below current willingness to pay thresholds (at CAD 80,000 per QALY). MDC also facilitated oncology assessment for 29 non-LC patients. <b>Conclusions</b>: An MDC led to a reduction in patient visits and direct patient and caregiver costs.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-Apr,"Stone CJL, Johnson AP, Robinson D, Katyukha A, Egan R, Linton S, Parker C, Robinson A, Digby GC",9,2093,oncology,2025-11-22
35673010,POKR: Building a Computable Heterogeneous Knowledge Resource for Precision Oncology.,"Precision oncology is expected to improve selection of targeted therapies, tailored to individual patients and ultimately improve cancer patients' outcomes. Several cancer genetics knowledge databases have been successfully developed for such purposes, including CIViC and OncoKB, with active community-based curations and scoring of genetic-treatment evidences. Although many studies were conducted based on each knowledge base respectively, the integrative analysis across both knowledge bases remains largely unexplored. Thus, there exists an urgent need for a heterogeneous precision oncology knowledge resource with computational power to support drug repurposing discovery in a timely manner, especially for life-threatening cancer. In this pilot study, we built a heterogeneous precision oncology knowledge resource (POKR) by integrating CIViC and OncoKB, in order to incorporate unique information contained in each knowledge base and make associations amongst biomedical entities (e.g., gene, drug, disease) computable and measurable via training POKR graph embeddings.

Inclusion criteria were defined according to the APBI American Society for Radiation Oncology's ASTRO Evidence-Based Consensus Statement. The prescribed dose was 26 to 28 Gy in 5 fractions on 5 consecutive days. Regular follow-up visits with objective and subjective evaluation of treatment tolerance were performed after 0 and 2 weeks, 6 months, and at annual intervals. Between February 2017 and January 2020, 175 patients with breast conserving surgery met the inclusion criteria for APBI. Mean age was 65.7 years (range, 46-88). Thirteen percent of patients received a diagnosis with carcinoma in situ, 55%, 35%, and 37% with T1a/b/c, and 10% with T2 stages, respectively. The mean volume of planning target volume (PTV) was 119 cc (range, 45-465), the ratio of mean PTV: whole breast volume ratio was 21% (7%-53%). Mean follow-up was 42 months (median, 45, range, 0-67). Acute toxicity after 2 weeks was low with 69%, 26%, and 5% grade 0, 1, and 2. In addition, 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year follow-up data were available from 146, 134, 107, 73, and 25 patients. Patient-reported cosmetic outcomes were assessed excellent or good in 97.9%, 98.5%, 98.1%, 98.6%, and 100%. Regarding grade 2 toxicities, as by now 3%, 2%, 2%, 0%, and 0% G2 fibrosis, 1%, 1%, 0%, 0%, and 0% G2 atrophy, no G2 skin telangiectasia or breast edema occurred. So far, none of the patients have experienced G3 toxicity or higher. The remaining patients had grade 0 or 1 toxicity only. Five ipsilateral breast recurrences (1 marginally to PTV, 4 out-of-field) and 5 distant recurrences were recorded by March 2023. The 4-year in-breast recurrence rate was 2.5%. Eight patients died, with 2 of them from disease. For all patients, the 4-year overall, cancer specific and disease-free survival rates were 97.1%, 99.4%, and 95.3%, respectively.

33494312,Integrating Patient-Centred Research in the Canadian Cancer Trials Group.,"The inclusion of patients as partners in research is a key link in the delivery of patient-centred care in healthcare systems. Despite genuine intentions to engage patients in authentic partnerships, efforts can result in tokenism and benefits of engagement are missed. Understanding how patient engagement provides value along the research to patient-care continuum and how to best engage patients as partners are key. This document describes the method taken by the Canadian Cancer Trials Group (CCTG) to implement meaningful patient centricity and engagement and the benefits realized. Originally, Patient Representatives were recruited and assigned to CCTG Committees. Lacking guidance, the role was one of a passive meeting attendee. A gap analysis identified a need for clarity in expectations, understanding of the linkage to CCTG strategic objectives, and supporting tools and training. A plan was developed and successfully implemented in three phases, each phase building on the previous, the level of patient engagement simultaneously changing from ""Inform"" to ""Involve"" to ""Collaborate"" on the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) scale. Results include significant contributions to increased patient accrual in CCTG trials, to increased CCTG grant funding, as well as recognition and adoption of these practices within Canada and internationally.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-Jan,"Needham J, Taylor J, Nomikos D",3,1380,oncology,2025-11-22

32489269,"Health care provider preferences for, and barriers to, cannabis use in cancer care.","Limited research has been conducted about the perspectives of oncology health care providers (hcps) concerning the use of cannabis in cancer care and their potential role in advising patients. We sought to determine the barriers encountered by hcps with respect to medical cannabis and their preferred practices in this area. An anonymous survey about cannabis was distributed to oncology hcps at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary, Alberta. The 45-question survey measured the opinions of hcps about cannabis use and authorization in oncology. Of 103 oncology hcps who participated in the study, 75% were women. By hcp type, the most commonly reported professional groups were oncology nurse (40%), radiation therapist (9%), and pharmacist (6%). Of respondents, 75% reported providing direct care to cancer patients. More than half (69%) had spoken to a patient about cannabis in the preceding month, and 84% believed that they lacked sufficient knowledge about cannabis to make recommendations. Barriers such as monitoring the patient's use of cannabis (54%), prescribing an accurate dose (61%) or strain (53%), and having insufficient research (50%) were most commonly reported. More than half of hcps (53%) would be interested in receiving more information or training about the use of cannabis in oncology. The survey indicated that this group of oncology hcps believed that they lacked sufficient knowledge about cannabis to make recommendations to patients. In addition to that lack of knowledge, a number of notable barriers were reported, and more than half the hcps indicated interest in learning more about cannabis in the future.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"McLennan A, Kerba M, Subnis U, Campbell T, Carlson LE",5,1645,oncology,2025-11-22

33380881,Expression of PD-L1 for predicting response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic urothelial carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"We conducted this meta-analysis and systematic literature review to study the ability of PD-L1 to predict objective response in patients with urothelial cancer treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Relevant studies of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors in urothelial cancer that reported objective response rate (orr) based on PD-L1 expression status in PubMed, embase, and the Cochrane Library were retrieved. Efficacy of PD-L1 expression status in predicting orr and the efficacy, safety of PD-1 and PD-L1 drugs were analyzed. Studies were divided into ≥1%, ≥5%, and ≥25% based on PD-L1 positivity threshold, and the patients were grouped into PD-L1 positive and negative. In all 3 expression thresholds, patients with positive PD-L1 expression were more likely to experience an objective response [≥1% threshold odds ratio (or): 1.74; 95% confidence interval (ci): 1.20 to 2.53; ≥5% threshold or: 2.74; 95% ci: 2.01 to 3.724; ≥25% threshold or: 7.13; 95% ci: 2.38 to 21.40] in comparison with patients with negative PD-L1 expression. Of the 3 thresholds, the ≥25% threshold was better in predicting orr (1.74 vs. 2.93 vs. 7.13; <i>p</i> < 0.0001). The ≥1% PD-L1 threshold had a relatively high sensitivity in predicting orr; the ≥5% PD-L1 threshold was better for specificity. Sensitivity was higher at the ≥25% threshold than at the other two thresholds, but specificity was lower. Further, we found that there is no statistically significant difference in efficacy between PD-1 and PD-L1 drugs. Urothelial cancer patients with PD-L1 positive expression responded better than PD-L1 negative patients did, and a threshold of ≥5% or greater for PD-L1 expression might predict positive clinical response.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Huang J, Teng X",2,1693,oncology,2025-11-22
33173380,Prevention and treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis.,"Cancer is a hypercoagulable state with an associated increased risk of venous thromboembolism (vte) that is further amplified in individuals who undergo chemotherapy. Compared with patients having cancer alone or vte alone, patients who develop cancer-associated vte have a significantly poorer prognosis. The risks of recurrent vte despite appropriate anticoagulation therapy and of bleeding are also higher in patients with cancer than in those without. For those reasons, the prevention and appropriate management of cancer-associated thrombosis is of paramount importance. Although low-molecular-weight heparin has been the standard of care for the prevention and treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis, direct oral anticoagulants are increasingly being adopted as an effective and safe alternative.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Oct,"Ng S, Carrier M",2,806,oncology,2025-11-22
31932259,The underreporting of phase III chemo-therapeutic clinical trial data of older patients with cancer: A systematic review.,"Inspired by the American Society of Clinical Oncology's recommendations to strengthen the evidence base for older adults with cancer, the purpose of this systematic review is to identify the reporting of treatment efficacy and adverse events specific to older adults with cancer in Phase III chemo-therapeutic clinical trials. This review also investigates the frequency with which these data points were reported in the literature to identify gaps in reporting and opportunities to expand the knowledge base on clinical outcomes for older adults with cancer. Chemo-therapeutic clinical trial data published from July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017 was reviewed. Manuscripts (n = 929) were identified based on keyword searches of EMBASE and PubMed. After removal of duplicates (n = 116) and articles that did not meet this study's inclusion criteria (n = 654), 159 articles were identified for review. Reviewed papers were published in 36 different scientific journals and included twenty-five different cancer types. Of the 159 articles, 117 (73.6%) reported age-specific medians and 75 (47.2%) included stratifications of data by age. Treatment efficacy was reported in 96.2% of the articles with 39.9% reporting effectiveness of treatment by age. Reporting of adverse events was included in 84.9% of the articles with only 8.9% reporting these events stratified by age. Results suggest inadequate reporting of treatment efficacy and adverse events as well as basic descriptive statistics about the age distribution of study subjects. Conscious efforts are needed to address these deficiencies at every level of planning and conducting clinical trials as wells as reporting outcomes stratified by age. Ultimately, standardized reporting could lead to improved treatment decisions and outcomes for older adults with cancer.",Journal of geriatric oncology,2020-Apr,"BrintzenhofeSzoc K, Krok-Schoen JL, Canin B, Parker I, MacKenzie AR, Koll T, Vankina R, Hsu CD, Jang B, Pan K, Lund JL, Starbuck E, Shahrokni A",13,1818,oncology,2025-11-22
33173388,The risk of diarrhea and colitis in patients with lung cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (icis), including inhibitors of PD-1, PD-L1, and ctla-4, are relatively novel therapies for lung cancer, although their use might be limited by gastrointestinal toxicity. The aim of the present study was to determine the risk of diarrhea and colitis associated with icis in lung cancer and the rates of discontinuation because of those toxicities. Electronic databases were searched for prospective trials reporting the risk of diarrhea and colitis in patients with lung cancer treated with PD-1, PD-L1, and ctla-4 inhibitors. The incidences of diarrhea and colitis and their grades were assessed clinically using standardized reporting criteria. Pooled incidence and weighted relative risk estimates for diarrhea and colitis with 95% confidence intervals (cis) were estimated using a random effects model. The incidence of discontinuations for gi toxicity was also calculated. Twenty-seven studies were included: sixteen studies with PD-1 inhibitors, nine studies with PD-L1 inhibitors, and four studies combining PD-based strategies with ctla-4 inhibitors. The incidence of all-grade diarrhea was 9.1% (95% ci: 7.8% to 10.5%) for anti-PD-1 therapy and 11.0% (95% ci: 7.5% to 14.5%) for anti-PD-L1 therapy. The incidence of all-grade colitis was 0.9% (95% ci: 0.4% to 1.3%) for anti-PD-1 therapy and 0.4% (95% ci: 0.0% to 0.8%) for anti-PD-L1 therapy. The relative risk for all-grade diarrhea was higher with combination anti-PD-1 and anti-ctla-4 than with anti-PD-1 monotherapy (relative risk: 1.61; 95% ci: 1.14 to 2.29). Anti-PD-1 therapy was discontinued in 4.1% of patients with diarrhea (95% ci: 0.7% to 7.4%) and in 35.7% of those with colitis (95% ci: 0.0% to 81.1%); combination therapy was discontinued in 10.1% of patients with diarrhea (95% ci: 4.8% to 15.4%) and in 39.9% of those with colitis (95% ci: 3.9% to 75.9%). Diarrhea is a relatively frequently encountered gi toxicity when ici therapy is used in lung cancer treatment. Colitis is less frequently encountered, although when it does occur, it often results in therapy discontinuation.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Oct,"Bishay K, Tandon P, Bourassa-Blanchette S, Laurie SA, McCurdy JD",5,2086,oncology,2025-11-22

CheckMate 218 is a North American expanded-access program (eap) of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma. Here, we report safety and survival outcomes for the Canadian cohort in the eap. Eligible patients were those 18 years of age or older with unresectable stage iii or iv melanoma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and no prior anti-PD-1 or anti-ctla-4 therapy. Patients were treated with nivolumab 1 mg/kg and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles (induction phase); they then continued with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (maintenance phase) until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 48 weeks, whichever occurred first. Safety and overall survival (os) data were collected. Of 194 patients enrolled, 174 were treated, and 51% continued on nivolumab maintenance. Median follow-up was 12.9 months. All-grade and grades 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were reported in 98% and 60% of patients respectively and led to treatment discontinuation in 40% and 28% of patients. Two treatment-related deaths were reported. The 12- and 18-month os rates were 80% [95% confidence interval (ci): 73% to 86%] and 76% (95% ci: 67% to 82%) respectively. In this Canadian population, nivolumab plus ipilimumab demonstrated a safety profile and survival outcomes consistent with phase ii and iii clinical trial data.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Aug,"Hogg D, Monzon JG, Ernst S, Song X, McWhirter E, Savage KJ, Skinn B, Romeyer F, Smylie M",9,1576,oncology,2025-11-22

32489265,Translating guidelines to practice: a training session about cancer-related fatigue.,"Cancer-related fatigue (crf) is the highest unmet need in cancer survivors. The Canadian Association of Psychosocial Oncology (capo) has developed guidelines for screening, assessment, and intervention in crf; however, those guidelines are not consistently applied in practice because of patient, health care provider (hcp), and systemic barriers. Notably, previous studies have identified a lack of knowledge of crf guidelines as an impediment to implementation. In this pilot study, we tested the preliminary outcomes, acceptability, and feasibility of a training session and a knowledge translation (kt) tool designed to increase knowledge of the capo crf guidelines among hcps and community support providers (csps). A one-time in-person training session was offered to a diverse sample of hcps and csps (<i>n</i> = 18). Outcomes (that is, knowledge of the capo crf guidelines, and intentions and self-efficacy to apply guidelines in practice) were assessed before and after training. Acceptability and feasibility were also assessed after training to guide future testing and implementation of the training. After training, participants reported increased knowledge of the capo crf guidelines and greater self-efficacy and intent to apply guidelines in practice. Participant satisfaction with the training session and the kt tool was high, and recruitment time, participation, and retention rates indicated that the training was acceptable and feasible. The provided training is both acceptable to hcps and csps and feasible. It could increase knowledge of the capo crf guidelines and participant intentions and self-efficacy to implement evidence-based recommendations. Future studies should investigate actual changes in practice and how to optimize follow-up assessments. To promote practice uptake, kt strategies should be paired with guideline development.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Jones G, Rutkowski N, Trudel G, St-Gelais C, Ladouceur M, Brunet J, Lebel S",7,1866,oncology,2025-11-22

33173390,Strategies for the delay of surgery in the management of resectable hepatobiliary malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"We aimed to review data about delaying strategies for the management of hepatobiliary cancers requiring surgery during the covid-19 pandemic. Given the covid-19 pandemic, many jurisdictions, to spare resources, have limited access to operating rooms for elective surgical activity, including cancer, thus forcing deferral or cancellation of cancer surgeries. Surgery for hepatobiliary cancer is high-risk and particularly resource-intensive. Surgeons must critically appraise which patients will benefit most from surgery and which ones have other therapeutic options to delay surgery. Little guidance is currently available about potential delaying strategies for hepatobiliary cancers when surgery is not possible. An international multidisciplinary panel reviewed the available literature to summarize data relating to standard-of-care surgical management and possible mitigating strategies to be used as a bridge to surgery for colorectal liver metastases, hepatocellular carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Outcomes of surgery during the covid-19 pandemic are reviewed. Resource requirements are summarized, including logistics and adverse effects profiles for hepatectomy and delaying strategies using systemic, percutaneous and radiation ablative, and liver embolic therapies. For each cancer type, the long-term oncologic outcomes of hepatectomy and the clinical tools that can be used to prognosticate for individual patients are detailed. There are a variety of delaying strategies to consider if availability of operating rooms decreases. This review summarizes available data to provide guidance about possible delaying strategies depending on patient, resource, institution, and systems factors. Multidisciplinary team discussions should be leveraged to consider patient- and tumour-specific information for each individual case.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Oct,"Bennett S, Søreide K, Gholami S, Pessaux P, Teh C, Segelov E, Kennecke H, Prenen H, Myrehaug S, Callegaro D, Hallet J",11,1900,oncology,2025-11-22

We sought to investigate patterns of primary care use during cancer follow-up care. We identified all persons in Nova Scotia, diagnosed with an invasive breast, prostate, colorectal, or gynecologic cancer between January 2006 and December 2013. We linked this dataset to cancer centre, hospital discharge abstracts, physicians' billing, and census data. We identified a survivor cohort (<i>n</i> = 12,201), then descriptively examined primary care use during follow-up care. Multivariate Poisson and negative binomial regression, respectively, were used to examine primary care use for two outcomes: total number of primary care provider (pcp) visits (all reasons) and total number of cancer-specific pcp visits. The mean numbers of pcp visits (all reasons) and cancer-specific pcp visits per year for survivors who did not receive cancer centre follow-up (cc-fup) were 8.12 and 0.43 visits, respectively, and for survivors who continued to receive cc-fup were 8.75 and 0.63 visits, respectively. Age, cancer type, stage at diagnosis, comorbidity scores, year of diagnosis, and receipt of cc-fup were associated with both outcomes. Compared with prostate cancer survivors, breast, colorectal, and gynecologic cancer survivors had, respectively, 56%, 69%, and 56% fewer expected cancer-specific PCP visits. Receipt of cc-fup increased the expected number of pcp visits (all reasons) by 12% and cancer-specific pcp visits by 50%. Primary care use was higher in survivors who continued to visit their oncology teams for follow-up. This suggests that survivors who remain with their oncology teams after treatment continue to have high needs not met by these teams alone.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Urquhart R, Lethbridge L",2,1760,oncology,2025-11-22

It has a high mortality rate, especially when localized treatments fail. For about a decade, the only systemic treatment shown to improve survival was sorafenib. Recently, lenvatinib was found to be noninferior to sorafenib for overall survival, and combination atezolizumab-bevacizumab improved survival compared with sorafenib. Similarly, in the post-sorafenib setting, a number of recent positive clinical trials have been reported, and they indicate that regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab are effective and safe in the second-line setting. With so many new options available, including immunotherapy, it is challenging to define the best sequence of systemic treatment for patients with hcc.

33173391,Musculoskeletal oncology: patient triage and management during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Sarcoma treatment during the covid-19 pandemic is a new challenge. This patient population is often immunocompromised and potentially more susceptible to viral complications. Government guidelines highlight the need to minimize patient exposure to unnecessary hospital visits. However, those guidelines lack practical recommendations on ways to manage triage and diagnosis expressly for new cancer patients. Furthermore, there are no reports on the efficiency of the guidelines. One of the main issues in treating musculoskeletal tumours is the complexity and variability of presentation. We offer a triage model, used in a quaternary-referral musculoskeletal oncology centre, that allows us to maintain an open pathway for referral of new patients while minimizing exposure risks. A multidisciplinary approach and analysis of existing investigations allow for a pre-clinic evaluation. The model identifies 3 groups of patients: ■ Patients with suspected high-grade malignancy, or benign cases with aggressive features, both in need of further evaluation in the clinic and prompt treatment■ Patients with low-grade malignancy, and benign cases whose treatment is not urgent, that are managed during the pandemic by telemedicine, with reassurance and information about their illness■ Patients who can be managed by their local medical professionals In comparison to a pre-pandemic period, that approach resulted in a higher ratio of malignant-to-benign conditions for new patients seen in the clinic (3:4 vs. 1:3 respectively), thus using available resources more efficiently and prioritizing patients with suspected high-grade malignancy. We believe that this triage system could be applied in other surgical oncology fields during a pandemic.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Oct,"Olshinka N, Mottard S",2,1743,oncology,2025-11-22
33380872,Comprehensive genomic profiling for non-small-cell lung cancer: health and budget impact.,"Single-gene tests and hotspot panels targeting specific subsets of biomarkers constitute the Canadian genomic testing landscape for non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc). However, newer testing options such as comprehensive genomic profiling (cgp) offer improved detection rates and identification of multiple classes of genomic alterations in a single assay, minimizing tissue requirements and turnaround time. The objective of the present analysis was to assess the health and budget impacts of adopting cgp testing for nsclc in Canada. This study assessed the impact of funding the cgp tests FoundationOne CDx and FoundationOne Liquid (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA, U.S.A.) over a 3-year time horizon using a Canadian societal perspective for Ontario. Conventional testing strategies were summarized into two reference scenarios: a series of single-gene tests only, and reflex single-gene testing followed by a hotspot panel for negative results. Four adoption scenarios for cgp testing were considered: replacing all single-gene and hotspot panel testing, replacing hotspot panel testing only, use after negative single-gene and hotspot testing, and use of FoundationOne Liquid in individuals with insufficient tissue for conventional testing. When cgp testing was assumed to replace all conventional testing with 50% uptake, the budget impact per person per year ranged from $0.71 to $0.87, depending on the reference scenario, with a 3-year gain of 680.9 life-years and 3831 working days over the full cohort. Given the present testing landscape for patients with nsclc in Canada, listing cgp testing could optimize the selection of appropriately targeted treatments, and thus add life-years and productivity for this population, with a minimal budget impact.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Johnston KM, Sheffield BS, Yip S, Lakzadeh P, Qian C, Nam J",6,1768,oncology,2025-11-22
32905157,The importance of humour in oncology: a survey of patients undergoing radiotherapy.,"Humour has long been considered an important coping tool for patients with cancer, but published quantitative data about its significance are limited. The purpose of our study was to survey patients with cancer undergoing radiotherapy regarding their opinions about the use of humour in their care. An anonymous 35-item questionnaire evaluating the patient experience, including the value of humour, was developed by an interdisciplinary team of health care providers (hcps) working within the Radiation Medicine program. This anonymous, voluntary, paper-based survey for self-completion required approximately 10 minutes to finish and was administered during the fall of 2018 and the spring of 2019. For the 199 patients who completed the survey [108 women, 89 men (2 respondents did not specify)], median age was 68 years. That group represents approximately 30%-35% of the patients on treatment during the study period. Almost all respondents (86%) indicated that, during their visits to the cancer centre, it was ""somewhat important"" or ""very important"" for health care providers (hcps) to use appropriate humour, and 61% of respondents indicated using humour ""frequently"" or ""always"" when dealing with their individual cancers. Most respondents (79%) said that humour decreased anxiety, and 86% indicated that laughing was considered ""somewhat important"" or ""very important."" Approximately 4% of respondents even listed ""sense of humour"" as being the most important quality that they looked for in their interactions with their hcps. Cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy clearly view humour as being important for coping and dealing with their disease, and oncology hcps should routinely consider incorporating the use of appropriate humour into the care that they provide.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Aug,"Samant R, Balchin K, Cisa-Paré E, Renaud J, Bunch L, McNeil A, Murray S, Meng J",8,1781,oncology,2025-11-22
35194791,Validation of NRG Oncology's prognostic nomograms for oropharyngeal cancer in the Veterans Affairs database.,"To test whether nomograms developed by NRG Oncology for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients could be validated in an independent population-based sample. The authors tested nomograms for estimating progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients from the Veterans Health Administration with previously untreated locoregionally advanced OPSCC, diagnosed between 2008 and 2017, managed with definitive radiotherapy with or without adjuvant systemic therapy. Covariates were age, performance status, p16 status, T/N category, smoking history, education history, weight loss, marital status, and anemia. We used multiple imputation to handle missing data and performed sensitivity analyses on complete cases. Validation was assessed via Cox proportional hazards models, log-rank tests, and c-indexes. A total of 4007 patients met inclusion criteria (658 patients had complete data). Median follow-up time was 3.20 years, with 967 progression events and 471 noncancer deaths. Each risk score was associated with poorer outcomes per unit increase (PFS score, hazard ratio [HR], 1.42 [1.37-1.47]; OS score, HR, 1.40 [1.34-1.45]). By risk score quartile, 2-year PFS estimates were 89.2%, 78.5%, 65.8%, and 48.3%; OS estimates were 92.6%, 83.6%, 73.9%, and 51.3%, respectively (P < .01 for all comparisons). C-indices for models of PFS and OS were 0.65 and 0.67, for all patients, respectively (0.69 and 0.73 for complete cases). The nomograms slightly overestimated PFS and OS in the overall cohort but exhibited high agreement in complete cases. NRG nomograms were effective for predicting PFS and OS for patients with OPSCC, supporting their broader applicability in the OPSCC population undergoing definitive radiotherapy.",Cancer,2022-May,"Nelson TJ, Thompson CA, Zou J, Kumar A, Sangchan P, Williamson CW, Vitzthum LK, Sharabi AB, Murphy JD, Fakhry CA, Mell LK",11,1758,oncology,2025-11-22
37832790,Ultra-fast multi-parametric 4D-MRI image reconstruction for real-time applications using a downsampling-invariant deformable registration (D2R) model.,"Motion estimation from severely downsampled 4D-MRI is essential for real-time imaging and tumor tracking. This simulation study developed a novel deep learning model for simultaneous MR image reconstruction and motion estimation, named the Downsampling-Invariant Deformable Registration (D2R) model. Forty-three patients undergoing radiotherapy for liver tumors were recruited for model training and internal validation. Five prospective patients from another center were recruited for external validation. Patients received 4D-MRI scans and 3D MRI scans. The 4D-MRI was retrospectively down-sampled to simulate real-time acquisition. Motion estimation was performed using the proposed D2R model. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed D2R model and baseline methods, including Demons, Elastix, the parametric total variation (pTV) algorithm, and VoxelMorph, were compared. High-quality (HQ) 4D-MR images were also constructed using the D2R model for real-time imaging feasibility verification. The image quality and motion accuracy of the constructed HQ 4D-MRI were evaluated. The D2R model showed significantly superior and robust registration performance than all the baseline methods at downsampling factors up to 500. HQ T1-weighted and T2-weighted 4D-MR images were also successfully constructed with significantly improved image quality, sub-voxel level motion error, and real-time efficiency. External validation demonstrated the robustness and generalizability of the technique. In this study, we developed a novel D2R model for deformation estimation of downsampled 4D-MR images. HQ 4D-MR images were successfully constructed using the D2R model. This model may expand the clinical implementation of 4D-MRI for real-time motion management during liver cancer treatment.",Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,2023-Dec,"Xiao H, Han X, Zhi S, Wong YL, Liu C, Li W, Liu W, Wang W, Zhang Y, Wu H, Lee HV, Cheung LA, Chang HC, Liao YP, Deng J, Li T, Cai J",17,1784,oncology,2025-11-22
36872871,Intraoperative Radiation Therapy: A Large Integrated Health Care System's Approach and Outcomes.,"Introduction Intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) may not be as effective in the community compared with clinical trials. Methods The authors reviewed data from the electronic health records of patients who received IORT between February 2014 and February 2020 at a single center within a large integrated health care system. The primary outcome was ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence. Results Of 5731 potentially eligible patients, 245 (4.3%) underwent IORT (mean age: 65.4 ± 0.4 years; median follow-up time: 3.5 years ± 2.2 months). According to the American Society for Radiation Oncology's accelerated partial breast irradiation guidelines based on final pathology, 51% of patients were suitable candidates for IORT, 38.4% were cautionary, and 10.6% were unsuitable. For adjuvant therapy, 6.5% had consolidative whole breast irradiation, and 66.4% received endocrine treatment. At the median follow-up time of 3.5 years, overall ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was 3.7%. Recurrences tended to be more frequent in patients who refused or did not complete endocrine treatment than in those who received it (7.4% vs 1.9%, p = 0.07). The complication rate was 14.7%, with seroma being the most common (8.2%). Discussion The IORT ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rate of 3.7% confirms a higher-than-expected rate compared to randomized clinical trials, possibly due to less compliance with endocrine therapy. Conclusion The authors subsequently revised their IORT protocol to require endocrine treatment as a part of the IORT treatment plan and to strongly recommend adjuvant whole breast irradiation for all patients deemed cautionary or unsuitable for IORT according to the American Society for Radiation Oncology's accelerated partial breast irradiation guidelines.",The Permanente journal,2023-Mar,"Tang A, Dzubnar JM, Kelly JF, Banks KC, Phillips JL, Cureton EA, Svahn JD, Mai V, Lyon LL, Thomas ES, Shim VC",11,1779,oncology,2025-11-22
39676262,A precision immuno-oncology turn? Hybridizing cancer genomics and immunotherapy through neoantigens-based adoptive cell therapies.,"This article explores the development of T cell-based therapies in Switzerland. These therapies, which elicit the immunological potential of each patient to respond to tumor development, constitute a major promise for so-called 'precision oncology'. We document how immunological concepts, technologies, and practices are articulated given the centrality of genomics in 'precision oncology'. We consider 'precision immunotherapies' to probe whether and how change ensues in these established sociotechnical regimes of biomedicine. The case of genomics and immunology in oncology offers a unique insight into the conditions of possibility for change in such regimes. How does the present new wave of cancer immunotherapies challenge, integrate, and complement the centrality of genomics in 'precision oncology'? What are the specific processes that make possible the convergence, competition, or co-existence of distinct conceptions, infrastructures, and programs of innovative cancer medicine? Drawing from observations and interviews with researchers and clinicians, we qualify these sociotechnical processes as <i>hybridizations.</i> Bringing together different sociotechnical regimes of biomedical research is conditional to the articulation of core concepts, technologies, and translational practices of genomics and immunology. Pivotal to this objective are neoantigens, cell surface proteins originating from the somatic genetic mutations of tumors and which activate a patient's immune response. While neoantigens are an unstable entity in experimentation, they offer a conceptual and material substrate to renegotiate the dominance of cancer genomics, and initiate the production of a new, hybrid regime of 'immunogenomic precision' in oncology.",Social studies of science,2025-Aug,"Chiapperino L, Graber N, Panese F",3,1753,oncology,2025-11-22

33343210,Non-immunotherapy options for the first-line management of hepatocellular carcinoma: exploring the evolving role of sorafenib and lenvatinib in advanced disease.,"The results of the sharp trial established sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (tki), as the sole first-line treatment option in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) for more than a decade. In 2020, there has been a surge in new therapies for hcc, including immunotherapeutic strategies and the approval of a number of novel tkis. In addition to sorafenib, lenvatinib and combination atezolizumab-bevacizumab now represent standard first-line treatment options. As those systemic therapy options begin to be better utilized, assurance of adequate liver function and optimal timing are required to improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, sequencing of the agents will have to be carefully tailored, given the increasing armamentarium of choices. Here, we discuss the role of lenvatinib and sorafenib in the first-line management of hcc.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Nov,"Perera S, Kelly D, O'Kane GM",3,840,oncology,2025-11-22

35594462,Estrogen for the Treatment and Prevention of Breast Cancer: A Tale of 2 Karnofsky Lectures.,"In 1971, Sir Alexander Haddow et al. delivered the inaugural David A. Karnofsky lecture at the American Society for Clinical Oncology. This award was designated American Society for Clinical Oncology's highest, as he had used translational research to identify the first clinical therapy, that is, synthetic estrogens to treat breast cancer. His lecture was entitled ""Thoughts on Chemical Therapy."" For 40 years, high-dose synthetic estrogens were used as palliative therapy, for some advanced breast cancer patients 5 years following menopause. Mechanisms were unknown. Tamoxifen, a failed ""morning-after pill,"" is an antiestrogen in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, which was subsequently used to treat all stages of breast cancer and to prevent breast cancer. In 2008, Jordan was selected to present the 38th Karnofsky lecture entitled: ""The Paradoxical Action of Estrogen in Breast Cancer-Survival or Death?"" Unexpectedly, through a study of acquired resistance to long-term tamoxifen therapy, estrogen-induced apoptosis in long-term estrogen-deprived breast cancer was deciphered in Jordan's laboratory. These data and the biological rules established under laboratory conditions provided molecular mechanisms to aid in the interpretation of the Women's Health initiative in the United States and the Million Women Study in the United Kingdom. In addition, by establishing laboratory models to understand mechanisms of estrogen-induced apoptosis, new estrogen derivatives were successfully evaluated in the laboratory and tested as candidates for women after the therapeutic failure of antiestrogenic strategies to treat breast cancer. For the future, the knowledge obtained about estrogen-induced apoptosis in cancer holds the promise of discovering new therapies to control or cure cancer in general.","Cancer journal (Sudbury, Mass.)",,"Abderrahman B, Jordan VC",2,1816,oncology,2025-11-22

A review of registered protocols of clinical trials.,"In 2012, 11 standards describing best supportive care (bsc) in clinical trials in advanced cancer were defined through consensus statements. The consensus included 15 key components. Our objective was to analyze whether clinical trials that involved patients with advanced cancer and that included bsc in at least 1 arm met the standards and contained the key components. We reviewed clinical trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, the isrctn (International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number) registry, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for 2012-2018. We selected only phase iii studies in patients with advanced cancer that included bsc in at least 1 arm. We describe the characteristics of the trials, together with the definition and components of bsc. We analyzed how the trials met the standards and adopted the key components of bsc. Of 193 trials retrieved, only 64 met the inclusion criteria; 36 of those trials (56%) had no definition of bsc. Less than 7% of the trials included even 3 of the 8 bsc standards that were defined to be included in the design of trials. Furthermore, trials mentioned only 5 of the 15 key components that the consensus defined to be fundamental, with symptom management appearing in 22% of trials and the other 4 components appearing in less than 8%. Most clinical trials registered during 2012-2018 that involved patients with cancer and an arm with bsc did not define the bsc concept. Hence, the design of those trials does not meet the consensus recommendations.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Sanz Rubiales Á, Sánchez-Gutiérrez ME, Flores Pérez LA, Del Valle Rivero ML",4,1570,oncology,2025-11-22
32905281,Risk factors for venous thromboembolism in endometrial cancer.,"Venous thromboembolism (vte) in malignancy is associated with poor outcomes. We conducted a retrospective review of vte in patients with endometrial cancer to characterize the vte incidence, identify factors that contribute to vte risk, and compare survival outcomes in patients with and without vte. A retrospective chart review identified 422 eligible patients who underwent surgery for endometrial cancer (1 January 2014 to 31 July 2016). The primary outcome was vte. Binary logistic regression identified risk factors for vte; significant risk factors were included in a multivariate analysis. Kaplan-Meier estimates are reported, and log rank tests were used to compare the Kaplan-Meier curves. Risk-adjusted estimates for overall survival based on vte were determined using a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. The incidence of vte was 6.16% overall and 0.7% within 60 days postoperatively. Non-endometrioid histology, stages 3 and 4 disease, laparotomy, and age (<i>p</i> < 0.1) were identified as factors associated with vte and were included in a multivariate analysis. The overall death rate in patients with vte was 42% (9% without vte): hazard ratio, 5.63; 95% confidence interval, 2.86 to 11.08; <i>p</i> < 0.0001. Adjusting for age, stage of disease, and histology, risk of death remained significant for patients with a vte: hazard ratio, 2.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 4.42; <i>p</i> = 0.0271. A method to identify patients with endometrial cancer who are at high risk for vte is important, given the implications of vte for patient outcomes and the frequency of endometrial cancer diagnoses. Factors identified in our study might assist in the recognition of such patients.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Aug,"Pin S, Mateshaytis J, Ghosh S, Batuyong E, Easaw JC",5,1708,oncology,2025-11-22

33467570,Canadian Consensus for Biomarker Testing and Treatment of TRK Fusion Cancer in Adults.,"The tyrosine receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitors larotrectinib and entrectinib were recently approved in Canada for the treatment of solid tumours harbouring neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (<i>NTRK)</i> gene fusions. These <i>NTRK</i> gene fusions are oncogenic drivers found in most tumour types at a low frequency (<5%), and at a higher frequency (>80%) in a small number of rare tumours (e.g., secretory carcinoma of the salivary gland and of the breast). They are generally mutually exclusive of other common oncogenic drivers. Larotrectinib and entrectinib have demonstrated impressive overall response rates and tolerability in Phase I/II trials in patients with TRK fusion cancer with no other effective treatment options. Given the low frequency of TRK fusion cancer and the heterogeneous molecular testing landscape in Canada, identifying and optimally managing such patients represents a new challenge. We provide a Canadian consensus on when and how to test for <i>NTRK</i> gene fusions and when to consider treatment with a TRK inhibitor. We focus on five tumour types: thyroid carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and salivary gland carcinoma. Based on the probability of the tumour harbouring an <i>NTRK</i> gene fusion, we also suggest a tumour-agnostic consensus for <i>NTRK</i> gene fusion testing and treatment. We recommend considering a TRK inhibitor in all patients with TRK fusion cancer with no other effective treatment options.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-Jan,"Bebb DG, Banerji S, Blais N, Desmeules P, Gill S, Grin A, Feilotter H, Hansen AR, Hyrcza M, Krzyzanowska M, Melosky B, Noujaim J, Purgina B, Ruether D, Simmons CE, Soulieres D, Torlakovic EE, Tsao MS",18,1504,oncology,2025-11-22
33498159,Survival Impact of Aggressive Treatment and PD-L1 Expression in Oligometastatic NSCLC.,"Studies have shown that aggressive treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with oligometastatic disease improves the overall survival (OS) compared to a palliative approach and some immunotherapy checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and T-Lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors are now part of the standard of care for advanced NSCLC. However, the prognostic impact of PD-L1 expression in the oligometastatic setting remains unknown. Patients with oligometastatic NSCLC were identified from the patient database of the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal (CHUM). ""Oligometastatic disease"" definition chosen is one synchronous metastasis based on the M1b staging of the eight IASLC (The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer) Classification (within sixth months of diagnosis) or up to three cerebral metastasis based on the methodology of the previous major phase II randomized study of Gomez et al. We compared the OS between patients receiving aggressive treatment at both metastatic and primary sites (Group A) and patients receiving non-aggressive treatment (Group B). Subgroup analysis was performed using tumor PD-L1 expression. Among 643 metastatic NSCLC patients, we identified 67 patients with oligometastasis (10%). Median follow-up was 13.3 months. Twenty-nine patients (43%) received radical treatment at metastatic and primary sites (Group A), and 38 patients (57%) received non-aggressive treatment (Group B). The median OS (mOS) of Group A was significantly longer than for Group B (26 months vs. 5 months, <i>p</i> = 0.0001). Median progression-free survival (mPFS) of Group A was superior than Group B (17.5 months vs. 3.4 months, <i>p</i> = 0.0001). This difference was still significant when controlled for primary tumor staging: stage I (<i>p</i> = 0.316), stage II (<i>p</i> = 0.024), and stage III (<i>p</i> = 0.001). In the cohort of patients who were not treated with PD-L1 inhibitors, PD-L1 expression negatively correlated with mOS. Aggressive treatments of oligometastatic NSCLC significantly improve mOS and mPFS compared to a more palliative approach. PD-L1 expression is a negative prognostic factor which suggests a possible role for immunotherapy in this setting.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-Jan,"Gauvin C, Krishnan V, Kaci I, Tran-Thanh D, Bédard K, Albadine R, Leduc C, Gaboury L, Blais N, Tehfe M, Routy B, Florescu M",12,2327,oncology,2025-11-22
33380869,Presenting stage and risk group in men dying of prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer remains the 3rd leading cause of cancer-related mortality in Canadian men, and yet screening for prostate cancer continues to be controversial because the majority of men diagnosed with prostate cancer do not die of the disease. It also remains uncertain whether treatment of cases that can be treated with curative intent alters the mortality rate. There are very few studies describing the presenting stage, risk groups, and survival after diagnosis for men dying of prostate cancer in the literature. In this study, we explored these characteristics for all men who died of prostate cancer in British Columbia between 2013 and 2015. The population-based BC Cancer databases were used to identify all patients diagnosed between January 2013 and December 2015 who died of prostate cancer. Patient, tumour, and treatment characteristics were collected, and the risk grouping for each tumour was determined. The proportion of cases in each risk group at the time of diagnosis was determined. Survival time from diagnosis to death was calculated for all patients and for each risk group using the Kaplan-Meier method. A total of 1256 patients died of prostate cancer. Of patients who presented with metastatic disease, 57.2% presented with a Gleason score of 8 or more, compared with only 35.7% of patients who presented with nonmetastatic disease (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). The presenting stage and risk group of those dying of prostate cancer were as follows: 32% metastatic disease, 3% regional (defined as node-positive), 39% localized high risk, 9% localized intermediate risk, 4% localized low risk, 6% localized not otherwise specified, and 7% unknown. Therefore, 80.3% of those with a known risk group presented with either localized high-risk, regional, or metastatic disease at diagnosis. The median survival times from diagnosis to death were 12 years for localized low-risk, 10 years for localized intermediate-risk, 6.5 years for localized high-risk, 4 years for regional, and 1.7 years for metastatic disease at diagnosis. This population-based analysis demonstrates that patients with localized high-risk, regional, or metastatic disease at diagnosis constitute the overwhelming majority of patients who die of prostate cancer in British Columbia. Unless these disease states can reliably be identified at an earlier low- or intermediate-risk localized state in the future, it is unlikely that treatment of localized low- and intermediate-risk cancer will have an impact on survival. Furthermore, patients with <i>de novo</i> metastatic disease had identifiable risk factors of a higher prostate-specific antigen and Gleason score. Further studies are required to confirm these results.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Parimi S, Bondy S, Aparicio M, Sunderland K, Cho J, Bachand F, Nguyen Chi K, Pickles T, Tyldesley S",9,2709,oncology,2025-11-22
38148731,Optimizing the doses of cancer drugs after usual dose finding.,"Since the middle of the 20th century, oncology's dose-finding paradigm has been oriented toward identifying a drug's maximum tolerated dose, which is then carried forward into phase 2 and 3 trials and clinical practice. For most modern precision medicines, however, maximum tolerated dose is far greater than the minimum dose needed to achieve maximal benefit, leading to unnecessary side effects. Regulatory change may decrease maximum tolerated dose's predominance by enforcing dose optimization of <i>new</i> drugs. Dozens of already approved cancer drugs require re-evaluation, however, introducing a new methodologic and ethical challenge in cancer clinical trials. In this article, we assess the history and current landscape of cancer drug dose finding. We provide a set of strategic priorities for postapproval dose optimization trials of the future. We discuss ethical considerations for postapproval dose optimization trial design and review three major design strategies for these unique trials that would both adhere to ethical standards and benefit patients and funders. We close with a discussion of financial and reporting considerations in the realm of dose optimization. Taken together, we provide a comprehensive, bird's eye view of the postapproval dose optimization trial landscape and offer our thoughts on the next steps required of methodologies and regulatory and funding regimes.","Clinical trials (London, England)",2024-Jun,"Strohbehn GW, Stadler WM, Boonstra PS, Ratain MJ",4,1404,oncology,2025-11-22
32669933,Access to cancer care in northwestern Ontario-a population-based study using administrative data.,"Despite universal access to health care in Canada, there are disparities relating to social determinants of health that contribute to discrepancies between rural and urban areas in cancer incidence and outcomes. Given that Canada has one of the highest-quality national population-based cancer registry systems in the world and that little information is available about cancer statistics specific to northwestern Ontario, the purpose of the present study was to estimate the percentage of cancer patients without documentation of a specialist consultation (medical or radiation oncology consultation) and to determine factors that affect access to specialist consultation in northwestern Ontario. This population-based retrospective study used administrative data obtained through the Ontario Cancer Data Linkage Project. For each index case, a timeline was constructed of all Ontario Health Insurance Plan billing codes and associated service dates, starting with the primary cancer diagnosis and ending with death. Specific factors affecting access to specialist consultation were assessed. Within the 6-year study period (2010-2016), 2583 index cases were identified. Most (<i>n</i> = 2007, 78%) received a specialist consultation. Factors associated with not receiving a specialist consultation included older age [<i>p</i> < 0.0001; odds ratio (or): 0.29; 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.19 to 0.44] and rural residence (<i>p</i> < 0.0001; or: 0.48; 95% ci: 0.48 to 0.72). Factors associated with receiving a specialist consultation included a longer timeline (<i>p</i> < 0.0001; or: 1.32; 95% ci: 1.19 to 1.46), a diagnosis of breast cancer (<i>p</i> < 0.0001; or: 2.51; 95% ci: 1.43 to 4.42), and a diagnosis of lung cancer (<i>p</i> < 0.0001; or: 1.77; 95% ci: 1.38 to 2.26). This study is the first to look at care access in northwestern Ontario. The complexity and multidisciplinary nature of cancer care makes the provision of appropriate care a challenge; a one-size-fits-all disease prevention and treatment strategy might not be appropriate.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Jun,"Febbraro M, Conlon M, Caswell J, Laferriere N",4,2056,oncology,2025-11-22
32218661,Therapeutic landscape of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer in Canada in 2020.,"Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Canada and remains associated with high mortality. Nevertheless, recent advances in the fields of immuno-oncology and precision medicine have led to significant improvements in clinical outcome in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc). Those improvements were facilitated by a greater understanding of the biologic classification of nsclc, which catalyzed discoveries of novel therapies. Here, we present a comprehensive review of the recent avalanche of practice-changing trials in metastatic nsclc, and we offer an approach to the management of this disease from a Canadian perspective. We begin with an overview of the pathologic and molecular characterization of metastatic nsclc. Next, we review the indications for currently approved immune checkpoint inhibitors, and we provide an approach to the management of disease with a driver mutation. Finally, we address future avenues in both diagnostics and therapeutics for patients with advanced and metastatic nsclc.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Feb,"Elkrief A, Joubert P, Florescu M, Tehfe M, Blais N, Routy B",6,1031,oncology,2025-11-22
32489260,Nonsurgical management of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a clinical practice guideline.,"Practice guidelines based on a systematic review of the literature regarding the nonsurgical management of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) in North America are lacking. Resection and transplantation are the foundations for cure of hcc; however, most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, precluding those curative treatments. A number of local or regional therapies are used and are followed by systemic therapy for advanced or progressive disease. Other treatments are available, but their efficacy, compared with those standards, is not well known. First, systematic review questions were developed. Literature searches of the medline, embase, and Cochrane library databases (January 2000 to July 2018 or January 2005 to July 2018 depending on the question) were conducted; in addition, abstracts from the 2018 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology were reviewed. A practice guideline was drafted that was then scrutinized by internal and external reviewers. Seventy-seven studies were included in the guideline: no guidelines, two systematic reviews, and seventy-five primary studies published in full (including one pooled analysis). Five recommendations were developed. There is no evidence for or against the use of local or regional interventions other than transarterial chemoembolization for the treatment of intermediate- or advanced-stage hcc. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support the addition of sorafenib to any local or regional therapy. Sorafenib or lenvatinib are recommended for first-line systemic treatment of intermediate-stage hcc. Regorafenib or cabozantinib provide survival benefits when given as second-line treatment. Antiviral treatment is recommended in individuals with advanced hcc who are positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Meyers BM, Knox J, Cosby R, Beecroft JR, Chan KKW, Coburn N, Feld J, Jonker D, Mahmud A, Ringash J",10,1801,oncology,2025-11-22
33498797,Real-World Palbociclib Use in HR+/HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer in Canada: The IRIS Study.,"Palbociclib is a selective cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor used in combination with aromatase inhibitors or fulvestrant for patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced/metastatic breast cancer (ABC/MBC). Palbociclib was the first CDK 4/6 inhibitor approved for HR+/HER2- ABC/MBC treatment in Canada in combination with letrozole (P+L) as an initial endocrine-based therapy (approved March 2016), or with fulvestrant (P+F) following disease progression after prior endocrine therapy (approved May 2017). The Ibrance Real World Insights (IRIS) study (NCT03159195) collected real-world outcomes data for palbociclib-treated patients in several countries, including Canada. This retrospective chart review included women with HR+/HER2- ABC/MBC receiving P+L or P+F in Canada. Physicians reviewed medical records for up to 14 patients, abstracting demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes. Progression-free rates (PFRs) and survival rates (SRs) at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months were estimated via Kaplan-Meier analysis. Thirty-three physicians examined medical records for 247 patients (P+L, <i>n</i> = 214; P+F, <i>n</i> = 33). Median follow-up was 8.8 months for P+L and 7.0 months for P+F. Most patients were initiated on palbociclib 125 mg/d (P+L, 90.2%; P+F, 84.8%). Doses were reduced in 16.6% of P+L and 14.3% of P+F patients initiating palbociclib at 125 mg/d. The PFR for P+L was 90.3% at 12 months and 78.2% at 18 months; corresponding SRs were 95.6% and 93.0%. For P+F, 6-month PFR was 91.0%; 12-month SR was 100.0%. Dose reduction rates were low and PFR and SR were high in this Canadian real-world assessment of P+L and P+F treatments, suggesting that palbociclib combinations are well tolerated and effective.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-Jan,"Mycock K, Zhan L, Taylor-Stokes G, Milligan G, Mitra D",5,1836,oncology,2025-11-22
33380867,"Clinicopathologic characteristics, survival, and treatments for gastric adenosquamous carcinoma: a population-based study.","Gastric adenosquamous carcinoma (gasc) is a rare entity with distinctive characteristics that are not fully understood. In the present study, we evaluated the characteristics of this rare disease. The U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program database was searched to determine the clinicopathologic features, prognostic factors, and treatments for 246 patients with gasc and 42,735 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma (gac). Relative to gac, gasc is associated with higher proportions of cardia involvement, high-grade tumours, deep tumour invasion, metastatic lymph nodes, and chemotherapy treatment. In patients who underwent potentially curative surgery (pcs), gasc was associated with a higher proportion of radiotherapy use and poorer overall survival (<i>p</i> < 0.001), although no significant difference (<i>p</i> = 0.802) was observed after propensity score matching (psm). Multivariate analysis after psm revealed that the independent prognostic factors for gasc were TNM stage [hazard ratio (hr): 1.512; <i>p</i> = 0.021] and regional nodes examined (hr: 0.588; <i>p</i> = 0.02). In patients with advanced disease, no significant difference in survival between gasc and gac was observed (<i>p</i> = 0.212), although survival was significantly poorer for gasc after psm (<i>p</i> = 0.019). Multivariate analysis after psm revealed that the independent prognostic factors for gasc were invasion depth (hr: 1.303; <i>p</i> = 0.036) and chemotherapy (hr: 0.444; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Relative to gac, gasc was associated with more aggressive features, although survival outcomes were similar after pcs. Chemotherapy remains a mainstay of treatment for patients with advanced gasc, but its role remains unclear for patients who are undergoing pcs.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Li HS, Liu X, Zhang MY, Cheng K, Chen Y, Zhou YW, Liu JY",7,1767,oncology,2025-11-22
33173387,Cigarette-smoking characteristics and interest in cessation in patients with head-and-neck cancer.,"Many patients diagnosed with head-and-neck cancer are current or former smokers. Despite the well-known adverse effects of smoking, continuation of smoking during cancer treatment is associated with reduced efficacy of that treatment and with cancer recurrence. In the present study, we examined smoking characteristics in patients with head-and-neck cancer near the time of cancer treatment. A prospective cohort of patients with head-and-neck cancer who attended a dental oncology clinic before receiving cancer treatment at a regional cancer centre were invited to participate in a study that involved completing an interviewer-administered questionnaire to assess smoking characteristics, intention to quit, motivation to quit, and strategies perceived to potentially aid in successful cessation. The study enrolled 493 ever-smokers, with a response rate of 96.1% and a self-reported current smoker rate of 37.1% (<i>n</i> = 183). Most of the current smokers reported high nicotine dependence, with 84.7% (<i>n</i> = 155) indicating a time to first cigarette of 30 minutes or less. Most had previously attempted to quit smoking (77.0%), and many had prior unsuccessful quit attempts before resuming smoking again. Most were interested in quitting smoking (85.8%), and many (70.5%) were seriously considering quitting smoking within the subsequent 30 days. Patients with head-and-neck cancer reported high nicotine dependence and high interest in cessation opportunities near the time of treatment for cancer. Those results might provide support for provision of smoking cessation opportunities.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Oct,"Conlon MSC, Santi SA, Meigs ML, Davidson SM, Saunders D",5,1598,oncology,2025-11-22
33557029,How Canadian Oncologists Use Oncotype DX for Treatment of Breast Cancer Patients.,"The literature suggests that medical oncologists differ on how they use the Oncotype DX (ODX) genomic assay for making decisions about systemic therapy in breast cancer patients. Given the emergence of data supporting the use of genomic profiling for the prognosis and predicting benefit of chemotherapy, we surveyed medical oncologists in Canada to assess their usage and perception of the ODX assay. A 34-item survey was distributed to Canadian medical oncologists via the Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists. Data was collected on physician demographics, ODX usage patterns, and physicians' perception of the impact clinical and pathologic characteristics make on ODX utilization. Response rate was 20.6% with 47 responses received from 228 survey sent. Forty-five responses were eligible for analysis. Sixty-two percent (28/45) of respondents treated predominantly breast cancer, and 60% (27/45) have been in practice for at least 10 years. The most cited reason for using ODX was to avoid giving patients unnecessary chemotherapy (64%; 29/45). Sixty-seven percent (30/45) deferred making treatment decisions until ODX testing was completed. Factors most strongly impacting ODX utilization included: patient request, medical comorbidities and tumor grade. In clinical scenarios, ODX was more frequently selected for patients aged 40-65 (vs. <40 or >65), grade 2 tumors (vs. grade 1 or 3), and Ki-67 index of 10-20% (vs. <10% or >20%). This survey demonstrated that Canadian medical oncologists are preferentially using ODX to avoid giving patients unnecessary chemotherapy. The utilization of ODX is mainly in patients with intermediate clinical and pathologic features.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-Feb,"Zhu X, Dent S, Paquet L, Zhang T, Tesolin D, Graham N, Aseyev O, Song X",8,1682,oncology,2025-11-22
36375114,Clinical Impact of ASCO Choosing Wisely Guidelines on Staging Imaging for Early-Stage Breast Cancers: A Time Series Analysis Using SEER-Medicare Data.,"American Society for Clinical Oncology released the Choosing Wisely list in 2012, highlighting low-value procedures that lack evidence, advising against the use of positron emission tomography, computerized tomography, and radionuclide bone scans for the staging of early-stage breast cancer at low risk for metastasis. The objective of the study was to assess the impact of the American Society of Clinical Oncology Choosing Wisely guidelines on inappropriate staging imaging among early-stage breast cancers. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program-Medicare data set was used to identify 50,004 women age 66 years and older with new incident diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer (stage 0 through stage 2a; T < 4, N = 0, and M = 0). The primary outcome was the incidence of patients with inappropriate imaging following an early-stage breast cancer diagnosis. The primary outcome was identified within 6 months of the first diagnosis. An interrupted time series analysis using negative binomial regression was performed for outpatient claims for these diagnostic studies versus the two interruptions of guidelines release and guidelines reinforcement. Mean images per patient, percent change for the study period, and rate of change per year were calculated. Imaging rates fell by a modest 2.32% following guidelines release in April 2012 (point estimate = -2.32%; 95% CI, -6.34% to 1.88%). By contrast, imaging rates fell by a four-fold larger amount (point estimate = -9.36%; 95% CI, -13.20% to -5.35%) following guidelines published reminders in journals (or reinforcement) in October 2013. Mean imaging studies per patient (95% CI) declined from 1.80 (1.76 to 1.84) in January 2012 to 1.50 (1.48 to 1.53) by January 2015, representing a 16% decline in imaging overuse in 2015 compared with 3 years earlier. The rate of change (95% CI) in images per patient was initially small at -0.47% (-4.27% to 3.33%) per year between April 2012 and October 2013, but almost eight times faster at -3.70% (-5.81% to -1.60%) per year after October 2013. This analysis demonstrates a substantial decrease in the prevalence of imaging overuse in early-stage breast cancers correlating with the 2013 reinforcement of American Society of Clinical Oncology's 2012 Choosing Wisely guidelines. The creation and dissemination of such resources serves as a powerful tool to improve clinical practice, cost-effectiveness, and patient safety from secondary malignancies, anxiety, and overdiagnosis.",JCO oncology practice,2023-Feb,"Baltz AP, Siegel ER, Kamal AH, Siegel R, Kozlik MM, Crist STS, Makhoul I",7,2495,oncology,2025-11-22

32905267,Retrospective cohort study of unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer in Canada.,"The management of unresectable stage iii non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) is complex and best determined through multidisciplinary consultation. A longitudinal, population-level study was carried out to describe the management approach and outcomes of treatment in the real-world setting in Ontario. Individuals diagnosed with nsclc between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2015 were identified in the Ontario Cancer Registry. Unresectable disease was defined as no surgery reported within 3 months of diagnosis. Initial treatments included radiotherapy (rt, curative or palliative), chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and chemoradiation [crt, concurrent (ccrt) or sequential (scrt)]. Survival was calculated from diagnosis with stage iii disease to death or last follow-up. Of the 24,729 individuals diagnosed with nsclc, 5243 (21.2%) had stage iii disease, with most of the latter group (4542, 86.6%) having unresectable disease. Median age was 70 years, and 54.2% were men. The frequency of first-line treatment was ccrt, 22.1%; palliative rt, 21.0%; curative rt, 19.6%; no treatment, 19.6%; chemotherapy alone, 11.6%; scrt, 5.4%; and targeted therapy, 0.7%. Median overall survival (mos) was 14.2 months [95% confidence interval (ci): 13.6 months to 14.7 months], with the longest survival observed in patients who received targeted therapy (mos: 34.7 months; 95% ci: 21.4 months to 51.2 months), and the poorest, in those receiving no cancer treatment (mos: 5.9 months; 95% ci: 5.0 months to 6.4 months). The mos in patients receiving ccrt was 23.6 months (95% ci: 21.4 months to 25.6 months). Guideline-recommended ccrt is undertaken in only a small proportion of patients with unresectable nsclc in Ontario. The reasons for low uptake of that recommendation are only partly understood.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Aug,"Seung SJ, Hurry M, Walton RN, Evans WK",4,1784,oncology,2025-11-22
33704113,"Factors Associated with Meeting the Psychosocial Needs of Cancer Survivors in Nova Scotia, Canada.","<i>Purpose:</i> The purpose of this study is to describe the psychosocial needs of cancer survivors and examine whether sociodemographic factors and health care providers accessed are associated with needs being met. <i>Methods</i>: All Nova Scotia survivors meeting specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are identified from the Nova Scotia Cancer Registry and sent an 83-item survey to assess psychosocial concerns and whether and how their needs were met. Descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages) and Chi-square analyses are used to examine associations between sociodemographic and provider factors and outcomes. <i>Results</i>: Anxiety and fear of recurrence, depression, and changes in sexual intimacy are major areas of concern for survivors. Various sociodemographic factors, such as immigration status, education, employment, and internet use, are associated with reported psychosocial health and having one's needs met. Having both a specialist and primary care provider in charge of follow-up care is associated with a significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) higher degree of psychosocial and informational needs met compared to only one physician or no follow-up physician in charge. Accessing a patient navigator also is significantly associated with a higher degree of needs met. <i>Conclusions</i>: Our study identifies the most prevalent psychosocial needs of cancer survivors and the factors associated with having a higher degree of needs met, including certain sociodemographic factors, follow-up care by both a primary care practitioner and specialist, and accessing a patient navigator.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Nov,"Chahine S, Walsh G, Urquhart R",3,1611,oncology,2025-11-22
32669938,Consensus statement: summary of the Quebec Lung Cancer Network recommendations for prioritizing patients with thoracic cancers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The emergence of covid-19 has the potential to change the way in which the health care system can accommodate various patient populations and might affect patients with non-covid-19 problems. The Quebec Lung Cancer Network, which oversees thoracic oncology services in the province of Quebec under the direction of the Ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux, convened to develop recommendations to deal with the potential disruption of services in thoracic oncology in the province of Quebec. The summary provided here has been adapted from the original document posted on the Programme québécois du cancer Web site at: https://www.msss.gouv.qc.ca/professionnels/documents/coronavirus-2019-ncov/PJ1_Recommandations_oncologie-thoracique-200415.pdf. Plans to optimize the health care system and potentially to prioritize services were discussed with respect to various levels of activity. For each level-of-activity scenario, suggestions were made for the services and treatments to prioritize and for those that might have to be postponed, as well as for potential alternatives to care. The principal recommendation is that the cancer centre executive committee and the multidisciplinary tumour board always try to find a solution to maintain standard-of-care therapy for all patients with thoracic tumours, using novel approaches to treatment and the adoption of a network approach to care, as needed. The effect of the covid-19 pandemic on the health care system remains unpredictable and requires that cancer teams unite and offer the most efficient and innovative therapies to all patients under the various conditions that might be forced upon them.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Jun,"Blais N, Bouchard M, Chinas M, Lizotte H, Morneau M, Spicer J, Martel S",7,1660,oncology,2025-11-22

33173383,Osteopontin level and promoter polymorphism in patients with metastatic breast cancer.,"Cancer initiation typically occurs when a proto-oncogene's coding region undergoes mutation, resulting in uncontrollable cell growth and division, or when a tumour suppressor gene's coding region is affected by a mutation that inhibits activity of the resulting gene product. The pathophysiologic result is, respectively, exaggerated cell-cycle growth or deficient programmed cell death. Osteopontin (opn) is an integrin-binding phosphoprotein that is expressed on the surface of normal cells. Osteopontin has a major role in diverse tumour components, especially those implicated in invasion and metastasis. In the present study, we aimed to illustrate the value of opn as a possible contributor in breast cancer (bca). This prospective study included 115 patients newly diagnosed with bca and distant metastasis who were recruited from the Oncology Center, Mansoura University, and the Department of Clinical Oncology and Nuclear Medicine, Mansoura University Hospital, Egypt. The patients recruited had been diagnosed with disseminated visceral metastasis (visceral crisis), with or without bone metastasis; patients with cranial metastasis were excluded from the study. All patients received first-line chemotherapy with docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> plus cisplatin 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or carboplatin 6 auc (area under the curve) on day 1 every 21 days for a maximum of 6 cycles or till development of toxicity. Trastuzumab (in cases of her2-positive disease) was given whenever possible (if government assistance or personal finances permitted). Serum levels of opn were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) before treatment was started. A group of 30 matched healthy women whose median serum opn level was 15 ng/dL were included, and that level was therefore defined as the cut-off value. In addition, opn gene mutation was determined by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). Correlations of pretreatment serum opn and opn gene mutation with various patient clinicopathologic variables, response to the treatment, progression-free survival (pfs), and overall survival (os) were assessed. Mean serum opn was highest in her2-amplified bca (64.4 ± 42.3 ng/dL), and then in triple-negative bca (55.9 ± 34.7 ng/dL), followed by the luminal B and A subtypes (38.4 ± 33.1 ng/dL and 36.3 ± 32.2 ng/dL respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.017). Testing by pcr revealed that opn gene mutation was highest in triple-negative bca (85% opn mutant vs. 15% non-mutant), and then in her2-overexpressed bca (80% opn mutant vs. 20% non-mutant), followed by luminal B bca (61.9% opn mutant vs. 38.1% non-mutant); the least expression was detected in luminal A bca (57.9% opn mutant vs. 42.1% non-mutant). Interestingly, patients with high serum opn and opn gene mutation experienced both poor pfs (median: 12 months vs. 14 months; <i>p</i> = 0.001) and poor os (median: 14 months vs. 18 months; <i>p</i> = 0.001). Moreover, participants with opn gene mutation experienced a poor response: of those with progressive disease, 74% had opn mutation and 26% had unmutated opn (<i>p</i> = 0.04). Additionally, high pretreatment serum opn was correlated with poor treatment response: 49.1 ± 33.8 ng/dL in patients with progressive disease and 35.5 ± 34.3 ng/dL in those who achieved a complete response, a partial response, or stable disease (<i>p</i> = 0.05). Strong concordance was found between high serum opn and opn gene mutation in 69 tumours (79.3%), and strong concordance was detected between normal or low serum opn and non-mutant opn in 28 tumours (60.8%). The current prospective work helps to highlight opn as a valid prognostic biomarker for patients with metastatic bca and reveals that high pretreatment serum opn and opn gene mutation are both strongly linked with poor response and survival. Concordance between elisa and pcr results indicates that either method can be used for the evaluation of opn. Increased opn gene mutation in triple-negative bca could assist in tailoring the treatment response in this very aggressive tumour subtype and could be considered a targetable molecule in future studies.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Oct,"Elbaiomy MA, Akl T, Elhelaly R, El-Beshbishi W, El Ghonemy MS, Elzehery R",6,4105,oncology,2025-11-22

The association between MAFLD and clinical outcomes of endometrial cancer (EC) remains unknown. We retrospectively included 725 EC patients between January 2012 and December 2020. The odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using logistic regression analyses. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used for survival analysis. Among EC patients, the prevalence of MAFLD was 27.7% (201/725, 95% confidence interval (Cl) = 0.245-0.311). MAFLD was significantly associated with cervical stromal involvement (CSI) (OR = 1.974, 95% confidence interval (Cl) = 1.065-3.659, <i>p</i> = 0.031). There was a significant correlation between overall survival (OS) and CSI (HR = 0.31; 95%CI: 0.12-0.83; <i>p</i> = 0.020), while patients with MAFLD had a similar OS to those without MAFLD (<i>p</i> = 0.952). Moreover, MAFLD was significantly associated with CSI in the type I EC subgroup (OR = 2.092, 95% confidence interval (Cl) = 1.060-4.129, <i>p</i> = 0.033), but not in the type II EC subgroup (<i>p</i> = 0.838). Further logistic regression analysis suggested that the hepatic steatosis index (HSI) was significantly associated with CSI among type I EC patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (OR = 1.079, 95% confidence interval (Cl) = 1.020-1.139, <i>p</i> = 0.012). About one-quarter of our cohort had MAFLD. MAFLD was associated with the risk of CSI in EC patients, and this association existed in type I EC patients but not in type II EC patients. Furthermore, the HSI can help predict CSI in type I EC patients without T2DM.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2023-Mar,"Lin X, Chen C, Jiang T, Ma J, Huang L, Huang L, Lei H, Tong Y, Huang G, Mao X, Sun P",11,1667,oncology,2025-11-22

This study examined how oncology nurses describe the evolution of emotions from first significant patient loss through cumulative patient death. To explore the emotional evolution of being an oncology nurse. Semistructured interviews with 7 oncology nurses. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. Participant's mean age was 41.3 years, with 13.9 years of nursing experience and 10.6 years of oncology experience. One metatheme, ""riding the roller coaster,"" described the overall emotional experience of the nurses. Three subthemes, ""all in and then,"" ""finding your way,"" and ""impact on self,"" further outlined the process taken to cope with workplace emotions. Oncology nurses are frequently exposed to loss and suffering. Findings from this study suggest that new nurses are underprepared for the emotional experience of being an oncology nurse. Further, they define their emotional boundaries in isolation and without guidance on how to develop healthy coping skills. Changing the culture of silence around mental health and well-being among healthcare professionals can provide space for important conversations to occur. Oncology nurses have few resources to teach them how to cope with the emotions experienced while caring for oncology patients. These findings suggest that alternative approaches to the traditional bereavement programs and innovative interventions offered to new oncology nurses within their first few years are needed.",Cancer nursing,2020-,"Phillips CS, Volker DL",2,1583,oncology,2025-11-22

33704176,Lung Metastasis Probability in Ewing Sarcoma: A Nomogram Based on the SEER Database.,"Up to now, an accurate nomogram to predict the lung metastasis probability in Ewing sarcoma (ES) at initial diagnosis is lacking. Our objective was to construct and validate a nomogram for the prediction of lung metastasis in ES patients. A total of 1157 patients with ES from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were retrospectively collected. The predictors of lung metastasis were identified via the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate logistic analysis. The discrimination and calibration of the nomogram were validated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration curve. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical usefulness and net benefits of the prediction model. Factors including age, tumor size, primary site, tumor extension, and other site metastasis were identified as the ultimate predictors for the nomogram. The calibration curves for the training and validation cohorts both revealed good agreement, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test identified that the model was well fitted (<i>p</i> > 0.05). In addition, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values in the training and validation cohorts were 0.732 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.607-0.808) and 0.741 (95% CI: 0.602-0.856), respectively, indicating good predictive discrimination. The DCA showed that when the predictive metastasis probability was between 1% and 90%, the nomogram could provide clinical usefulness and net benefit. The nomogram constructed and validated by us could provide a convenient and effective tool for clinicians that can improve prediction of the probability of lung metastasis in patients with ES at initial diagnosis.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Wang J, Fan Y, Xia L",3,1716,oncology,2025-11-22
32489249,Treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer after progression on nivolumab or pembrolizumab.,"Although PD-1 antibodies (PD1 Ab) are the standard of care for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (ansclc), most patients will progress. We compared survival outcomes for patients with ansclc who received systemic therapy (st) after progression and for those who did not. Additionally, clinical characteristics that predicted receipt of st after PD1 Ab failure were evaluated. All patients with ansclc in British Columbia initiated on nivolumab or pembrolizumab between June 2015 and November 2017, with subsequent progression, were identified. Eligibility criteria for additional st included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ecog) performance status (ps) of 3 or less and survival for more than 30 days from the last PD1 Ab treatment. Post-progression survival (pps) was assessed by landmark analysis. Baseline characteristics associated with pps were identified by multivariable analysis. Of 94 patients meeting the eligibility criteria, 33 received st after progression. In 75.6%, a PD1 Ab was received as first- or second-line treatment. The most common sts were erlotinib (36.4%) and docetaxel (27.3%). No statistically significant difference in median pps was observed between patients who did and did not receive st within 30 days of their last PD1 Ab treatment (6.9 months vs. 3.6 months, log-rank <i>p</i> = 0.15.) In multivariable analysis, factors associated with increased pps included an ecog ps of 0 or 1 compared with 2 or 3 [hazard ratio (hr): 0.42; 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.24 to 0.73; <i>p</i> = 0.002] and any response compared with no response to PD1 Ab (hr: 0.54; 95% ci: 0.33 to 0.90; <i>p</i> = 0.02). In this cohort, only 35.1% of patients eligible for post-PD1 Ab therapy received st. Post-progression survival was not significantly affected by receipt of post-progression therapy. Prospective trials are needed to clarify the benefit of post-PD1 Ab treatments.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Freeman AT, Lesperance M, Wai ES, Croteau NS, Fiorino L, Geller G, Brooks EG, Poonja Z, Fenton D, Irons S, Ksienski D",11,1900,oncology,2025-11-22
32489270,Health-related quality of life and well-being in parents of infants and toddlers with cancer.,"The unique psychosocial needs of parents and caregivers of young children with cancer are poorly understood. The aims of the present study were to examine health-related quality of life (hrqol), stress, and psychological distress in parents of young children (0-4 years) diagnosed with cancer; and the associations between parent psychosocial functioning and child treatment characteristics. Parents (<i>n</i> = 35) with a child (<i>n</i> = 19 male, 54.3%) 0-48 months of age (median: 31.06 months) on active cancer therapy were recruited. Parents completed questionnaires related to demographics, parent hrqol, parenting stress, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and parent psychological distress. Parents reported clinically elevated parenting stress (5.9%), posttraumatic stress symptoms (18.2%), and psychological distress (21.9%). Compared with population norms, parents reported lower hrqol in the vitality (<i>t</i> = 5.37, <i>p</i> < 0.001), mental health (<i>t</i> = 4.02, <i>p</i> < 0.001), role limitation-emotional (<i>t</i> = 3.52, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and general health perceptions (<i>t</i> = 2.25, <i>p</i> = 0.025) domains. Social functioning (β = 0.33, <i>p</i> = 0.041) predicted general health perceptions; vitality (β = 0.30, <i>p</i> = 0.134) and parent mental health (β = 0.24, <i>p</i> = 0.285) did not [<i>F</i><sub>(3,29)</sub> = 12.64, <i>p</i> < 0.001, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.57]. A subset of parents of young children on active cancer treatment experience clinically elevated psychosocial symptoms. Having poor social connections put parents at risk of perceiving their health more poorly in general. Supports that focus on preventing the emergence of clinically significant distress should focus on parents of young children with cancer who are most at risk of poor outcomes.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Morhun JM, Racine NM, Guilcher GMT, Tomfohr-Madsen LM, Schulte FSM",5,1803,oncology,2025-11-22
32669940,Consensus statement on tumour bed localization for radiation after oncoplastic breast surgery.,"Oncoplastic surgery (ops) is becoming the new standard of care for breast-conserving surgery, leading to some challenges with adjuvant radiation, particularly when accurate tumour bed (tbd) delineation is needed for focused radiation (that is, accelerated partial breast irradiation or boost radiation). Currently, no guidelines have been published concerning tbd localization for adjuvant targeted radiation after ops. A modified Delphi method was used to establish consensus by a panel of 20 experts in surgical and radiation oncology at the Canadian Locally Advanced Breast Cancer National Consensus Group and in a subsequent online member survey. These are the main recommendations:■ Surgical clips are necessary and should, at a minimum, be placed along the 4 side walls of the cavity, plus 1-4 clips at the posterior margin if necessary.■ Operative reports should include pertinent information to help guide the radiation oncologists.■ Breast surgeons and radiation oncologists should have a basic understanding of ops techniques and work on ""speaking a common language.""■ Careful consideration is needed when determining the value of targeted radiation, such as boost, in higher-level ops procedures with extensive tissue rearrangement. The panel developed a total of 6 recommendations on tbd delineation for more focused radiation therapy after ops, with more than 80% agreement on each statement. All are summarized, together with the corresponding evidence or expert opinion.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Jun,"Tse T, Knowles S, Bélec J, Caudrelier JM, Lock M, Brackstone M, Arnaout A",7,1485,oncology,2025-11-22
32218666,Complex surgery and perioperative systemic therapy for genitourinary cancer of the retroperitoneum.,"The purpose of the present guideline is to recommend surgical or systemic treatment for metastatic testicular cancer; T3b or T4, or node-positive, and metastatic renal cell cancer (rcc); and T3, T4, or node-positive upper tract urothelial (utuc) cancer. Draft recommendations were formulated based on evidence obtained through a systematic review of randomized controlled trials, comparative retrospective studies, and guideline endorsement. The draft recommendations underwent an internal review by clinical and methodology experts, and an external review by clinical practitioners. The primary literature search yielded eight guidelines, five systematic reviews, and twenty-seven primary studies that met the eligibility criteria. Cytoreductive nephrectomy should no longer be considered the standard of care in patients with T3b or T4, or node-positive, and metastatic rcc. Eligible patients should be treated with systemic therapy and have their primary tumour removed only after review at a multidisciplinary case conference (mcc). Adjuvant sunitinib after surgery is not recommended. Patients with venous tumour thrombus should be considered for surgical intervention. Patients with T3, T4, or node-positive utuc should have their tumour removed without delay. Decisions concerning lymph node dissection should be done at a mcc and be based on stage, expertise, and imaging. Adjuvant systemic treatment is recommended for resected high-risk utuc. Patients with metastasis-positive testicular cancer with residual tumour after systemic treatment should be treated at specialized centres. For all complex retroperitoneal surgeries, the evidence shows that higher-volume centres are associated with lower rates of procedure-related mortality, and patients should be referred to higher-volume centres for surgical resection.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Feb,"Finelli A, Coakley N, Chin J, Flood TA, Loblaw A, Morash C, Shayegan B, Siemens R",8,1826,oncology,2025-11-22
32905342,Sequence of therapy and survival in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.,"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pnets) often present as advanced disease. The optimal sequence of therapy is unknown. Sequential patients with advanced pnets referred to BC Cancer between 2000 and 2013 who received 1 or more treatment modalities were reviewed, and treatment patterns, progression-free survival (pfs), and overall survival (os) were characterized. Systemic treatments included chemotherapy, small-molecule therapy, and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. In 66 cases of advanced pnets, median patient age was 61.2 years (25%-75% interquartile range: 50.8-66.2 years), and men constituted 47% of the group. First-line therapies were surgery (36%), chemotherapy (33%), and somatostatin analogues (32%). Compared with first-line systemic therapy, surgery in the first line was associated with increased pfs and os (20.6 months vs. 6.3 months and 100.3 months vs. 30.5 months respectively, <i>p</i> < 0.05). In 42 patients (64%) who received more than 1 line of therapy, no difference in os or pfs between second-line therapies was observed. Our results confirm the primary role of surgery for advanced pnets. New systemic treatments will further increase options.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Aug,"Tsang ES, Loree JM, Speers C, Kennecke HF",4,1182,oncology,2025-11-22

Preserving quality of life is a primary goal for this subset of patients; (2) Methods: A group of 19 physicians working in South Italy and daily involved in head and neck cancer care took an anonymous online survey aimed at revealing the level of knowledge and the application of communication techniques in daily patient care; (3) Results: Several specialists, 18 out 19 (95%), considered that patient participation in therapeutic choices is mandatory. The main obstacles to complete and reciprocate communication still consist of lack of time and staff, but also in the need for greater organization, which goes beyond the multidisciplinary strategy already used; (4) Conclusions: A greater impulse to training and updating on issues related to counseling can improve communication between the different clinicians involved in the treatment plan.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2022-Aug,"Addeo R, Pompella L, Vitale P, Fattoruso SIS, Di Giovanni I, Perri F, Caraglia M, Fasano M, Arigliani R",9,1016,oncology,2025-11-22

Although the role of hipec has recently been questioned with respect to results from the prodige 7 trial, the role and benefit of a complete crs were confirmed, as observed with a 41-month gain in median survival in that study, and 15% of patients remaining disease-free at 5 years. Still, crc with pm is associated with a poor prognosis, and good patient selection is essential. Many questions about the optimal management approach for such patients remain, but all patients with pm from crc should be referred to, or discussed with, a pm surgical oncologist, because cure is possible. The objective of the present guideline is to offer a practical approach to the management of pm from crc and to reflect on the new practice standards set by recent publications on the topic.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Brind'Amour A, Dubé P, Tremblay JF, Soucisse ML, Mack L, Bouchard-Fortier A, McCart JA, Govindarajan A, Bischof D, Haase E, Giacomantonio C, Hebbard P, Younan R, MacNeill A, Boulanger-Gobeil C, Sidéris L",16,990,oncology,2025-11-22
33309481,Utilizing Data Visualization to Identify Survival and Treatment Differences Between Women With De Novo and Recurrent Metastatic Breast Cancer.,"De novo stage IV metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and recurrent MBC are considered the same when determining guideline-based care, but differences in treatment patterns exist. Data visualization can be used to understand these differences and optimize treatment delivery. This retrospective study evaluated treatment patterns for de novo and recurrent MBC using the American Society of Clinical Oncology's CancerLinQ Discovery database. Spatiotemporal graphics depicting treatment data were generated for MBC subtype and stratified by de novo and recurrent MBC. Descriptive statistics for categorical and continuous variables were calculated. We identified 1668 patients diagnosed and treated for MBC: 391 patients with HER2<sup>+</sup> MBC, 767 patients with HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2- MBC, and 510 patients with triple-negative MBC. Median survival from MBC diagnosis for patients with de novo MBC and recurrent MBC was 1.4 years (interquartile range, 0.6-3.0) and 1.8 years (interquartile range, 0.7-4.5), respectively. Both patients with de novo and recurrent HER2<sup>+</sup> MBC were often treated with continuous HER2-targeted therapy. Patients with de novo HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2- MBC often received chemotherapy followed by hormone therapy. This contrasted with treatment trends observed among patients with recurrent HR<sup>+</sup>/HER2- MBC who, after receiving chemotherapy, seldom went on to receive hormone therapy. Patients diagnosed with triple-negative MBC displayed less heterogeneous treatment trends. There are observable differences in survival and practice patterns between de novo and recurrent MBC.

32669943,Validation in Alberta of an administrative data algorithm to identify cancer recurrence.,"Readily available population-based data about cancer recurrence would improve surveillance and research for women of reproductive age. We randomly selected 200 women from the Alberta Cancer Registry who had received a cancer diagnosis and who ever had a pregnancy between 2003 and 2012. Administrative data were obtained and linked. Several definitions of recurrence were assessed using various minimum lengths of time between the initial diagnosis date and subsequent diagnoses or treatments, or both. Chart review was used as a ""gold standard"" definition of recurrence. Chart review identified recurrences in 26 women. The definition that best captured ""recurrence"" was 2 or more cancer diagnosis codes 10 or more months from the diagnosis date [sensitivity: 80.8%; 95% confidence interval (ci): 60.7% to 93.5%; specificity: 81.0%; 95% ci: 74.4% to 86.6%; positive predictive value: 38.9%; 95% ci: 25.9% to 53.1%; negative predictive value: 96.6%; 95% ci: 92.2% to 98.9%; kappa = 0.42; 95% ci: 0.28 to 0.57].

The objective of the present study was to characterize treatment patterns and survival outcomes in patients with advanced nsclc. We conducted a longitudinal population-level study in patients diagnosed with stage iv nsclc in Ontario between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2015, with follow-up to 31 March 2017 for overall survival and treatment sequence. Patients were stratified as nonsquamous or squamous histology. A sub-analysis was conducted for patients with nonsquamous histology who received targeted therapies, on the assumption that their tumours were <i>EGFR</i> mutation-positive (<i>EGFR</i>m+). Treatment patterns were determined, and survival was calculated from date of diagnosis to death or censoring. Of 24,729 nsclc cases identified, stage iv disease was diagnosed in 49.2%, histology was nonsquamous in 10,103, and <i>EGFR</i>m+ was assumed in 508. Median patient age ranged from 69 to 72 years for the three cohorts. For patients with nonsquamous histology, palliative radiotherapy was the most frequently used first-line treatment (44.4%), followed by no treatment (26.7%) and chemotherapy (14.9%). In the <i>EGFR</i>m+ cohort, 75.6% received gefitinib as first- or second-line therapy, and almost half (47.4%) the 473 patients with squamous histology treated with first-line chemotherapy received cisplatin or carboplatin with gemcitabine. Median overall survival in the nonsquamous and squamous cohorts was 4.9 and 4.6 months respectively; it was 17.6 months for patients who were <i>EGFR</i>m+. Survival of patients with stage iv nsclc remains poor, with the exception of patients who are <i>EGFR</i>m+.

32669931,Prognosis and clinicopathologic features in patients with gastric stump cancer after curative surgery.,"Gastric stump (""remnant"") cancer is the development of a malignancy related to previous gastric surgery. Prognosis in gastric stump cancer, compared with that in primary gastric cancer, is still controversial. From January 1988 to December 2012 at a single medical centre in Taiwan, 105 patients with gastric stump cancer, including 85 with previous peptic ulcer disease and 20 with previous gastric cancer, were analyzed for clinicopathologic characteristics and overall survival (os). The 5-year os rates for patients with gastric stump cancer and with primary gastric cancer were 51.2% and 54.5% respectively (<i>p</i> = 0.035). Analysis of clinicopathologic characteristics indicated that, compared with patients having primary gastric cancer, those with gastric stump cancer had more lymph node metastasis (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and had been diagnosed at a more advanced stage (<i>p</i> = 0.047). Multivariate analysis with os as an endpoint showed that age [<i>p</i> = 0.015; hazard ratio (hr): 2.300; 95% confidence interval (ci): 1.173 to 4.509], tumour size (<i>p</i> = 0.037; hr: 1.700; 95% ci: 1.031 to 2.801), stromal reaction (<i>p</i> = 0.021; hr: 1.802; 95% ci: 1.094 to 2.969), and pathologic N category (<i>p</i> = 0.001; hr: 1.449; 95% ci: 1.161 to 1.807) were independent predictors in gastric stump cancer. The os rates for patients with gastric stump cancer who previously had gastric cancer or peptic ulcer disease were 72.9% and 50.0% respectively (<i>p</i> = 0.019). The Borrmann classification was more superficial (<i>p</i> = 0.005), lymph node metastases were fewer (<i>p</i> = 0.004), and staging was less advanced (<i>p</i> = 0.025) in patients with gastric stump cancer who previously had gastric cancer than in their counterparts who previously had peptic ulcer disease. Survival is poorer in patients with gastric stump cancer who previously had peptic ulcer disease than in those who previously had primary gastric cancer. Patients with gastric stump cancer who previously had gastric cancer and could receive curative gastrectomy tended to have a better prognosis because of a more superficial Borrmann classification. Regular follow-up in patients who have undergone gastric surgery is recommended for the early detection of gastric stump cancer.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Jun,"Kung CY, Fang WL, Wang RF, Liu CA, Li AFY, Wu CW, Shyr YM, Chou SC, Huang KH",9,2277,oncology,2025-11-22

Recent analyses reveal that this has not been widely adopted. The purpose of this cost-effectiveness analysis is to compare the costs and benefits associated with observation or SLNB in women >70 years old with hormone receptor-positive, clinically node-negative, operable breast cancer. A decision tree with Markov modeling was created to compare treatment strategies using long-term follow-up data from clinical trials in this population. Costs were estimated from published literature and publicly available databases. Breast cancer-specific health-state utilities were derived from the literature and expert opinion. One-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. A structural sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of functional status and anxiety from nonevaluation of the axilla on cost-effectiveness. Costs and benefits, measured in life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), were tabulated across 10, 15, and 20 years and compared using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). SLNB is not cost-effective from the payer or societal perspectives with ICERs of $138,374/LY and $131,900/LY, respectively. When QALYs were considered, SLNB provided fewer QALYs (SLNB, 10.33 QALYs; observation, 10.53 QALYs) at a higher cost (SLNB, $15,845; observation, $4020). Structural sensitivity analysis revealed that SLNB was cost-effective in certain patients with significant anxiety related to axillary observation (ICER, $39,417/QALY). Routine SLNB in this population is not cost-effective.

37150319,Association of Patient Experience of Care and Radiation Therapy Initiation Among Women With Early-Stage Breast Cancer.,"For women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer, lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy (RT) has been a guideline-recommended treatment. However, lumpectomy followed by hormonal therapy is also an approved treatment for certain women. It is unclear what patient-driven factors are related to decisions to receive RT. This study examined relationships between patient-reported experience of care, an important dimension of health care quality, and receipt of RT after lumpectomy. We used National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data linked to the CMS Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems patient surveys (SEER-CAHPS) to examine experiences of care among women diagnosed with local/regional stage breast cancer 2000 to 2017 who received lumpectomy, were enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare, completed a CAHPS survey ≤18 months after diagnosis, and survived for this study period. Experience of care was assessed by patient-provided scores for physicians, doctor communication, care coordination, and other aspects of care. Multivariable logistic regression models assessed associations of receipt of external beam RT with care experience and patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. The study population included 824 women; 655 (79%) received RT. Women with higher experience of care scores for their personal doctor were significantly more likely to have received any RT (odds ratio [OR], 1.18; P = .033). Nonsignificant trends were observed for associations of increased RT with higher CAHPS measures of doctor communications (OR, 1.15; P = .055) and care coordination (OR, 1.24; P = .051). In contrast, women reporting higher scores for Part D prescription drug plans were significantly less likely to have received RT (OR, 0.78; P = .030).

The impact of geography and treatment center type (quaternary vs. non-quaternary) on access to care is unclear. A retrospective chart review was performed on HCC patients who received sorafenib in British Columbia from 2008 to 2016. Patients were grouped by Statistics Canada population center (PC) size criteria: large PC (LPC), medium PC (MPC), and small PC (SPC). Access to specialists, receipt of liver-directed therapies, and survival outcomes were compared between the groups. Of 286 patients, the geographical distribution was: LPC: 75%; MPC: 16%; and SPC: 9%.

Demographic data, risk factors, symptoms, treatment, and staging data were collected and analyzed. Survival analyses were completed. <b>Results:</b> A total of 1604 patients were included in our study, of which 766 (47.8%) were male. The median age at diagnosis was 68 (range 19-99). There were 374 (23.3%) patients with resectable tumors at diagnosis versus 597 (37.2%) with unresectable tumors. Of the patients, 380 (21.5%) received chemotherapy (CT) and 81 (5.0%) underwent radiation therapy. There was a clear trend with worsening stage and performance status associated with shorter median overall survival (OS). Ampulla of Vater tumors had the best median OS (25.69 months), while intrahepatic bile duct cancers had the worst (5.78 months).

39235549,A Transformative Decade: An Evaluation of the Francophone African Group of Pediatric Oncology's Training Program (2014-2024).,"Childhood cancer in Africa faces significant challenges due to workforce shortages and limited training opportunities. The French African Group for Pediatric Oncology (GFAOP) established the African School of Pediatric Oncology and introduced a pediatric oncology teaching called the ""Diplome Universitaire de Cancérologie Pédiatrique"" (DUCP) training program. This report evaluates the contributions of the DUCP program to pediatric oncology in Africa and discusses the sustainability of the program. The DUCP program trained six cohorts of healthcare professionals from French-speaking African countries since 2014. An evaluation was done on the participant demographics and regional contributions. Data were collected from trainee records and DUCP records. The DUCP program was evaluated based on the domains developed by the Education Program Assessment Tool (EPAT). Over the 10-year period, the DUCP program trained 107 healthcare professionals from 20 Francophone countries of which 99% were retained in Africa. Of the 83 graduates, 55 (66%) actively practice in pediatric oncology. Of the 18 francophone countries, 17 countries increased the number of pediatric oncologists and 16 improved the ratio of pediatric oncologists to children under 15 years. Nine new pediatric oncology services were established by the graduates thus far. Despite challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the program remains sustainable because of continued financial support, collaborations with the international pediatric oncology community, and adapting the program content to participant and local setting needs. Retention of graduates in childhood cancer services remains a challenge that necessitates governmental involvement. The DUCP program is impactful and sustainable and improves access for children to cancer services in Africa. By fostering continued collaboration with governments, addressing the needs of an increasing African population, and expanding support for similar initiatives, the program's longevity and positive impact can be further ensured.",Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,2025-Apr,"Kili A, ElKababri M, Coze C, Patte C, Van Heerden J, Martelli H, Harif M, Hessissen L",8,2057,oncology,2025-11-22
32489268,A population-based analysis of breast cancer incidence and survival by subtype in Ontario women.,"Breast cancer (bca) is the type of cancer most frequently diagnosed among women in Canada. Breast cancer is categorized into various molecular subtypes by the expression of estrogen receptor (er), progesterone receptor (pgr), and her2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). Currently, Canada has no national cancer registry with epidemiology data by subtype. Thus, we conducted a study to determine incidence, survival, and clinicopathologic characteristics by bca subtype [triple negative breast cancer (tnbc); her2+; and hormone receptor-positive (hr+), her2-] in Canadian women newly diagnosed with bca. Female patients diagnosed between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2016 (fiscal 2012-2015) were identified in the Ontario Cancer Registry, and individual patient data were linked to data in provincial health administrative databases. Descriptive statistics and Kaplan-Meier curves were generated. In this cohort, 3277 women (9.5%) had tnbc, 4902 (14.3%) had her2+ bca, and 22,247 (64.8%) had hr+, her2-breast cancer. The annual incidence was 15 per 100,000 for the tnbc group, 21-23 per 100,000 for the her2+ group, and 97-105 per 100,000 for the hr+, her2- group. The lowest median overall survival (mos) of 8.9 months was observed in women with clinical stage iv tnbc. In comparison, the mos was 37.3 months in those with her2+ disease and 35.2 months in those with and hr+, her2- metastatic bca. In the present study, the most recent and largest administrative database analysis of a Canadian population to date, we observed a subtype distribution consistent with previously reported data, together with comparable annual incidence and overall survival patterns.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Seung SJ, Traore AN, Pourmirza B, Fathers KE, Coombes M, Jerzak KJ",6,1670,oncology,2025-11-22

32489263,Canadian consensus: a new systemic treatment algorithm for advanced <i>EGFR-</i>mutated non-small-cell lung cancer.,"Multiple clinical trials for the treatment of advanced <i>EGFR-</i>mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) have recently been reported. As a result, the treatment algorithm has changed, and many important clinical questions have been raised:■ What is the optimal first-line treatment for patients with <i>EGFR-</i>mutated nsclc?■ What is preferred first-line treatment for patients with brain metastasis?■ What is the preferred second-line treatment for patients who received first-line first- or second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis)?■ What is the preferred treatment after osimertinib?■ What evidence do we have for treating patients whose tumours harbour uncommon <i>EGFR</i> mutations? A Canadian expert panel was convened to define the key clinical questions, review recent evidence, and discuss and agree on practice recommendations for the treatment of advanced <i>EGFR-</i>mutated nsclc. The published overall survival results for osimertinib, combined with its central nervous system activity, have led to osimertinib becoming the preferred first-line treatment for patients with common <i>EGFR</i> mutations, including those with brain metastasis. Other agents could still have a role, especially when osimertinib is not available or not tolerated. Treatment in subsequent lines of therapy depends on the first-line therapy or on T790M mutation status. Treatment recommendations for patients whose tumours harbour uncommon <i>EGFR</i> mutations are guided mainly by retrospective and limited prospective evidence. Finally, the evidence for sequencing and combining tkis with chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, checkpoint inhibitors, and other new therapeutics is reviewed. This Canadian expert consensus statement and algorithm were driven by significant advances in the treatment of <i>EGFR-</i>mutated nsclc.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Melosky B, Banerji S, Blais N, Chu Q, Juergens R, Leighl NB, Liu G, Cheema P",8,1841,oncology,2025-11-22

At the meeting, results from key studies in treatment-naïve chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) were presented. Of those studies, phase iii oral presentations focused on the efficacy and safety of therapy with inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (btk) and Bcl-2. One presentation reported updated results of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 1912 trial comparing the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib-rituximab with that of fludarabine-cyclophosphamide-rituximab in patients less than 70 years of age with cll. A second presentation reported interim results of the elevate tn trial, which is investigating the efficacy and safety of acalabrutinib-obinutuzumab or acalabrutinib monotherapy compared with chlorambucil-obinutuzumab. A third presentation reported on the single-agent zanubrutinib arm of the sequoia trial in patients with del(17p). The final presentation constituted a data update from the cll14 trial, which is evaluating fixed-duration venetoclax-obinutuzumab compared with chlorambucil-obinutuzumab, including the association of minimal residual disease status with progression-free survival.

32669930,Real-world impact of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer: a population-based analysis.,"Randomized trials have demonstrated equivalent oncologic outcomes and decreased morbidity in patients with rectal cancer who undergo laparoscopic surgery (lapsx) compared with open surgery (opensx). The objective of the present study was to compare short-term outcomes after lapsx and opensx in a real-world setting. A national discharge abstract database was used to identify all patients who underwent rectal cancer resection in Canada (excluding Quebec) from April 2004 through March 2015. Short-term outcomes examined included same-admission mortality and length of stay (los). Of 28,455 patients, 82.4% underwent opensx, and 17.6%, lapsx. The use of lapsx increased to 34% in 2014 from 5.9% in 2004 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Same-admission mortality was lower among patients undergoing lapsx than among those undergoing opensx (1.08% and 1.95% respectively, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). On multivariable analysis, the odds of same-admission mortality with lapsx was 36% lower than that with opensx (odds ratio: 0.64; <i>p</i> = 0.003). Median los was shorter after lapsx than after opensx (5 days and 8 days respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.0001). The strong association of lapsx with shorter los was maintained on multivariable analysis controlling for patient, surgeon, and hospital factors. For patients with rectal cancer, shorter los and decreased same-admission mortality are associated with the use of lapsx compared with opensx.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Jun,"Drohan AE, Hoogerboord CM, Johnson PM, Flowerdew GJ, Porte GA",5,1421,oncology,2025-11-22
33173389,Reimbursement recommendations for cancer drugs supported by phase II evidence in Canada.,"Phase ii data are increasingly being used as primary evidence for public reimbursement for oncologic drugs. We compared the frequency of reimbursement recommendations for phase ii and phase iii submissions and assessed for variables associated with a positive or conditional recommendation. We identified submissions made to the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review's Expert Review Committee (perc), of the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, July 2011 to July 2019, that were supported only by phase ii data. We identified variables within the perc's deliberative framework, including clinical and economic factors, associated with the final reimbursement recommendation. We conducted a multivariable analysis with logistic regression for these variables: feasibility of phase iii study, hematologic indication, and unmet need. We identified 139 submissions with a perc final recommendation. In 27 instances (19%), the submission had only phase ii evidence, and a positive recommendation was issued for 63% of them (the positive recommendation rate was 82% for submissions with phase iii evidence). Clinical benefit (<i>p</i> < 0.001), unmet need (<i>p</i> = 0.047), and patient alignment (<i>p</i> = 0.015) were associated with a positive recommendation. If a future phase iii study was deemed feasible for submissions with only phase ii evidence, then in univariable (<i>p</i> = 0.040) and multivariable analysis (<i>p</i> = 0.024), the perc was less likely to recommend reimbursement (odds ratio: 0.132). Although more than half the oncologic submissions with phase ii data were recommended for public reimbursement, compared with submissions having phase iii data, they were less likely to be recommended. A positive or conditional recommendation was more likely if clinical benefit and alignment with patient values was demonstrated. The perc was less likely to recommend reimbursement for submissions with phase ii evidence if a phase iii trial was deemed possible.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Oct,"Li YYR, Mai H, Trudeau ME, Mittmann N, Chiasson K, Chan KKW, Cheung MC",7,1987,oncology,2025-11-22

33504079,Prophylactic Surgery in the BRCA+ Patient: Do Women Develop Breast Cancer While Waiting?,"Breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutation carriers have an increased risk of breast cancer. Mitigation of this risk can be achieved via surveillance or prophylactic mastectomy with or without breast reconstruction. Those that choose surgery expect to reduce their chance of developing cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of patients developing breast cancer prior to surgery and to identify modifiable contributing factors within the patient journey. This is a historical cohort study of all BRCA mutation carriers identified through the British Columbia Cancer Hereditary Cancer Program between 2000 and 2012. Patients were divided into two groups: surveillance (S) and prophylactic mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction (PM/IBR). The incidence of cancer, time to PM/IBR and patient journeys were analyzed. A total of 333 women were identified. The time to surgery from mutation disclosure was a median of 31 (5.3, 75.7) months. During this period, 6% of patients developed breast cancer compared with a 14% incidence of breast cancer in patients choosing surveillance. The majority of time to surgery was attributed to the period between mutation disclosure and the decision to proceed with surgery. Strategies to facilitate decision-making as well as wait list prioritization and dedicated operative time should be targeted to this population to decrease the number of women developing an interval cancer prior to surgery.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-Jan,"Macadam SA, Slater K, Cheifetz RE, Jansen L, Chia S, Brasher PMA, Bovill ES",7,1472,oncology,2025-11-22
32905260,A cost-utility analysis of atezolizumab in the second-line treatment of patients with metastatic bladder cancer.,"Despite initial promising results, the IMvigor211 clinical trial failed to demonstrate an overall survival (os) benefit for atezolizumab compared with chemotherapy as second-line treatment for metastatic bladder cancer (mbc). However, given lessened adverse events (aes) and preserved quality of life (qol) with atezolizumab, there might still be investment value. To evaluate that potential value, we conducted a cost-utility analysis (cua) of atezolizumab compared with chemotherapy from the perspective of the Canadian health care payer. A partitioned survival model was used to evaluate atezolizumab compared with chemotherapy over a lifetime horizon (5 years). The base-case analysis was conducted for the intention-to-treat (itt) population, with additional scenario analyses for subgroups by IMvigor-defined PD-L1 status. Health outcomes were evaluated through life-year gains and quality-adjusted life-years (qalys). Cost estimates in 2018 Canadian dollars for systemic treatment, aes, and end-of-life care were incorporated. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (icer) was used to compare treatment strategies. Parameter and model uncertainty were assessed through sensitivity and scenario analyses. Per Canadian guidelines, cost and effectiveness were discounted at 1.5%. For the itt population, the expected qalys for atezolizumab and chemotherapy were 0.75 and 0.56, with expected costs of $90,290 and $8,466 respectively. The resultant icer for atezolizumab compared with chemotherapy was $430,652 per qaly. Scenario analysis of patients with PD-L1 expression levels of 5% or greater led to a lower icer ($334,387 per qaly). Scenario analysis of observed compared with expected benefits demonstrated a higher icer, with a shorter time horizon ($928,950 per qaly). Despite lessened aes and preserved qol, atezolizumab is not considered cost-effective for the second-line treatment of mbc.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Aug,"Parmar A, Richardson M, Coyte PC, Cheng S, Sander B, Chan KKW",6,1904,oncology,2025-11-22
32613363,Is it Wise to Omit Sentinel Node Biopsy in Elderly Patients with Breast Cancer?,"The Society of Surgical Oncology's Choosing Wisely<sup>®</sup> guidelines recommend against routine sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in clinically node-negative (cN0), hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer patients aged ≥ 70 years. We examined the effect of SLNB on treatment and outcomes in this population. A single-institution retrospective review of consecutive cN0 women ≥ 70 years of age who received SLNB was performed. We collected clinicopathologic characteristics and treatment data. Patients were compared according to SLN status with subset analysis of HR-positive patients. Outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and univariable analysis, and were compared using log-rank tests. Of 500 patients, 345 (69%) were SLN-negative. Median age was 74 years (range 70-96). Most tumors were T1 (72%), N0 (69%), invasive ductal (77%), without lymphovascular invasion (88%), estrogen receptor-positive (88%) and progesterone receptor-positive (75%), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (88%) treated with lumpectomy (71%). Median number of SLNs obtained was 2 (range 0-12) and median number of positive SLNs was 0 (range 0-8). Characteristics of the HR-positive subset were similar. In both the overall cohort and the HR-positive subset, SLN status significantly affected the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, although no significant effect on recurrence was observed. SLN-negative patients had better overall survival and less distant recurrence (both p < 0.0001). Adjuvant hormone therapy significantly improved overall survival. SLNB can be safely omitted in elderly patients with T1, HR-positive, invasive ductal carcinoma tumors, but may still provide important information affecting treatment. Patients who are candidates for adjuvant systemic chemotherapy should still be considered for SLNB.",Annals of surgical oncology,2021-Jan,"Sun J, Mathias BJ, Sun W, Fulp WJ, Zhou JM, Laronga C, Loftus LS, Lee MC",8,1843,oncology,2025-11-22
33467402,Mismatch Repair Universal Screening of Endometrial Cancers (MUSE) in a Canadian Cohort.,"Approximately 2-6% of endometrial cancers (ECs) are due to Lynch Syndrome (LS), a cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germline pathogenic variants (PVs) affecting the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. Increasingly, universal tissue-based screening of ECs has been proposed as an efficient and cost-effective way to identify families with LS, though few studies have been published on Canadian cohorts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and overall performance of a universal immunohistochemistry (IHC) screening program for women with EC within a single Canadian university hospital centre. From 1 October 2015 to 31 December 2017, all newly diagnosed ECs (n = 261) at our centre were screened for MMR protein deficiency by IHC. MMR deficiency was noted in 69 tumours (26.4%), among which 53 had somatic MLH1 promoter hypermethylation and were considered ""screen-negative"". The remaining MMR-deficient cases (n = 16) were considered ""screen-positive"" and were referred for genetic counselling and testing. Germline PVs were identified in 12/16 (75%). One additional PV was identified in a screen-negative individual who was independently referred to the Genetics service. This corresponds to an overall LS frequency of 5.0% among unselected women with EC, and 6.4% among women diagnosed under age 70 years. Our algorithm detected MMR gene pathogenic variants in 4.6% and 6.2% of unselected individuals and individuals under age 70 years, respectively. Four germline PVs (30.8%) were identified in individuals who did not meet any traditional LS screening criteria. Universal IHC screening for women with EC is an effective and feasible method of identifying individuals with LS in a Canadian context.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-Jan,"Lawrence J, Richer L, Arseneau J, Zeng X, Chong G, Weber E, Foulkes W, Palma L",8,1730,oncology,2025-11-22
38856026,NRG-CC004 ancillary data study-exploring the effect of bupropion on sexual desire in female cancer survivors with and without vulvovaginal symptoms.,"Female cancer survivors often experience estrogen-deprivation symptoms, which may lead to decreases in sexual desire, vulvovaginal health (lubrication, dryness, discomfort), and sexual satisfaction. Interventions are needed to address these concerns. The objective of this secondary analysis was to determine if women with higher (better) scores on the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) lubrication and pain subscales reported higher desire scores based on treatment with bupropion vs placebo. Participants were part of NRG Oncology's NRG-CC004 (NCT03180294), a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating bupropion (150 vs 300 mg) to improve sexual desire in survivors of breast or gynecologic cancer. All participants with baseline data from the FSFI lubrication, pain, and desire subscales with 5- and/or 9-week data were analyzed. The FSFI subscale scores were correlated using Spearman correlation coefficients. Logistic regression was used to determine associations between FSFI desire and other FSFI subscales while accounting for treatment arm and other covariates. The primary outcome of NRG Oncology's NRG-CC004 (NCT03180294) randomized phase II dose-finding trial was change from baseline to 9 weeks on the FSFI desire subscale score. Similar to the parent study, the primary outcome for this ancillary data study was the FSFI desire subscale score at 5 and 9 weeks. Overall, 230 participants completed the FSFI at baseline and 189 at 9 weeks. The strongest correlations were between lubrication and pain at baseline (all participants, rho = 0.77; bupropion arms, rho = 0.82), week 5 (all participants, rho = 0.71; bupropion arms, rho = 0.68), and week 9 (all participants, rho = 0.75; bupropion arms, rho = 0.78), and the weakest correlations were between desire and pain. In patients in the treatment arms there were no interactions between lubrication or pain.The impact of various covariates on the FSFI score for desire at 9 weeks demonstrated that participants of non-White race (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21-0.81; P = .010), with a high lubrication score (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.21-0.61; P = .0002), with a high pain score (less pain) (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.29-0.87; P = .014), or with prior pelvic surgery (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.23-0.63; P = .0002) had lower odds of having low desire. Acute estrogen-deprivation symptoms should be addressed prior to sexual desire intervention. This secondary analysis was not powered to examine all variables. Lubrication and pain were predictors of low desire. Therefore, vulvovaginal atrophy and associated genitourinary symptoms of menopause such as vaginal dryness and dyspareunia should be addressed prior to or in parallel with interventions for sexual desire.",The journal of sexual medicine,2024-Aug,"Carter J, Pugh SL, Arring N, Littell RD, Page SJ, Rowland KM, Goodman JR, Razaq W, Siddique S, Borges M, Kachnic LA, Barton DL",12,2734,oncology,2025-11-22

The review identified 238 patients in 2007-2009 and 283 patients in 2013-2015. Over time, the proportion of patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma increased to 73.1% from 60.9%, and diagnoses of nsclc not otherwise specified (nos) decreased to 6.4% from 18.9%, <i>p</i> < 0.0001. Use of diagnostic bronchoscopy decreased (26.9% vs. 18.4%), and mediastinal sampling procedures, including endobronchial ultrasonography, increased (9.2% vs. 20.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.0001). Use of ihc increased over time to 76.3% from 41.6% (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Larger surgical or core biopsy samples and those for which ihc was performed were more likely to undergo biomarker testing (both <i>p</i> < 0.01). Customizing treatment based on pathologic subtype and molecular genotype has become key in treating patients with advanced lung cancer. Greater accuracy of pathology diagnosis is being achieved, including through the routine use of ihc.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Oct,"Nadjafi M, Sung MR, Santos GDC, Le LW, Hwang DM, Tsao MS, Leighl NB",7,1459,oncology,2025-11-22

Frank argued that when one's life story is shipwrecked by chronic or life-threatening illness, storytelling is way to reorient one's biography to a new ending, repairing the narrative wreckage created by the illness experience. In this critical narrative study with nine pediatric oncology nurses in Ontario, Canada, we highlight how, through physical, narrative, and moral proximity, nurses become entwined in their patients' and families' illness narratives, and how developing this narrative knowledge provides nurses with opportunities to steer families onto new terrain. As well, we examine how nurses re-story and repair their own identities as ""good"" caregivers in situations when they are prevented from acting on behalf of their pediatric cancer patients. These findings contribute to literature on illness narratives by considering narrative repair as a relational process enacted as part of pediatric oncology caregiving.","Health (London, England : 1997)",2025-May,"Molinaro ML, Polzer J, Laliberte Rudman D, Savundranayagam M",4,1244,oncology,2025-11-22
33916930,Benefit from Adjuvant TKIs Versus TKIs Plus Chemotherapy in <i>EGFR</i>-Mutant Stage III-pN2 Lung Adenocarcinoma.,"Recent studies have demonstrated benefits from adjuvant tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) compared with chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer. We launched a multi-center retrospective study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of adjuvant TKIs with or without chemotherapy in epidermal growth factor receptor (<i>EGFR</i>)-mutant stage III-pN2 lung adenocarcinoma. Two hundred and seventy-four consecutive cases with stage III-pN2 lung adenocarcinoma and complete resection have been investigated. Clinic-pathologic characteristics, adjuvant treatments, long-term survivals, and toxicities were documented. Risk factors of distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. There were 52 (19.0%) patients treated with adjuvant TKIs alone, 199 (72.6%) with adjuvant chemotherapy alone, and 23 (8.4%) with both. After a median follow-up time of 29 months, the two-year DMFS, DFS, and OS was 61.2%, 54.1%, and 91.2%, respectively. According to univariable analyses, the risk factors were lymphovascular invasion (<i>p</i> < 0.001), extranodal extension (<i>p</i> = 0.005), and adjuvant systemic therapy (<i>p</i> = 0.006) for DMFS, <i>EGFR</i> mutation type (<i>p</i> = 0.025), lymphovascular invasion (<i>p</i> = 0.013), extranodal extension (<i>p</i> = 0.004), and adjuvant systemic therapy (<i>p</i> < 0.001) for DFS, and <i>EGFR</i> mutation type (<i>p</i> < 0.001) for OS.

32489250,Epidemiology of adult and pediatric Burkitt lymphoma in Canada: sequelae of the HIV epidemic.,"Although the pathogenesis and epidemiology of endemic Burkitt lymphoma (bl) have been extensively studied, the epidemiologic landscape of sporadic and immunodeficiency-associated bl in North America remains poorly understood. We used 3 distinct population-based cancer registries to retrospectively study bl incidence and mortality in Canada. Data for patient sex; age at the time of diagnosis; and reporting province, city, and forward sortation area (fsa, the first three characters of a postal code) were analyzed. During 1992-2010, 1420 patients with bl in Canada were identified (incidence rate: 2.40 cases per million patient-years), of which 71.1% were male patients. Mean age at diagnosis was 55.5 ± 20.8 years. A bimodal incidence by age distribution was seen in both sexes, with pediatric- and adult-onset peaks. An analysis based on fsas identified select communities with statistically higher rates of adult bl. Several of those fsas were located within the 3 major metropolitan areas (Montreal, Vancouver, Toronto) and within self-identified lgbtq communities. The fsas with a higher socioeconomic status score were associated with lower rates of bl. Current results highlight the geographic and historic pattern of bl in Canada. The human immunodeficiency virus remains an important risk factor for adult bl.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Roy SF, Ghazawi FM, Le M, Lagacé F, Roy CF, Rahme E, Savin E, Zubarev A, Sasseville D, Popradi G, Litvinov IV",11,1322,oncology,2025-11-22

In recent years, more extensive use of stereotactic radiation (STRT) and the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors have positively impacted outcomes in patients with metastatic melanoma.brain metastases. Here, we examined real world clinical outcomes of patients presenting with melanoma brain metastases (MBMs). <i>Methods:</i> This retrospective review evaluated MBMs patients treated at The Ottawa Hospital from April 2000 to July 2017. Clinical, radiologic, pathologic and treatment information were gathered from the electronic medical records. The primary outcome was overall survival. The proportional Cox regression model was employed for survival data, while the Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests analyzed the relationship between categorical and continuous data, respectively. <i>Results:</i> This retrospective study included 276 patients. Brain metastases were detected symptomatically in 191 patients (69.2%); the rates of detection by routine screening were 4.6% in the pre-2012 era and 11.7% in the contemporary era (<i>p</i> = 0.029). Median survival was three months. Predictors of overall survival were age, higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values, multiple brain lesions, more extensive extracranial disease, neurological symptoms, infratentorial lesions and treatment type. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that stereotactic radiotherapy (STRT) was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.401 (<i>p</i> < 0.001) for survival; likewise, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.375 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). <i>Conclusion:</i> The findings from this study as ""real world"" data are consistent with results of pivotal clinical trials in MBMs patients and support contemporary locoregional and immunotherapy practices.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-Jan,"Phillips WJ, Baghai T, Ong M, Lo B, Ibrahim AM, Smith TKT, Song X",7,1876,oncology,2025-11-22

The purpose of this study was to report the first quality-adjusted survival analysis comparing the two treatments. NRG/RTOG 1203 randomized patients having undergone hysterectomy to either 3DCRT or IMRT. Stratification factors included RT dose, chemotherapy, and disease site. The EQ-5D, both index and visual analog scale (VAS), were obtained at baseline, 5 weeks after the start of RT, 4-6 weeks post RT and 1 and 3-years post RT. EQ-5D index and VAS scores along with quality-adjusted survival (QAS) were compared between treatment arms using the t-test at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. NRG/RTOG 1203 enrolled 289 patients of which 236 consented to participate in the patient reported outcome (PRO) assessments. QAS was higher in women treated with IMRT, 1374 vs 1333 days (p = 0.5) compared to patients treated with 3DCRT, but this difference was not statistically different. Patients treated with IMRT had less of a decline in VAS score 5 weeks post RT, -5.04, compared to patients treated with 3DCRT, -7.48, although not statistically significant (p = 0.38). This is the first report of the use of the EQ-5D comparing two radiotherapy techniques in the treatment of gynecologic malignancies after surgery.

32489266,HPV sampling options for cervical cancer screening: preferences of urban-dwelling Canadians in a changing paradigm.,"Of women in Canada diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer, 50% have not been screened according to guidelines. Interventions involving self-collected samples for human papillomavirus (hpv) screening could be an avenue to increase uptake. To guide the development of cervical cancer screening interventions, we assessed ■ preferred sample collection options,■ sampling preferences according to previous screening behaviours, and■ preference for self-sampling among women not screened according to guidelines, as a function of their reasons for not being screened. Data were collected in an online survey (Montreal, Quebec; 2016) and included information from female participants between the ages of 21 and 65 years who had not undergone hysterectomy and who had provided answers to survey questions about screening history, screening interval, and screening preferences (<i>n</i> = 526, weighted <i>n</i> = 574,392). In weighted analyses, 68% of all women surveyed and 82% of women not recently screened preferred screening by self-sampling. Among women born outside of Canada, the United States, or Europe, preference ranged from 47% to 60%. Nearly all women (95%-100%) who reported fear or embarrassment, dislike of undergoing a Pap test, or lack of time or geography-related availability of screening as one of their reasons for not being screened stated a preference for undergoing screening by self-sampling. The results demonstrate a strong preference for self-sampling among never-screened and not-recently-screened women, and provides initial evidence for policymakers and researchers to address how best to integrate self-sampling hpv screening into both organized and opportunistic screening contexts.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Datta GD, Mayrand MH, Qureshi S, Ferre N, Gauvin L",5,1711,oncology,2025-11-22
32218655,Does free nicotine replacement improve smoking cessation rates in cancer patients?,"Cigarette smoking is carcinogenic and has been linked to inferior treatment outcomes and complication rates in cancer patients. Here, we report the results of an 18-month pilot smoking cessation program that provided free nicotine replacement therapy (nrt). In January 2017, the smoking cessation program at our institution began offering free nrt for actively cigarette-smoking patients with cancer. The cost of 4 weeks of nrt was covered by the program, and follow-up was provided by smoking cessation champions. From January 2017 to June 2018, 8095 patients with cancer were screened for cigarette use, of whom 1135 self-identified as current or recent smokers. Of those 1135 patients, 117 enrolled in the program and accepted a prescription for nrt. The rates of patient referral and patients attending a referral appointment were significantly higher in 2018-2018 than they had been in 2015-2016 (100% vs. 80.3%, <i>p</i> < 0.001, and 27.6% vs. 11.3%, <i>p</i> < 0.001, respectively). Median follow-up was 9.0 months (25%-75% interquartile range: 5.7-11.6 months). Of the patients who accepted nrt and who also had complete data (<i>n</i> = 71), 25 (35.2%) reported complete smoking cessation, and 32 (45.1%) reported only decreased cigarette smoking. On univariable analysis, no factors were significantly predictive of smoking cessation, although initial cigarette use (>10 vs. ≤10 initial cigarettes) was significantly predictive of smoking reduction (odds ratio: 5.04; 95% confidence interval: 1.46 to 17.45; <i>p</i> = 0.011). This pilot study of free nrt demonstrated rates of referral and acceptance of nrt that were improved compared with historical rates, and most referred patients either decreased their use of cigarettes or quit entirely.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Feb,"Arifin AJ, McCracken LC, Nesbitt S, Warner A, Dinniwell RE, Palma DA, Louie AV",7,1755,oncology,2025-11-22
32905332,Age-dependent increased odds of cardiovascular risk factors in cancer survivors: Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging cohort.,"This study compared the odds of self-reported and objectively measured cardiovascular (cv) risk factors in a sample of Canadian cancer survivors and individuals without cancer. A nationally representative sample of 45- to 85-year-old cancer survivors (<i>n</i> = 6288) in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging were compared with individuals without cancer (<i>n</i> = 44,051). The most prevalent risk factors in cancer survivors were all self-reported or easily measured in clinic: overweight or obesity (68.0%), former smoking (62.9%), fewer than 5 daily servings of fruits and vegetables (59.8%), hypertension (43.7%), and high waist circumference (47.0%). After adjustment for sex and education, the odds ratios of several cv risk factors varied by age in cancer survivors and the non-cancer controls. At ages 50 and 60, cancer survivors have increased odds of overweight or obesity, former smoking, hypertension, high waist circumference and truncal fat, diabetes, lung disease, and heart rate greater than 80 bpm compared with non-cancer controls. At age 70, odds did not differ for many risk factors; at age 80, no differences were evident. Without modification by age, low physical activity was more prevalent in cancer survivors (odds ratio: 1.27; 95% confidence interval: 1.17 to 1.39). There were no differences in the odds of cv risk factors measured by specialized equipment, including electrocardiography, carotid ultrasonography, spirometry, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The odds of several easy-to-assess cv disease risk factors are higher among middle-aged, but not older, cancer survivors relative to the general Canadian population. Initial assessment of cv risk for middle-aged adults in the survivorship setting could be quickly and inexpensively performed using self-reported and easily measured metrics.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Aug,"Kirkham AA, Pituskin E, Neil-Sztramko SE",3,1837,oncology,2025-11-22
32489257,Impact of Recurrence Score on type and duration of chemotherapy in breast cancer.,"The use of Oncotype dx (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA, U.S.A.) testing has been shown to change treatment decisions in approximately 30% of breast cancer (bca) cases, but research on how Recurrence Score testing has affected the type of chemotherapy offered is limited. We sought to determine if the availability of Oncotype dx testing resulted in a change to the type and duration of chemotherapy regimens used in the treatment of early-stage hormone receptor-positive bca. In a population-based cohort study, patients treated in the 2 years before the availability of Oncotype dx testing were compared with patients treated in the 2 years after testing availability. Charts were audited and divided into 2 groups: pre-Oncotype dx and post-Oncotype dx. The groups were compared for differences in duration of chemotherapy (12 weeks vs. >12 weeks), types of agents used (anthracycline vs. non-anthracycline), and myelosuppressive potential of the chosen regimen. Of 834 patients who fulfilled the enrolment criteria, 360 fell into the pre-Oncotype dx era, and 474, into the post-Oncotype dx era. An increase of 11.2 percentage points, to 69.5% from 58.3%, was observed in the proportion of patients receiving short-course compared with long-course chemotherapy (<i>p</i> = 0.068). The proportion of patients prescribed anthracycline-containing regimens declined in the post-Oncotype dx era (47.7% pre vs. 32.2% post, <i>p</i> = 0.016).

32489255,Nivolumab in metastatic melanoma: good efficacy and tolerability in elderly patients.,"Nivolumab is an anti-PD-1 antibody that restores the antitumour immune function of T cells, blocking the binding of PD-1 with its ligand PD-L1. PD-1 is expressed on T cells and interacts with PD-L1 on tumour cells. The PD-1-PD-L1 link inhibits T cell activation. In metastatic melanoma, PD-1-PD-L1 binding plays a critical role, and the advent of the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab has delivered new and effective treatment options with proven clinical benefit. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of nivolumab in elderly patients with metastatic melanoma. The study enrolled 55 elderly patients (75 years of age and older) with a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. Primary endpoints of the study were progression-free survival (pfs) and the objective response rate; secondary endpoints were overall survival, reduction in serum lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) from before to after treatment, and tolerability. Nivolumab was well tolerated and resulted in good disease control, with a manageable toxicity profile and significant clinical benefit. The duration of pfs was 5.1 months (95% confidence interval: 3.5 months to 6.8 months). A significant correlation was observed between reduction in serum ldh and pfs: 0.60 (95% confidence interval: 0.28 to 0.86; <i>p</i> = 0.002). Nivolumab is an immunotherapy treatment that has proved to be an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic option in elderly patients with metastatic melanoma.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"De Luca R, Meraviglia S, Blasi L, Maiorana A, Cicero G",5,1450,oncology,2025-11-22

32489258,Digital gene expression analysis might aid in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer.,"Thyroid cancer represents approximately 90% of endocrine cancers. Difficulties in diagnosis and low inter-observer agreement are sometimes encountered, especially in the distinction between the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (fvptc) and other follicular-patterned lesions, and can present significant challenges. In the present proof-of-concept study, we report a gene-expression assay using NanoString nCounter technology (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA, U.S.A.) that might aid in the differential diagnosis of thyroid neoplasms based on gene-expression signatures. Our cohort included 29 patients with classical papillary thyroid carcinoma (ptc), 13 patients with fvptc, 14 patients with follicular thyroid carcinoma (ftc), 14 patients with follicular adenoma (fa), and 14 patients without any abnormality. We developed a 3-step classifier that shows good correlation with the pathologic diagnosis of various thyroid neoplasms. Step 1 differentiates normal from abnormal thyroid tissue; step 2 differentiates benign from malignant lesions; and step 3 differentiates the common malignant entities ptc, ftc, and fvptc. Using our 3-step classifier approach based on selected genes, we developed an algorithm that attempts to differentiate thyroid lesions with varying levels of sensitivity and specificity. Three genes-namely <i>SDC4, PLCD3</i>, and <i>NECTIN4/PVRL4-</i>were the most informative in distinguishing normal from abnormal tissue with a sensitivity and a specificity of 100%. One gene, <i>SDC4</i>, was important for differentiating benign from malignant lesions with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 92%. Various combinations of genes were required to classify specific thyroid neoplasms. This preliminary proof-of-concept study suggests a role for nCounter technology, a digital gene expression analysis technique, as an adjunct assay for the molecular diagnosis of thyroid neoplasms.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Armanious H, Adam B, Meunier D, Formenti K, Izevbaye I",5,1932,oncology,2025-11-22

""Minimal itm"" is defined as lesions in a location with limited spread (generally 1-4 lesions); the lesions are generally superficial, often clustered together, and surgically resectable. ""Moderate itm"" is defined as more than 5 lesions covering a wider area, or the rapid development (within weeks) of new in-transit lesions. ""Maximal itm"" is defined as large-volume disease with multiple (>15-20) 2-3 cm nodules or subcutaneous or deeper lesions over a wide area.■ In patients presenting with minimal itm, complete surgical excision with negative pathologic margins is recommended. In addition to complete surgical resection, adjuvant treatment may be considered.■ In patients presenting with moderate unresectable itm, consider using this approach for localized treatment: intralesional interleukin 2 or talimogene laherparepvec as 1st choice, topical diphenylcyclopropenone as 2nd choice, or radiation therapy as 3rd choice. Evidence is insufficient to recommend intralesional bacille Calmette- Guérin or CO<sub>2</sub> laser ablation outside of a research setting.■ In patients presenting with maximal itm confined to an extremity, isolated limb perfusion, isolated limb infusion, or systemic therapy may be considered.

Under the auspices of the Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists, we conducted an online national survey to better understand the impact of the pandemic on the medical oncology community in Canada. An English-language multiple-choice survey, including questions about demographics, covid-19 risk, use of personal protective equipment (ppe), personal challenges, and chemotherapy management was distributed to Canadian medical oncologists. The survey was open from 30 March to 4 April 2020, and attracted 159 responses. More than 70% of medical oncologists expressed moderate-to-extreme concern about personally contracting covid-19 and about family members or patients (or both) contracting covid-19 from them. Despite that high level of concern, considerable variability in the use of ppe in direct cancer care was reported at the time of this survey, with 33% of respondents indicating no routine ppe use at their institutions and 69% indicating uncertainty about access to adequate ppe. Of the respondents, 54% were experiencing feelings of nervousness or anxiety on most days, and 52% were having feelings of depression or hopelessness on at least some days. Concern about aging parents or family and individual wellness represented the top personal challenges identified. The management of cancer patients has been affected, with adoption of telemedicine reported by 82% of respondents, and cessation of clinical trial accrual reported by 54%. The 3 factors deemed most important for treatment decision-making were■ cancer prognosis and anticipated benefit from treatment,■ risk of treatment toxicity during scarce health care access, and■ patient risk of contracting covid-19. This report describes the results of the first national survey assessing the impact of the covid-19 on Canadian medical oncologists and how they deliver systemic anticancer therapies.

Selection of appropriate targeted therapy for patients with nsclc now involves testing for multiple biomarkers, including <i>EGFR</i>. <i>EGFR</i> mutation status is required to optimally treat patients with nsclc, and thus timely and accurate biomarker testing is necessary. However, in Canada, there are currently no standardized processes or methods in place to ensure consistent testing implementation. That lack creates challenges in ensuring that all appropriate biomarkers are tested for each patient and that the medical oncologist receives the results for making informed treatment decisions in a timely way. An expert multidisciplinary working group was convened to create consensus recommendations about biomarker testing in advanced nsclc in Canada, with a primary focus on <i>EGFR</i> testing. Recognizing that there are biomarkers beyond <i>EGFR</i> that require timely identification, the expert multidisciplinary working group considered <i>EGFR</i> testing in the broader context of integration into complex lung biomarker testing. Primarily, the panel of experts recommends that all patients with nonsquamous nsclc, regardless of stage, should undergo comprehensive reflex biomarker testing at diagnosis with targeted next-generation sequencing. The panel also considered the <i>EGFR</i> testing algorithm and the challenges associated with the pre-analytic, analytic, and post-analytic elements of testing. Strategies for funding testing by reducing silos of single biomarker testing for <i>EGFR</i> and for optimally implementing the recommendations presented here and educating oncology professionals about them are also discussed.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Cheema PK, Gomes M, Banerji S, Joubert P, Leighl NB, Melosky B, Sheffield BS, Stockley T, Ionescu DN",9,1760,oncology,2025-11-22
33380871,Lysine analogue use during cancer surgery: a survey from a Canadian tertiary care centre.,"When used during surgery, antifibrinolytic hemostatic agents such as lysine analogues are effective at reducing blood loss and the need for transfusions. Despite proven efficacy, use of hemostatic agents remains low during some surgeries. Our objective was to explore surgeon opinions about, and use of lysine analogues in, oncologic surgeries at a large tertiary care academic institution. We administered a survey to surgeons who perform high-transfusion-risk oncologic surgeries at a large academic hospital in Ottawa, Ontario. Design and distribution of the survey followed a modified Dillman method. To ensure that the survey questionnaire was relevant, clear, and concise, we performed informant interviews, cognitive interviews, and pilot-testing. The final survey consisted of 19 questions divided into 3 sections: respondent demographics, use of hemostatic agents, and potential clinical trial opinions. Of 28 surgeons, 24 (86%) participated. When asked to indicate the frequency of lysine analogue use, ""never"" accounted for 46% of the responses, and ""rarely"" (<10% of the time) accounted for 23% of the responses. Reasons for never using included ""unfamiliar with benefits"" and ""prefer alternatives."" Fifteen surgeons (63%) felt that a trial was needed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of lysine analogues in their cancer field. Our survey found that lysine analogues are infrequently used during oncologic surgeries at our institution.

38925824,Extracellular Vesicle DNA Extraction and Sequencing in Ancient Serum Samples From Patients With Breast Cancer.,"Extracellular vesicle DNA (EV-DNA) has emerged as a novel biomarker for tumor mutation detection using liquid biopsies, exhibiting biological advantages compared to cell-free DNA (cfDNA). This study assessed the feasibility of EV-DNA and cfDNA extraction and sequencing in old serum samples of patients with breast cancer (BC). A total of 28 serum samples of 27 patients with corresponding clinical information were collected between 1983 and 1991. EV-DNA was extracted using Exo-GAG kit (Nasabiotech) and cfDNA using QIAsymphony DSP Virus/Pathogen Midi Kit (Qiagen), respectively. Subsequently, 10 matched samples (EV-DNA n=5, cfDNA n=5) of five patients were subjected to sequencing using the Oncomine™ Breast cfDNA Research Assay v2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were collected on median 1.9 years after primary diagnosis [interquartile range (IQR)=0.2-7.2]. Median follow-up was 9.5 years (IQR=5.2-14.2). Median age of serum samples was 36.1 years (IQR=34.5-37.3). EV-DNA and cfDNA were extracted from 100% (28/28) of the included samples. Both, DNA quantity and concentration were comparable between EV-DNA and cfDNA. Sequencing was successfully performed in 100% (10/10) of the included samples. Two matched analyses yielded equivalent results in EV-DNA and cfDNA (no mutations, n=1; PIK3CA mutation, n=1), whilst in two analyses, PIK3CA mutation was only found in cfDNA, and in one analysis, a TP53 mutation was only found in EV-DNA.

32218662,Trends in survival based on treatment modality in patients with pancreatic cancer: a population-based study.,"Pancreatic cancer (pcc) is one of the most lethal types of cancer, and surgery remains the optimal treatment modality for patients with resectable tumours. The objective of the present study was to examine and compare trends in the survival rate based on treatment modality in patients with pcc. This population-based retrospective analysis included all patients with known-stage pcc in Ontario between 2007 and 2015. Flexible parametric models were used to conduct the survival analysis. Survival rates were calculated based on treatment modality, while adjusting for patient- and tumour-specific covariates. The study included 6437 patients. We found no noticeable improvement in survival for patients with stage iii or iv tumours; however, for stage i disease, the 1-, 2-, and 5-year survival rates increased over time to 81% from 51%, to 71% from 35%, and to 61% from 22% respectively. Most improvements were seen for surgical modalities, with 2-year survivals increasing to 89% from 65% for distal pancreatectomy (dp) without radiation (rt) or chemotherapy (ctx), to 65% from 37% for dp plus rt or ctx, to 60% from 44% for Whipple-only, and to 50% from 36% for Whipple plus rt or ctx. Lastly, 5-year survival improved to 81% from 52% for dp only, to 41% from 12% for dp plus rt or ctx, to 49% from 25% for Whipple-only, and to 26% from 12% for Whipple plus rt or ctx. Most cases of pcc continue to be diagnosed at a late stage, with poor short-term and long-term prognoses. After adjustment for patient age, sex, and year of diagnosis, the survival for stage i tumours and for surgical modalities increased over time. Further research is needed to identify the reasons for improvement in survival during the study period.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Feb,"Shakeel S, Finley C, Akhtar-Danesh G, Seow HY, Akhtar-Danesh N",5,1726,oncology,2025-11-22
33173385,Understanding clinical practice and survival outcomes in patients with unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer in a single centre in Quebec.,"A retrospective cohort study considered patients 18 or more years of age diagnosed between January 2007 and May 2018 with unresectable stage iii non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) who received combined chemoradiation (crt). Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method to determine median overall (os) and progression-free survival (pfs) and the associated 95% confidence intervals (cis). Cox regression analysis was performed to identify factors prognostic for survival, including age, sex, smoking status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ecog ps), histology, treatment type, tumour size, and nodal status. Of 226 patients diagnosed with unresectable stage iii disease, 134 (59%) received combined crt. Mean age was 63 years; most patients were white, were current smokers, had an ecog ps of 0 or 1, and had nonsquamous histology. Median pfs was 7.03 months (95% ci: 5.6 months to 8.5 months), and os for the cohort was 18.7 months (95% ci: 12.4 months to 24.8 months). Of those patients, 78% would have been eligible for durvalumab consolidation therapy. Univariate analysis demonstrated a significant os benefit (<i>p</i> = 0.010) for concurrent crt (ccrt) compared with sequential crt (scrt). Disease-specific survival remained significantly better in the ccrt group (<i>p</i> = 0.004). No difference in pfs was found between the ccrt and scrt groups. In addition, tumour size and nodal involvement were significant discriminating factors for survival (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In this patient cohort, 64% of patients progressed and received subsequent therapy. Based on multivariate analysis, tumour size and nodal station were the only factors predictive of survival in patients with unresectable stage iii nsclc treated with crt. Combined crt has been the standard treatment for unresectable stage iii nsclc. In our study, a trend of better survival was seen for ccrt compared with scrt. Factors predictive of survival in patients with stage iii disease treated with crt were tumour size and nodal station. Most patients with stage iii disease would potentially be eligible for durvalumab maintenance therapy based on the eligibility criteria from the pacific trial. The use and effectiveness of novel treatments will have to be further studied in our real-world patient population and similar populations elsewhere.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Oct,"Agulnik J, Kasymjanova G, Pepe C, Hurry M, Walton RN, Sakr L, Cohen V, Lecavalier M, Small D",9,2346,oncology,2025-11-22
35989203,Psychometric assessment of the Concerns about Late Effects in Oncology Questionnaire (CLEO) among female breast cancer survivors.,"The Concerns about Late Effects in Oncology (CLEO) questionnaire was developed to measure concerns cancer survivors may have about late effects. The current study sought to assess the Concerns about Late Effects in Oncology's (CLEO) psychometric properties - factor structure, construct validity, discriminatory power, and internal consistency. 147 breast cancer survivors completed a survey. Factor structure was determined by exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Construct validity was assessed against fear of cancer recurrence, anxiety, depression, quality of life, and neuroticism. Discriminatory power was assessed against participants' age and clinical characteristics. The EFA confirmed a 4-factor structure; health professionals' support, psychological impacts, adapting, and daily functional impacts. There was only partial support for construct validity and discriminatory power. The CLEO demonstrated excellent internal consistency, with an overall Cronbach's α = 0.87 (health professionals' support: α = 0.89, psychological impacts: α = 0.93, adapting: α = 0.82, and daily functional impacts: α = 0.89). The findings suggest further development of the CLEO should focus on the psychological and functional impacts of late effects. Use of the CLEO may enhance communication about the impact of late effects, ensuring earlier identification and management of late effects in this population.",Patient education and counseling,2022-Nov,"Chen J, Henry G, Butow P, Juraskova I, Laidsaar-Powell R, Shaw J",6,1400,oncology,2025-11-22
33477965,"Implementation of the Canadian National Standards in Breast Cancer Surgical Care: Gaps, Barriers, Enablers and Opportunities.","<b>Background</b>: Diagnosis and surgical treatment decision making for breast cancers has become increasingly complex. Recently, Canadian Partnership Against Cancer (CPAC) published pan-Canadian evidence-based surgical standards for the care of breast cancer patients. This study was undertaken to assess the degree to which these standards were currently met in practice and to further understand the determinants of their implementation nationally. <b>Methods</b>: This study was undertaken in two parts-(1) National survey of breast cancer surgeons to assess the perceived extent of implementation of these standards in their institution and province; (2) Formation of a focus group with a representative sample of breast surgeons across Canada to further understand the barriers and facilitators towards future breast standards implementation. <b>Results</b>: 35 surgeons participated in the survey: 66% were from community hospitals. There were four categories of standards that were the most significantly lacking across the country-(a) processes related to quality assurance, (b) turnaround time for pathology results (c) psychosocial and health-related support for the breast cancer patient and (d) breast reconstruction for patients undergoing mastectomy. The focus group included participants from all ten Canadian provinces. For each standard, the 134 determinants fell into three main categories-individual physician (n = 27, 20%); organizational (n = 46, 34%), and system (n = 61, 46%). While specific determinants were present for each category, surgical standards were more likely to be implemented in practice if (1) they aligned with organizational priorities standards; (2) the individual physicians or physician groups were accountable to the organization and/or cancer jurisdiction regarding compliance with the standard; and (3) if infrastructure or resources existed within the organization or system for the reliable collection of relevant, meaningful, practice changing data combined with the capability of benchmarking, peer-peer comparisons and timely feedback to the surgeons. <b>Conclusion</b>: The results of this study demonstrated variation, barriers and opportunities for the national implementation of CPAC's breast cancer surgery standards and identified determinants of high-quality breast surgical care delivery.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-Jan,"Arnaout A, Prashad A, Dunk N, Rogers J, Finley C, Edwards A, Argent-Katwala M",7,2349,oncology,2025-11-22

32669936,Investigating epidemiologic trends and the geographic distribution of patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma throughout Canada.,"Anal cancer is a rare disease, constituting 0.5% of new cancer cases in the United States. The most common subtype is squamous cell carcinoma (scc). Studies in several developed nations have reported on an increasing incidence of anal cancer in recent decades, and various risk factors pertaining to the pathogenesis of the disease have been identified, including infection with the human papillomavirus, tobacco use, and immunosuppression. The epidemiology and distribution of anal scc throughout Canada remain poorly understood, however. Using 3 population-based cancer registries, a retrospective analysis of demographic data across Canada for 1992-2010 was performed. The incidence and mortality for anal scc was examined at the levels of provinces, cities, and the forward sortation area (FSA) component (first 3 characters) of postal codes. During 1992-2010, 3720 individuals were diagnosed with anal scc in Canada; 64% were women. The overall national incidence rate was 6.3 cases per million population per year, with an average age at diagnosis of 60.4 years. The incidence increased over time, with significantly higher incidence rates documented in British Columbia and Nova Scotia (9.3 cases per million population each). Closer examination revealed clustering of cases in various urban centres and self-identified lgbtq communities in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. This study provides, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of the burden of anal scc in Canada, identifying susceptible populations and shedding light onto novel avenues of research to lower the incidence of anal cancer throughout the country.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Jun,"Cattelan L, Ghazawi FM, Le M, Savin E, Zubarev A, Lagacé F, Sasseville D, Waschke K, Litvinov IV",9,1632,oncology,2025-11-22
32905211,Severe cytomegalovirus gastritis after pembrolizumab in a patient with melanoma.,"Immunotherapy has emerged as a standard of cancer treatment, with an increasing number of indications. Recently, opportunistic infections have been reported in several cases in which immunotherapy has led to an increased susceptibility to infection. The present case is the first report of cytomegalovirus (cmv) gastritis occurring in a patient with melanoma during immunotherapy without immune-related adverse events (iraes) and without the use of immunosuppressant agents. A 43-year-old woman presented with stage iii malignant melanoma. She underwent wide excision of skin, with lymph node dissection, and she started immunotherapy with a 3-week cycle of pembrolizumab. The patient demonstrated stable disease response, and no iraes were observed during her initial treatment courses. However, after the 9th treatment cycle, she began to experience epigastric pain that worsened significantly, requiring a visit to the emergency centre. Imaging by computed tomography (ct) and integrated positron-emission tomography/ct revealed severe diffuse gastroduodenitis with acute pancreatitis. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed diffuse oozing, hemorrhagic, edematous, and exfoliative mucosa involving the entire gastric wall, defined as acute hemorrhagic gastritis. Biopsies of the gastric wall revealed cmv infection. Those findings were consistent with a diagnosis of cmv gastritis, and the patient received antiviral therapy with ganciclovir. After treatment, she recovered enough to resume immunotherapy. This case report presents a rare occurrence of cmv gastritis related to immunotherapy. As more patients are treated with immunotherapy, incidences of cmv infections are expected to increase; a high index of clinical suspicion is therefore needed in symptomatic patients.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Aug,"Kim H, Ha SY, Kim J, Kang M, Lee J",5,1774,oncology,2025-11-22
33923355,A Canadian Perspective on the Challenges for Delivery of Curative-Intent Therapy in Stage III Unresectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises a highly heterogenous group of patients with regards to patient fitness and tumour size and distribution, resulting in a wide range of treatment goals and therapy options. Curative-intent multimodality treatment should be considered in all patients with stage III NSCLC. For patients with unresectable disease who are fit, have adequate lung function, and have a disease that can be encompassed within a radical radiation volume, concurrent chemoradiation therapy (cCRT) is the standard of care and can produce cure rates of 20-30%. Recently, consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab has been recognized as the standard of care following cCRT based on significant improvement rates in overall survival at 4 years. The large heterogeneity of the stage III NSCLC population, along with the need for extensive staging procedures, multidisciplinary care, intensive cCRT, and now consolidation therapy makes the delivery of timely and optimal treatment for these patients complex. Several logistical, communication, and education factors hinder the delivery of guideline-recommended care to patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC. This commentary discusses the potential challenges patients may encounter at different points along their care pathway that can interfere with delivery of curative-intent therapy and suggests strategies for improving care delivery.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-Apr,"Brade A, Jao K, Yu S, Cheema P, Doucette S, Christofides A, Schellenberg D",7,1419,oncology,2025-11-22
33704191,Canadian Cancer Centre Response to COVID-19 Pandemic: A National and Provincial Response.,"COVID-19 has spread rapidly, requiring health delivery systems to undertake dramatic transformations. To evaluate these system changes, we undertook one of the first Canadian health delivery system reviews and the first Canadian cancer centre evaluation of pandemic system modifications. Questionnaires were distributed to the Canadian Association of Provincial Cancer Agencies (CAPCA) members in order to assess changes to cancer centre services and patient management. Documentation relating to COVID-19 from the CAPCA electronic space was accessed, and all publicly available cancer centre documentation related to COVID-19 was reviewed. Seven provinces completed the questionnaire and had documentation available from the CAPCA electronic space. All screening programs across Canada were suspended. In most provinces surveyed, ≥50% of outpatient appointments were occurring virtually, with <25% using video platforms. Generally, the impact on diagnostic imaging and new patient referrals correlated with the impact of COVID-19. Most provinces had a reduction in operating room availability, with chemotherapy and radiation treatments continuing. Public health modification, including personal protective equipment and screening staff, varied across the country. Canadian cancer centres underwent a rapid and aggressive transformation of services in response to COVID-19, with many similarities and differences across provinces. In part, this response was facilitated by communication under a national association, which in Canada remains unique to cancer. This response may serve to inform changes in other jurisdictions or disease states now and in future waves of the pandemic, as well as a record of changes for future health services and patient outcome research.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Rittberg R, Mann A, Desautels D, Earle CC, Navaratnam S, Pitz M",6,1771,oncology,2025-11-22

However, data about the safety and efficacy of combined immune checkpoint blockade with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients on hemodialysis are limited. Renal function has no known clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics and clearance of nivolumab and ipilimumab. Further, most immune-related adverse events in patients on hemodialysis are thought to be manageable with the same treatments applied in patients with normal renal function. We present a case of advanced clear-cell renal cell carcinoma in a patient on hemodialysis who received combined immune checkpoint blockade with nivolumab and ipilimumab and who showed no evident signs of immune-related adverse events.

33380860,A population-based study of pulmonary monitoring and toxicity for patients with testicular cancer treated with bleomycin.,"Bleomycin is commonly used to treat advanced testicular cancer and can be associated with severe pulmonary toxicity. The primary objective of the present study was to describe the use of pulmonary function tests (pfts) and chest imaging before, during, and after treatment with bleomycin. To identify all incident cases of testicular cancer treated with bleomycin-based chemotherapy in the Canadian province of Ontario during 2005-2010, the Ontario Cancer Registry was linked with chemotherapy treatment records. Health administrative databases were used to describe use of pfts, chest imaging, and physician visits for respiratory complaints. Of 394 patients treated with orchiectomy and chemotherapy who received at least 1 dose of bleomycin, 93% had complete chemotherapy records available. In the 4 weeks before, during, and within 2 years after finishing bleomycin-based chemotherapy, pfts were performed in 17%, 17%, and 29% of patients respectively. Chest imaging was performed in 68%, 62%, and 98% of patients in the same time periods. In the 2 years after bleomycin-based chemotherapy, 23% of treated patients had a physician visit for respiratory symptoms. That rate was substantially higher for men with greater exposure to bleomycin: 40% (24 of 60) for 10-12 doses bleomycin compared with 21% (53 of 250) for 7-9 doses and with 14% (8 of 58) for 1-6 doses (<i>p</i> = 0.002). Quality improvement initiatives are needed to increase baseline rates of chest imaging within 4 weeks of starting chemotherapy for testicular cancer; to understand why such a high proportion of men have chest imaging during bleomycin-based chemotherapy; and to mitigate the excess pulmonary toxicity seen with increasing exposure to bleomycin.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Raphael MJ, Lougheed MD, Wei X, Karim S, Robinson AG, Bedard PL, Booth CM",7,1731,oncology,2025-11-22
32669935,Postoperative radiotherapy option based on mediastinal lymph node reclassification for patients with pN2 non-small-cell lung cancer.,"In this research, we used the mediastinal lymph node reclassification proposed by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (iaslc) to screen for patients with pathologic N2 (pN2) non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) who might benefit from postoperative radiotherapy (port). The study enrolled 440 patients with pN2 nsclc who received complete surgical resection and allocated them to one of three groups: N2a1 (single-station skip mediastinal lymph node metastasis), N2a2 (single-station non-skip mediastinal lymph node metastasis), and N2b (multi-station mediastinal lymph node metastasis). Rates of local recurrence at first recurrence in patients receiving and not receiving port were compared using the chi-square test. Overall (os) and disease-free survival (dfs) were then compared using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank test. In addition, the factors potentially influencing os and dfs were analyzed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression. The rate of local recurrence for the N2a2 and N2b groups was significantly lower in patients receiving port (<i>p</i> = 0.044 and <i>p</i> = 0.043 respectively). The log-rank test revealed that, for the N2a1 group, differences in os and dfs were not statistically significant between the patients who did and did not receive port (<i>p</i> = 0.304 and <i>p</i> = 0.197 respectively). For the N2a2 group, os and dfs were markedly superior in patients who received port compared with those who did not (<i>p</i> = 0.001 and <i>p</i> = 0.014 respectively). For the N2b group, os was evidently better in patients who received port compared with those who did not (<i>p</i> = 0.025), but no statistically significant difference in dfs was observed (<i>p</i> = 0.134). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that, in the N2a1 group, port was significantly associated with poor os [hazard ratio (hr): 2.618; 95% confidence interval (ci): 1.185 to 5.785; <i>p</i> = 0.017]; in the N2a2 group, port was associated with improved os (hr: 0.481; 95% ci: 0.314 to 0.736; <i>p</i> = 0.001) and dfs (hr: 0.685; 95% ci: 0.479 to 0.980; <i>p</i> = 0.039). For patients with pN2 nsclc who receive complete resection, port might be beneficial only for patients with single-station non-skip metastasis (N2a2). Patients with single-station skip metastasis (N2a1) and multi-station metastasis (N2b) might not currently benefit from port.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Jun,"Jin J, Xu Y, Hu X, Chen M, Fang M, Hang Q, Chen M",7,2403,oncology,2025-11-22
32669934,Tyrosine kinase inhibitors significantly improved survival outcomes in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumour: a multi-institutional cohort study.,"The real-world impact of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) in clinical practice for gastrointestinal stromal tumour (gist) has not been extensively reported. We sought to assess how outcomes have changed over the eras and to evaluate the effect of access to imatinib and sunitinib on survival in patients with unresectable or metastatic gist in British Columbia. Patients with metastatic or unresectable gist were allocated to one of three eras: pre-2002, 2002-2007, and post-2007 based on treatment availability (pre-imatinib, post-imatinib, and post-sunitinib). Overall survival (os) and progression-free survival (pfs) were compared between eras. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the effects of tumour, patient, and treatment characteristics on survival outcomes. Of 657 patients diagnosed with gist throughout British Columbia during 1996-2016, 196 had metastatic disease: 23 in the pre-imatinib era, 67 in the post-imatinib era, and 106 in the post-sunitinib era. A significant increase in os, by 53.6 months (<i>p</i> = 0.0007), and pfs, by 29.1 months (<i>p</i> = 0.044), was observed after the introduction of imatinib. The introduction of sunitinib did not significantly affect os or pfs. Implementation of tkis has drastically improved survival outcomes for patients with metastatic gist by up to 4.55 years in the real-world setting. Our study demonstrates that implementation of tkis in clinical practice has outperformed their benefit predicted in clinical trials.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Jun,"Tan AD, Willemsma K, MacNeill A, DeVries K, Srikanthan A, McGahan C, Hamilton T, Li H, Blanke CD, Simmons CE",10,1509,oncology,2025-11-22

32905256,Breast cancer diagnosis and treatment wait times in specialized diagnostic units compared with usual care: a population-based study.,"Breast assessment sites (bass) were developed to provide expedited and coordinated care for patients being evaluated for breast cancer (bca) in Ontario. We compared the diagnostic and treatment intervals for patients diagnosed at a bas and for those diagnosed through a usual care (uc) route. This population-based, cross-sectional study of patients diagnosed with bca in Ontario during 2007-2015 used linked administrative data. ""Diagnostic interval"" was the time from the earliest cancer-related health care encounter before diagnosis to diagnosis; ""treatment interval"" was the time from diagnosis to treatment. Diagnosis at a bas was determined from the patient's biopsy and mammography institutions. Interval lengths for the bas and uc groups were compared using multivariable quantile regression, stratified by detection method. The diagnostic interval was shorter for patients who were bas-diagnosed than for those who were uc-diagnosed, with adjusted median differences of -4.0 days [95% confidence interval (ci): -3.2 days to -4.9 days] for symptomatic patients and -5.4 days (95% ci: -4.7 days to -6.1 days) for screen-detected patients. That association was modified by stage at diagnosis, with larger differences in patients with early-stage cancers. In contrast, the treatment interval was longer in patients who were bas-diagnosed than in those who were uc-diagnosed, with adjusted median differences of 4.2 days (95% ci: 3.8 days to 4.7 days) for symptomatic patients and 4.2 days (95% ci: 3.7 days to 4.8 days) for screen-detected patients.

33804587,"An Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario) Clinical Practice Guideline: Consolidation or Maintenance Systemic Therapy for Newly Diagnosed Stage II, III, or IV Epithelial Ovary, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma.","To provide recommendations on systemic therapy options in consolidation or maintenance therapy for women with newly diagnosed stage II, III, or IV epithelial ovary, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma including all histological types. Consistent with the Program in Evidence-based Program's standardized approach, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and PROSPERO (the international prospective register of systematic reviews) databases, and four relevant conferences were systematically searched. The Working Group drafted recommendations and revised them based on the comments from internal and external reviewers. We have one recommendation for consolidation therapy and eight recommendations for maintenance therapy. Overall, consolidation therapy with chemotherapy should not be recommended in the target population. For maintenance therapy, we recommended olaparib (Recommendation), niraparib (Weak Recommendation), veliparib (Weak Recommendation), and bevacizumab (Weak Recommendation) for certain patients with newly diagnosed stage III-IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma, respectively. We do not recommend some agents as maintenance therapy in four recommendations. We are unable to specify the patient population by histological types for different maintenance therapy recommendations. When new evidence that can impact the recommendations is available, the recommendations will be updated as soon as possible.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-Mar,"Hirte H, Yao X, Ferguson SE, May T, Elit L",5,1474,oncology,2025-11-22
32669922,Inflammatory markers as prognostic factors of recurrence in advanced-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.,"Multiple immunologic parameters have provided useful prognostic and assessment significance in various cancers, including head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (scc). We sought to identify whether pretreatment inflammatory markers could prognosticate recurrence in patients with advanced (stage iii or iv) head-and-neck scc who underwent therapy with curative intent in a tertiary care centre between January 2010 and December 2012. In a chart review, we recorded demographics; primary tumour characteristics; p16 status; pretreatment inflammatory markers, including body mass index (bmi), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (nlr), C-reactive protein (crp), and serum albumin; therapy received; and date of relapse, death, or last follow-up. The main outcome was relapse-free survival (rfs). Overall survival (os) was a secondary outcome. From among 235 charts reviewed, 118 cases were included: 86 oropharyngeal (50 p16-positive, 18 p16-negative, 17 p16 unavailable, 1 p16 indeterminate), and 32 non-oropharyngeal (7 p16-positive, 19 p16-negative, 6 p16 unavailable). Median follow-up was 2.45 years (25%-75% interquartile range: 1.65-3.3 years). In univariate analysis, p16 status, bmi, modified Glasgow prognostic score, and crp were significant for rfs, but in multivariate analysis, only p16 status, bmi, and crp remained significant. For os, only crp and nlr were significant in both the univariate and multivariate analyses. After adjustment for p16 status, nlr did not remain significant. After adjustment for p16 status, crp remained significant for both rfs and os. In patients with head-and-neck scc, a stronger prognostic value is associated with human papillomavirus status than with nlr and many other factors, including bmi and albumin. However, even though few of our patients had high crp, serum crp remained significant despite p16-positive status.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Jun,"Valdes M, Villeda J, Mithoowani H, Pitre T, Chasen M",5,1862,oncology,2025-11-22

32875443,Laparoscopic Portal Territory Hepatectomy (Extended Segment 5) by an Indocyanine Green Fluorescent Dual Staining Technique (Video).,"Anatomical liver resections (ALR), which both remove the tumor and the corresponding segments, meet more with the surgical oncology's radical nature as reported by Makuuchi.1 Nevertheless, laparoscopic ALR remains a highly specialized procedure due to technical difficulty in the selection of the transection plane. This video aimed to present a novel laparoscopic ALR strategy of tumor-bearing portal territory hepatectomy with an indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent dual staining technique. Video: A 42-year-old man admitted to our center for a single hepatic mass at the end of segment 5. To test liver reserve function and locate the tumor, we intravenously administrated ICG (0.5 mg/kg) 5 days before the operation. The ICG-R15 of the patient was 4.1%. The Glissonian pedicles of target portal territory were approached and temporally clamped with Takasaki's Glissonian method as discussed by Takasaki.2 Then, we intravenously administered ICG (1 mL, 5 mg/L) to negative stain the portal territory of segment 5 and expose biliary leak from the cut surface. Fusion ICG imaging of the tumor and positive fluorescent region were obtained using the PINPOINT image system (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI). Liver parenchyma transection was performed alongside the boundary of negative fluorescence region using an ultrasonic scalpel and L-PMOD as reported by Cai et al..3 Since the tumor located at the junction of segments 5 and 8, we did some extended resection. Operative time was 195 min, and the estimated intraoperative blood loss was 100 mL. The patient was discharged on the seventh day, without any complications. HCC was confirmed in histopathology with a free margin (over 1.3 cm). No recurrence was noted in the follow-up period for 6 months after the operation.

32489256,Cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone compared with bortezomib-dexamethasone in transplantation-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.,"Cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone (CyBorD) is considered a standard induction regimen for transplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (mm). It has not been prospectively compared with bortezomib-dexamethasone (Bor-Dex). We aimed to compare the efficacy of CyBorD and Bor-Dex induction in transplant-eligible patients. In a retrospective observational study at a single tertiary centre, all patients with transplant-eligible mm who received induction with CyBorD or Bor-Dex between March 2008 and April 2016 were enrolled. Progression-free survival (pfs), response, and stem-cell collection for a first autologous stem-cell transplantation (ahsct) were compared. Of 155 patients enrolled, 78 (50.3%) had received CyBorD, and 77 (49.7%), Bor-Dex. The patients in the Bor-Dex cohort were younger than those in the CyBorD cohort (median: 57 years vs. 62 years; <i>p</i> = 0.0002) and more likely to have had treatment held, reduced, or discontinued (26% vs. 14.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.11). The stem-cell mobilization regimen for both cohorts was predominantly cyclophosphamide and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (gcsf). Plerixafor was used more often for the CyBorD cohort (<i>p</i> = 0.009), and more collection failures occurred in the CyBorD cohort (<i>p</i> = 0.08). In patients receiving Bor-Dex, more cells were collected (9.9×10<sup>6</sup> cells/kg vs. 7.7×10<sup>6</sup>cells/kg, <i>p</i> = 0.007). At day +100, a very good partial response or better was achieved in 75% of the CyBorD cohort and in 73% of the Bor-Dex cohort (<i>p</i> = 0.77). Median pfs was 3.2 years in the Bor-Dex cohort and 3.7 years in the CyBorD cohort (<i>p</i> = 0.56). Overall efficacy was similar in our patients receiving CyBorD and Bor-Dex. After ahsct, no difference in depth of response or pfs was observed. Cyclophosphamide-gcsf seems to increase collection failures and hospitalizations in patients receiving CyBorD. Prospective studies are required to examine that relationship.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Figueiredo A, Atkins H, Mallick R, Kekre N, Kew A, McCurdy A",6,1998,oncology,2025-11-22
33380879,"First-line therapy, autologous stem-cell transplantation, and post-transplantation maintenance in the management of newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma.","In Ontario, no clearly defined standard of care for the management of mantle cell lymphoma (mcl) has been developed, and substantial variability from centre to centre is evident. This guidance document was prompted by the need to harmonize practice in Ontario with respect to first-line, conditioning, and post-transplantation maintenance therapy for patients newly diagnosed with transplantation-eligible mcl. The medline and embase databases were systematically searched from January 2013 to January 2020 for evidence, and the best available evidence was used to draft recommendations relevant to first-line therapy, autologous stem-cell transplantation, and post-transplantation maintenance in the management of transplantation-eligible newly diagnosed mcl. Final approval of this guidance document was obtained from the Stem Cell Transplant Advisory Committee.

33173374,Prognostic utility of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated using different modalities.,"Inflammation is a critical component in carcinogenesis. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (nlr) has been retrospectively studied as a biomarker of prognosis in metastatic colorectal cancer (mcrc). Compared with a low nlr, a high nlr is associated with worse prognosis. In the present study, we compared real-world survival for patients with mcrc based on their nlr group, and we assessed the utility of the nlr in determining first-line chemotherapy and metastasectomy benefit. In this retrospective and descriptive analysis of patients with mcrc undergoing first-line chemotherapy in a single centre, the last systemic absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte count before treatment was used for the nlr. A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to estimate the nlr cut-off value, dividing the patients into low and high nlr groups. Median overall survival (mos) was compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test. A multivariate analysis was performed using a Cox regression model. The 102 analyzed patients had a median follow-up of 15 months. Regardless of systemic therapy, approximately 20% of patients underwent metastasectomy. The nlr cut-off was established at 2.35, placing 45 patients in the low-risk group (nlr < 2.35) and 57 in the high-risk group (nlr ≥ 2.35). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a mos of 39.1 months in the low-risk group and 14.4 months in the high-risk group (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression on the nlr estimated a hazard ratio of 3.08 (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Survival analysis in each risk subgroup, considering the history of metastasectomy, was also performed. In the low-risk group, mos was longer for patients undergoing metastasectomy than for those not undergoing the procedure (95.2 months vs. 22.6 months, <i>p</i> = 0.05). In the high-risk group, mos was not statistically different for patients undergoing or not undergoing metastasectomy (24.3 months vs. 12.7 months, <i>p</i> = 0.08). Our real-world data analysis of nlr in patients with mcrc confirmed that this biomarker is useful in predicting survival. It also suggests that nlr is an effective tool to choose first-line treatment and to predict the benefit of metastasectomy.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Oct,"Nogueira-Costa G, Fernandes I, Gameiro R, Gramaça J, Xavier AT, Pina I",6,2199,oncology,2025-11-22
33451147,Identifying Best Implementation Practices for Smoking Cessation in Complex Cancer Settings.,"In response to evidence about the health benefits of smoking cessation at time of cancer diagnosis, Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario) (OH-CCO) instructed Regional Cancer Centres (RCC) to implement smoking cessation interventions (SCI). RCCs were given flexibility to implement SCIs according to their context but were required to screen new patients for tobacco status, advise patients about the importance of quitting, and refer patients to cessation supports. The purpose of this evaluation was to identify practices that influenced successful implementation across RCCs. A realist evaluation approach was employed. Realist evaluations examine how underlying processes of an intervention (mechanisms) in specific settings (contexts) interact to produce results (outcomes). A realist evaluation may thus help to generate an understanding of what may or may not work across contexts. The RCCs with the highest Tobacco Screening Rates used a centralized system. Regarding the process for advising and referring, three RCCs offered robust smoking cessation training, resulting in advice and referral rates between 80% and 100%. Five RCCs surpassed the target for Accepted Referral Rates; acceptance rates for internal referral were highest overall. Findings highlight factors that may influence successful SCI implementation.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-Jan,"Giannopoulos E, Papadakos J, Cameron E, Brual J, Truscott R, Evans WK, Giuliani ME",7,1326,oncology,2025-11-22
34313033,Should We Consider Value Frameworks for Cancer Drugs as Oncology's Landscape Evolves?; from an Oncologist Perspective in Korea.,"As the role of immunotherapies and personalized medicine grow, cancer patients have faced many choices in treatments and have suffered financial toxicity. These challenges brought the need for the value framework (VF) to guide treatment decision making. A survey was taken to 102 oncologists about perception for VF. They were asked about priorities among several considerations when they prescribe cancer drugs. Their views on the need for development and potential implications of VF in Korea were assessed, also. The survey shows that 90% of the respondents choose clinical efficacy as the most important value in cancer drugs selection, and the cost of drug was more weighted value in immune checkpoint inhibitors (13.7%). Approximately half (53.9%) answered that they were aware of the existing VFs. Over 90% of respondents agreed with the need for development of a VF for cancer drugs based on Korean healthcare system and further usefulness for decisions about reimbursement issues. Seventy-one percent answered that two representative VFs (American Society Clinical Oncology-VF and European Society for Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale) should be reflected in value measurement of cancer drugs in Korea.

32218659,Prognosis in young women less than 40 years of age with brain metastasis from breast cancer.,"Brain metastasis from breast cancer (bca) in young women is doubly devastating because both quality of life and life expectancy are significantly reduced. With new radiation technology and drugs that have emerged, survival is expected to increase for these young women. Using the oacis and sardo patient databases, we identified 121 patients diagnosed with bca and brain metastasis between 2006 and 2016 at the University of Montreal Hospital Centre. Those patients were divided into Group A, patients who developed brain metastasis during the evolution of metastatic bca, and Group B, patients whose first metastasis was to the brain. For each group, we compared young patients (<40 years of age) with older patients (≥40 years of age). Among the 121 patients with brain metastasis, median overall survival (mos) was significantly longer for those less than 40 years of age than for those 40 or more years of age (18 months vs. 4 months, <i>p</i> < 0.001). With respect to the timing of brain metastasis, survival was significantly longer in Group B than in Group A (7 months vs. 4 months, <i>p</i> = 0.032). In Group A, mos was significantly longer for patients less than 40 years of age than for patients 40 or more years of age (18 months vs. 3 months, <i>p</i> = 0.0089). In Group B, the 2-year overall survival rate was 57% for patients less than 40 years of age and 12% for those 40 or more years of age (mos: not reached vs. 7 months; <i>p</i> = 0.259). In our single-centre retrospective cohort of women with brain metastasis from bca, prognosis was better for young women (<40 years) than for older women (≥40 years). Survival was also longer for patients whose initial metastasis was to the brain than for patients whose brain metastasis developed later in the disease course. In patients who received systemic treatment, median survival remained significantly higher in women less than 40 years of age. Further studies are needed to validate those results.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Feb,"Mustillo A, Ayoub JP, Charpentier D, Yelle L, Florescu M",5,1968,oncology,2025-11-22
32905286,Practical update for the use of bone-targeted agents in patients with bone metastases from metastatic breast cancer or castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Bone metastases are a significant source of morbidity and mortality for patients with breast and prostate cancer. In this review, we discuss key practical themes regarding the use of bone-targeted agents (btas) such as bisphosphonates and denosumab for managing bony metastatic disease. The btas both delay the onset and reduce the incidence of skeletal-related events (sres), defined as any or all of a need for radiation therapy or surgery to bone, pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, or hypercalcemia of malignancy. They have more modest benefits for pain and other quality-of-life measures. Regardless of the benefits of btas, it should always be remembered that the palliative management of metastatic bone disease is multimodal and multidisciplinary. The collaboration of all disciplines is essential for optimal patient care. Special consideration is given to these key questions: ■ What are btas, and what is their efficacy?■ What are their common toxicities?■ When should they be initiated?■ How do we choose the appropriate bta?■ What is the appropriate dose, schedule, and duration of btas?","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Aug,"Southcott D, Awan A, Ghate K, Clemons M, Fernandes R",5,1111,oncology,2025-11-22
32489251,A catalyst for transforming health systems and person-centred care: Canadian national position statement on patient-reported outcomes.,"Patient-reported outcomes (pros) are essential to capture the patient's perspective and to influence care. Although pros and pro measures are known to have many important benefits, they are not consistently being used and there is there no Canadian pros oversight. The Position Statement presented here is the first step toward supporting the implementation of pros in the Canadian health care setting. The Canadian pros National Steering Committee drafted position statements, which were submitted for stakeholder feedback before, during, and after the first National Canadian Patient Reported Outcomes (canpros) scientific conference, 14-15 November 2019 in Calgary, Alberta. In addition to the stakeholder feedback cycle, a patient advocate group submitted a section to capture the patient voice. The canpros Position Statement is an outcome of the 2019 canpros scientific conference, with an oncology focus. The Position Statement is categorized into 6 sections covering 4 theme areas: Patient and Families, Health Policy, Clinical Implementation, and Research. The patient voice perfectly mirrors the recommendations that the experts reached by consensus and provides an overriding impetus for the use of pros in health care. Although our vision of pros transforming the health care system to be more patient-centred is still aspirational, the Position Statement presented here takes a first step toward providing recommendations in key areas to align Canadian efforts. The Position Statement is directed toward a health policy audience; future iterations will target other audiences, including researchers, clinicians, and patients.

We lack information about the extent of this burden in Canadian remote regions. This study aimed to: (1) describe prostate cancer-related out-of-pocket costs and perceived financial burden, and (2) identify factors associated with such a perceived burden among prostate cancer patients living in a remote region of the province of Quebec (Canada). <i>Methods:</i> A cross-sectional study was conducted among 171 prostate cancer patients who consulted at the outpatient clinic of the Centre Hospitalier de Rouyn-Noranda. <i>Results:</i> The majority of patients (83%) had incurred out-of-pocket costs for their cancer care. The mean total cost incurred in the last three months was $517 and 22.3% reported a moderate, considerable or unsustainable burden. Multivariable analysis revealed that having incurred higher cancer-related out-of-pocket costs (OR: 1.001; 95%CI: 1.001-1.002) private drug insurance (vs. public, OR: 5.23; 95%CI: 1.13-24.17) was associated with a greater perceived financial burden.

32489267,Germline variants and phenotypic spectrum in a Canadian cohort of individuals with diffuse gastric cancer.,"<i>CDH1</i> pathogenic variants (pvs) cause most cases of inherited diffuse gastric cancer (dgc), but have low detection rates and vary geographically. In the present study, we examined hereditary causes of dgc in patients in Ontario. <i>CDH1</i> testing through single-site or multi-gene panels was conducted for patients with dgc meeting the 2015 International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (igclc) criteria, or with isolated dgc at less than 50 years of age, or with a strong family history of cancer identified at the Zane Cohen Centre (zcc). All <i>CDH1-</i>positive patients at zcc, regardless of cancer history, were summarized. In 15 of 85 patients with dgc (17.6%), a pv or likely pv was identified through <i>CDH1</i> single-site (<i>n</i> = 43) or multi-gene panel (<i>n</i> = 42) testing. The detection rate was 9.4% overall (8 of 85) and 11% using igclc criteria (7 of 65). No <i>CDH1</i> pvs were identified in patients with isolated dgc at less than 40 years of age, but 1 pv was identified in a patient with isolated dgc at less than 50 years of age. Multi-gene panels identified 9 pvs (21.4%), including <i>CDH1, STK11, ATM</i>, <i>BRCA2, MLH1</i>, and <i>MSH2</i>. Review of 81 <i>CDH1</i> carriers identified 10% with dgc (median age: 48 years; range: 38-59 years); 41% were unaffected (median age: 53 years; range: 26-89 years). Observed malignancies other than dgc or lobular breast cancer (lbc) included colorectal, gynecologic, kidney or bladder, prostate, testicular, and ductal breast cancers. Lobular-breast cancer was seen only in 3 families. In Ontario, the detection rate of <i>CDH1</i> pvs in patients with dgc was low: no pvs were identified in patients with isolated dgc at less than 40 years of age, and 1 was identified in a patient with isolated dgc at less than 50 years of age. Isolated lbc with no dgc was observed in <i>CDH1-</i>positive families, as were pathology-confirmed nondgc or non-lbc malignancies, which had not previously been reported. Given a phenotype that overlaps with other hereditary conditions, multi-gene panels are recommended for all patients with dgc at less than 50 years of age and for those meeting igclc criteria.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Aronson M, Swallow C, Govindarajan A, Semotiuk K, Cohen Z, Kaurah P, Velsher L, Ambus I, Buckley K, Forster-Gibson C, Meschino WS, Blumenthal A, Kim RH, Brar S",14,2183,oncology,2025-11-22

38160673,Analysis of Risk Factors for Febrile Neutropenia in Patients with Small-Cell Lung Cancer Receiving Carboplatin Plus Etoposide Therapy.,"Febrile neutropenia (FN) is an oncologic emergency requiring immediate empiric antibiotic therapy. Although carboplatin plus etoposide combination chemotherapy is associated with a relatively high frequency of FN, the risk factors are unclear. Hence, this retrospective study aimed to identify predictive markers of carboplatin/etoposide-induced FN. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of patients with previously untreated small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) who received combination chemotherapy with carboplatin (area under the concentration curve: 5 mg/mL·min, day 1) and etoposide (80 or 100 mg/m2, days 1-3) between July 2007 and June 2022. FN was assessed during the 21 days after initiation of carboplatin and etoposide therapy according to the Japanese Society of Medical Oncology's definition. Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables were used to compare the two groups. Statistical significance was set at p values &lt;0.05. Explanatory variables with p values &lt;0.05 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Among the 176 eligible patients, the incidence of FN during the first cycle of chemotherapy was 25.0% (44/176). Multivariate analysis revealed that co-administration of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or potassium-competitive acid blockers (PCABs) and body mass index (BMI) were significantly associated with FN (p = 0.0035 and 0.0011, respectively). Patients with both co-administration of PPIs or PCABs and a BMI ≤22.509 kg/m2 presented with significantly higher frequencies of FN compared with the other patients (13/24 [54.2%] vs. 31/152 [20.4%] patients; odds ratio: 4.56, 95% confidence interval: 1.70-12.48; p = 0.00147).

We developed a model to estimate attributable cancer treatment failure because of continued smoking after a cancer diagnosis (af<sub>s</sub>). Canadian health system data were used to determine the additional treatment cost for af<sub>s</sub> for the most common cancers in Canada. Of 206,000 patients diagnosed with cancer annually, an estimated 4789 experienced af<sub>s</sub>. The annual incremental cost associated with treating patients experiencing af<sub>s</sub> was estimated at between $198 million and $295 million (2017 Canadian dollars), reflecting an added incremental cost of $4,810-$7,162 per patient who continued to smoke. Analyses according to disease site demonstrated higher incremental costs where the smoking prevalence and the cost of individual second-line cancer treatment were highest. Of breast, prostate, colorectal, and lung cancers, lung cancer was associated with the highest incremental cost for treatment after af<sub>s</sub>. The costs associated with af<sub>s</sub> in Canada after a cancer diagnosis are considerable. Populations in which the smoking prevalence and treatment costs are high are expected to benefit the most from efforts aimed at increasing smoking cessation capacity for patients newly diagnosed with cancer.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Iragorri N, Essue B, Timmings C, Keen D, Bryant H, Warren GW",6,1433,oncology,2025-11-22
32489262,"Baseline staging imaging for distant metastasis in women with stages I, II, and III breast cancer.","In Ontario, there is no clearly defined standard of care for staging for distant metastasis in women with newly diagnosed and biopsy-confirmed breast cancer whose clinical presentation is suggestive of early-stage disease. This guideline addresses baseline imaging investigations for women with newly diagnosed primary breast cancer who are otherwise asymptomatic for distant metastasis. The medline and embase databases were systematically searched for evidence from January 2000 to April 2019, and the best available evidence was used to draft recommendations relevant to the use of baseline imaging investigation in women with newly diagnosed primary breast cancer who are otherwise asymptomatic. Final approval of this practice guideline was obtained from both the Staging in Early Stage Breast Cancer Advisory Committee and the Report Approval Panel of the Program in Evidence-Based Care. These recommendations apply to all women with newly diagnosed primary breast cancer (originating in the breast) who have no symptoms of distant metastasis Staging tests using conventional anatomic imaging [chest radiography, liver ultrasonography, chest-abdomen-pelvis computed tomography (ct)] or metabolic imaging modalities [integrated positron-emission tomography (pet)/ct, integrated pet/magnetic resonance imaging (mri), bone scintigraphy] should not be routinely ordered for women newly diagnosed with clinical stage i or stage ii breast cancer who have no symptoms of distant metastasis, regardless of biomarker status. In women newly diagnosed with stage iii breast cancer, baseline staging tests using either anatomic imaging (chest radiography, liver ultrasonography, chest-abdomen-pelvis ct) or metabolic imaging modalities (pet/ct, pet/mri, bone scintigraphy) should be considered regardless of whether the patient is symptomatic for distant metastasis and regardless of biomarker profile.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Arnaout A, Varela NP, Allarakhia M, Grimard L, Hey A, Lau J, Thain L, Eisen A",8,1896,oncology,2025-11-22
38198064,Inter-fractional portability of deep learning models for lung target tracking on cine imaging acquired in MRI-guided radiotherapy.,"MRI-guided radiotherapy systems enable beam gating by tracking the target on planar, two-dimensional cine images acquired during treatment. This study aims to evaluate how deep-learning (DL) models for target tracking that are trained on data from one fraction can be translated to subsequent fractions. Cine images were acquired for six patients treated on an MRI-guided radiotherapy platform (MRIdian, Viewray Inc.) with an onboard 0.35 T MRI scanner. Three DL models (U-net, attention U-net and nested U-net) for target tracking were trained using two training strategies: (1) uniform training using data obtained only from the first fraction with testing performed on data from subsequent fractions and (2) adaptive training in which training was updated each fraction by adding 20 samples from the current fraction with testing performed on the remaining images from that fraction. Tracking performance was compared between algorithms, models and training strategies by evaluating the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95) between automatically generated and manually specified contours. The mean DSC for all six patients in comparing manual contours and contours generated by the onboard algorithm (OBT) were 0.68 ± 0.16. Compared to OBT, the DSC values improved 17.0 - 19.3% for the three DL models with uniform training, and 24.7 - 25.7% for the models based on adaptive training. The HD95 values improved 50.6 - 54.5% for the models based on adaptive training. DL-based techniques achieved better tracking performance than the onboard, registration-based tracking approach.

34068400,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy for the Treatment of Oligometastatic Tumors versus Standard of Care.,"Recent clinical trial results reported that stereotactic radiotherapy (SABR) may improve survival for patients with oligometastatic (OM) cancer. Given that these results come from a phase II trial, there remains considerable uncertainty about this finding, and about the cost-effectiveness of SABR for patients with OM cancer. In this analysis, we estimate the cost-effectiveness of SABR for oligometastatic cancer patients. A probabilistic time-dependent Markov model was constructed to simulate treatment of oligometastatic cancer patients over five- and ten-year time horizons. The primary data source was the phase II, Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for the Comprehensive Treatment of Oligometastases (SABR-COMET )trial and supplemented with data from the literature. We estimated the effect of SABR and the standard of care (SoC) using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were measured from a provincial payer perspective (2018 Canadian dollars). In the reference case analysis (five-year time horizon), SABR was associated with additional incremental costs of CAD 38,487 and an incremental QALY gain of 0.84. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CAD 45,726 per QALY gained. Over a ten-year time horizon, the increased uncertainty in the long-term effectiveness of SABR resulted in an ICER of CAD 291,544 per QALY gained. Estimates from the probabilistic analysis indicated that at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of CAD 50,000 and CAD 100,000 per QALY gained, there is 54% and 78% probability (respectively) that SABR would be cost-effective using the five-year time horizon. The adoption of SABR therapy requires a considerable upfront capital investment. Our results suggest that the cost-effectiveness of SABR is contingent on the uncertainty in the evidence base. Further clinical trials to confirm the effectiveness of SABR and research into the real-world costs associated with this treatment could reduce the uncertainty around implementation of the technology.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-May,"Raymakers AJN, Cameron D, Tyldesley S, Regier DA",4,2020,oncology,2025-11-22
32735508,Successful Implementation of a Quality Improvement Intervention Toward a QOPI-Certified Breast Cancer Center in Mexico.,"As part of a quality improvement (QI) project undertaken during the 2018 edition of the American Society of Clinical Oncology's Quality Training Program (QTP), we evaluated our practice's compliance to 70 measures regarding the Core, Symptom/Toxicity and Breast Cancer modules from the Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI) database. Thirteen measures were identified as being consistently low in documentation rate in our medical records (MR). After establishing a multidisciplinary QI team, we defined to accomplish 100% documentation rate of these 13 QOPI measures in ≥ 80% of the monthly new patient MRs during the 6-month QTP. We designed a Microsoft Word MR template and implemented a new pre-consultation process. Monthly Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles were conducted to assess the performance of the intervention. After the 6-month QI intervention, > 80% of our monthly MRs achieved 100% compliance to the aimed-for 13 QOPI measures. Furthermore, our new pre-consultation process proved to be valuable in facilitating the documentation of data without interfering with the oncology appointment. The development of a systematic QI approach effectively enhanced our compliance to 13 QOPI measures over a 6-month period.

Clinical trial data can generally compare drugs in a pair-wise fashion. Real-world collection of health utility data, symptoms, and toxicities allows for the direct comparison between multiple tki therapies in the population with <i>ALK</i>+ nsclc. In a prospective cohort study, outpatients with <i>ALK</i>+ recruited between 2014 and 2018, treated with a variety of tkis, were assessed every 3 months for clinico-demographic, patient-reported symptom and toxicity data and EQ-5D-derived health utility scores (hus). In 499 longitudinal encounters of 76 patients with <i>ALK</i>+ nsclc, each tki had stable longitudinal hus when disease was controlled, even after months to years: the mean overall hus for each tki ranged from 0.805 to 0.858, and longitudinally from 0.774 to 0.912, with higher values associated with second- or third-generation tkis of alectinib, brigatinib, and lorlatinib. Disease progression was associated with a mean hus decrease of 0.065 (95% confidence interval: 0.02 to 0.11). Health utility scores were inversely correlated to multiple symptoms or toxicities: rho values ranged from -0.094 to -0.557. Fewer symptoms and toxicities were associated with the second- and third-generation tkis compared with crizotinib. In multivariable analysis, only stable disease state and baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status were associated with improved hus. There was no significant decrease in hus when patients with <i>ALK</i>+ disease were treated longitudinally with each tki, as long as patients were clinically stable.

33173386,Delay in diagnosis of patients with head-and-neck cancer in Canada: impact of patient and provider delay.,"Head-and-neck cancers (hncs) often present at an advanced stage, leading to poor outcomes. Late presentation might be attributable to patient delays (reluctance to seek treatment, for instance) or provider delays (misdiagnosis, prolonged wait time for consultation, for example). The objective of the present study was to examine the length and cause of such delays in a Canadian universal health care setting. Patients presenting for the first time to the hnc multidisciplinary team (mdt) with a biopsy-proven hnc were recruited to this study. Patients completed a survey querying initial symptom presentation, their previous medical appointments, and length of time between appointments. Clinical and demographic data were collected for all patients. The average time for patients to have their first appointment at the mdt clinic was 15.1 months, consisting of 3.9 months for patients to see a health care provider (hcp) for the first time since symptom onset and 10.7 months from first hcp appointment to the mdt clinic. Patients saw an average of 3 hcps before the mdt clinic visit (range: 1-7). No significant differences in time to presentation were found based on stage at presentation or anatomic site. At our tertiary care cancer centre, a patient's clinical pathway to being seen at the mdt clinic shows significant delays, particularly in the time from the first hcp visit to mdt referral. Possible methods to mitigate delay include education about hnc for patients and providers alike, and a more streamlined referral system.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Oct,"Kassirian S, Dzioba A, Hamel S, Patel K, Sahovaler A, Palma DA, Read N, Venkatesan V, Nichols AC, Yoo J, Fung K, Mendez A, MacNeil SD",13,1538,oncology,2025-11-22
33173376,"Nodal staging affects adjuvant treatment choices in elderly patients with clinically node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.","In response to Choosing Wisely recommendations that sentinel lymph node biopsy (slnb) should not be routinely performed in elderly patients with node-negative (cN0), estrogen receptor-positive (er+) breast cancer, we sought to evaluate how nodal staging affects adjuvant treatment in this population. From a prospective database, we identified patients 70 or more years of age with cN0 breast cancer treated with surgery for er+ her2-negative invasive disease during 2012-2016. We determined rates of, and factors associated with, nodal positivity (pN+), and compared the use of adjuvant radiation (rt) and systemic therapy by nodal status. Of 364 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 331 (91%) underwent slnb, with 75 (23%) being pN+. Axillary node dissection was performed in 11 patients (3%). On multivariate analysis, tumour size was the only factor associated with pN+ (<i>p</i> = 0.007). Nodal positivity rates were 0%, 13%, 23%, 33%, and 27% for lesions preoperatively sized at 0-0.5 cm, 0.5-1 cm, 1.1-2.0 cm, 2.1-5.0 cm, and more than 5.0 cm. Compared with patients assessed as node-negative, those who were pN+ were more likely to receive axillary rt (lumpectomy: 53% vs. 1%, <i>p</i> < 0.001; mastectomy: 43% vs. 2%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and adjuvant systemic therapy (endocrine: 82% vs. 69%; chemotherapy plus endocrine: 7% vs. 2%, <i>p</i> = 0.002). Of elderly patients with cN0 er+ breast cancer, 23% were pN+ on slnb. Size was the primary predictor of nodal status, and yet significant rates of nodal positivity were observed even in tumours preoperatively sized at 1 cm or less. The use of rt and systemic adjuvant therapies differed by nodal status, although the long-term oncologic implications require further investigation. Multidisciplinary input on a case-by-case basis should be considered before omission of slnb.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Oct,"Laws A, Cheifetz R, Warburton R, McGahan CE, Pao JS, Kuusk U, Dingee C, Quan ML, McKevitt E",9,1838,oncology,2025-11-22
33647504,Prognostic Impact of KRAS G12C Mutation in Patients With NSCLC: Results From the European Thoracic Oncology Platform Lungscape Project.,"KRAS mutations, the most frequent gain-of-function alterations in NSCLC, are currently emerging as potential predictive therapeutic targets. The role of KRAS-G12C (Kr_G12C) is of special interest after the recent discovery and preclinical analyses of two different Kr_G12C covalent inhibitors (AMG-510, MRTX849). KRAS mutations were evaluated in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections by a microfluidic-based multiplex polymerase chain reaction platform as a component of the previously published European Thoracic Oncology Platform Lungscape 003 Multiplex Mutation study, of clinically annotated, resected, stage I to III NSCLC. In this study, -Kr_G12C mutation prevalence and its association with clinicopathologic characteristics, molecular profiles, and postoperative patient outcome (overall survival, relapse-free survival, time-to-relapse) were explored. KRAS gene was tested in 2055 Lungscape cases (adenocarcinomas: 1014 [49%]) with I or II or III stage respective distribution of 53% or 24% or 22% and median follow-up of 57 months. KRAS mutation prevalence in the adenocarcinoma cohort was 38.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 35.0% to 41.0%), with Kr_G12C mutation representing 17.0% (95% CI: 14.7% to 19.4%). In the ""histologic-subtype"" cohort, Kr_G12C prevalence was 10.5% (95% CI: 9.2% to 11.9%). When adjusting for clinicopathologic characteristics, a significant negative prognostic effect of Kr_G12C presence versus other KRAS mutations or nonexistence of KRAS mutation was identified in the adenocarcinoma cohort alone and in the ""histologic-subtype"" cohort. For overall survival in adenocarcinomas, hazard ratio (HR)<sub>G12C versus other KRAS</sub> is equal to 1.39 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.89, p = 0.031) and HR<sub>G12C versus no KRAS</sub> is equal to 1.32 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.69, p = 0.028) (both also significant in the ""histologic-subtype"" cohort). For time-to-relapse, HR<sub>G12C versus other KRAS</sub> is equal to 1.41 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.92, p = 0.030). In addition, among all patients, for relapse-free survival, HR<sub>G12C versus no KRAS</sub> is equal to 1.27 (95% CI: 1.04 to 1.54, p = 0.017).

33567626,Prolonged SARS-CoV-2-RNA Detection from Nasopharyngeal Swabs in an Oncologic Patient: What Impact on Cancer Treatment?,"The pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is a serious global challenge affecting millions of people worldwide. Cancer patients are at risk for infection exposure and serious complications. A prompt diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the timely adoption of isolation measures and the appropriate management of cancer treatments. In lung cancer patients the symptoms of infection 19 may resemble those exhibited by the underlying oncologic condition, possibly leading to diagnostic overlap and delays. Moreover, cancer patients might display a prolonged positivity of nasopharyngeal RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2, causing long interruptions or delay of cancer treatments. However, the association between the positivity of RT-PCR assays and the patient's infectivity remains uncertain. We describe the case of a patient with non-small cell lung cancer, and a severe ab extrinseco compression of the trachea, whose palliative radiotherapy was delayed because of the prolonged positivity of nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2. The patient did not show clinical symptoms suggestive of active infection, but the persistent positivity of RT-PCR assays imposed the continuation of isolation measures and the delay of radiotherapy for over two months. Finally, the negative result of SARS-CoV-2 viral culture allowed us to verify the absence of viral activity and to rule out the infectivity of the patient, who could finally continue her cancer treatment.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2021-Feb,"Ferrari A, Trevenzoli M, Sasset L, Di Liso E, Tavian T, Rossi L, Di Meco E, Cattelan AM",8,1447,oncology,2025-11-22
32489271,Association between waiting time for radiotherapy after surgery for early-stage breast cancer and survival outcomes in Ontario: a population-based outcomes study.,"After surgery for early-stage breast cancer (bca), adjuvant radiotherapy (rt) decreases the risk of locoregional recurrence and death from bca. It is unclear whether delays to the initiation of adjuvant rt are associated with inferior survival outcomes. This population-based retrospective cohort study included a random sample of 25% of all women with stage i or ii bca treated with adjuvant rt in Ontario between 1 September 2001 and 31 August 2002, when, because of capacity issues, wait times for radiation were abnormally long. Pathology reports were manually abstracted and deterministically linked to population-level administrative databases to obtain information about recurrence and survival outcomes. Cox proportional hazards modelling was used to evaluate the association between waiting time and survival outcomes. A composite survival outcome was used to ensure that all possible measurable harms of delay would be captured. The composite outcome, event-free survival, included locoregional recurrence, development of metastatic disease, and bca-specific mortality. We identified 1028 women with stage i or ii bca who were treated with breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant rt. For the 599 women who were treated with adjuvant radiation without intervening chemotherapy, a waiting time of 12 weeks or more from surgery to the start of radiation appeared to be associated with worse event-free survival after a median follow-up of 7.2 years (hazard ratio for the composite outcome: 1.44; 95% confidence interval: 0.98 to 2.11; <i>p</i> = 0.07). For the 429 women who received intervening adjuvant chemotherapy, a waiting time of 6 weeks or more from completion of chemotherapy to start of radiation was associated with worse event-free survival after a median follow-up of 7.4 years (hazard ratio: 1.50; 95% confidence interval: 1.00 to 2.22; <i>p</i> = 0.047). Delay to the initiation of adjuvant rt after breast-conserving surgery is associated with inferior bca survival outcomes. The good prognosis for patients with early-stage bca limits the statistical power to detect an effect of delay to rt.

32218658,Analyzing the effect of physician assignment in the survival of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) is the most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with a 5-year survival of 17%. The low survival rate observed in patients with nsclc is primarily attributable to advanced stage of disease at diagnosis, with more than 50% of cases being stage iv at presentation. For patients with advanced disease, palliative systemic therapy can improve overall survival (os); however, a recent review at our institution of more than 500 consecutive cases of advanced nsclc demonstrated that only 55% of the patients received palliative systemic therapy. What is unknown to date is whether that observed low rate of systemic therapy in our previous study is uniform across oncologists. With ethics approval, we performed a retrospective analysis of newly diagnosed patients with stage iv nsclc seen as outpatients at our institution between 2009 and 2012 by 4 different oncologists. Demographics, treatment, and survival data were collected and compared for the 4 oncologists. The 4 oncologists saw 528 patients overall, with D seeing 115; L, 158; R, 137; and M, 118.

We used a feasibility questionnaire distributed to women (40-49 or 50-74 years of age) attending msus and wwcs in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to examine■ women's views about bca primary prevention and sources of health care information,■ prevalence of lifestyle-related bca risk factors, and■ predictors of prior mammography encounters within provincial screening guidelines.Variables examined included personal profiling, comorbidities, prior mammography uptake, lifestyle behaviours, socioeconomic status, health information sources, and willingness to discuss or implement lifestyle modifications, or endocrine therapy, or both. A logistic regression analysis examined associations with prior mammography encounters. Of the 244 responses obtained during 1.5 months from women aged 40-49 years (<i>n</i> = 75) and 50-74 years (<i>n</i> = 169), 56% and 75% respectively sought or would prefer to receive health information from within, as opposed to outside, health care. Lifestyle-related bca risk factors were prevalent, and most women were willing to discuss or implement lifestyle modifications (93%) or endocrine therapy (67%). Of the two age groups, 49% and 93% respectively had previously undergone mammography within guidelines. Increasing age and marital status (single, separated, or divorced vs. married or partnered) were independent predictors of prior mammography encounters within guidelines for women 40-49 years of age; no independent predictors were observed in the older age group. Women attending msus and wwcs seem to largely adhere to mammography guidelines and appear motivated to engage in bca primary prevention strategies, including lifestyle modifications and endocrine therapy. Women's views as observed in this study provide a rationale for the potential incorporation of bca risk assessment within the ""mammogram point of care"" to engage motivated women in bca primary prevention strategies.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Jun,"Rundle A, Iles S, Matheson K, Cahill LE, Forbes CC, Saint-Jacques N, Urquhart R, Younis T",8,2111,oncology,2025-11-22
32218657,Biopsy on progression in patients with <i>EGFR</i> mutation-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer-a Canadian experience.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (tkis) are standard therapy for patients with advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer harbouring an <i>EGFR</i> mutation. Upon progression, 50%-60% develop a secondary T790M mutation. Recent trials demonstrated outcome improvement with osimertinib compared with standard platinum-based chemotherapy as second-line therapy for patients with secondary T790M mutation. To identify T790M, a biopsy of the tumour or, more recently, plasma is necessary. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate biopsy procedures and mutational analysis at 2 Canadian cancer centres. In a retrospective review of patients who were approached to enrol in the aura2, aura3, or astris studies, demographics, eligibility for rebiopsy upon progression after an egfr tki, rebiopsy methods and complications, number of rebiopsies, and incidence of the T790M mutation were collected. Of 84 patients considered for trial enrolment, 80 signed a consent. In 78 patients who underwent rebiopsy, computed tomography or ultrasonography guidance were the most common methods used. The most common biopsy sites were lung and lymph nodes. The median number of rebiopsies performed to find a T790M mutation was 2. Only 9% of patients experienced complications. Of samples obtained, 74% were adequate for testing after initial rebiopsy. A T790M mutation was found in 47 patients, of whom 44 were enrolled on a trial. After multiple rebiopsies, only 5% of samples were inadequate for molecular analysis. In the Canadian setting, the acceptance of rebiopsy on progression was high. Multiple rebiopsies were clinically feasible and could increase the yield for T790M mutation. The incidence of complications was low despite the most common site for rebiopsy being lung.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Feb,"Chu Q, Agha A, Devost N, Walton RN, Ghosh S, Ho C",6,1803,oncology,2025-11-22
33380873,Economic evaluation of adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer and residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant taxane and trastuzumab-based treatment in Canada.,"In the katherine trial, adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine [T-DM1, Kadcyla (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.)], compared with trastuzumab, significantly reduced the risk of recurrence or death by 50% (unstratified hazard ratio: 0.50; 95% confidence interval: 0.39 to 0.64; <i>p</i> < 0.0001) in patients with her2-positive early breast cancer (ebc) and residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant systemic treatment. A cost-utility evaluation, with probabilistic analyses, was conducted to examine the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (qaly) gained associated with T-DM1 relative to trastuzumab, given the higher per-cycle cost of T-DM1. A Markov model comprising a number of health states was used to examine clinical and economic outcomes over a lifetime horizon from the Canadian public payer perspective. Patients entered the model in the invasive disease-free survival (idfs) state, where they received either T-DM1 or trastuzumab. Transition probabilities between the health states were derived from the katherine trial, Canadian life tables, and published literature from other relevant clinical trials (emilia, cleopatra, and M77001). Resource use, costs, and utilities were derived from katherine, other clinical trials, published literature, provincial fee schedules, and clinical expert opinion. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for key assumptions and model parameters. Compared with trastuzumab, adjuvant T-DM1 was associated with a cost savings of $8,300 per patient and a 2.16 incremental qaly gain; thus T-DM1 dominated trastuzumab. Scenario analyses yielded similar results, with T-DM1 dominating trastuzumab or producing highly favourable incremental cost-utility ratios of less than $10,000 per qaly. Adjuvant T-DM1 monotherapy is a cost-effective strategy compared with trastuzumab alone in the treatment of patients with her2-positive ebc and residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant systemic treatment.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Younis T, Lee A, Coombes ME, Bouganim N, Becker D, Revil C, Jhuti GS",7,1951,oncology,2025-11-22

Erythema gyratum repens (egr) is a cutaneous paraneoplastic syndrome with distinctive characteristics. Here, we report the rare case of a 73-year-old woman with a chronic erythematous rash for 11 months associated with intense pruritus. She was treated with prednisone and antihistamines by dermatologists, but did not respond. The patient was subsequently seen in our clinic for unintentional weight loss and anorexia with intermittent nausea and vomiting. During further evaluation with imaging studies, upper endoscopy, and colonoscopy with biopsy, poorly differentiated anal scc was identified. Biopsies of the skin rash were characteristic of egr. She was treated using concurrent chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C and pelvic radiation (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions) for anal scc. She tolerated the treatment, and her rash faded, with resolution of the pruritus.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Aug,"Saeed A, Hameem ZU, Modi D, Park R, Saeed A",5,963,oncology,2025-11-22
38101486,Impact of Apolipoprotein E Genotype on Neurocognitive Function in Patients With Brain Metastases: An Analysis of NRG Oncology's RTOG 0614.,"Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is a common treatment for brain metastases and is frequently associated with decline in neurocognitive functioning (NCF). The e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer disease and NCF decline associated with a variety of neurologic diseases and insults. APOE carrier status has not been evaluated as a risk factor for onset time or extent of NCF impairment in patients with brain metastases treated with WBRT. NRG/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0614 treated adult patients with brain metastases with 37.5 Gy of WBRT (+/- memantine), performed longitudinal NCF testing, and included an optional blood draw for APOE analysis. NCF test results were compared at baseline and over time with mixed-effects models. A cause-specific Cox model for time to NCF failure was performed to assess the effects of treatment arm and APOE carrier status. APOE results were available for 45% of patients (n = 227/508). NCF did not differ by APOE e4 carrier status at baseline. Mixed-effects modeling showed that APOE e4 carriers had worse memory after WBRT compared with APOE e4 noncarriers (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised total recall [least square mean difference, 0.63; P = .0074], delayed recognition [least square mean difference, 0.75; P = .023]). However, APOE e4 carrier status was not associated with time to NCF failure (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.60-1.23; P = .40). Memantine delayed the time to NCF failure, regardless of carrier status (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.52-1.01; P = .054). APOE e4 carriers with brain metastases exhibited greater decline in learning and memory, executive function, and the Clinical Trial Battery Composite score after treatment with WBRT (+/- memantine), without acceleration of onset of difference in time to NCF failure.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",2024-Jul,"Wefel JS, Deshmukh S, Brown PD, Grosshans DR, Sulman EP, Cerhan JH, Mehta MP, Khuntia D, Shi W, Mishra MV, Suh JH, Laack NN, Chen Y, Curtis AA, Laba JM, Elsayed A, Thakrar A, Pugh SL, Bruner DW",19,1846,oncology,2025-11-22
32489264,A randomized trial of the electronic Lung Cancer Symptom Scale for quality-of-life assessment in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.,"Improving health-related quality of life (hrqol) is a key goal of systemic therapy in advanced lung cancer, although routine assessment remains challenging. We analyzed the impact of a real-time electronic hrqol tool, the electronic Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (elcss-ql), on palliative care (pc) referral rates, patterns of chemotherapy treatment, and use of other supportive interventions in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) receiving first-line chemotherapy. Patients with advanced nsclc starting first-line chemotherapy were randomized to their oncologist receiving or not receiving their elcss-ql data before each clinic visit. Patients completed the elcss-ql at baseline, before each chemotherapy cycle, and at subsequent follow-up visits until disease progression. Prospective data about the pc referral rate, hrqol, and use of other supportive interventions were collected. For the 95 patients with advanced nsclc who participated, oncologists received real-time elcss-ql data for 44 (elcss-ql arm) and standard clinical assessment alone for 51 (standard arm). The primary endpoint, the pc referral rate, was numerically higher, but statistically similar, for patients in the elcss-ql and standard arms. The hrqol scores over time were not significantly different between the two study arms. The elcss-ql is feasible as a tool for use in routine clinical practice, although no statistically significant effect of its use was demonstrated in our study. Improving access to supportive care through the collection of patient-reported outcomes and hrqol should be an important component of care for patients with advanced lung cancer.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Kuo JC, Graham DM, Salvarrey A, Kassam F, Le LW, Shepherd FA, Burkes R, Hollen PJ, Gralla RJ, Leighl NB",10,1661,oncology,2025-11-22

There are two aims for this short communication: ■ Highlight colorectal risk factor findings from a population-based case-control study■ Highlight trends and challenges of colorectal cancer research in Indigenous populations in Ontario. Prevalences of cigarette smoking, obesity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and family history of colorectal cancer were estimated using the Indigenous identifier in the Ontario Familial Colon Cancer Registry for 1999-2007 and then compared for cases and controls using age-adjusted odds ratios (ors) with 95% confidence intervals (cis). The registry search identified 66 Indigenous cases and 23 Indigenous controls. Cigarette smoking (or: 1.88; 95% ci: 0.63 to 5.60) and obesity (or: 2.16; 95% ci: 0.72 to 6.46) were higher in cases, but not statistically significantly so. Findings were consistent with previous literature describing Indigenous populations.

38901878,Improving quality of care by standardising patient data collection in electronic medical records in an oncology department in Spain.,"Evaluation of quality of care in oncology is key in ensuring patients receive adequate treatment. American Society of Clinical Oncology's (ASCO) Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI) Certification Program (QCP) is an international initiative that evaluates quality of care in outpatient oncology practices. We retrospectively reviewed free-text electronic medical records from patients with breast cancer (BR), colorectal cancer (CRC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In a baseline measurement, high scores were obtained for the nine disease-specific measures of QCP Track (2021 version had 26 measures); thus, they were not further analysed. We evaluated two sets of measures: the remaining 17 QCP Track measures, as well as these plus other 17 measures selected by us (combined measures). Review of data from 58 patients (26 BR; 18 CRC; 14 NSCLC) seen in June 2021 revealed low overall quality scores (OQS)-below ASCO's 75% threshold-for QCP Track measures (46%) and combined measures (58%). We developed a plan to improve OQS and monitored the impact of the intervention by abstracting data at subsequent time points. We evaluated potential causes for the low OQS and developed a plan to improve it over time by educating oncologists at our hospital on the importance of improving collection of measures and highlighting the goal of applying for QOPI certification. We conducted seven plan-do-study-act cycles and evaluated the scores at seven subsequent data abstraction time points from November 2021 to December 2022, reviewing 404 patients (199 BR; 114 CRC; 91 NSCLC). All measures were improved. Four months after the intervention, OQS surpassed the quality threshold and was maintained for 10 months until the end of the study (range, 78-87% for QCP Track measures; 78-86% for combined measures). We developed an easy-to-implement intervention that achieved a fast improvement in OQS, enabling our Medical Oncology Department to aim for QOPI certification.",BMJ open quality,2024-Jun,"Alonso-Jáudenes Curbera G, Gómez-Randulfe Rodríguez MI, Alonso de Castro B, Silva Díaz S, Parajó Vázquez I, Gratal P, López López R, García Campelo R",8,1977,oncology,2025-11-22

In the United States, an estimated 204 000 to 475 000 caregiving youth provide multifaceted, extended care in oncology. This results in both positive and negative outcomes for youth-spanning multiple domains of health. The aim of this study was to explore the caregiving experiences, outcomes, and unmet needs of caregiving youth (aged 12-24 years) in oncology. An explanatory sequential mixed-methods study design was used. Fifty-two adults who lived with a parent with cancer as a child were recruited via social media and asked to complete an online survey. A subsample of 18 individuals reporting high to very high amounts of caregiving were subsequently interviewed. The mean reported caregiving youth age was 16.13 (±4.86) years. They provided care approximately 22.43 h/wk for approximately 3.04 years. Most (71.2%) reported high to very high amounts of caregiving activity. The highest reported categories of unmet needs were information, family, feelings, friends, and time out/recreation. Qualitative findings included 4 themes: stepping into the role, family communication, dealing with feelings, and a new separateness. Identified needs included a desire for more information to aid in uncertainty, better communication within the family, needing someone to help them process their feelings, and peer-to-peer support. It is important for nurses and researchers to be aware of and acknowledge the needs of families dealing with cancer and aid in the development and implementation of tailored interventions to support caregiving youth.",Cancer nursing,,"Hendricks BA, Kupzyk K, Poppert Cordts KM, Lally RM",4,1690,oncology,2025-11-22
32669925,Tumour response 3 months after neoadjuvant single-fraction radiotherapy for low-risk breast cancer.,"Standard treatment for early-stage invasive breast cancer (bca) consists of breast-conserving surgery and several weeks of adjuvant radiotherapy (rt). Neoadjuvant single-fraction rt is a novel approach for early-stage bca. We sought to investigate the effect of delaying surgery after neoadjuvant rt with respect to the rate of pathologic response (pr). Women 65 years of age or older with a new diagnosis of stage i luminal A bca were eligible for inclusion. A single 20 Gy dose to the primary breast tumour was given, followed by breast-conserving surgery 3 months later. The primary endpoint was the pr rate assessed by microscopic evaluation using the Miller-Payne system. To date, 10 patients have been successfully treated. Median age of the patients was 72 years (range: 65-84 years). In 8 patients, neoadjuvant rt resulted in a tumour pr with median residual cellularity of 3%. No immediate rt complications other than mild dermatitis were noted. This study demonstrates a method for delivering single-fraction rt that can lead to a high level of pr in most patients. Continued accrual to this study and subsequent trials are needed to determine the feasibility, safety, and role of this novel technique in the management of early-stage bca.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Jun,"Tiberi D, Vavassis P, Nguyen D, Guilbert MC, Simon-Cloutier A, Dubé P, Gervais MK, Sideris L, Leblanc G, Hijal T, Dufresne MP, Yassa M",12,1249,oncology,2025-11-22

Initial report of a longitudinal change management campaign at a provincial cancer program.,"Despite level 1 evidence demonstrating the equivalence of single-fraction radiotherapy (sfrt) and multiple-fraction radiotherapy (mfrt) for the palliation of painful bone metastases, sfrt remains underused. In 2015, to encourage the sustainable use of palliative radiation oncology resources, CancerCare Manitoba disseminated, to each radiation oncologist in Manitoba, guidelines from Choosing Wisely Canada (cwc) that recommend sfrt. We assessed whether dissemination of the guidelines influenced sfrt use in Manitoba in 2016, and we identified factors associated with mfrt. All patients treated with palliative radiotherapy for bone metastasis in Manitoba from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2016 were identified from the provincial radiotherapy database. Patient, treatment, and disease characteristics were extracted from the electronic medical record and tabulated by fractionation schedule. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors associated with mfrt. In 2016, 807 patients (mean age: 70 years; range: 35-96 years) received palliative radiotherapy for bone metastasis, with 69% of the patients having uncomplicated bone metastasis. The most common primary malignancies were prostate (27.1%), lung (20.6%), and breast cancer (15.9%). In 62% of cases, mfrt was used-a proportion that was unchanged from 2015. On multivariable analysis, a gastrointestinal [odds ratio (or): 5.3] or lung primary (or: 3.3), complicated bone metastasis (or: 4.3), and treatment at a subsidiary site (or: 4.4) increased the odds of mfrt use. Dissemination of cwc recommendations alone did not increase sfrt use by radiation oncologists in 2016. A more comprehensive knowledge translation effort is therefore warranted and is now underway to encourage increased uptake of sfrt in Manitoba.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Aug,"Kim JO, Hanumanthappa N, Chung YT, Beck J, Koul R, Bashir B, Cooke A, Dubey A, Butler J, Nashed M, Hunter W, Ong A",12,1830,oncology,2025-11-22

In the neoadjuvant setting, data exploring whether expeditious neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nac) after diagnosis improves the rate of pathologic complete response (pcr) in breast cancer are limited. Patients who received nac and completed treatment between May 2012 and December 2018 were identified from a prospectively collected database at BC Cancer. Time from diagnosis to start of nac was calculated. Patients were grouped into those who did and did not experience a pcr, and those who started nac within 28 days or after 28 days [time to nac (ttn)]. The association between pcr and ttn was tested using logistic regression. In the time period studied, 482 patients who received nac were identified. After exclusions, 421 patients met the eligibility criteria. Median time from biopsy to chemotherapy was 33 days (range: 7-140 days). In 149 patients (35.4%), nac was received within 28 days of diagnosis (range: 7-28 days); in 272 patients (64.6%), it was received after more than 28 days (range: 29-140 days). The overall pcr rate was 31.8%. A trend toward a higher pcr rate, although not statistically significant, was observed in the group that initiated chemotherapy within 28 days (34.2% vs. 30.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.43). In the logistic regression model, rates of pcr were associated with receptor status, but not age, stage, or ttn. In the neoadjuvant setting, we observed no difference in the rate of pcr in patients who started nac within 28 days or after 28 days.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Jun,"Le D, Eslami M, Li H, Hajjaj O, Chia S, Simmons C",6,1603,oncology,2025-11-22

Thirty months later, she is still in complete remission of her PCNSL and MS. In this case, whole brain radiotherapy was excluded because it may be associated with an increased risk of neurotoxicity in MS. ASCT was preferred because it has been shown to prevent disability progression in less advanced MS stages. Our patient is the second to receive an ASCT in this context and this option of treatment should be the preferred if the patient is eligible.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Moineau-Vallée K, Rinfret J, Luu Hoai MH, St-Louis V, Berthelet F, Létourneau-Guillon L, Lemieux-Blanchard É, Prat A, Adam JP",9,1162,oncology,2025-11-22

All of the patients were recommended to receive radical surgery. a total of 197 patients were included. Eighty-one patients received CRT, while one hundred and sixteen patients received TNT. Nine patients did not undergo surgery because of the distant metastases (one patient (1.2%) in CRT group, two patients (1.7%) in TNT group) or a refusal of resection (two patients in CRT group, four patients in TNT group). The pathological complete response (pCR) rate was 32.7% in TNT compared with 12.8% in CRT (<i>p</i> = 0.002). There was no statistically significant difference in grade 3 acute toxicities of neoadjuvant treatment and surgical complications between the two groups. the consolidation chemotherapy model is safe for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer and it has a high pCR rate.

Subsequently, several clinical trials in patients with resected or metastatic melanoma found that immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies have a benefit greater than that with interferon. It was therefore considered timely for an update to the guideline about adjuvant systemic therapy in melanoma. The present guideline was developed by the pebc and the Melanoma Disease Site Group (dsg). Based on a systematic review from a literature search conducted using medline, embase, and the Evidence Based Medicine Reviews databases for the period 1996 to 28 May 2019, the Working Group drafted recommendations. The systematic review and recommendations were then circulated to the Melanoma dsg and the pebc Report Approval Panel for internal review; the revised document underwent external review. For patients with completely resected cutaneous or mucosal melanoma with a high risk of recurrence, the recommended adjuvant therapies are nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or dabrafenib-trametinib for patients with <i>BRAF</i> V600E or V600K mutations; nivolumab or pembrolizumab are recommend for patients with <i>BRAF</i> wild-type disease. Use of ipilimumab is not recommended. Molecular testing should be conducted to help guide treatment decisions. Interferon alfa, chemotherapy regimens, vaccines, levamisole, bevacizumab, bacillus Calmette-Guérin, and isolated limb perfusion are not recommended for adjuvant treatment of cutaneous melanoma except as part of a clinical trial.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Feb,"Petrella TM, Fletcher GG, Knight G, McWhirter E, Rajagopal S, Song X, Baetz TD",7,1770,oncology,2025-11-22
33704190,Genomic and Clinical Correlates of Adrenocortical Carcinoma in an Adult Patient with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome: A Case Report.,"Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is defined by germline mutations of the p53 tumour suppressor gene. Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare aggressive malignancy that is commonly associated with LFS. Most LFS-linked ACC cases occur in children, and limited research has been dedicated to the clinical outcomes and genomics of adult cases with LFS-linked ACC. We report on a 34-year-old female who was diagnosed with three separate malignancies: stage III invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast, metastatic ACC from the right adrenal gland, and grade 2 pleomorphic sarcoma of the left hand. Her invasive breast ductal carcinoma was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and she received a bilateral mastectomy after her LFS was confirmed with genetic blood testing. Adrenal ACC was initially treated with a right nephrectomy and adrenalectomy, followed by adjuvant mitotane and two lines of chemotherapy after disease recurrence. Her hand sarcoma was treated by second ray amputation. Further, we conducted deep next-generation sequencing of each of her unique tumour tissue samples using FoundationONE CDx. A whole-genome shot capture followed by in vitro sequencing performed by the Illumina<sup>®</sup> HiSeq platform revealed a germline P191fs*18 TP53 mutation across all three tissue samples. This case provides insight into the genomics and clinical characteristics of LFS-linked adult-onset ACC and demonstrated that p53 mutations were preserved throughout each malignancy, without apparent treatment pressures on genomic profiling. This case reinforces the critical importance of adopting best practices for LFS, which include the implementation of highly vigilant screening and management of care in a multidisciplinary setting.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Dec,"Bondy S, Tajzler C, Hotte SJ, Kapoor A, Zbuk K, Lalani AA",6,1740,oncology,2025-11-22

It was reported that a low pni score is significantly associated with major postoperative complications and poor prognosis. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of perioperative oral management (pom) on the perioperative pni profiles of patients with digestive system or urinary cancers. The medical records of 181 patients with cancer who underwent surgery and for whom a pni could be calculated were retrospectively reviewed. The intervention rate with pom was 34.8%. The median preoperative pni score was 48.25 in all patients with a pom intervention [25% to 75% interquartile range (iqr): 44.38-54.13] and 47.25 in those without an intervention (iqr: 42.0-53.5). Compared with patients not receiving pom, those who received pom had significantly higher pni scores from the early postoperative period (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Notably, of patients who could resume oral intake within 3 days after surgery, those who received pom intervention, compared with those who did not, had significantly higher pni scores from the early postoperative period (<i>p</i> < 0.05).

However, routine screening for ltbi has its limitations. The objective of the present study was to assess the number of patients treated for ltbi both before and after the introduction of a consistent tuberculin skin test (tst) screening program for patients with mm at our cancer centre. This retrospective observational study analyzed adult patients with mm treated with autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2014, for whom tst was consistently performed at our cancer facility. Baseline demographic characteristics of patients who received tst testing and ltbi therapy were compared with those of a pre-intervention cohort of patients (1 January 2008 to 31 December 2009) who were not tested. During the post-intervention period, 170 patients with mm had a tst. In 14 patients (8.2%) results were positive, and 11 of the 14 received ltbi therapy. Of another 12 patients with radiographic imaging changes consistent with prior granulomatous disease and negative tst results, 2 were treated. No cases of tuberculosis (tb) reactivation were noted in individuals who completed ltbi therapy. One case of active tb was diagnosed in a patient with a negative tst. In contrast, in the pre-intervention matched cohort of 170 patients, no tsts were performed, and no cases of active tb were documented. Patients with mm could benefit from a consistent tst testing policy coupled with subsequent ltbi therapy. However, universal testing might not be required. A targeted program combining evaluation of host risk factors, imaging findings, and screening tests might optimize ltbi diagnosis and management, and thus be effective in preventing the development of active tb in at-risk patients with mm.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Jun,"Gitman M, Vu J, Nguyen T, Chen C, Rotstein C",5,1906,oncology,2025-11-22

32669928,PD-1 inhibition in malignant melanoma and lack of clinical response in chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the same patients: a case series.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) is the most common adult leukemia in the Western world. Unfortunately, affected patients are often immunosuppressed and at increased risk of infection and secondary malignancy. Previous meta-analysis has found that patients with cll have a risk of melanoma that is increased by a factor of 4 compared with the general population. Recent advances in the understanding of the PD receptor pathway have led to immunotherapies that target cancer cells. The use of PD-1 inhibitors is now considered first-line treatment for <i>BRAF</i> wild-type metastatic melanoma. Interestingly, early preclinical data suggest that inhibition of that pathway could also be used in the treatment of cll; however, recent clinical data did not support the effectiveness of that approach. In this case series, we highlight 2 cases in which patients with cll and concurrent malignant melanoma underwent treatment with PD-1 inhibitors and were found to experience reductions in their white blood cell counts without improvement in their hemoglobin. Those cases further illustrate that treatment of cll with PD-1 inhibitors is ineffective.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Jun,"Landego I, Hewitt D, Hibbert I, Dhaliwal D, Pieterse W, Grenier D, Wong R, Johnston J, Banerji V",9,1147,oncology,2025-11-22
32489272,Prolonged response to liposomal irinotecan in a patient with stage IV pancreatic/bile duct cancer previously treated with FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel.,"At 9%, and 2% when diagnosed at advanced stage, the 5-year relative survival rate for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pdac) is the lowest of any cancer. The currently approved treatment options for metastatic pdac in the United States are folfirinox [irinotecan-fluorouracil (5fu)-leucovorin (lv)-oxaliplatin], gemcitabine-nab-paclitaxel, and liposomal irinotecan plus 5fu-lv. Liposomal irinotecan is a novel formulation of irinotecan encapsulated within a lipid bilayer, which favours local metabolic activation. The napoli-1 trial demonstrated the efficacy of liposomal irinotecan in combination with 5fu and lv for the treatment of advanced pdac after progression on gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. The 1-year survival in those patients was 25%; however, none had had irinotecan-refractory disease before treatment with liposomal irinotecan. Furthermore, the U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend liposomal irinotecan plus 5fu-lv in patients who have received prior fluoropyrimidine-based therapy if no prior irinotecan therapy has been given. Here, we report a male patient with stage iv cancer of pancreas or bile duct (site unconfirmed) who experienced a prolonged (51 weeks) response to liposomal irinotecan plus 5fu-lv despite prior disease progression on irinotecan. Several factors have previously been associated with long-term survival in patients receiving liposomal irinotecan therapy: no prior irinotecan-based chemotherapy, high Karnofsky performance status score, age 65 years or less, serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 less than 59 U/mL, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio 5 or less, and absence of liver metastasis. The patient in the present report had none of those characteristics indicative of long-term survival, except his age at diagnosis-47 years.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Apr,"Surinach A, Phung T, Abdul-Rahim O, Khushman M",4,1796,oncology,2025-11-22
34571335,Absence of significant clinical benefit for a systematic routine creatine phosphokinase measurement in asymptomatic patients treated with anti-programmed death protein (ligand) 1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to screen cardiac or neuromuscular immune-related toxicities.,"Despite unprecedented results of anti-programmed death protein (ligand) 1 (PD-(L)1) immune checkpoint inhibitor in the oncology's armamentarium, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) represent a therapeutic hurdle. Currently, there is no consensual recommendation on a routinely monitored biomarker to early detect irAE. Biological markers such as serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) are commonly used to measure muscular tissue injury. The potential of routine serum CPK monitoring to predict cardiac or neuromuscular irAE in patients treated with immunotherapy remains unknown. In this retrospective study between January 2016 and December 2018 at Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, 1151 cancer patients treated with anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy were systematically monitored with serum CPK measurements before each immunotherapy cycle. We considered significant CPK increases according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 (CTCAEV5) of grade ≥2 severity. Comparisons were performed in patients with immune-related CPK (ir-CPK) elevations symptomatic versus asymptomatic. Overall, 53 of 1151 (4.6%) patients showed a CPK increase. Elevations of CPK were deemed to be immunotherapy-related in 31 of 1151 (2.7%) patients. Among them, 12 of 31 (38.7%) patients experienced symptomatic cardiac or neuromuscular irAE, whereas the other 19 of 31 (61.3%) patients remained asymptomatic. In patients with symptomatic irAE, the mean ir-CPK level was higher compared with asymptomatic patients (1271 versus 771 UI/L, P value = 0.02). In the asymptomatic group, all patients experienced a spontaneous resolution of the ir-CPK increase, and none required medical intervention. Most patients with immune-related CPK increase remained asymptomatic. The CPK serum increase did not alter the clinical management of asymptomatic patients. The results of this study did not support a significant clinical interest for a systematic routine CPK monitoring in patients amenable to anti-PD-(L)1 immunotherapy.","European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2021-Nov,"Hajem S, Ederhy S, Champiat S, Troalen F, Nolin-Lapalme A, Berhoune M, Cauquil C, Martin-Romano P, Baldini C, Laparra A, Vuagnat P, Hollebecque A, Mateus C, Besse B, Naltet C, Robert C, Marabelle A, Massard C, Lambotte O, Michot JM",20,1999,oncology,2025-11-22

33173384,Quality of life in a real-world study of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with trifluridine/tipiracil.,"Quality of life (qol) is important for oncology patients, especially for those with late-stage disease. The present study was initiated to address the lack of published prospective data about the qol benefits of trifluridine/tipiracil (ftd/tpi) compared with best supportive care (bsc) in patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mcrc). This prospective, cross-sectional, non-interventional study used multidimensional validated scales to evaluate patient-reported qol in two study cohorts of patients and also to measure differences in mcrc-related symptoms and pain in a real-world clinical setting. Our findings demonstrate that patients with refractory mcrc report better overall qol when treated with ftd/tpi than with bsc alone. In that population, statistically significant differences in mean qol measures favoured ftd/tpi over bsc for physical symptom distress, psychological distress, activity impairment, overall valuation of life, and symptomatology. The overall better qol for patients receiving ftd/tpi implies that treatment was well tolerated and was associated with a lower symptom burden. No significant differences for pain were observed between the groups. This study suggests that ftd/tpi is a well-tolerated option for the treatment of patients with refractory mcrc, showcasing the value of capturing real-world qol data in routine clinical practice.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Oct,"Cheung WY, Kavan P, Dolley A",3,1386,oncology,2025-11-22

However, it is non-specific and could be increased in several cancers and some benign conditions. We report the case of a 70-year-old man followed since 2014 for a left colon adenocarcinoma with the persistence of an increased CEA. There was no evidence of recurrence, but a right lobar thyroid nodule without a significantly increased uptake was incidentally discovered on the CT scan of <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) PET/CT. We suspected a medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) explaining the persistent elevation of CEA. Plasma calcitonin levels were 47 ng/L (N < 10). Fine needle aspiration cytology found atypia of undetermined significance and the patient was reluctant to undergo surgery without any further exploration. We performed a <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine (<sup>18</sup>F-FDOPA) PET/CT preoperatively which revealed a punctiform focus of the right thyroid lobe corresponding to a pT1aN1aMxR0 medullary thyroid carcinoma, histopathologically confirmed.

32669921,Willingness of women with early estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer to take adjuvant CDK4/6 inhibitors.,"The steady decline in breast cancer (bca) mortality has come at the cost of increasingly toxic and expensive adjuvant therapies. Trials evaluating the addition of 2 or 3 years of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (cdk4/6) inhibitors to adjuvant endocrine therapy (et) are ongoing, but the willingness of patients to take such additional therapy is unknown. We surveyed 100 consecutive postmenopausal women with nonmetastatic estrogen receptor-positive bca who had initiated adjuvant et within the preceding 2 years. Participants were asked about perceived recurrence risk, bca worry, and overall health. They were then asked about their willingness to accept 2 years of treatment with an additional oral drug that would reduce recurrence by 40% for a range of baseline recurrence risks in 2 hypothetical scenarios. Mean age of the 99 evaluable participants was 61.7 years. In the scenario with no drug toxicity, 85% of respondents were likely to accept the new drug for a reduction in recurrence to 30% from 50%, but only 49% would take the drug if risk was reduced to 3% from 5%. In a scenario with drug-induced fatigue, the corresponding drug acceptance rates were 55% and 39% respectively. For the second scenario, bca worry was correlated with increased willingness to take the drug, even for only a 2% absolute reduction in recurrence risk. The willingness of patients with estrogen receptor-positive bca to take an adjuvant cdk4/6 inhibitor will greatly depend on the expected benefit and toxicities described to them as well as on worry about bca recurrence.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2020-Jun,"Lipton NJ, Jesin J, Warner E, Cao X, Kiss A, Desautels D, Jerzak KJ",7,1559,oncology,2025-11-22

38073295,Oncology nursing research: a global perspective.,"The specialty of oncology nursing began around the 1970s when oncology as a science became a significant practice in the clinical areas. As the practice of oncology grew in health care settings, physicians focused on providing care for individuals diagnosed with cancer with treatments like surgery, radiation, and novel chemotherapy agents. Physicians treated the physical disease, while oncology nurses cared for, and became specialised in, the assessment and management of side effects and symptoms, and supporting patients and families in coping with the impacts from the disease and treatments. Thus, the oncology nursing speciality focus is on physical, psychosocial, and practical management of patients' care; education of patients and families; and co-ordination of the complex care provided. This article focuses on how the science, or the evidence base, of oncology nursing has grown globally since those early years. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the growth and development in the body of evidence underpinning the oncology nursing specialty by highlighting scientific studies, publications, and evidence-based practice. Over the years, there has been a steady growth in the research evidence supporting the specialty, yet future challenges are ahead. These challenges include demonstrating impact of nursing interventions; infrastructure support; resources for capacity building; building research-mindedness; and strengthening equality, diversity, and inclusion.",Annals of palliative medicine,2024-Jan,"Fitch MI, Barton-Burke M, Fong W, Young A",4,1485,oncology,2025-11-22

Over the past 50 years, development of novel therapies and improvements in supportive care have led to improvements in long-term survival rates. However, there remains great morbidity associated with cancer treatment among childhood cancer survivors, and the outcomes for patients who relapse remain poor. The introduction of precision medicine, an approach that uses the understanding of genetic and biochemical profiles of a disease (as enabled by next-generation sequencing) to tailor treatment to a patient, has quickly started to change the diagnostic and therapeutic landscape of pediatric oncology. With its use, a better understanding of tumor biology, improved classification systems for various cancers, and genetically and molecularly targeted therapeutic strategies have been developed.

Ambulatory care is recognised as a key tenet in ensuring the safety and sustainability of acute care services. Increased access to ambulatory care has successfully reduced ED utilisation and improved clinical outcomes in high-risk non-oncological populations. Individualised management of acute cancer presentations is a key challenge for emergency oncology services so that it can mirror routine cancer care. There are an increasing number of acute cancer presentations, such as low-risk febrile neutropenia and incidental pulmonary embolism, that can be risk assessed for care in an emergency ambulatory setting.

37202732,Experiences of patients on cancer treatment regarding decentralization of oncology services at a tertiary hospital in the Eastern Cape.,"The cancer burden is a global public health concern associated with high morbidities and mortalities. Low and middle-income countries are more affected including South Africa. Limited access to oncology services contributes to the late presentation, late diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. In the Eastern Cape, oncology services were previously centralized with negative effects on the quality of life of the already compromised health status of the oncology patients. To mitigate the situation, a new oncology unit was opened to decentralize oncology services in the province. Little is known about the experiences of patients after this transformation. That prompted this inquiry. This study aims to explore the experiences of cancer patients regarding the decentralization of oncology services at a tertiary hospital in the Eastern Cape. A qualitative approach with a descriptive, explorative, and contextual design was undertaken, to obtain the perspective of oncology recipients following the decentralization of oncology services at a selected public tertiary hospital in the Eastern Cape. After obtaining ethical clearance and permission to conduct the study, interviews were conducted with 19 participants. All interviews were transcribed verbatim against their audio recordings. Field notes were taken by the primary researcher. The concept of trustworthiness was used to ensure rigour throughout this study. Thematic analysis was done using Tesch's approach to open coding in qualitative research. Three themes emerged from the data analysis: 1) Access to oncology services; 2) Oncology services provided; and 3) Need for improved infrastructural facilities. The majority of patients had positive experiences with the unit. The waiting time was acceptable, and medication was available. Access to services was improved.

This qualitative study is based on a semi-structured interview with 25 practicing nurses in oncology. Strategies used by nurses to identify mental distress in their patients include: receiving information, mobilizing interpersonal skills, and identifying causes of distress. When asked about the barriers that hinder the practice of identifying and responding to patients' distress, nurses reported facing several barriers that can be classified into three categories: health care system-related barriers, patient-related barriers, and nurse-related barriers. Oncology nurses should benefit from specific training on the systematic assessment of mental distress in cancer patients, in order to improve the overall management of oncology patients.","Cancer reports (Hoboken, N.J.)",2024-Apr,"Aquil A, Mouallif M, Elgot A",3,1056,oncology,2025-11-22

Informed by intersectionality, gendered racism, and the Strong Black Woman framework, this study sought to examine the possibility that Black women are adversely affected by such phenomena as evidenced by lower probability of being referred to psycho-oncology services compared to Black men, White women and White men. Data for this study consisted of 1598 cancer patients who received psychosocial distress screening at a comprehensive cancer center in a large Midwest teaching hospital. Multilevel logistic modeling was used to examine the probability of referral to psycho-oncology services for Black women, Black men, White women, and White men while controlling for patient-reported emotional and practical problems and psychosocial distress. Results indicated that Black women had the lowest probability of being referred to psycho-oncology services (2%). In comparison, the probability of being referred to psycho-oncology were 10% for White women, 9% for Black men, and 5% for White men. Additionally, as nurses' patient caseload decreased, the probability of being referred to psycho-oncology increased for Black men, White men, and White women. In contrast, nurses' patient caseload had little effect on the probability of being referred to psycho-oncology for Black women. These findings suggest unique factors influence psycho-oncology referral rates for Black women. Findings are discussed with particular focus on how to enhance equitable care for Black women with cancer.",Psycho-oncology,2023-Jun,"Aburizik A, Brindle M, Johnson E, Provencio A, Kivlighan M, LeBeau B",6,1626,oncology,2025-11-22
36944157,A Scoping Review of Compassion Fatigue Among Oncology Nurses Caring for Adult Patients.,"Oncology nurses have frequent contact with oncology patients during their cancer journey. This long-term, recurrent contact can impact the health and well-being of the nurse through the development of compassion fatigue (CF). To identify what contributes to CF and what individual, interpersonal, and organizational factors mitigate CF among oncology nurses caring for adult patients. A scoping review framework by Arksey and O'Malley guided this review. Electronic databases were searched for relevant studies. A blinded screening process was undertaken by the authors using the following inclusion criteria: English language published from January 2011 to December 2021, primary research peer-reviewed studies, and focusing on CF within oncology nurses caring for adult patients in any practice setting. Nineteen studies (21 articles) were identified. The review found nurses' personal beliefs around nursing care being provided, and personality traits of psychological inflexibility, neuroticism, passive coping, and avoidance contributed to CF. Workplace conflict and lack of a healthy work-life balance also contributed to CF. However, nurses' personal resilience, ability to positively reflect upon their work, a supportive team environment, and continuing education were found to mitigate CF. Levels of CF vary among oncology nurses caring for adult patients. Oncology nurses may benefit from personal and organizational resources aimed at improving oncology nurses' professional quality of life while decreasing CF. Consideration and future research of effective interventions are needed to sustain a future health workforce and mitigate CF among oncology nurses.",Cancer nursing,,"Banks J, Lopez V, Sahay A, Cleary M",4,1671,oncology,2025-11-22

32706978,The evolution of interventional oncology in the 21st century.,"Interventional oncology (IO) has proven to be highly efficient in the local therapy of numerous malignant tumors in addition to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Due to the advent of immune-oncology with the possibility of tumor control at the molecular and cellular levels, a system change is currently emerging. This will significantly rule oncology in the coming decades. Therefore, one cannot think about IO in the 21st century without considering immunology. For IO, this means paying much more attention to the immunomodulatory effects of the interventional techniques, which have so far been neglected, and to explore the synergistic possibilities with immuno-oncology. It can be expected that the combined use of IO and immuno-oncology will help to overcome the limitations of the latter, such as limited local effects and a high rate of side-effects. To do this, however, sectoral boundaries must be removed and interdisciplinary research efforts must be strengthened. In case of success, IO will face an exciting future.",The British journal of radiology,2020-Sep,Helmberger T,1,1037,oncology,2025-11-22

Patients diagnosed with different neoplasms have benefited from a personalized therapeutic approach in terms of response and survival. However, several challenges must be addressed for precision oncology to become a global reality. Access to genomic testing that allows biomarker identification is a main issue. A nonsystematic literature review about inequities in access to molecular genetic testing, focusing on lung cancer as the prominent example, was performed by a group of expert clinical oncologists. Access to molecular tests and their matched treatments differ between regions of the world and even among diverse populations in the same country. Socioeconomic characteristics are often strongly correlated with this disparity. Furthermore, although the cost is a determinant factor for inequality, other issues have been recognized.

This review sheds light on two common women's issues in neuro-oncology. Neuro-oncology providers are often faced with patient questions about fertility and pregnancy maintenance or prevention and typically respond with generic cancer chemotherapy recommendations, based on the paucity of evidence on the use of common neuro-oncology chemotherapies and pregnancy. While these remain important gap issues, there are several other poorly researched issues in the Neuro-Oncology of Women (N.O.W.) including recommendations around endogenous and iatrogenic hormone exposure and female sexuality in cancer. As a significant percentage of cancers are hormone-dependent, it is important to understand how changes in hormone levels impact tumor biology over the course of a woman's lifespan. Furthermore, greater attention should be given to the impact of tumors and tumor treatments on female sexuality. This article is intended to serve as an introduction to these two specific subjects within the vast expanse of N.O.W. subject matter.",Current oncology reports,2021-Aug,"Gatson NTN, Boccia ML, Taylor KR, Mack JKO, Fonkem E",5,1179,oncology,2025-11-22

This special article aims to express the next evolution of cancer therapy, while also considering the challenges and uncertainties facing future directions. The recent achievements of medical science in the oncology field concern both new diagnostic techniques, such as liquid biopsy, and therapeutic strategies with innovative anticancer drugs. Although several molecular characteristics of tumors are linked to the tissue of origin, some mutations are shared by multiple tumor histologies, thus paving the way for what is called 'precision oncology.' The article highlights the importance of identifying new mutations and biomolecular pathways that can be pursued with new anticancer drugs. Oncology and medical science have made great progress in understanding new molecular targets; being able to early identify tumor markers that are not confined to a single organ through minimally invasive diagnostic techniques allows us to design new effective therapeutic strategies.

32023125,Radiation Oncology Workforce in Colombia.,"Colombia is experiencing an epidemiologic transition, with an increasing incidence of cancerous neoplasms prevalent in high-income countries, while infection-associated tumors remain highly prevalent. According to international standards, Colombia has a deficit of radiotherapy machines (a shortage of about 47 machines) and radiation oncology specialists (a shortage of about 19 to 149 specialists based on number of centers and incident cases, respectively) to meet the national demand, which may induce an inappropriate dynamic in radiation oncology services. Estimates based on cancer incidence trends and the rate of new specialists in radiation oncology expected to graduate per year suggest that the current deficit will remain unchanged or may even increase during the next decades. The situation is critical because of the existence of a single training program in the country for a population of 45 million inhabitants and the low availability of educational programs offered in the Latin American region to cover the national demand. A comprehensive analysis of radiotherapy services should include data on medical physicists, radiotherapists, and the oncology nursing workforce; however, we found no reliable information available.

However, there are still gaps between knowledge and practice for older adults with cancer. Here we provide a detailed methodology of geriatric oncology care delivery within a single institution. The Cancer and Aging Resiliency (CARE) clinic is a multidisciplinary approach for implementing geriatric-driven health care for older adults with cancer. The CARE clinic was developed as a direct response to recommendations targeting key multifactorial geriatric health conditions (e.g. falls, nutritional deficits, sensory loss, cognitive impairment, frailty, multiple chronic conditions, and functional status). The multidisciplinary team assesses and delivers a comprehensive set of recommendations, all in one clinic visit, to minimize burden on the patient and the caregiver. The CARE clinic consultative model is a novel approach integrating cancer subspecialties with geriatric oncology healthcare delivery. Older adults with cancer have unique needs that are independent of routine oncology care.

Thematic semi-structured interviews of 10 oncology nurses working in a single university hospital were conducted. The data were analysed using content analysis. Oncology nurses thought that peer support promotes the psychosocial wellbeing of patients with cancer by increasing their social contact and strengthening their emotional resources. In their daily work, oncology nurses engaged in several activities that promote the interactions between patients with cancer and informal forms of peer support. However, directing patients with cancer to formal peer support services outside specialised health care was not an established practice. Oncology nurses expressed several concerns about the availability of support and the coping ability of peer supporters and expressed scepticism about the reliability of information shared in peer support groups. The awareness of oncology nurses regarding formal peer support services appears rather limited. This knowledge gap should be reduced, such as through closer collaboration between hospitals and third sector cancer organisations, which does not appear effective at present based on the results. In addition, patients with cancer should be systematically informed about peer support.",European journal of oncology nursing : the official journal of European Oncology Nursing Society,2021-Apr,"Kallio R, Jones M, Pietilä I, Harju E",4,1375,oncology,2025-11-22

Psychological literature has shown that receiving an oncological diagnosis can cause significant psychological stress and discomfort. However, the experiences of young patients and their caregivers as they confront this challenge are not yet fully understood. This paper adopts a qualitative methodological approach to explore how young patients with an oncological diagnosis and their parents make sense of the experiential challenges they face. Thus, the research realized 18 semi-structured interviews, 11 of which were with pediatric and adolescent oncology patients, and 7 of which were with 6 mothers and 1 father. The qualitative thematic analysis revealed that the oncological diagnosis triggers different emotions taking the scene in the attempt to cope with the threats of meaning that the diagnosis poses. However, such intense experience promotes transformative feelings in parents and young patients, leading to important personal growth. Lastly, this article discusses the need to improve palliative psychological care competences in pediatric oncology. By providing comprehensive psychological care to young oncology patients and their families, healthcare providers can mitigate the psychological stress and pain associated with the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2023-Jul,"Testoni I, Nicoletti AE, Moscato M, De Vincenzo C",4,1392,oncology,2025-11-22

An online survey assessing respondent demographics, baseline knowledge and training in pharmacogenomics, comfort level with pharmacogenomic data, and challenges of implementing clinical pharmacogenomic platforms was distributed to professional colleagues and over national oncology pharmacy listservs. Pharmacists were grouped based on their comfort level with pharmacogenomic data. Results were analyzed utilizing Pearson chi-square test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. A total of 84 participants from 58 cancer centers participated in the survey. Most participants were post-graduate year 2 trained and a majority reported being comfortable assessing oncology pharmacogenomic data. Respondents indicated that pharmacogenomics reported within the electronic medical record was the most common institutional process to support pharmacogenomics for oncology patients. Despite this, poor visibility of pharmacogenomics within the electronic medical record was the most challenging aspect of implementing a pharmacogenomic program. Additional challenges included lack of resources for pharmacogenomic programs, insurance denials for pharmacogenomic-driven testing and medication, and prolonged turnaround time of pharmacogenetic results. Length of practice, post-graduate year 2 residency training, institutions with pharmacist involvement on hematology/oncology molecular tumor board, and institutions where a pharmacist helped create local pharmacogenomic policies were significantly associated with respondents' comfortability in assessing pharmacogenomics.

The residual tumour classification scheme, where a complete histologic excision is defined as a histologic tumour-free margin >0 mm, has been used for >40 years in human oncology by all of the major clinical staging organizations and is considered highly prognostic for the vast majority of malignant tumours in people. Because of the widespread use of the residual tumour classification scheme both clinically and in research studies, this standardized approach permits better communication between clinicians, an evidence-based decision-making process for adjuvant treatment options following surgical resection, minimizes exposing patients to unnecessary adjuvant treatments and a better ability to compare local tumour control for specific tumours between different studies.

35829692,Global Challenges in Access to and Implementation of Precision Oncology: The Health Care Manager and Health Economist Perspective.,"Precision medicine changes the landscape of oncology practices by offering the opportunity to optimize care through a more targeted, personalized approach of managing cancer treatments. However, precision oncology is costly and does not benefit all patients with cancer, making it critically important to consider the tradeoff between costs and health benefits. Here, we discuss the global challenges in implementing precision oncology from the perspective of health care management and health economics and emphasize the different challenges for high-income compared with low- and middle-income countries. For health care managers making resource allocation decisions, the decision to adopt, implement, and finance precision oncology must consider opportunity costs, and the allocation must be proportional to the system's capacity. The standard approach of health technology assessment is inadequate because it fails to consider the capacity to pay. From an economic perspective, global implementation of precision oncology must confront the issues of accessibility, affordability, and system readiness. Low- and middle-income countries often have no or delayed access to novel targeted-therapy agents, find these drugs cost-prohibitive, and struggle to build the infrastructure with sufficient workforce and adequate testing and computing facilities to capitalize the benefit of precision oncology. Although high-income countries are better equipped to implement precision oncology, the challenges there lie in implementing strategies to maximize the value of precision oncology through promoting appropriate use while limiting inappropriate applications. The recent rollout of COVID-19 vaccines internationally highlights the importance of information uncertainty and offers valuable insights on global access to and implementation of precision oncology.",American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

39358740,Nurses' perceptions of compassionate care in pediatric oncology: a qualitative interview study.,"Compassion is a crucial aspect in the management of pediatric oncology patients as it has the potential to enhance nurse satisfaction levels, thereby further enhancing the quality and safety of the care they deliver. This study aimed to investigate nurses' understanding and experience of compassionate care when working in pediatric oncology departments. This research utilized a qualitative descriptive design. Content analysis was used to make sense of data collected via individual and semi-structured interviews conducted with nurses (n = 32) working in pediatric oncology departments. Nurses' understanding of compassionate care for children with cancer was organized into two categories: Humanistic compassionate care and compassionate end-of-life care. The humanistic compassionate care category comprised of three subcategories: (1) empathy, (2) altruism, and (3) respect for the cultural values and beliefs of the family. The compassionate end-of-life care category comprised of two subcategories: (1) facilitating parents' presence at the child's bedside and (2) creating suitable conditions for accepting the death of a child. Compassionate care for children with cancer is marked by a strong emphasis on humanistic, cultural, and end-of-life considerations. Our findings further emphasize the paramount importance of taking families' presence, wishes and beliefs into consideration within this context.",BMC health services research,2024-Oct,"Ghaljeh M, Mardani-Hamooleh M, Pezaro S",3,1415,oncology,2025-11-22

This leaves patients at risk of developmental diagnoses and referrals being delayed. Clarify the current developmental surveillance and screening practices of one pediatric oncology team. Researchers reviewed charts for patients (n = 66) seen at a pediatric oncology clinic in a suburban academic medical center to determine engagement in developmental screening (including functioning around related areas such as speech, neurocognition, etc.) and referrals for care in these areas. Developmental histories were collected from all patients through admission history and physical examination (H&P), but there was no routinized follow-up. Physicians did not conduct regular developmental screening per American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for any patients but identified n = 3 patients with needs while the psychology team routinely surveilled all patients seen during this time (n = 41) and identified n = 18 patients as having delays. Physicians did not routinely screen for development needs beyond H&P and were inconsistent in developmental follow-up/referrals. Integrated psychologists were key in generating referrals for developmental-based care. However, many oncology patients were not seen by psychologists quickly or at all, creating a significant gap in care during a crucial developmental period. The case is made for further routinization of ongoing developmental screening in pediatric oncology care.",Psycho-oncology,2024-May,"Pereira LM, Bono MH, Hilbert S",3,1597,oncology,2025-11-22

32317029,Recent advances of PET imaging in clinical radiation oncology.,"Radiotherapy and radiation oncology play a key role in the clinical management of patients suffering from oncological diseases. In clinical routine, anatomic imaging such as contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are widely available and are usually used to improve the target volume delineation for subsequent radiotherapy. Moreover, these modalities are also used for treatment monitoring after radiotherapy. However, some diagnostic questions cannot be sufficiently addressed by the mere use standard morphological imaging. Therefore, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging gains increasing clinical significance in the management of oncological patients undergoing radiotherapy, as PET allows the visualization and quantification of tumoral features on a molecular level beyond the mere morphological extent shown by conventional imaging, such as tumor metabolism or receptor expression. The tumor metabolism or receptor expression information derived from PET can be used as tool for visualization of tumor extent, for assessing response during and after therapy, for prediction of patterns of failure and for definition of the volume in need of dose-escalation. This review focuses on recent and current advances of PET imaging within the field of clinical radiotherapy / radiation oncology in several oncological entities (neuro-oncology, head & neck cancer, lung cancer, gastrointestinal tumors and prostate cancer) with particular emphasis on radiotherapy planning, response assessment after radiotherapy and prognostication.","Radiation oncology (London, England)",2020-Apr,"Unterrainer M, Eze C, Ilhan H, Marschner S, Roengvoraphoj O, Schmidt-Hegemann NS, Walter F, Kunz WG, Rosenschöld PMA, Jeraj R, Albert NL, Grosu AL, Niyazi M, Bartenstein P, Belka C",15,1528,oncology,2025-11-22
31812754,Evolution and Clinical Impact of EGFR Mutations in Circulating Free DNA in the BELIEF Trial.,"Longitudinal evaluation of mutations in blood samples was a prespecified secondary objective in the BELIEF trial of erlotinib and bevacizumab in advanced EGFR-positive NSCLC. Here, we report the testing results and explore the correlation of EGFR status in blood with clinical outcomes. Blood samples were prospectively collected from patients at baseline, at response evaluation, and at progression and sent to a central laboratory. Circulating free DNA was purified and EGFR mutations were analyzed with a validated real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. EGFR exon 19/21 mutations were detected in 55 of 91 baseline blood samples (60.4%) and correlated with a significantly worse progression-free survival: 11.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.0-14.8 mo) for the patients who were positive versus 22.9 months (95% CI: 9.5-33.9 mo) for those who were negative (log-rank p = 0.0020). Among the 74 samples at response, exon 19/21 mutations were detected only in three samples (4.1%). In contrast, 29 of 58 patients (50.0%) were exon 19/21 positive at progression and showed a significantly worse median overall survival of 21.7 months (95% CI: 17.0-30.9 mo) compared with 37.4 months (95% CI: 22.6-53.1 mo) for those who were negative (log-rank p = 0.011). Blood samples at the three time points were available for 48 patients. Of those, among 14 exon 19/21 EGFR-negative at presentation, 13 (93%) were persistently negative for the sensitizing mutations after progression and the p.T790M could only be detected in the blood of two patients. Longitudinal testing of EGFR mutations in blood can offer valuable clinical information. In patients of the BELIEF study, detection of EGFR mutations in circulating free DNA at presentation was associated with shorter progression-free survival, whereas positivity at progression correlated with shorter overall survival. Finally, patients negative in blood at presentation were almost invariably negative at relapse.",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,2020-Mar,"Molina-Vila MA, Stahel RA, Dafni U, Jordana-Ariza N, Balada-Bel A, Garzón-Ibáñez M, García-Peláez B, Mayo-de-Las-Casas C, Felip E, Curioni Fontecedro A, Gautschi O, Peters S, Massutí B, Palmero R, Ponce Aix S, Carcereny E, Früh M, Pless M, Popat S, Cuffe S, Bidoli P, Kammler R, Roschitzki-Voser H, Tsourti Z, Karachaliou N, Rosell R",26,1982,oncology,2025-11-22

Data sharing in precision oncology is therefore of utmost importance. The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) Data Principles have been developed to define good practices in data sharing. Motivated by the ambition of applying the FAIR Data Principles to our own clinical precision oncology implementations and research, we have performed a systematic literature review of potentially relevant initiatives. For clinical data, we suggest using the Genomic Data Commons model as a reference as it provides a field-tested and well-documented solution. Regarding classification of diagnosis, morphology and topography and drugs, we chose to follow the World Health Organization standards, i.e. ICD10, ICD-O-3 and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classifications, respectively. For the bioinformatics pipeline, the Genome Analysis ToolKit Best Practices using Docker containers offer a coherent solution and have therefore been selected.

AYAs with cancer possess several risk factors for eating disorders that may place them at an even higher risk. Since these patients see their oncology team frequently, oncology clinics are opportune settings for eating disorder screening. Here, we describe a study to implement screening for eating disorders in AYA patients in an oncology clinic. During regularly scheduled oncology visits, eligible patients were given the SCOFF questionnaire. A total of 163 eligible patients filled out the SCOFF questionnaire with 11 positive results (6.75%).

Insufficient evidence of cost-effectiveness impedes the integration of NGS into routine cancer care. The complexity of personalized treatment challenges conventional economic evaluation. Clearly delineating challenges informs future cost-effectiveness analyses to better value and contextualize health, preference-, and equity-based outcomes. We conducted a scoping review to characterize the applied methods and outcomes of economic evaluations of NGS in oncology and identify existing challenges. We included 27 articles published since 2016 from a search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Identified challenges included defining the evaluative scope, managing evidentiary limitations including lack of causal evidence, incorporating preference-based utility, and assessing distributional and equity-based impacts. These challenges reflect the difficulty of generating high-quality clinical effectiveness and real-world evidence (RWE) for NGS-guided interventions. Adapting methodological approaches and developing life-cycle health technology assessment (HTA) guidance using RWE is crucial for implementing NGS in oncology.

Taking a patient's whole picture into perspective is crucial in deciding the appropriate management strategy. The management of BM requires an interdisciplinary approach that frequently includes oncology, neurosurgery, radiation oncology and palliative care. Treatment includes both direct targeted therapies to the lesion(s) as well as management of the neurologic side effects caused by mass effect. There is limited evidence of when screening for BM in the gynecology oncology patient is warranted but it is recommended that any cancer patient with new focal neurologic deficit or increasing headaches should be evaluated. The primary imaging modality for detection of BM is MRI, but other imaging modalities such as CT and PET scan can be used for certain scenarios. New advances in radiation techniques, improved imaging modalities, and systemic therapies are helping to discover BM earlier and provide treatments with less detrimental side effects.",Current treatment options in oncology,2022-Nov,"Akapo A, Anishchenko K, Lefkowits C, Greenwood AL",4,1250,oncology,2025-11-22

This report was developed as a part of the World Health Organization (WHO) Rehabilitation 2030 initiative to identify rehabilitation-specific recommendations in guidelines for oncology care. A systematic review of guidelines was conducted. Only guidelines published in English, for adults with cancer, providing recommendations for rehabilitation referral and assessment or interventions between 2009 and 2019 were included. 13840 articles were identified. After duplicates and applied filters, 4897 articles were screened. 69 guidelines were identified with rehabilitation-specific recommendations. Thirty-seven of the 69 guidelines endorsed referral to rehabilitation services but provided no specific recommendations regarding assessment or interventions. Thirty-two of the 69 guidelines met the full inclusion criteria and were assessed using the AGREE II tool. Twenty-one of these guidelines achieved an AGREE II quality score of ≥ 45 and were fully extracted. Guidelines exclusive to pharmacologic interventions and complementary and alternative interventions were excluded. Findings identify guidelines that recommend rehabilitation services across many cancer types and for various consequences of cancer treatment signifying that rehabilitation is a recognized component of oncology care. However, these findings are at odds with clinical reports of low rehabilitation utilization rates suggesting that guideline recommendations may be overlooked.

Oncologists were physicians self-identified as providing oncologic care to patients. Oncology pharmacists were pharmacists with an oncology subspecialty. We calculated the geographic density of physician and pharmacist oncology workforce and used county-level cancer crude rates to quantify the demand for oncology workforce. We used spatial data to plot the density of oncology workforces relative to county-level cancer rates and compared the county-level density of oncologists and oncology pharmacists. Of the 30,553 members of the oncology workforce in 2019, 28,681 were oncologists and 1,090 were oncology pharmacists. The mean county-level density of oncologists was 2.94 (SD = 7.32) per 100,000 persons. Sixty-four percent of counties had no oncologists with primary practice location in that county and 12% had no oncologists in the local and adjacent counties. Counties in the top quartile of cancer rates had the highest percentage without any oncologists with primary practice location in the county (75%) and with no oncologists in the local as well as adjacent counties (16%). Geographically mismatched demand and supply characterized the current oncology workforce.

Amongst all the malignancies, gynaecological cancer still continues to have a high incidence and prevalence leading to significant morbidity and mortality. While a multipronged strategy of decreasing the gynaecological cancer burden is a global priority, one of the key strategies to decrease the morbidity and mortality is to train gynaecological oncology specialists. Most of the developed nations have an established gynaecologic oncology training programme in the form of a well-designed curriculum and skill training. However, in developing countries where the actual disease burden of these cancers is highest, such focused training programmes have only started emerging and evolving over the past two decades. While it is a positive step to initiate such training programmes in a country like India, there are still gaps in the uniformity of curriculum and training.

35349050,Cardio-Oncology Care Delivered in the Non-academic Environment.,"It is a fact that the field of Cardio-Oncology is growing rapidly throughout the USA and abroad. Cancer and heart disease continue to be the leading causes of death in the USA, and oncologic therapies are evolving to the point that cancer survivors are increasing yearly, some living long enough to develop cardiovascular disease, and others living with sequelae from their cancer therapy. The financial burdens to the healthcare system continue to present barriers for the delivery of healthcare, especially for patients with heart disease and cancer as chronic diseases. Collaboration between cardiologists and oncologists is paramount to ensure timely cancer care while minimizing cardiotoxicity. The field of Cardio-Oncology is the perfect model for the current management of these patients, positioned to break down silos, avoid delays in cancer care, and treating potential short- and long-term sequela of cancer therapy in a cost-efficient manner. While cardio-oncology programs initially sprang from the academic and defined cancer centers, it is rapidly growing in the nonacademic settings. This paper explores reasons that occurred and explores some of the unique aspects to cancer care and cardio-oncology delivery in the nonacademic setting. The ultimate goal is to achieve the best cancer care with the least degree of disruption to therapy that also minimizes cardiotoxicity, lowering costs, and improving outcomes for patients.",Current treatment options in oncology,2022-May,"Arnold AM, Skurka K",2,1442,oncology,2025-11-22

34407223,Integrative surgical oncology: A model of acute integrative oncology.,"Integrative oncology has emerged as a recognized medical subspecialty because of growing interest in the use of integrative medicine in modern cancer care on behalf of both patients and providers. Acutherapy and mind-body techniques, such as meditation and yoga, have been shown to aid in symptom control and improve quality of life in oncologic patient populations, and the Society of Integrative Oncology and American Society of Clinical Oncology have recently endorsed a set of guidelines for the implementation of these techniques specifically in patients with breast cancer. Although the current guidelines focus largely on the management of chronic symptoms, there exists evidence to support the use of these techniques in acute symptom management as well. With surgical resection representing the backbone of many cancer treatment regimens, symptoms that arise during the perioperative period are prime examples of the acute symptomatology common among patients with cancer. Here, the authors provide a detailed literature review of the current evidence supporting the use of integrative techniques during the perioperative period and demonstrate their applicability for acute symptom management within oncologic and surgical populations.

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic forced additional resource restriction and diversion, further impacting care delivery. Our intention is to analyze the impact COVID-19 on a provincial medical oncology workload and bring attention to the limitations of the current workload metric for oncologists. (2) Methods: All medical oncology patient encounters were extracted and compared, collected by year and encounter type, from April 2014 through March 2022. (3) Results: There was an increase in all patient encounters by an average of 9.5% per year, including during the strictest COVID-19 restrictions. There was an increase in virtual care encounters from 37.9% to 52.1%. (4) Conclusions: Medical Oncology workloads have increased over time and estimates suggest growing demand. Little data exist to inform workforce requirements and actual workload is not captured by the current metric. Though volume of new consults continues to increase, COVID-19 has highlighted additional changes in the delivery of care, likely with lasting impact, little of which are included in the current workload metric.","Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.)",2023-Mar,"Sheridan M, Colwell B, Lamond NWD, Macfarlane R, Rayson D, Snow S, Wood LA, Ramjeesingh R",8,1250,oncology,2025-11-22

Multiple triage systems for nonemergent surgical procedures have been published, but potentially curative cancer procedures are essential surgery rather than elective surgery. In the present and future scenario of our country, thoracic oncology teams may have the difficult decision of weighing the utility of surgical intervention against the risk for inadvertent COVID-19 exposure for patients and medical staff. In consequence, traditional pathways of surgical care must be adjusted to reduce the risk of infection and the use of resources. It is recommended that all thoracic cancer patients should be offered treatment according to the accepted standard of care until shortage of services require a progressive reduction in surgical cases. Here, we present a consensus of recommendations discussed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts on thoracic oncology and based on the best available evidence, and hope it will provide a modifiable framework of guidance for local strategy planners in thoracic cancer care services in Mexico.

This survey was conducted within the International Psycho-Oncology Society Federation of psycho-oncology societies and included representatives of each national federated society and some countries not belonging to the Federation. Survey questions were emailed requesting specific details, from the registered contact person, for each country, about psycho-oncology training, professional registration and accreditation. Of 43 countries contacted (34 Federated and 9 non-federated members), 39 replied and answered the questionnaire (90, 7%). Disparities were reported between countries, with details indicating differences from having no national program, to quite detailed and legally accredited requirements. The majority of countries had no formally recognized profession of ""Psycho-oncologist,"" while some countries reported that it is mandatory (or recommended to have) a specialist in psycho-oncology in cancer centers and, thus, that an accredited, nationally recognized and certified training in this specialty exists. The study underlines the need to create a curriculum for the specialty (certification and accreditation) for the profession of psycho-oncology.

Both share common risk factors (diabetes, obesity, hypertension, diet, smoking, etc.). The associated timing of CVD and cancer onset is thus largely influenced by modifiable risk factors. Advances in cancer treatment have extended the lives of patients with cancer, but for some at the cost of adverse cardiovascular events. The rapidly growing number of patients surviving cancer, often in the setting of advanced age, new or pre-existing CV disease and risk factors, the management of these patients has become the concern of experts in cardio-oncology. The goal of cardio-oncology is to provide optimal care for patients with cancer and/or at risk of cardiovascular disease.

To better understand the challenges to neurosurgical oncology care in low-resource settings, the authors collected data on national neurosurgical capacity and hospital diagnostic and treatment capacity across 7 national referral hospitals in 7 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In April 2023, a 42-item self-administered questionnaire was distributed to partner neurosurgeons at the 7 centers via REDCap to provide country- and hospital-level capacity data on neurosurgical oncology care. Neurosurgical and neurosurgical oncology care were reported to be available in a limited number of provinces, states, regions, and counties in 6 of the 7 countries. The general neurosurgical workforce density across the 7 countries ranged from 0.03 to 0.67 per 100,000 persons, and that of the pediatric neurosurgical workforce ranged from 0 to 0.05 per 100,000 persons. Two centers had no pediatric ICUs, and the remaining 5 centers had pediatric ICUs with bed capacities between 1 and 8. One hospital had neither a CT nor an MRI scanner available and relied solely on private diagnostic facilities for neuroimaging. Histopathology services were largely limited to basic histopathology staining only; molecular subtyping was available at a single center. Three hospitals offered pediatric anesthesia expertise. None of the hospitals offered subspecialty neuro-oncology care or had a pediatric neuro-oncologist. None of the 7 hospitals had formal neurocritical care, neuroradiology, or neuropathology expertise. Neither adjuvant chemotherapy nor radiotherapy was available at 3 centers. Rehabilitation was largely limited to basic physical and occupational therapy at all 7 centers. Although all 7 countries had a multiple health payer system, the payment structure differed across the 7 hospitals for different neurosurgical oncology services, with patients making out-of-pocket payments for all services in some cases.

This overview outlines the case for establishing cardio-oncology services and defines the ways in which these services benefit cancer patients. The primary objective of cardio-oncology is to manage CVDs in order to allow cancer patients to complete the best cancer treatments safely and with minimal interruption. In the decades since the first discovery of heart failure induced by anthracycline chemotherapy, both cardiovascular and oncological science have advanced considerably. Cardio-oncology services aim to bring together expertise from these two fast moving fields in order to provide optimal evidence-based care for cancer patients with CVDs. Here we discuss the basis of cardio-oncology services by presenting their rationale and key components, as well as their essential roles in education, training and research. At each stage of the cancer care pathway, a cardio-oncology service can add value by ensuring cancer patients have timely access to specialist care backed up by cutting edge diagnostic tools and treatment options, as well as holistic supports. We highlight areas of recent and upcoming developments in the field that are likely to change established clinical practice. Improved cardiac imaging modalities can detect chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction earlier and are also essential for the prompt diagnosis of an expanding range of cardiovascular effects complicating newer cancer therapeutics, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and other targeted therapies. Modern cancer therapy has dramatically improved cancer survival and as such CVD is becoming one of the principal determinants of overall outcome for cancer patients. A dedicated cardio-oncology service can facilitate the optimisation of cardiovascular treatment and enable the completion of cancer therapy. A multidisciplinary collaborative approach is key to achieving these objectives.",Clinical oncology (Royal College of Radiologists (Great Britain)),2021-Aug,"Andres MS, Pan J, Lyon AR",3,2076,oncology,2025-11-22

36681205,Optimizing benefit/risk in oncology: Review of post-marketing dose optimization and reflections on the road ahead.,"Oncology therapies shifted from chemotherapy to molecularly targeted agents and finally to the era of immune-oncology agents. In contrast to cytotoxic agents, molecularly targeted agents are more selective, exhibit a wider therapeutic window, and may maximally modulate tumor growth at doses lower than the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). However, first-in-patient oncology studies for molecularly targeted agents continued to evaluate escalating doses using limited number of patients per dose cohort assessing dose-limiting toxicities to identify the MTD which is commonly selected for further development adopting a 'more is better' approach that led to several post-marketing requirement (PMR) studies to evaluate alternative, typically lower, doses or dosing frequencies to optimize the benefit-risk profile. In this review, post-marketing dose optimization efforts were reviewed including those required by a regulatory pathway or voluntarily conducted by the sponsor to improve efficacy, safety, or method of administration. Lessons learned and future implications from this deep dive review are discussed considering the evolving regulatory landscape on dose optimization for oncology compounds.",Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,2023-Feb,"Soltantabar P, Lon HK, Parivar K, Wang DD, Elmeliegy M",5,1201,oncology,2025-11-22

It is not surprising that neoplasms, in various forms, develop in numerous species of animals and even in plants. Unmistakable accounts of cancer with clinical features as are understood today begin in the 5th c. B.C. The principles and practice of the Hippocratic and Galenic tradition dominated cancer care virtually into the 20th century.

As the field of precision oncology expands, it is critical for pharmacy students to understand how genetic information informs cancer treatment decisions. However, to effectively teach students about pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics, faculty require relevant educational resources, including those that support higher-order learning. In this Commentary, we demonstrate the potential utility of publicly accessible cancer genomics databases as teaching resources for pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics in oncology pharmacy education. Using clinical data retrieved from a genomics database, we illustrate how case studies can be developed to target core competencies, including understanding tumor genomics profiling, somatic mutations and pharmacotherapy selection, and clinical pharmacogenetics testing.

However, it is accompanied by substantial uncertainties, shortages and unexplored sections. The lack of globally established definitions, principles, and guidelines in this field has adversely impacted the quality of end-of-life experiences for children with hospice needs worldwide. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive review of scientific literature, extracting and compiling the available but sparse data on pediatric oncology hospice from the PubMed database. Our systematic approach led to development of a well-organized structure introducing the foundational elements, highlighting complications, and uncovering hidden gaps in this critical area. This structured framework comprises nine major categories including general ideology, population specifications, role of parents and family, psychosocial issues, financial complications, service locations, involved specialties, regulations, and quality improvement.

This survey was conducted to explore the educational needs of International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners members for the purpose of developing resources to support future learning relevant to the diverse global pharmacy practitioner membership of our society. A cross-sectional survey of International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners membership was conducted between 10 December 2018 and 15 January 2019. The survey contained 17 questions and consisted of four sections: (1) respondents' demographics, (2) common challenges/barriers faced by members in accessing oncology pharmacy education, (3) areas within oncology pharmacy where members need education and (4) preferred methods of education delivery. Descriptive statistics were utilized to summarize survey results. The survey was completed by 62 out of 363 International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners members (17% response rate). Respondents were from 19 different countries, representing all the habitable continents. Most respondents were practicing in North America (21%), Oceania (21%) and Asia (16%). The majority of respondents worked in inpatient cancer units (60%), ambulatory tertiary cancer centres (31%) and academia (26%). Reported barriers to accessing education relevant to oncology pharmacy practice included lack of financial support (44%), time spent travelling to attend educational activities (39%), limited learning opportunities in their country of practice (34%) and limited growth of the oncology pharmacy discipline in their country of practice (32%). The content areas of greatest demand included pharmacotherapy of various cancers followed by oncology pharmacy research, International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners oncology pharmacy practice standards, supportive care and medication safety. Among educational activities offered by International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners, respondents valued annual International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners symposia and Journal of Oncology Pharmacy Practice the most. Most respondents (87%) indicated webinars as an effective educational tool. Among an international oncology pharmacist cohort, we identified practice areas prioritized by pharmacists for continuing and professional development. Time and cost were common barriers to education, both in developing and developed countries.

Commissioned by the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (SEOM), in this review, we sought to distill the most recent evidence on this topic, focusing on the mechanisms that underpin the effects of PA on cancer, the role of PA in cancer prevention and in the prognosis of cancer and practical recommendations for clinicians regarding PA counseling. Despite the available information, the introduction of exercise programs into the global management of cancer patients remains a challenge with several areas of uncertainty. Among others, the most effective behavioral interventions to achieve long-term changes in a patient's lifestyle and the optimal intensity and duration of PA should be defined with more precision in future studies.",Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,2020-Oct,"Pollán M, Casla-Barrio S, Alfaro J, Esteban C, Segui-Palmer MA, Lucia A, Martín M",7,989,oncology,2025-11-22
39659048,Associations Between Oncology Outreach and Patient-Sharing Measures of Care Coordination.,"Oncology outreach is a common strategy for addressing cancer workforce shortages, where traveling oncologists commute across clinical settings to extend their services. Despite its known benefits specifically for rural patients, oncology outreach reallocates physician resources to satellite clinics and may negatively impact the coordination of cancer care. In this retrospective study, we identified patients with incident breast, colorectal, and lung cancers from 2016-2019 nationwide Medicare claims and linked them to oncologists using Part B. We considered encounters occurring outside the physician's primary hospital service area as ""outreach visits"" and calculated the proportion of outreach visits by oncology specialty for contiguous US hospital referral regions (HRRs) using 2016-2017 claims. We constructed a nationwide physician patient-sharing network from 2018-2019 claims and computed median care density-a measure of physician team familiarity-and local transitivity-a measure of physician cohesion/clustering-for each HRR as proxies for care coordination. Generalized linear models were used to explore the associations between oncology outreach and care coordination measures at the HRR level. We found that HRRs with high medical oncology outreach were associated with 16% decreases in care density (95% CI: 5-25) and 4% decreases in local transitivity (95% CI: 1-8) compared to HRRs with low medical oncology outreach. HRRs with high radiation and surgical oncology outreach were not associated with network-based measures of care coordination. While medical oncology outreach increases access for underserved patient populations, it potentially fragments care delivery across clinical settings. Health systems may consider this trade-off to inform decisions concerning the implementation of outreach programs or policies aimed at hedging against fragmentation in markets with active outreach arrangements.",Cancer medicine,2024-Dec,"Scodari BT, Schaefer AP, Kapadia NS, O'Malley AJ, Moen EL",5,1928,oncology,2025-11-22

32557598,Artificial Intelligence and Mechanistic Modeling for Clinical Decision Making in Oncology.,"The amount of ""big"" data generated in clinical oncology, whether from molecular, imaging, pharmacological, or biological origin, brings novel challenges. To mine efficiently this source of information, mathematical models able to produce predictive algorithms and simulations are required, with applications for diagnosis, prognosis, drug development, or prediction of the response to therapy. Such mathematical and computational constructs can be subdivided into two broad classes: biologically agnostic, statistical models using artificial intelligence techniques, and physiologically based, mechanistic models. In this review, recent advances in the applications of such methods in clinical oncology are outlined. These include machine learning applied to big data (omics, imaging, or electronic health records), pharmacometrics and quantitative systems pharmacology, as well as tumor kinetics and metastasis modeling. Focus is set on studies with high potential of clinical translation, and particular attention is given to cancer immunotherapy.

31412295,RNA sequencing for research and diagnostics in clinical oncology.,"Molecular diagnostics is becoming one of the major drivers of personalized oncology. With hundreds of different approved anticancer drugs and regimens of their administration, selecting the proper treatment for a patient is at least nontrivial task. This is especially sound for the cases of recurrent and metastatic cancers where the standard lines of therapy failed. Recent trials demonstrated that mutation assays have a strong limitation in personalized selection of therapeutics, consequently, most of the drugs cannot be ranked and only a small percentage of patients can benefit from the screening. Other approaches are, therefore, needed to address a problem of finding proper targeted therapies. The analysis of RNA expression (transcriptomic) profiles presents a reasonable solution because transcriptomics stands a few steps closer to tumor phenotype than the genome analysis. Several recent studies pioneered using transcriptomics for practical oncology and showed truly encouraging clinical results. The possibility of directly measuring of expression levels of molecular drugs' targets and profiling activation of the relevant molecular pathways enables personalized prioritizing for all types of molecular-targeted therapies. RNA sequencing is the most robust tool for the high throughput quantitative transcriptomics.

The sample constituted of 140 individuals aged 65 years and older suffering from a recent nonmetastatic cancer (breast, lung, gynecological, or hematological), followed up to 6 years. We used Cox proportional hazards model to assess the effect of SPA at baseline on mortality. It was adjusted for age, gender, educational and cognitive level, oncological information (the site and kind of cancer), number of comorbidities, and physical and mental health at baseline. Patients were aged 73 years at diagnosis and were more often women (85.7%). Individuals with more negative SPA were 3.62 times more likely to die than those with a more positive SPA, with control of gender, age, education and cognitive level, mental and physical health, the category (breast, lung, gynecological, or hematological), and kind (initial or recurrence) of cancer. These findings suggest that SPA influence the mortality of older people in the particular context of oncology.

We built a decision analytical model-a decision tree-to estimate the cost-effectiveness of running a paediatric oncology unit compared with a do-nothing scenario (no paediatric oncology care) from a healthcare provider perspective. We used the recently (2018-2019) conducted costing estimate for running the paediatric oncology unit at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital (TASH) and employed a mixed costing approach (top-down and bottom-up). We used data on health outcomes from other studies in similar settings to estimate the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted of running a paediatric oncology unit compared with a do-nothing scenario over a lifetime horizon. Both costs and effects were discounted (3%) to the present value. The primary outcome was incremental cost in US dollars (USDs) per DALY averted, and we used a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 50% of the Ethiopian gross domestic product per capita (USD 477 in 2019). Uncertainty was tested using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The incremental cost and DALYs averted per child treated in the paediatric oncology unit at TASH were USD 876 and 2.4, respectively, compared with no paediatric oncology care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of running a paediatric oncology unit was USD 361 per DALY averted, and it was cost-effective in 90% of 100 000 Monte Carlo iterations at a USD 477 WTP threshold. The provision of paediatric cancer services using a specialised oncology unit is most likely cost-effective in Ethiopia, at least for easily treatable cancer types in centres with minimal to moderate capability.

38992872,Accuracy of Medical Oncology Prognosis for Metastatic Cancer Patients Evaluated for Enrollment Onto an Ongoing Randomized Clinical Trial.,"For patients with metastatic cancer, a key aspect of interdisciplinary care has involved the overall prognosis provided by Medical Oncology. This study represents prospective evaluation of Medical Oncology prognosis accuracy for patients considered for enrollment onto an ongoing randomized controlled trial. The Spine Patient Optimal Radiosurgery Treatment for Symptomatic Metastatic Neoplasms (SPORTSMEN) phase 2 randomized clinical trial examines optimal radiation therapy treatment of symptomatic spinal metastases with a primary end point of pain freedom at 3 months post-treatment. A key eligibility criterion for trial enrollment is overall prognosis exceeding 3 months, typically provided by Medical Oncology. During the first year of trial enrollment, Medical Oncology prognosis for patients considered for SPORTSMEN inclusion was prospectively assessed for accuracy. Twenty-seven patients with documented Medical Oncology prognosis were considered for SPORTSMEN enrollment. The prognosis administered by Medical Oncology exceeded 3 months in 26 patients, and <3 months in 1 patient. The overall accuracy of Medical Oncology prognosis was correct for 15 of 27 patients (56%), significantly worse for inpatients than outpatients ( P =0.0381). In patients with metastatic spine disease, the estimated prognosis provided by Medical Oncology is often optimistic, as nearly half of patients assigned a prognosis of >3 months failed to reach this threshold before experiencing death or hospice. These findings indicate that a more heuristic approach to assessing patient prognosis may be necessary to avoid unwarranted prognostic optimism, particularly for inpatients. Such an approach could potentially provide a more compassionate and cost-effective management of these patients' remaining lifespan thereby optimizing quality of life.",American journal of clinical oncology,2024-Oct,McClelland S,1,1839,oncology,2025-11-22

The aim of this study was to measure the immediate impact of COVID-19 on surgical oncology practice volume. A retrospective study of patients treated at an NCI-Comprehensive Cancer Center was performed. ""Pre-COVID"" era was defined as January-February 2020 and ""COVID"" as March-April 2020. Primary outcomes were clinic visits and operative volume by surgical oncology subspecialty. Abouyt 907 new patient visits, 3897 follow-up visits, and 644 operations occurred during the study period. All subspecialties experienced significant decreases in new patient visits during COVID, though soft tissue oncology (Mel/Sarc), gynecologic oncology (Gyn/Onc), and endocrine were disproportionately affected. Telehealth visits increased to 11.4% of all visits by April. Mel/Sarc, Gyn/Onc, and Breast experienced significant operative volume decreases during COVID (25.8%, p = 0.012, 43.6% p < 0.001, and 41.9%, p < 0.001, respectively), while endocrine had no change and gastrointestinal oncology had a slight increase (p = 0.823) in the number of cases performed. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are wide-ranging within surgical oncology subspecialties. The addition of telehealth is a viable avenue for cancer patient care and should be considered in surgical oncology practice.",Journal of surgical oncology,2021-Jul,"Gazivoda V, Greenbaum A, Roshal J, Lee J, Reddy L, Rehman S, Kangas-Dick A, Gregory S, Kowzun M, Stephenson R, Laird A, Alexander HR, Berger AC",13,1391,oncology,2025-11-22

Our study aims to determine the real-world impact of routine incorporation of molecular testing among the Turkish Oncology community across all types of cancer and identify gaps for the first time. This research was conducted in Turkey among medical oncologists from different backgrounds. The survey attendance was entirely voluntary. A questionnaire with twelve items (multiple choice +/- closed-ended) was utilized in this study to assess the effect of molecular tests in real clinical situations. 102 oncologists with various levels of experience participated in this study. Most of the respondents (97%) reported successful implementation of molecular testing. About 10% of the participating oncologists said they preferred genetic tests at the early stages of cancer, compared to the majority who preferred genetic tests at the terminal stage. Molecular tests are often performed in separate locations and 47% of the oncologists were using a targeted panel specific to the type of malignancy. Several informational difficulties must be resolved in order to have early personalized therapy as the standard treatment.

In this unequaled collaboration, dogs have inadvertently but serendipitously been molded into a potent human cancer model. Unlike many common model species, dogs are raised in the same environment as humans and present with spontaneous tumors with human-like comorbidities, immunocompetency, and heterogeneity. In breast, bladder, blood, and several pediatric cancers, in-depth profiling of dog and human tumors has established the benefits of the dog model. In addition to this clinical and molecular similarity, veterinary studies indicate that domestic dogs have relatively high tumor incidence rates. As a result, there are a plethora of data for analysis, the statistical power of which is bolstered by substantial breed-specific variability. As such, dog tumors provide a unique opportunity to interrogate the molecular factors underpinning cancer and facilitate the modeling of new therapeutic targets. This review discusses the emerging field of comparative oncology, how it complements human and rodent cancer studies, and where challenges remain, given the rapid proliferation of genomic resources.

We collected data from January 1<sup>st</sup>-2017 to December 31<sup>th</sup>-2021 at a reference center in Bogotá-Colombia regarding first-time consultations of cross-cutting services (clinical oncology, hematology, palliative care, radiation oncology); specialized multidisciplinary units (breast, prostate, lung, stomach); inpatient and outpatient systemic therapy; radiotherapy; oncology surgery; and bone marrow transplant. A descriptive time series analysis was performed, estimating monthly percent change and endemic channels. Starting the confinement (April 2020), a general decrease in service demand was observed (R: -14.9% to -90.0%), with an additional but lower decrease in August 2020 coinciding with the first pandemic wave (R: -11.3% to -70.0%). Follow-up visits and ambulatory treatment showed no consistent reductions. New patients' consultations for cross-cutting services had a speedy recovery (1 month), but clinical oncology, specialized units, and in-hospital treatment resumed more slowly. Only breast and stomach cancer showed a sustained reduction in early-stage disease. Women and older patients had a more significant reductionin service demand. Conclusion: Despite no changes in service supply, the confinement induced a significant reduction in service demand. Variations by cancer type, service type, and population demographics deserve careful consideration for a suitable response to the emergency. The speedy recovery and the absence of a significant decrease during subsequent waves of the pandemic suggest patient resiliency and a lower impact than expected in middle-income settings in the presence of universal health insurance.","Colombia medica (Cali, Colombia)",2022-,"Zuluaga Patiño M, Luna Benitez MC, Jurado Sanabria N, Soto-Cala B, Solano Vega JC, Sánchez Forero RA, Murillo R",7,1801,oncology,2025-11-22

There are considerable costs and inefficiencies in moving preclinical research into effective cancer therapies for patients. Canine translational models of radiation research can fill an important niche between rodent and human studies, ultimately providing valuable, predictive, translational biological and clinical results for human cancer patients. Companion dogs naturally and spontaneously develop cancers over the course of their lifetime. Many canine tumor types share important similarities to human disease, molecularly and biologically, with a comparable clinical course. Dogs receive state-of-the-art medical care, which can include radiotherapy, experimental therapeutics, and novel technologies, offering an important opportunity for radiobiology and radiation oncology research. Notably, the National Cancer Institute has developed the Comparative Oncology Program to promote this area of increased research interest. In this review, the benefits and limitations of performing translational radiation research in companion dogs will be presented, and current research utilizing the canine model will be highlighted, including studies across research areas focusing on common canine tumor types treated with radiotherapy, comparative normal tissue effects, radiation and immunology research, and alternative radiation therapy approaches involving canine cancer patients.",International journal of radiation biology,2022-,Boss MK,1,1686,oncology,2025-11-22

Thus, ensuring equitable access to clinical trials is a major priority for national cancer organizations. This study aimed to examine clinical trial eligibility criteria that may adversely affect the enrollment of underrepresented groups and assess the availability of demographic information in published gynecologic oncology studies. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for gynecologic oncology studies conducted between 1997 and 2021. Each study's inclusion and exclusion criteria were reviewed to determine whether demographic factors were used for enrollment screening. For published studies, demographic variables that were reported were identified. The expected clinical trial enrollment based on disease incidence and mortality was compared with the observed trial enrollment based on race. There were 1597 gynecologic oncology studies: 883 (55%) from ovarian cancer studies, 336 (21%) from cervical cancer studies, 262 (17%) from uterine cancer studies, and 116 (7%) from multisite gynecologic oncology studies. Of the 581 published studies, 554 (95%) reported age, 363 (63%) reported race, and 171 (29%) reported ethnicities. Cervical cancer studies were most likely to report demographic information, including race (P=.026) and ethnicity (P<.001). During the study period, 189 studies (12%) excluded patients based on the language spoken. Industry-sponsored trials (odds ratio, 0.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.30) and organization-sponsored trials (odds ratio, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.22-0.73) were less likely to exclude patients because of language than investigator-initiated trials. A minority of patients (37%) in cervical cancer trials were of White race, compared with 85% of patients in uterine cancer trials and 82% of patients in ovarian cancer trials. Over the last 3 decades, 1 in 10 gynecologic oncology trials excluded patients because of language. Race and ethnicity were reported in more than half of the available studies.

During and after cancer treatment, nutrition is an important component of supportive care, for patients and their family members. Current scientific data consistently show that poor nutrition can reduce survival and decrease adherence to cancer treatments. Unfortunately, the limited availability of dietitians makes access to individualized nutrition counseling challenging, and many cancer patients still do not receive adequate nutritional support. As a result, one of the main unmet needs of patients and their families through the whole cancer trajectory is accessible and up-to-date evidence-based nutritional counseling that emphasizes basic healthy nutrition. The popularity of complementary and integrative medicine among patients with cancer makes the integrative oncology setting an excellent avenue for providing such support. A suggested simple approach that utilizes World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research and American Cancer Society basic information is described. This approach can be easily incorporated into integrative oncology settings, while reserving the role for the registered dietician to address underweight patients, patients with malnutrition, and patients with more complicated dietary situations.

33456594,Oncology Information System: A Qualitative Study to Identify Cancer Patient Care Workflows.,"Oncology information systems provide solutions for managing the information of cancer patients and enable monitoring of different aspects of cancer patient care. Since the use of oncology information systems enhances the quality of care, improves documentation, optimizes resource allocation, and increases the cost-effectiveness of care services, attention to these systems' performance and their adaptation to workflows seems necessary. The purpose of this study was to identify cancer patient care workflows to design an oncology information system for Iran. This study employed a qualitative design and was conducted in 2019. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 experts to determine their views on identifying workflows for cancer patients' care. The participants were clinical and non-clinical staff at six university hospitals equipped with oncology wards. The method of data analysis was framework analysis. The cancer patient care workflows consisted of two categories, including cancer diagnosis workflows and cancer treatment workflows. Cancer diagnosis workflows fall into three subcategories, i.e., the patient's referral to the clinic, an examination of the patient's condition, and pathology workflows. On the other hand, cancer treatment workflows are divided into various treatments offered to cancer patients and workflows in the chemotherapy and radiotherapy wards. Given the variety of services and the complexity of caring for cancer patients as well as the involvement of various specialists in the process of care, identifying and optimizing workflows in the oncology information system reduces errors, enhances data accuracy, eliminates unnecessary steps, and ultimately improve the service delivery to cancer patients.",Journal of medicine and life,2020-,Yazdanian A,1,1756,oncology,2025-11-22

31915101,Psychiatric and psychosocial implications in cancer care: the agenda of psycho-oncology.,"Because of the increasing global cancer burden and the WHO epidemiological estimation in terms of number of new cases, deaths and long-survivors worldwide, an interdisciplinary approach, including psychiatric and psychoncology care is mandatory in oncology. About 50% of cancer patients have in fact been shown to have psychiatric disorders, including clinically significant emotional distress and/or unrecognised or untreated psychosocial conditions as a consequence of cancer at some point during the cancer trajectory. These problems are associated with the patient's reduction of quality of life, impairment in social relationships, longer rehabilitation time, poor adherence to treatment and abnormal illness behaviour. Because of these reasons, the internationally recognised IPOS Standards of Quality Cancer Care underline that psychosocial cancer care should be recognised as a universal human right; that quality cancer care must integrate the psychosocial domain into routine care and that distress should be measured as the sixth vital sign after temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate and pain. In spite of social inequalities still existing between countries in the organisation and implementation of psychosocial oncology, recommendations and guidelines are available regarding screening, assessment and intervention to psychiatric and psychosocial disorders across the trajectory of cancer.

This prospective, survey-based study catalogued reasons for clinic absenteeism and noted that the most common reason an appointment was missed was the patient being unaware it existed. Next most common reasons were medical conflicts and family obligations. Patients at this clinic would benefit from a clinic navigator to assist with scheduling appointments, remind patients of upcoming appointments, and resolve conflicting medical appointments.",Journal of community health,2021-Apr,"Saleh M, Caron J, Hernandez S, Boyd L",4,912,oncology,2025-11-22

Under this situation, the classic log-rank test may confront high power loss. In this paper, we consider a Z<sub>max</sub> test, which is the maximum of the log-rank test and a Fleming-Harrington test. Simulation studies indicate that the Z<sub>max</sub> test not only controls the Type I error rate but also maintains good power under different delayed effect models. The asymptotic properties of the Z<sub>max</sub> test are also established, which further supports its robustness. We apply the Z<sub>max</sub> test to two data sets reported in recent immuno-oncology clinical trials, in which Z<sub>max</sub> has exhibited remarkable improvement over the conventional log-rank test.",Journal of biopharmaceutical statistics,2020-Mar,"Yang M, Hua Z, Xue L, Hu M",4,777,oncology,2025-11-22

We aimed to evaluate changes in every oncology care pathway essential step, from screening to treatment, during the pandemic. Monthly oncological activity differences between 2019 and 2020 (screening tests, histopathological analyzes, multidisciplinary tumor board meetings (MTBMs), diagnostic announcement procedures (DAPs), and treatments were calculated in two French areas experiencing different pandemic intensity (Reims and Colmar). COVID-19 has had a dramatic impact in terms of screening (-86% to -100%), diagnosis (-39%), and surgical treatment (-30%). This global decrease in all essential oncology care pathway steps contrasted with the relative stability of chemotherapy (-9%) and radiotherapy use (-16%). Outbreak occurred earlier and with more intensity in Colmar but had a comparable impact in both areas regarding MTMBs and DAPs. The current ONCOCARE-COV study is still in progress and with a longer follow-up to analyze postlockdown situation.",The oncologist,2021-Feb,"Brugel M, Carlier C, Essner C, Debreuve-Theresette A, Beck MF, Merrouche Y, Bouché O",7,1046,oncology,2025-11-22
37584279,Quality criteria for pediatric oncology centers: A systematic literature review.,"Survival of children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer improved over the last decades due to better diagnostics, treatment, and supportive care. Quality criteria that measure, compare, and make the quality of care of individual pediatric oncology centers more transparent are heterogeneous and inconsistent. With this systematic review, we aimed to summarize existing quality criteria for pediatric oncology centers in countries with highly developed health-care systems. We searched three databases for publications, and websites for guidelines about quality criteria for pediatric oncology centers in February 2022. We considered all types of publications except expert opinions. We excluded publications not focusing on highly developed health-care systems, addressing the certification of professionals, or focusing on subspecialties (e.g., pediatric neuro-oncology). We discarded quality criteria if they were too specific (e.g., for a specific treatment center), too broad (e.g., national 5-year overall survival), or if the aspect was covered by standardized clinical procedures or at the national level. We grouped the identified criteria thematically. We identified 18 publications and guideline documents with 530 criteria, of which 201 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The combination of similar criteria resulted in 90 overarching criteria, which we assigned to the following categories: facilities and networks, multidisciplinary team and other experts, supportive care, treatment, long-term care, and volume and numbers. Our results provide a comprehensive overview of existing quality criteria for pediatric oncology in countries with highly developed health-care systems.

Research is needed to identify these determinants of cancer health disparities and to develop interventions to achieve cancer health equity. Herein, we focus on the overall burden of ancestry-related molecular alterations, the functional significance of the alterations in hallmarks of cancer, and the implications of the alterations for precision oncology and immuno-oncology. In conclusion, we reflect on the importance of estimating ancestry, improving diverse racial and ethnic participation in cancer clinical trials, and examining the intersection among determinants of cancer health disparities.",Annual review of medicine,2021-Jan,"Freedman JA, Al Abo M, Allen TA, Piwarski SA, Wegermann K, Patierno SR",6,812,oncology,2025-11-22
38865611,The Effect of Perceived Social Support and Spiritual Care Needs in Predicting Hope in Oncology Patients.,"Hope has an influential role in oncology patients and is related to perceived social support and spirituality. However, studies on the extent to which the concepts of perceived social support and spiritual care needs affect hope are still limited. To examine the effect of perceived social support and spiritual care needs in predicting hope in adult oncology patients. Study questionnaires, a demographic form, the Herth Hope Scale, the Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale, and the Spiritual Care Needs Scale were administered to participants. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted. A total of 134 oncology patients completed the study questionnaires. Significant correlations were found between hope and perceived social support and between hope and spiritual care needs ( P < .05). Perceived support explained 11.7% of the variance in hope scores. A 1-unit increase in the support score was associated with a 0.344-unit increase in the hope score. Spiritual care needs did not significantly predict hope. In line with the results, interventions that promote social support may increase hope in oncology patients. Nurses could incorporate interventions into their care to improve social support as one way to enhance hope levels among oncology patients. Further studies are required to understand more about the impact of spiritual care needs on hope.",Cancer nursing,,"Budak SE, Ay Kaatsız MA",2,1378,oncology,2025-11-22
38243190,The role of molecular tumor boards in neuro-oncology: a nationwide survey.,"In neuro-oncology, the inclusion of tumor patients in the molecular tumor board has only become increasingly widespread in recent years, but so far there are no standards for indication, procedure, evaluation, therapy recommendations and therapy implementation of neuro-oncological patients. The present work examines the current handling of neuro-oncological patients included in molecular tumor boards in Germany. We created an online based survey with questions covering the handling of neuro-oncologic patient inclusion, annotation of genetic analyses, management of target therapies and the general role of molecular tumor boards in neuro-oncology in Germany. We contacted all members of the Neuro-Oncology working group (NOA) of the German Cancer Society (DKG) by e-mail. 38 responses were collected. The majority of those who responded were specialists in neurosurgery or neurology with more than 10 years of professional experience working at a university hospital. Molecular tumor boards (MTB) regularly take place once a week and all treatment disciplines of neuro-oncology patients take part. The inclusions to the MTB are according to distinct tumors and predominantly in case of tumor recurrence. An independently MTB member mostly create the recommendations, which are regularly implemented in the tumor treatment. Recommendations are given for alteration classes 4 and 5. Problems exist mostly within the cost takeover of experimental therapies. The experimental therapies are mostly given in the department of medical oncology. Molecular tumor boards for neuro-oncological patients, by now, are not standardized in Germany. Similarities exists for patient inclusion and interpretation of molecular alterations; the time point of inclusion and implementation during the patient treatment differ between the various hospitals. Further studies for standardization and harmonisation are needed. In summary, most of the interviewees envision great opportunities and possibilities for molecular-based neuro-oncological therapy in the future.",BMC cancer,2024-Jan,"Hönikl LS, Lange S, Butenschoen VM, Delbridge C, Meyer B, Combs SE, Illert AL, Schmidt-Graf F",8,2051,oncology,2025-11-22

Patients older than 65 years are generally considered geriatric. The incidence of cancer in geriatric patients is increasing annually. Candidacy for surgical intervention depends on factors such as cancer type, size, location, grade and stage of the tumor, and the patient's overall health status and age. Despite increasing agreement that age should not limit treatment options, geriatric patients tend to be undertreated. Cancer in geriatric patients has different features than in younger patients. As such, treatment options may be dissimilar in these 2 cohorts.

It has been demonstrated that they have higher morbidity and poorer prognosis of several medical diseases than the general population, with an at least 10-20-year reduction in life expectancy. A special issue of Psycho-Oncology focusing on cancer care among patients affected by SMI was called by the Editorial Board of the journal, with the aim to explore cancer health disparities and inequalities among people with SMI, mortality from cancer, problems of communication between multidisciplinary oncology and psychiatric teams and need for more structured intervention (i.e., screening, prevention, treatment). Authors from eight countries contributed. The problem of stigma and barriers to cancer care provision for patients with SMI were studied (e.g., the complex nature of SMI and healthcare providers' misunderstanding of SMI). Key barriers were related to both patients, clinicians and institutional problems, such as fragmentation of care. A higher mortality from cancer and poor knowledge about cancer risk-factors was shown in patients with SMI. Models of intervention were also proposed. Several conclusions have been recommended by the authors, such as the need for guidelines and clinical procedures specific for cancer care in mental health settings; large-scale studies to address the disparities of care in people with SMI; a larger vision of psychosocial oncology as the facilitator of the liaison between oncology and psychiatry.",Psycho-oncology,2021-Dec,"Grassi L, Riba MB",2,1572,oncology,2025-11-22

ASCO and the College of American Pathologists have successfully collaborated over the last 15 years to improve collaboration between clinical oncologists and pathologists and to standardize pathologic assay techniques. Cancer is an increasingly recognized societal burden in low- and middle-income countries. In 2015, ASCO and the College of American Pathologists implemented an initiative to identify countries that could benefit from peer insights by jointly convening an international workshop among members of both organizations and pathologists and clinical oncologists from Haiti, Honduras, Vietnam, and Uganda. Honduras was chosen as a pilot site, and representatives of ASCO, the College of American Pathologists, and the Honduras pathology and clinical oncology communities have identified areas in which collaboration might be productive. Multiple barriers, including high poverty levels, poor cancer awareness educational programs, lack of human resources, and delayed diagnosis and treatment, have resulted in a higher cancer mortality rate in Honduras compared with high/moderate-income countries and are shared by other low-income countries. ASCO and the College of American Pathologists member faculty supported a symposium led by Honduras colleagues for interested Honduran pathologists and oncologists. The Honduran communities are now working to establish national resource-appropriate guidelines for both pathology and clinical oncology. Taken together, these efforts indicate that barriers to meet the needs of the clinical oncologists in a low-income country such as Honduras are challenging but not insurmountable.",American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

The aims of this study were to conceptualize the clinical strategies that outpatient oncology nurses use to introduce early palliative care and to determine how these strategies align with the framework of practice. A constructivist-informed grounded theory study was conducted in a tertiary cancer care center in Toronto, Canada. Twenty nurses (6 staff nurses, 10 nurse practitioners, and 4 advanced practice nurses) from multiple outpatient oncology clinics (ie, breast, pancreatic, hematology) completed semistructured interviews. Analysis occurred concurrently with data collection and used constant comparison until theoretical saturation was reached. The overarching core category, pulling it all together , outlines the strategies used by oncology nurses to support timely palliative care referral, drawing on the coordinating, collaborating, relational, and advocacy dimensions of practice. The core category incorporated 3 subcategories: (1) catalyzing and facilitating synergy among disciplines and settings , (2) promoting and considering palliative care within patients' personal narratives , and (3) widening the focus from disease-focused treatment to living well with cancer . Outpatient oncology nurses enact unique clinical strategies, which are aligned with the nursing framework and reflected multiple dimensions of practice, to introduce early palliative care. Our findings have clinical, educational, and policy implications for fostering the conditions in which nurses are supported to maximize their full potential in the introduction of early palliative care.",Cancer nursing,,"Mohammed S, Swami N, Pope A, Rodin G, Zimmermann C",5,1800,oncology,2025-11-22

32286693,Training oncology physicians to advise their patients on complementary and integrative medicine: An implementation study for a manual-guided consultation.,"The unmonitored use of complementary medicine in patients with cancer can be associated with an increased risk of safety-related issues, such as lower adherence to conventional cancer therapies. Training oncology physicians to advise their patients about the effectiveness and safety of these therapies could improve this situation. The objective of this study was to develop and pretest a consultation framework that has high potential to be widely implemented. The framework comprises: 1) a systematically developed and tested, manualized, guided consultation; and 2) blended learning training (e-learning and communication skills training workshop) to upskill oncology physicians in advising their patients on complementary and integrative medicine (CIM). For this implementation study, mixed methods were used to develop the manual (literature review, consensus procedure, pilot testing) and the training (questionnaires and interviews with oncology physicians and patients with cancer and an examination of the skills in a setting with standardized patients). The training was tested with 47 oncology physicians from across Germany. The manual-guided consultation (context: general information on the setting and communication techniques; inform: consultation duration and content; capture: previous CIM use; prioritize: focus on consultation; advise: evidence-based CIM recommendations; discuss, advise, accept, or advise against other CIM; concretize advice: summary and implementation; and monitor: documentation) was considered suitable. The structure and time frame (maximum, 20 minutes) of the consultation as well as the training were feasible and well accepted. The current study demonstrates that the KOKON-KTO framework (a German acronym for Competence Network for Complementary Medicine - Consultation Training for Oncology Physicians) is suitable for training oncology physicians.

With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), precision medicine is undergoing a shift toward more precise and personalized care. Wearable device technology complements this paradigm shift by offering continuous monitoring of patient vitals, facilitating early intervention, and improving treatment adherence. The integration of these technologies promises to enhance the quality of oncological care, making it more responsive and tailored to individual patient needs, thereby enabling wider implementation of such applications in the clinical setting. This review article addresses the integration of wearable devices and AI in oncology, exploring their role in patient monitoring, treatment optimization, and research advancement along with an overview of completed clinical trials and utility in different aspects. The vast applications have been exemplified using several studies, and all the clinical trials completed till date have been summarized in Table 2. Additionally, we discuss challenges in implementation, regulatory considerations, and future perspectives for leveraging these technologies to enhance cancer care and radically changing the global health sector. AI is transforming cancer care by enhancing diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment planning tools, thus making precision medicine more effective. Wearable technology facilitates continuous, noninvasive monitoring, improving patient engagement and adherence to treatment protocols. The combined use of AI and wearables aids in monitoring patient activity, assessing frailty, predicting chemotherapy tolerance, detecting biomarkers, and managing treatment adherence.

The aims of this study were to assess oncology nurses' perceptions about their responsibility and frequency of delivery of survivorship care to cancer patients and to examine the factors influencing such care. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 81 nurses working in the oncology unit of hospitals in Hong Kong. Participants completed an investigator-developed questionnaire designed to assess oncology nurses' perceptions of responsibility, practices, and barriers regarding the provision of survivorship care for cancer patients. Results revealed discrepancies between oncology nurses' perceptions of responsibility and practices, with high levels of perceptions of various survivorship care as their responsibility but low levels in delivery of such care. Despite that discussing and managing pain was agreed by most oncology nurses as their responsibility (95.1%), 34.6% of them have never managed survivors' pain. Besides, 33.3% of nurses have never discussed and managed survivors' sexuality issues. Lack of time (79.0%), inadequate educational resources for family members (59.3%), and lack of knowledge and skills (54.4%) were major factors that impeded survivorship care provision. This study provides further evidence for inadequacies of oncology nurses in delivering survivorship care and their perceived barriers. Further studies are required to enhance our understanding of the strategies for improving the quality of cancer survivorship care. Results underscore the need to develop educational resources and enhance training in survivorship care for oncology nurses.",Cancer nursing,,"Wong CL, So WKW, Choi KC, Tong M, Choy YP, Molassiotis A, Yates P, Chan RJ",8,1788,oncology,2025-11-22

33830352,Models of Integration of Specialized Palliative Care with Oncology.,"Evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses has shown that early integration of specialized palliative care improves symptoms and quality of life for patients with advanced cancer. There are various models of early integration, which may be classified based on setting of care and method of palliative care referral. Most successful randomized controlled trials of early palliative care have used a model of specialized teams providing in-person palliative care in free-standing or embedded outpatient clinics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth has become a prominent model for palliative care delivery. This model of care has been well received by patients and palliative care providers, although evidence to date is limited. Despite evidence from trials that routine early integration of palliative care into oncology care improves patient outcomes, referral to palliative care still occurs mostly according to the judgment of individual oncologists. This hinders equitable access to palliative care and to its known benefits for patients and their caregivers. Automated referral based on triggering criteria is being actively explored as an alternative. In particular, routine technology-assisted symptom screening, combined with targeted needs-based automatic referral to outpatient palliative care, may improve integration and ultimately increase quality of life.",Current treatment options in oncology,2021-Apr,"Mathews J, Hannon B, Zimmermann C",3,1392,oncology,2025-11-22
33620160,Does biomarker use in oncology improve clinical trial failure risk? A large-scale analysis.,"To date there has not been an extensive analysis of the outcomes of biomarker use in oncology. Data were pooled across four indications in oncology drawing upon trial outcomes from www.clinicaltrials.gov: breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), melanoma and colorectal cancer from 1998 to 2017. We compared the likelihood drugs would progress through the stages of clinical trial testing to approval based on biomarker status. This was done with multi-state Markov models, tools that describe the stochastic process in which subjects move among a finite number of states. Over 10000 trials were screened, which yielded 745 drugs. The inclusion of biomarker status as a covariate significantly improved the fit of the Markov model in describing the drug trajectories through clinical trial testing stages. Hazard ratios based on the Markov models revealed the likelihood of drug approval with biomarkers having nearly a fivefold increase for all indications combined. A 12, 8 and 7-fold hazard ratio was observed for breast cancer, melanoma and NSCLC, respectively. Markov models with exploratory biomarkers outperformed Markov models with no biomarkers. This is the first systematic statistical evidence that biomarkers clearly increase clinical trial success rates in three different indications in oncology. Also, exploratory biomarkers, long before they are properly validated, appear to improve success rates in oncology. This supports early and aggressive adoption of biomarkers in oncology clinical trials.",Cancer medicine,2021-Mar,"Parker JL, Kuzulugil SS, Pereverzev K, Mac S, Lopes G, Shah Z, Weerasinghe A, Rubinger D, Falconi A, Bener A, Caglayan B, Tangri R, Mitsakakis N",13,1523,oncology,2025-11-22
38158211,Evolving Barriers to Clinical Trial Enrollment and Clinical Care in Neuro-oncology in the Face of COVID-19.,"The lack of treatments with durable response in neuro-oncology highlights the critical need for clinical trials to advance patient care. The intersection of relatively low incidence, evolving classification schema, and entrenched community, healthcare provider, and organizational factors have been historic challenges against successful trial enrollment and implementation. The additional need for multidisciplinary, often tertiary-level care, further magnifies latent national and international health inequities with rural and under-served populations. The COVID-19 pandemic both unveiled fundamental weaknesses in historical approaches and prompted the necessity of new approaches and systems for conducting clinical trials. Here, we provide an overview of traditional barriers to clinical trial enrollment in neuro-oncology, the effect of COVID-19 on these barriers, and the discovery of additional systemic weaknesses. Finally, we discuss future directions by reflecting on lessons learned with strategies to broaden access of care and streamline clinical trial integration into clinical practice.",Seminars in neurology,2024-Feb,"Grandhi N, Zhou AY, Johnson MO, Butt OH",4,1103,oncology,2025-11-22

32829462,Increasing access to psychosocial oncology services means becoming more person-centered and situation-responsive.,"Current approaches in cancer supportive care call for enhanced patient access, personalized care, and higher service quality and performance. Person-centered care (PCC) is respectful and responsive to individuals' needs, preferences, and context. PCC is likely to enhance access to relevant resources and services as the cancer experience and trajectory unfold. However, significant gaps still exist in accessing supportive modalities across the cancer trajectory. Too often, affected individuals must contend with institution-centric rather than personalized modalities, practices, and schedules. In this commentary, we review the evidence on the distinct needs and preferences of individuals affected by cancer and highlight key factors significantly associated with patient experiences and satisfaction. Recommendations are made to enhance access, relevance, and a fuller integration of cancer service delivery. Last, we discuss how implementing these recommendations aligns with potentially more cost-effective psychosocial oncology support while directly addressing access to timely psychosocial care.",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2020-Dec,"Loiselle CG, Brown TL",2,1106,oncology,2025-11-22

A sizeable subset of respondents was interested in receiving information about the availability of genetic counseling from an oncology doctor or nurse, but not a genetic counselor (n=13/55, 24%). Most respondents preferred to be informed about genetic services at diagnosis (n=28/54, 52%) or within 1 to 2 months of diagnosis (n=14/54, 26%). In conclusion, patients and their families may benefit from prompt and early recognition of the risk of cancer predisposition syndromes, preferably within the first 2 months following diagnosis. Oncology professionals are an important source of information, and can introduce the availability of genetic counseling services and motivate families to undergo genetic testing, though alternative communication methods such as brochures may also be useful.",Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,2022-Aug,"Li KA, Sloat LM, Kung J, Jung J, Li A, Smith CH, Schratz KE, Cooper SL, Pratilas CA, Frankenfield P, Bodurtha J",11,1269,oncology,2025-11-22
32706453,The state of the science for communication training in pediatric oncology: A systematic review.,"Within the field of pediatric oncology, communication skills training (CST) has been recognized as a high priority by professional and accrediting organizations. However, the effectiveness of formalized CST interventions for pediatric oncology providers remains poorly understood. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and PsycInfo for original research articles assessing the effectiveness and quality of CST interventions targeting pediatric oncology clinicians. From 971 deduplicated references, eight articles representing six communication interventions were eligible for inclusion. This review summarizes the existing literature with respect to CST content, intervention methodology, targeted outcome metrics, measurement tools, short-term and sustained benefits, design biases, and availability of materials to allow for reproduction of interventions. Ultimately, studies on CST in pediatric oncology are few, heterogeneous, and lacking in standardized outcome metrics; however, synthesis of the available literature suggests feasibility and effectiveness. Increased scientific rigor is needed, and specific recommendations to advance the field are described.",Pediatric blood & cancer,2020-Oct,"Kaye EC, Cannone D, Snaman JM, Baker JN, Spraker-Perlman H",5,1187,oncology,2025-11-22

Consequently, a variety of unsynchronized approaches were kicked off to (electronically) measure patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Despite increasing evidence that PRO data are highly relevant for patient care, the data generated in these initial projects lack standardized processing pathways in order to impact clinical routine; therefore, potential future routine PRO assessments require adequate analysis, storage and processing to allow a robust, reproducible and reliable incorporation into routine clinical decision-making. Here, we discuss relevant challenges of digital follow-up that need to be tackled to render PRO data as relevant to physicians as laboratory or biomarker data.",Oncology,2020-,"Giordano FA, Welzel G, Siefert V, Jahnke L, Ganslandt T, Wenz F, Grosu AL, Heinemann F, Nicolay NH",9,913,oncology,2025-11-22

34255338,The Growing Impact of Cardiovascular Oncology: Epidemiology and Pathophysiology.,"Progress in the treatment of cancer has significantly improved survival of oncologic patients in recent decades. However, anticancer therapies, particularly some new, more potent and targeted agents, are potentially cardiotoxic. As a consequence, cardiovascular complications, including heart failure, arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, venous thromboembolism, peripheral vascular disease, arrhythmias, pericardial disease, and pulmonary hypertension, as related to cancer itself or to anticancer treatments, are increasingly observed and may adversely affect prognosis in oncologic patients. Cardiovascular oncology is an emerging field in cardiology and internal medicine, which is rapidly growing, dealing with the prevention, the early detection, and the management of cardiovascular disease, in all stages of anticancer therapy and during the survivorship period, now crucial for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. In this narrative review, the existing literature regarding the epidemiology of cardiovascular oncology, the mechanisms of cardiovascular complications in cancer, and the pathophysiology of cardiotoxicity related to chemotherapeutic agents, targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and radiotherapy will be analyzed and summarized.",Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,2021-Nov,"Tufano A, Coppola A, Galderisi M",3,1293,oncology,2025-11-22

Achieving this goal requires computational methods that can make sense of and combine heterogeneous data sources. Interpretability and integration of prior knowledge is of particular relevance for genomic models to minimize ungeneralizable models, promote rational treatment design, and make use of sparse genetic mutation data. While networks have long been used to capture genomic interactions at the levels of genes, proteins, and pathways, the use of networks in precision oncology is relatively new. In this chapter, I provide an introduction to network-based approaches used to integrate multi-modal data sources for patient stratification and patient classification. There is a particular emphasis on methods using patient similarity networks (PSNs) as part of the design. I separately discuss strategies for inferring driver mutations from individual patient mutation data.

39271283,ROCR: Modernizing Radiation Oncology Payment to Embrace Innovation and Better Care.,"Data demonstrates that hypofractionation is increasingly utilized based on evidence-based guidelines. The outdated Medicare fee-for-service approach penalizes radiation oncology (RO) practices from adopting hypofractionation, even as many patients benefit. To address the flawed fee-for-service payment system, which rewards volume over value, ASTRO introduced the Radiation Oncology Case Rate (ROCR) Value-Based Payment Program. ROCR shifts payment for RO services from fee-for-service to payment per patient or per episode. To address disparities, ROCR provides an evidence-based approach through the Health Equity Achievement in Radiation Therapy (HEART) initiative, providing transportation assistance payment for the underserved. Additionally, ROCR allows practices sufficient capital to maintain existing equipment and invest in new technology.

Although there have been vast advances in our understanding of the biological underpinnings of cancer and significant improvements in clinical care, disparities in cancer care for all women-including cisgender, transgender, and gender diverse women-persist. Similarly, despite inclusion within the oncology physician workforce, women and gender minorities, particularly those with additional identities under-represented in medicine, still face structural barriers to clinical and academic productivity and career success. In this article, we define and discuss how structural sexism influences both the equitable care of patients with cancer and the oncology workforce and explore the overlapping challenges in both realms.

38723754,Association of Patient Portal Messaging with Survival Among Radiation Oncology Patients.,"The shift to electronic health records has led to both patient portal messaging and large amounts of digital, real-world data for research. The objective of this study was to examine the association between portal messaging and survival among radiation oncology patients, using real-world data. This retrospective cohort study included patients at least 21 years old and seen by radiation oncology providers between January 14, 2014, and April 23, 2023, at the University of California, San Francisco. We developed Cox proportional hazards models for the outcome of death and examined factors associated with portal messaging using logistic regression models. Among 25,367 patients, the median age was 64 (interquartile range [IR], 54-72), 13,175 (52%) were White, and 14,389 (57%) were male. Overall, as the first message in a thread, 8986 (35%) patients sent messages to radiation oncology providers, and 4218 (17%) patients were sent messages from radiation oncology providers. Patients with head and neck or genitourinary malignancies were more likely than those with other diagnoses to send portal messages to and be sent portal messages from radiation oncology providers. Both sending portal messages to radiation oncology providers (hazard ratio [HR], 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.96; P = .001) and being sent messages from radiation oncology providers (HR, 0.77; CI, 0.70-0.84; P < .001) as the first message in a thread were associated with patient survival after adjusting for socioeconomic, disease, and treatment characteristics. There were disparities among patients sending portal messages to radiation oncology providers, including for Black versus White patients (odds ratio [OR], 0.60; CI, 0.51-0.69; P < .001) and for Medicaid versus Medicare patients (OR, 0.70; CI, 0.62-0.79; P < .001). There were also disparities among patients being sent portal messages by radiation oncology providers, including for Black versus White patients (OR, 0.77; CI, 0.64-0.91; P = .003), for Medicaid versus Medicare patients (OR, 0.76; CI, 0.65-0.89; P < .001), and for patients with female versus male providers (OR, 1.47; CI 1.34-1.62; P < .001). Sending portal messages to and being sent portal messages from radiation oncology providers were associated with better survival. Future studies should elucidate how best to support patient and provider engagement.","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",2024-Nov,"Alexander J, Beatty A",2,2379,oncology,2025-11-22
38684145,Cardiorenal Impact of Anti-Cancer Agents: The Intersection of Onco-Nephrology and Cardio-Oncology.,"The evolving landscape of cancer treatments has introduced new challenges, particularly related to adverse events associated with chemotherapeutic agents. To address these challenges, the fields of cardio-oncology and onco-nephrology have arisen, focusing on the management of cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity attributable to anti-cancer drugs. Numerous intersections between these disciplines exist, including onco-hypertension (HTN) and cardiorenal toxicities induced by chemotherapeutic agents. Additionally, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may cause myocarditis and nephritis. This paper aimed to explore the intersection between cardio-oncology and onco-nephrology. A detailed review will be undertaken, focusing on onco-HTN and the cardiorenal toxicities of chemotherapeutic agents, with a specific emphasis on the adverse effects associated with ICIs.

35897414,The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Oncology Patient Management.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way cancer patients should be managed. Using published literature on best practices on oncology patient management, we developed checklists to establish which recommendations were followed and differences between healthcare staff and institutions in a local health unit (overseeing two regional hospitals and 14 primary Healthcare Centers) in an interior region in Portugal. Checklists were delivered and completed by 15 physicians, 18 nurses and 5 pharmacists working at the Hospitals, and 29 physicians and 46 nurses from primary healthcare centers. Hospital staff do not show statistically significant differences regarding most proposed recommendations for the oncology clinical pathway, human resources, treatments, patient management and service management. Primary healthcare centers seem to follow a similar trend. As a local health unit, general recommendations for Oncology Patient Management show statistically significantly different values on education of suspected cases, identification, isolation procedures and samples collection; extension of work schedules; and education on cancer patient and COVID-19 positive referral procedures. All the checklists indicated good-to-high internal consistency. Our analysis showed cohesive work between groups regarding control and prevention of sources of infection; therefore, it is considered the highest priority to ensure that all other services, including oncology, continue functioning.

37475868,Insights into immuno-oncology drug development landscape with focus on bone metastasis.,"Bone is among the main sites of metastasis in breast, prostate and other major cancers. Bone metastases remain incurable causing high mortality, severe skeletal-related effects and decreased quality of life. Despite the success of immunotherapies in oncology, no immunotherapies are approved for bone metastasis and no clear benefit has been observed with approved immunotherapies in treatment of bone metastatic disease. Therefore, it is crucial to consider unique features of tumor microenvironment in bone metastasis when developing novel therapies. The vicious cycle of bone metastasis, referring to crosstalk between tumor and bone cells that enables the tumor cells to grow in the bone microenvironment, is a well-established concept. Very recently, a novel osteoimmuno-oncology (OIO) concept was introduced to the scientific community. OIO emphasizes the significance of interactions between tumor, immune and bone cells in promoting tumor growth in bone metastasis, and it can be used to reveal the most promising targets for bone metastasis. In order to provide an insight into the current immuno-oncology drug development landscape, we used 1stOncology database, a cancer drug development resource to identify novel immunotherapies in preclinical or clinical development for breast and prostate cancer bone metastasis. Based on the database search, 24 immunotherapies were identified in preclinical or clinical development that included evaluation of effects on bone metastasis. This review provides an insight to novel immuno-oncology drug development in the context of bone metastasis. Bone metastases can be approached using different modalities, and tumor microenvironment in bone provides many potential targets for bone metastasis. Noting current increasing interest in the field of OIO, more therapeutic opportunities that primarily target bone metastasis are expected in the future.",Frontiers in immunology,2023-,"Kähkönen TE, Halleen JM, MacRitchie G, Andersson RM, Bernoulli J",5,1900,oncology,2025-11-22
