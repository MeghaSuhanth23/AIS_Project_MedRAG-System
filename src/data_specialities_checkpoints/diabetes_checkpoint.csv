34173093,Oxidative Stress: Pathogenetic Role in Diabetes Mellitus and Its Complications and Therapeutic Approaches to Correction.,"The review presents modern views about the role of oxidative stress reactions in the pathogenesis of types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus and their complications based on the analysis of experimental and clinical studies. The sources of increased ROS generation in diabetes are specified, including the main pathways of altered glucose metabolism, oxidative damage to pancreatic β-cells, and endothelial dysfunction. The relationship between oxidative stress, carbonyl stress, and inflammation is described. The significance of oxidative stress reactions associated with hyperglycemia is considered in the context of the ""metabolic memory"" phenomenon. The results of our studies demonstrated significant ethnic and age-related variability of the LPO-antioxidant defense system parameters in patients with diabetes mellitus, which should be considered during complex therapy of the disease. Numerous studies of the effectiveness of antioxidants in diabetes mellitus of both types convincingly proved that antioxidants should be a part of the therapeutic process. Modern therapeutic strategies in the treatment of diabetes mellitus are aimed at developing new methods of personalized antioxidant therapy, including ROS sources targeting combined with new ways of antioxidant delivery.",Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,2021-May,"Darenskaya MA, Kolesnikova LI, Kolesnikov SI",3,1277,diabetes,2025-11-22

37857245,"Diabetes mellitus: Classification, mediators, and complications; A gate to identify potential targets for the development of new effective treatments.","Nowadays, diabetes mellitus has emerged as a significant global public health concern with a remarkable increase in its prevalence. This review article focuses on the definition of diabetes mellitus and its classification into different types, including type 1 diabetes (idiopathic and fulminant), type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, hybrid forms, slowly evolving immune-mediated diabetes, ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, and other special types. Diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus are also discussed. The role of inflammation in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes is explored, along with the mediators and potential anti-inflammatory treatments. Furthermore, the involvement of various organs in diabetes mellitus is highlighted, such as the role of adipose tissue and obesity, gut microbiota, and pancreatic β-cells. The manifestation of pancreatic Langerhans β-cell islet inflammation, oxidative stress, and impaired insulin production and secretion are addressed. Additionally, the impact of diabetes mellitus on liver cirrhosis, acute kidney injury, immune system complications, and other diabetic complications like retinopathy and neuropathy is examined.

They are at risk of developing life-threatening complications resulting in reduced quality of life, increased mortality and higher healthcare costs. The ability to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by modifying some of its risk factors has been hypothesized for decades. The long and often gradual time-course of increasing dysglycemia prior to diabetes diagnosis suggests that interventions during that period could be effective in preventing T2DM. In addition to lifestyle modifications, certain drugs prevent or slow development of hyperglycemia. Recently, drugs used for obesity management were shown to prevent T2DM.

34764939,The Utility of Exosomes in Diagnosis and Therapy of Diabetes Mellitus and Associated Complications.,"Diabetes mellitus and the associated complications are metabolic diseases with high morbidity that result in poor quality of health and life. The lack of diagnostic methods for early detection results in patients losing the best treatment opportunity. Oral hypoglycemics and exogenous insulin replenishment are currently the most common therapeutic strategies, which only yield temporary glycemic control rather than curing the disease and its complications. Exosomes are nanoparticles containing bioactive molecules reflecting individual physiological status, regulating metabolism, and repairing damaged tissues. They function as biomarkers of diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications. Considering that exosomes are bioactive molecules, can be obtained from body fluid, and have cell-type specificity, in this review, we highlight the multifold effects of exosomes in the pathology and therapy of diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2021-,"Sun Y, Tao Q, Wu X, Zhang L, Liu Q, Wang L",6,948,diabetes,2025-11-22
35668219,The burden and risks of emerging complications of diabetes mellitus.,"The traditional complications of diabetes mellitus are well known and continue to pose a considerable burden on millions of people living with diabetes mellitus. However, advances in the management of diabetes mellitus and, consequently, longer life expectancies, have resulted in the emergence of evidence of the existence of a different set of lesser-acknowledged diabetes mellitus complications. With declining mortality from vascular disease, which once accounted for more than 50% of deaths amongst people with diabetes mellitus, cancer and dementia now comprise the leading causes of death in people with diabetes mellitus in some countries or regions. Additionally, studies have demonstrated notable links between diabetes mellitus and a broad range of comorbidities, including cognitive decline, functional disability, affective disorders, obstructive sleep apnoea and liver disease, and have refined our understanding of the association between diabetes mellitus and infection. However, no published review currently synthesizes this evidence to provide an in-depth discussion of the burden and risks of these emerging complications. This Review summarizes information from systematic reviews and major cohort studies regarding emerging complications of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus to identify and quantify associations, highlight gaps and discrepancies in the evidence, and consider implications for the future management of diabetes mellitus.",Nature reviews.

34560536,Gestational diabetes mellitus - A metabolic and reproductive disorder.,"Maternal health associated with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) has been gaining significant research attention due to its severe risk and adverse health effects. GDM is the leading health disease in pregnant women. It is the most common metabolic disease and it can affect up to 25% of women during pregnancy. Pregnancy is a sensitive period that impacts both pregnant women and their unborn children's long-term health. It is a well-known fact that the leading causes of disease and mortality worldwide are diabetes mellitus and cancer, and specifically, women with diabetes mellitus are at a higher risk of developing breast cancer (BC). Women who have diabetes are equally vulnerable to reproductive diseases. Reproductive dysfunctions with diabetes are mainly attributed to coexisting polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), obesity, and hyperinsulinemia, etc. Moreover, India has long been recognized as the world's diabetic capital, and it is widely acknowledged that particularly pregnant and lactating women are among the most affected by diabetes. In India, one-third (33%) of women with GDM had a history of maternal diabetes. Nevertheless, the latest research suggests that gestational diabetes is also a risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases of the mother and offspring. Therefore, in the 21st century, GDM imposes a major challenge for healthcare professionals. We intend to explore the role of diabetes on female reproductive function throughout various stages of life in the perspective of the changing prognosis, prevalence, and prevention of GDM.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2021-Nov,"Choudhury AA, Devi Rajeswari V",2,1567,diabetes,2025-11-22
32398822,Pancreatic β-cells in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus: different pathways to failure.,"Loss of functional β-cell mass is the key mechanism leading to the two main forms of diabetes mellitus - type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Understanding the mechanisms behind β-cell failure is critical to prevent or revert disease. Basic pathogenic differences exist in the two forms of diabetes mellitus; T1DM is immune mediated and T2DM is mediated by metabolic mechanisms. These mechanisms differentially affect early β-cell dysfunction and eventual fate. Over the past decade, major advances have been made in the field, mostly delivered by studies on β-cells in human disease. These advances include studies of islet morphology and human β-cell gene expression in T1DM and T2DM, the identification and characterization of the role of T1DM and T2DM candidate genes at the β-cell level and the endoplasmic reticulum stress signalling that contributes to β-cell failure in T1DM (mostly IRE1 driven) and T2DM (mostly PERK-eIF2α dependent).

Since type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is suffered by the majority of diabetic patients (around 90-95%) and often the mono-target therapy fails in managing blood glucose levels and the other comorbidities, this review focuses on the potential drugs acting on multi-targets involved in the treatment of this type of diabetes. In particular, the review considers the main systems directly involved in T2DM or involved in diabetes comorbidities. Agonists acting on incretin, glucagon systems, as well as on peroxisome proliferation activated receptors are considered. Inhibitors which target either aldose reductase and tyrosine phosphatase 1B or sodium glucose transporters 1 and 2 are taken into account. Moreover, with a view at the multi-target approaches for T2DM some phytocomplexes are also discussed.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2020-Apr,"Artasensi A, Pedretti A, Vistoli G, Fumagalli L",4,1033,diabetes,2025-11-22
38341550,"Double diabetes-when type 1 diabetes meets type 2 diabetes: definition, pathogenesis and recognition.","Currently, the differentiation between type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is not straightforward, and the features of both types of diabetes coexist in one subject. This situation triggered the need to discriminate so-called double diabetes (DD), hybrid diabetes or type 1.5 diabetes, which is generally described as the presence of the insulin resistance characteristic of metabolic syndrome in individuals diagnosed with T1D. DD not only raises the question of proper classification of diabetes but is also associated with a significantly greater risk of developing micro- and macroangiopathic complications, which was independent of glycaemic control. When considering the global obesity pandemic and increasing incidence of T1D, the prevalence of DD may also presumably increase. Therefore, it is of the highest priority to discover the mechanisms underlying the development of DD and to identify appropriate methods to prevent or treat DD. In this article, we describe how the definition of double diabetes has changed over the years and how it is currently defined. We discuss the accuracy of including metabolic syndrome in the DD definition. We also present possible hypotheses connecting insulin resistance with T1D and propose possible methods to identify individuals with double diabetes based on indirect insulin resistance markers, which are easily assessed in everyday clinical practice. Moreover, we discuss adjuvant therapy which may be considered in double diabetic patients.",Cardiovascular diabetology,2024-Feb,"Bielka W, Przezak A, Molęda P, Pius-Sadowska E, Machaliński B",5,1505,diabetes,2025-11-22
35711119,Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in older adults: Current status and future prospects.,"The recent increase in life expectancy has resulted in an increase in the number of older adults with diabetes mellitus. In addition to type 2 diabetes, in which aging is a well-known risk factor, individuals with type 1 and other types of diabetes are also increasing owing to longevity in the general population and improved prognosis of the disease and comorbidities. Insulin-dependent state in type 1 diabetes and other types of diabetes, such as diabetes after pancreatectomy, inevitably requires insulin treatment for survival; however, daily injection of insulin is often hampered in older adults due to impaired cognitive function or limited activities of daily living. In this review, we aimed to discuss the current situation of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in older adults and highlight future prospects.

32342453,Exercise and Type 1 Diabetes.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the most common endocrine and metabolic disease caused by absolute or insufficient insulin secretion. Under the context of an aging population worldwide, the number of diabetic patients is increasing year by year. Most patients with diabetes have multiple complications that severely threaten their survival and living quality. DM is mainly divided into type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T1DM is caused by absolute lack of insulin secretion, so the current treatment for T1DM patients is exogenous insulin replacement therapy. At present, exercise therapy has been widely recognized in the prevention and treatment of diabetes, and regular aerobic exercise has become an important part of T1DM treatment. At the same time, exercise therapy is also used in conjunction with other treatments in the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications. However, for patients with T1DM, exercise still has the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

There are various etiological factors contributing to the expansion of its incidence on different geographical locations. Hence, the articles published in reputed journals were studies and data were collected for analyzing the etiology and prevention of T1DM. It has been observed that hybrid insulin peptides act as key antigens for the autoreactive T cells and cause the loss of self-tolerance in humans. The association of coxsackievirus B has been observed with the onset of T1DM. Accurate identification of the trigger can lead to the development of appropriate preventive measures. It can become a base for advance studies to prevent T1DM in humans.

35798847,The interplay between diabetes mellitus and menopause: clinical implications.,"The menopausal transition is an impactful period in women's lives, when the risk of cardiovascular disease is accelerated. Similarly, diabetes mellitus profoundly impacts cardiovascular risk. However, the interplay between menopause and diabetes mellitus has not been adequately studied. The menopausal transition is accompanied by metabolic changes that predispose to diabetes mellitus, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as menopause results in increased risk of upper body adipose tissue accumulation and increased incidence of insulin resistance. Equally, diabetes mellitus can affect ovarian ageing, potentially causing women with type 1 diabetes mellitus and early-onset T2DM to experience menopause earlier than women without diabetes mellitus. Earlier age at menopause has been associated with a higher risk of T2DM later in life. Menopausal hormone therapy can reduce the risk of T2DM and improve glycaemic control in women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus; however, there is not enough evidence to support the administration of menopausal hormone therapy for diabetes mellitus prevention or control. This Review critically appraises studies published within the past few years on the interaction between diabetes mellitus and menopause and addresses all clinically relevant issues, such as the effect of menopause on the development of T2DM, and the management of both menopause and diabetes mellitus.",Nature reviews.

35272093,Postpartum glucose intolerance following early gestational diabetes mellitus.,"Patients with gestational diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance postpartum compared with those without diabetes mellitus. We aimed to evaluate the association between early gestational diabetes mellitus and postpartum dysglycemia compared with gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed by routine screening in a cohort of patients with obesity. This was a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial of patients with obesity and singleton, nonanomalous gestations that compared early gestational diabetes mellitus screening at 14 to 20 weeks of gestation with routine screening at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. Patients were included in this analysis if they were diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus at the primary study site. The primary outcome was postpartum dysglycemia, defined as any abnormality on 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test 6 weeks postpartum or clinical diagnosis based on hyperglycemia requiring pharmacotherapy after delivery with deferred glucose tolerance test. Maternal characteristics and outcomes were compared in bivariable analysis, and logistic regression estimated the association between early gestational diabetes mellitus and postpartum dysglycemia. Of 119 patients included in this analysis, 30 were diagnosed by screening at <20 weeks of gestation and 89 at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. Patients were overall similar in baseline characteristics. Patients with early gestational diabetes mellitus were more likely to have postpartum dysglycemia than those with gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed with routine screening (36.7% vs 14.6%; odds ratio, 3.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-8.73). Most patients with early gestational diabetes mellitus who had postpartum dysglycemia were diagnosed clinically (n=7/11), whereas none of the patients with gestational diabetes mellitus established by routine testing were diagnosed with postpartum dysglycemia clinically. All (100%) patients with early gestational diabetes mellitus who completed a postpartum glucose tolerance test had dysglycemia compared with only 45% of patients with gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed on routine screening. The proportion of patients who followed up for postpartum visits and the timing of follow-up were similar between groups. Postpartum glucose tolerance test completion was low but also similar between groups. Although postpartum glucose tolerance test completion is low, patients with gestational diabetes mellitus before 20 weeks of gestation, seem to be at higher risk for postpartum dysglycemia than those with gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed at routine screening in a cohort of patients with obesity. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, but postpartum follow-up and diabetes mellitus testing may be even more important to improve long-term health in patients with early gestational diabetes mellitus.",American journal of obstetrics & gynecology MFM,2022-May,"Champion ML, Battarbee AN, Biggio JR, Casey BM, Harper LM",5,2925,diabetes,2025-11-22

37552777,"New Horizons: Epidemiology of Obesity, Diabetes Mellitus, and Cancer Prognosis.","The global prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus has increased in parallel with increasing cancer incidence, due to environmental and lifestyle factors and population aging. Metabolic diseases are associated with increased cancer risk, so a growing number of patients with cancer have coexistent obesity and/or diabetes mellitus. In this narrative review, we highlight recent evidence on the clinical impact of obesity and diabetes mellitus on the prognosis of prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer, and provide an overview of the underlying mechanisms. There is evidence that obesity is associated with increased risk of recurrence, and all-cause and cancer-specific mortality among adults with prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer. Diabetes mellitus is associated with increased all-cause and cancer-specific mortality for these 3 cancers, beyond any impact of obesity. Evidence also suggests increased risk of colorectal cancer recurrence in patients with diabetes mellitus. The underlying mechanisms are multifactorial and likely include hormonal imbalances and chronic inflammation that promote cancer cell growth. Obesity and diabetes mellitus are associated with increased risk of complications and side effects of cancer treatment. Associated comorbidities such as impaired kidney function, cardiovascular disease, and neuropathies may preclude the use of guideline cancer treatment and are competing causes of death.

38844688,"Diabetes mellitus in patients with acromegaly: pathophysiology, clinical challenges and management.","Acromegaly is a rare endocrine disease caused by hypersecretion of growth hormone, most commonly arising due to a pituitary adenoma. Diabetes mellitus is a common complication of acromegaly, occurring in approximately one-third of patients. The risk of diabetes mellitus in acromegaly is driven by increased exposure to growth hormone, which directly attenuates insulin signalling and stimulates lipolysis, leading to decreased glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. Acromegaly is a unique human model, where insulin resistance occurs independently of obesity and is paradoxically associated with a lean phenotype and reduced body adipose tissue mass. Diabetes mellitus in patients with acromegaly is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Therefore, preventive measures and optimized treatment of diabetes mellitus are essential in these patients. However, specific recommendations for the management of diabetes mellitus secondary to acromegaly are lacking due to limited research on this subject. This Review explores the underlying mechanisms for diabetes mellitus in acromegaly and its effect on morbidity and mortality.

31701441,Diabetic Nephropathy: An Overview.,Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most feared diabetic chronic microvascular complications and the major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The classical presentation of DN is characterized by hyperfiltration and albuminuria in the early phases which is then followed by a progressive renal function decline. The presentation of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) can vary especially in patients with T2DM where concomitant presence of other glomerular/tubular pathologies and severe peripheral vascular disease can become important confounders. All-cause mortality in individuals with DKD is approximately 30 times higher than that in diabetic patients without nephropathy and a great majority of patients with DKD will die from cardiovascular disease before they reach ESRD. The management of metabolic and hemodynamic perturbations for the prevention and for the delay of progression of DKD is very important.

33496979,Continuous glucose monitoring: A review of the evidence in type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is becoming widely accepted as an adjunct to diabetes management. Compared to standard care, CGM can provide detailed information about glycaemic variability in an internationally standardised ambulatory glucose profile, enabling more informed user and clinician decision making. We aimed to review the evidence, user experience and cost-effectiveness of CGM. A literature search was conducted by combining subject headings 'CGM' and 'flash glucose monitoring', with key words 'type 1 diabetes' and 'type 2 diabetes', limited to '1999 to current'. Further evidence was obtained from relevant references of retrieved articles. There is a strong evidence for CGM use in people with type 1 diabetes, with benefits of reduced glycated haemoglobin and hypoglycaemia, and increased time in range. While the evidence for CGM use in type 2 diabetes is less robust, similar benefits have been demonstrated. CGM can improve diabetes-related satisfaction in people with diabetes (PWD) and parents of children with diabetes, as well as the clinician experience. However, CGM does have limitations including cost, accuracy and perceived inconvenience. Cost-effectiveness analyses have indicated that CGM is a cost-effective adjunct to type 1 diabetes management that is associated with reduced diabetes-related complications and hospitalisation.

35008906,The Role of the Gut Microbiota in the Pathogenesis of Diabetes.,"Diabetes mellitus is a significant clinical and therapeutic problem because it can lead to serious long-term complications. Its pathogenesis is not fully understood, but there are indications that dysbiosis can play a role in the development of diabetes, or that it appears during the course of the disease. Changes in microbiota composition are observed in both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. These modifications are associated with pro-inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, endotoxemia, impaired β-cell function and development of insulin resistance. This review summarizes the role of the gut microbiota in healthy individuals and the changes in bacterial composition that can be associated with T1D or T2D. It also presents new developments in diabetes therapy based on influencing the gut microbiota as a promising method to alter the course of diabetes. Moreover, it highlights the lacking data and suggests future directions needed to prove the causal relationship between dysbiosis and diabetes, both T1D and T2D.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022-Jan,"Bielka W, Przezak A, Pawlik A",3,1059,diabetes,2025-11-22

32894314,The clinical consequences of heterogeneity within and between different diabetes types.,"Advances in molecular methods and the ability to share large population-based datasets are uncovering heterogeneity within diabetes types, and some commonalities between types. Within type 1 diabetes, endotypes have been discovered based on demographic (e.g. age at diagnosis, race/ethnicity), genetic, immunological, histopathological, metabolic and/or clinical course characteristics, with implications for disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis and treatment. In type 2 diabetes, the relative contributions of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction are heterogeneous and relate to demographics, genetics and clinical characteristics, with substantial interaction from environmental exposures. Investigators have proposed approaches that vary from simple to complex in combining these data to identify type 2 diabetes clusters relevant to prognosis and treatment. Advances in pharmacogenetics and pharmacodynamics are also improving treatment. Monogenic diabetes is a prime example of how understanding heterogeneity within diabetes types can lead to precision medicine, since phenotype and treatment are affected by which gene is mutated. Heterogeneity also blurs the classic distinctions between diabetes types, and has led to the definition of additional categories, such as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, type 1.5 diabetes and ketosis-prone diabetes. Furthermore, monogenic diabetes shares many features with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which make diagnosis difficult. These challenges to the current classification framework in adult and paediatric diabetes require new approaches. The 'palette model' and the 'threshold hypothesis' can be combined to help explain the heterogeneity within and between diabetes types. Leveraging such approaches for therapeutic benefit will be an important next step for precision medicine in diabetes.

39448829,The epidemiology of type 1 diabetes mellitus in older adults.,"Although type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is traditionally viewed as a youth-onset disorder, the number of older adults being diagnosed with this disease is growing. Improvements in the average life expectancy of people with T1DM have also contributed to the growing number of older people living with this disease. We summarize the evidence regarding the epidemiology (incidence, prevalence and excess mortality) of T1DM in older adults (ages ≥60 years) as well as the genetics, immunology and diagnostic challenges. Several studies report an incidence peak of T1DM in older adults of a similar size to or exceeding that in children, and population prevalence generally increases with increasing age. Glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody positivity is frequently observed in adult-onset T1DM. Guidelines for differentiating T1DM from type 2 diabetes mellitus in older adults recommend measuring levels of C-peptide and autoantibodies, including glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies. However, there is no gold standard for differentiating T1DM from type 2 diabetes mellitus in people aged 60 years and over. As such, the global variation observed in T1DM epidemiology might be in part explained by misclassification, which increases with increasing age of diabetes mellitus onset. With a growing global population of older adults with T1DM, improved genetic and immunological evidence is needed to differentiate diabetes mellitus type at older ages so that a clear epidemiological picture can emerge.",Nature reviews.

However, patients with concurrent IDDM and SPS often manifest insulin resistance, and SPS-associated IDDM probably has heterogeneous causes. Some patients manifest IDDM associated only with high titers of anti-GAD65 caused by SPS. By contrast, other patients develop IDDM only after being treated with high-dose corticosteroids or they progress to insulin dependency following their treatment with high-dose corticosteroids. The profile of autoantibodies differs markedly between type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), late-onset diabetes mellitus, and SPS-associated IDDM. Therefore, as with new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT), SPS-associated IDDM should be classified as a specific diabetes entity, the pathophysiology of which requires increased attention.",Trends in endocrinology and metabolism: TEM,2023-Oct,Heneberg P,1,915,diabetes,2025-11-22

Various clinical trials and animal studies have shown the promising effect of Nrf2 pathway in reversing diabetes by counteracting with the oxidative stress produced. The gene is known to dissociate from Keap1 on coming in contact with such stresses to show preventive and prognosis effect. The Nrf2 gene has been marked as a molecular player in dealing with wide intracellular as well as extracellular cellular interactions in different diseases.

Diabetes mellitus is found to have an association with gut microbiota. Few animal studies are available linking the alteration of gut microbiota in diabetes mellitus. Probiotics have been found to have anti-diabetic properties. If diabetes is treated with diet modification in addition to drugs, it could change the spectrum of intestinal bacteria by boosting commensal bacteria and decreasing the harmful bacteria in the microbiome population of the gastrointestinal tract, which is highly beneficial. This could aid diabetics in managing diabetes mellitus and its complications effectively.

32815547,Epigenetic modification and therapeutic targets of diabetes mellitus.,"The prevalence of diabetes and its related complications are increasing significantly globally. Collected evidence suggested that several genetic and environmental factors contribute to diabetes mellitus. Associated complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy and other cardiovascular complications are a direct result of diabetes. Epigenetic factors include deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation and histone post-translational modifications. These factors are directly related with pathological factors such as oxidative stress, generation of inflammatory mediators and hyperglycemia. These result in altered gene expression and targets cells in the pathology of diabetes mellitus without specific changes in a DNA sequence. Environmental factors and malnutrition are equally responsible for epigenetic states. Accumulated evidence suggested that environmental stimuli alter the gene expression that result in epigenetic changes in chromatin. Recent studies proposed that epigenetics may include the occurrence of 'metabolic memory' found in animal studies. Further study into epigenetic mechanism might give us new vision into the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and related complication thus leading to the discovery of new therapeutic targets. In this review, we discuss the possible epigenetic changes and mechanism that happen in diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2 separately.

31886753,Monogenic Diabetes: Genetics and Relevance on Diabetes Mellitus Personalized Medicine.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complex disease with significant impression in today's world. Aside from the most common types recognized over the years, such as type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), recent studies have emphasized the crucial role of genetics in DM, allowing the distinction of monogenic diabetes. Authors did a literature search with the purpose of highlighting and clarifying the subtypes of monogenic diabetes, as well as the accredited genetic entities responsible for such phenotypes. The following subtypes were included in this literature review: maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) and maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD). So far, 14 subtypes of MODY have been identified, while three subtypes have been identified in NDM - transient, permanent, and syndromic. Despite being estimated to affect approximately 2% of all the T2DM patients in Europe, the exact prevalence of MODY is still unknown, accentuating the need for research focused on biomarkers. Consequently, due to its impact in the course of treatment, follow-up of associated complications, and genetic implications for siblings and offspring of affected individuals, it is imperative to diagnose the monogenic forms of DM accurately. Currently, advances in the genetics field allowed the recognition of new DM subtypes, which until now, were considered slight variations of the typical forms. Thus, it is imperative to act in the close interaction between genetics and clinical manifestations, to facilitate diagnosis and individualize treatment.",Current diabetes reviews,2020-,"Sousa M, Bruges-Armas J",2,1598,diabetes,2025-11-22

Diabetes mellitus is a serious and growing problem worldwide, and its prevalence continues to grow; it is the 12th leading cause of death. An association between diabetes mellitus and cancer has been suggested for more than 100 years. Diabetes is a common disease diagnosed among patients with cancer, and evidence indicates that approximately 8-18% of patients with cancer have diabetes, with investigations suggesting an association between diabetes and some particular cancers, increasing the risk for developing cancers such as pancreatic, liver, colon, breast, stomach, and a few others. Breast and colorectal cancers have increased from 20% to 30% and there is a 97% increased risk of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or endometrial cancer. On the other hand, a number of cancers and cancer therapies increase the risk of diabetes mellitus. Complications due to diabetes in patients with cancer may influence the choice of cancer therapy.

There exist differences among major society guidelines regarding the definition of HTN and target blood pressure (BP) levels. Recent basic and clinical research studies have shed light on pathophysiologic and genetic links between HTN and diabetes mellitus. Randomized controlled trials over the past 5 years have confirmed the favorable BP and cardiovascular risk reduction by antidiabetic agents. HTN and diabetes mellitus are 'silent killers' with rising global prevalence. The development of HTN and diabetes mellitus tracks each other over time. The coexistence of both clinical entities synergistically contributes to micro- and macro-vasculopathy along with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.

Diabetes mellitus can lead to acute and chronic systemic complications. Among them, a negative effect of diabetes mellitus on sperm quality and male/couple fertility has been suggested. However, available studies in diabetes mellitus men evaluated relatively small cohorts with discordant results. To evaluate the clinical evidences of the effects of diabetes mellitus on sperm quality and fertility outcomes. An extensive Medline search was performed identifying studies in the English language. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in infertile men ranges from 0.7% to 1.4%, while the prevalence of infertility in diabetes mellitus men, evaluated in a few studies, ranges from 35% to 51%. Male diabetes mellitus seems to play a negative effect on couple fecundity, while being childless or subfertile men might increase the risk of diabetes mellitus. Available cross-sectional studies investigating semen parameters and male sexual hormones in men with diabetes mellitus are heterogeneous, assessed relatively small cohorts, show often discordant results and frequently are not directly comparable to derive robust conclusions. Two meta-analyses support a negative effect of diabetes mellitus on sperm normal morphology and no effect on sperm total count, with contradictory results regarding other semen parameters. Considering only studies on type 1 diabetes mellitus men, meta-analyses support a negative effect of diabetes mellitus on sperm motility and no effect on sperm total count, with contradictory results regarding other semen parameters. The rate of children observed among type 1 diabetes mellitus men was lower than controls, especially in subjects with a longer diabetes mellitus duration. Couples with a diabetes mellitus male partner undergoing assisted reproduction techniques showed lower pregnancy rates than controls.

Moreover, existing anti-diabetic drugs inevitably bring adverse reactions, and the application of islet transplantation is often limited by the damage caused by oxidative stress after transplantation. Thus, new approaches are needed to combat the growing burden of diabetes mellitus. Anthocyanins are of great nutritional interest and have been documented that have beneficial effects on chronic diseases, including diabetes mellitus. Here, we describe the health effects of anthocyanins on diabetes mellitus and islet transplantation. Epidemiological studies demonstrated that moderate intake of anthocyanins leading to a reduction in risk of diabetes mellitus. Numerous experiments both animal and clinical studies also showed positive effects of anthocyanins on prevention and treatment of diabetes and diabetic complications. These effects of anthocyanins may be related to mechanisms of improving glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin resistance, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. In addition, damage and function of pancreatic islets after transplantation are also improved by anthocyanins.

Through detailed analysis of hormone responses to mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT), we aimed to find representing characteristics of post-acute pancreatitis diabetes mellitus (PPDM-A) and post-chronic pancreatitis diabetes mellitus (PPDM-C). Participants with PPDM-A, PPDM-C, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and normal controls (NCs) underwent MMTT. Fasting and postprandial responses of serum glucose, C-peptide, insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), ghrelin, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and peptide YY (PYY) were detected and compared among different groups. Focused analysis on calculated insulin sensitivity and secretion indices were performed to determine major causes of hyperglycemia in different conditions. Participants with PPDM-A were characterized by increased C-peptide, insulin, glucagon, and PP, but decreased ghrelin, GIP, and PYY compared with NCs. Patients with PPDM-C showed secretion insufficiency of C-peptide, insulin, ghrelin, and PYY, and higher postprandial responses of glucagon and PP than NCs. In particular, both fasting and postprandial levels of ghrelin in PPDM-C were significantly lower than other diabetes groups. PYY responses in patients with PPDM-A and PPDM-C were markedly reduced. Additionally, the insulin sensitivity of PPDM-A was decreased, and the insulin secretion for PPDM-C was decreased. Along with the continuum from acute to chronic pancreatitis, the pathological mechanism of PPDM changes from insulin resistance to insulin deficiency.

That transpired to be an overstatement, yet insulin has proven to be the lifesaver for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus and an essential therapy for many with type 2 diabetes mellitus or other forms of diabetes mellitus. Since its discovery, insulin (a molecule of only 51 amino acids) has been the subject of pharmaceutical research and development that has paved the way for other protein-based therapies. From purified animal-extracted insulin and human insulin produced by genetically modified organisms to a spectrum of insulin analogues, pharmaceutical laboratories have strived to tailor the preparations to the needs of patients. Nonetheless, overall glycaemic control often remains poor as exogenous insulin is still not able to mimic the physiological insulin profile. Circumventing subcutaneous administration and the design of analogues with profiles that mimic that of physiological insulin are ongoing areas of research. Novel concepts, such as once-weekly insulins or glucose-dependent and oral insulins, are on the horizon but their real-world effectiveness still needs to be proven.

However, the mechanistic, therapeutic and/or diagnostic implications of these observations are uncoordinated and possibly conflicting. This review critically analyses the scientific investigations connecting sialic acids with diabetes mellitus. Generally, variations in the levels and patterns of sialylation, fucosylation and galactosylation were predominant across various tissues and body systems of diabetic patients, but the immune system seemed to be most affected. These might be explored as a basis for differential diagnosis of various diabetic complications. Sialic acids are predominantly elevated in nearly all forms of diabetic conditions, particularly nephropathy and retinopathy, which suggests some diagnostic value but the mechanistic details were not unequivocal from the available data. The plausible mechanistic explanations for the elevated sialic acids are increased desialylation by sialidases, stimulation of hexosamine pathway and synthesis of acute phase proteins as well as oxidative stress. Additionally, sialic acids are also profoundly associated with glucose transport and insulin resistance in human-based studies while animal-based studies revealed that the increased desialylation of insulin receptors by sialidases, especially NEU1, might be the causal link. Interestingly, inhibition of the diabetes-associated NEU1 desialylation was beneficial in diabetes management and might be considered as a therapeutic target. It is hoped that the article will provide an informed basis for future research activities on the exploitation of sialic acids and glycobiology for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes against diabetes mellitus.",Glycobiology,2024-Jul,"Ibrahim MA, Isah MB, Inim MD, Abdullahi AD, Adamu A",5,1847,diabetes,2025-11-22
33978603,Bone health in diabetes: Indian perspective.,"Despite estimated 77 million people having diabetes, bone health in Asian Indians with diabetes is largely unknown. This review summarizes the published literature on fracture risk and factors affecting it in Asian Indians with diabetes. Data on fracture prevalence in diabetes is limited; one study showed that diabetes was associated with a significantly higher number of fractures compared with subjects without diabetes (4% vs. 2.4%, P < 0.05). The prevalence of osteoporosis in Asian Indians with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) varies from 35.5 to 49.5%. Studies have shown an increased, similar or lower areal bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and/or hip in patients with T2D compared to controls without diabetes. On the contrary, the BMD in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is modestly low compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls without diabetes. Recent studies have shown compromised mechanical, material and compositional properties of trabecular bone in Asian Indians with T2D suggesting deteriorated bone quality as one of the contributors of high fracture risk. Further research is needed to generate evidence-based guidelines to prevent and manage bone fragility in Asian Indians with diabetes.","Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",2021-Aug,"Pal R, Bhadada SK",2,1244,diabetes,2025-11-22

34356646,The Relationship between Diabetes Mellitus and Gastric Cancer and the Potential Benefits of Metformin: An Extensive Review of the Literature.,"The objective of this review is to summarize the findings of published research that investigated the relationship between diabetes mellitus and gastric cancer (GCa) and the potential benefits of metformin on GCa. Related literature has been extensively reviewed, and findings from studies investigating the relationship between diabetes mellitus and GCa suggest that hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are closely related to the development of GCa. Although not supported by all, most observational studies suggest an increased risk of GCa in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially in women and in Asian populations. Incidence of second primary malignancy diagnosed after GCa is significantly higher in diabetes patients. Diabetes patients with GCa may have more complications after gastrectomy or chemotherapy and they may have a poorer prognosis than patients with GCa but without diabetes mellitus. However, glycemic control may improve in the diabetes patients with GCa after receiving gastrectomy, especially after procedures that bypass the duodenum and proximal jejunum, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or Billroth II reconstruction. The potential links between diabetes mellitus and GCa may involve the interactions with shared risk factors (e.g., obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, high salt intake, smoking, etc.), <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (HP) infection, medications (e.g., insulin, metformin, statins, aspirin, proton pump inhibitors, antibiotics, etc.) and comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, vascular complications, heart failure, renal failure, etc.). With regards to the potential benefits of metformin on GCa, results of most observational studies suggest a reduced risk of GCa associated with metformin use in patients with T2DM, which can be supported by evidence derived from many in vitro and animal studies. Metformin use may also reduce the risk of HP infection, an important risk factor of GCa. In patients with GCa, metformin users may have improved survival and reduced recurrence. More studies are required to clarify the pathological subtypes/anatomical sites of GCa associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus or prevented by metformin, to confirm whether GCa risk can also be increased in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and to explore the possible role of gastric microbiota in the development of GCa.",Biomolecules,2021-Jul,Tseng CH,1,2412,diabetes,2025-11-22

The types of diabetes mellitus include type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gestational diabetes mellitus, and other specific types of diabetes mellitus. Many risk factors contribute to diabetes mellitus mainly including genetics, environment, obesity, and diet. In the recent years, gut microbiota has been shown to be linked to the development of diabetes. It has been reported that the gut microbiota composition of diabetic patients is different from that of healthy people. Although the mechanism behind the abnormality remains to be explored, most hypotheses focus on the inflammation response and leaky gut in relation to the changes in production of endotoxins and metabolites derived from the intestinal flora. Consequently, the above-mentioned abnormalities trigger a series of metabolic changes, gradually leading to development of hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and diabetes. This review is (i) to summarize the differences in gut microbiota between diabetic patients and healthy people, (ii) to discuss the underlying mechanism(s) by which how lipopolysaccharide, diet, and metabolites of the gut microbiota affect diabetes, and (iii) to provide a new insight in the prevention and treatment of diabetes.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2022-May,"Guo Z, Pan J, Zhu H, Chen ZY",4,1315,diabetes,2025-11-22

In Latin America, hypertension prevalence varies from 30 to 50%. Moreover, the proportion of awareness, treatment and control of hypertension is very low. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus varies from 8 to 13% and around 40% of patients are unaware of their condition. In addition, the prevalence of prediabetes varies from 6 to 14% and this condition has also been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. The principal factors linked to a higher risk of hypertension in Latin America are increased adiposity, low muscle strength, unhealthy diet, low physical activity and low education. Besides being chronic conditions, leading causes of cardiovascular mortality, both hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, represent a substantial cost for the weak health systems of Latin American countries. Therefore, it is necessary to implement and reinforce public health programs to improve awareness, treatment and control of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, in order to reach the mandate of the United Nations to decrease the premature mortality for CVD.",Current hypertension reviews,2021-,"Lopez-Jaramillo P, Lopez-Lopez J, Cohen D, Alarcon-Ariza N, Mogollon-Zehr M",5,1218,diabetes,2025-11-22

32681438,The Potential of Albuminuria as a Biomarker of Diabetic Complications.,"Diabetes mellitus is a disease of dysregulated blood glucose homeostasis. The current pandemic of diabetes is a significant driver of patient morbidity and mortality, as well as a major challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. The global increase in the incidence of diabetes has prompted researchers to focus on the different pathogenic processes responsible for type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Similarly, increased morbidity due to diabetic complications has accelerated research to uncover pathological changes causing these secondary complications. Albuminuria, or protein in the urine, is a well-recognised biomarker and risk factor for renal and cardiovascular disease. Albuminuria is a mediator of pathological abnormalities in diabetes-associated conditions such as nephropathy and atherosclerosis. Clinical screening and diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is chiefly based on the presence of albuminuria. Given the ease in measuring albuminuria, the potential of using albuminuria as a biomarker of cardiovascular diseases is gaining widespread interest. To assess the benefits of albuminuria as a biomarker, it is important to understand the association between albuminuria and cardiovascular disease. This review examines our current understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in both forms of diabetes, with specific focus on the link between albuminuria and specific vascular complications of diabetes.",Cardiovascular drugs and therapy,2021-Jun,"Raja P, Maxwell AP, Brazil DP",3,1429,diabetes,2025-11-22

Embase and Medline databases were searched for studies reporting the incidence rate (IR) of diabetes-related amputations from 2010 to 2020. IR estimates of diabetes-related amputations with associated 95% confidence interval (CI) per 100,000 individuals with diabetes were calculated. 23 studies were included, reporting 505,390 diabetes-related lower extremity amputations. IR of minor amputations was 139.97 (95% CI 88.18-222.16) per 100,000 individuals with diabetes, among patients with type 1 diabetes was 148.59 (95% CI 65.00-339.68) and in type 2 diabetes was 75.53 (95% CI 29.94-190.54). IR of major amputations was 94.82 (95% CI 56.62-158.80) per 100,000 individuals with diabetes, among patients with type 1 diabetes was 100.76 (95% CI 53.71-189.01) and among type 2 diabetes was 40.58 (95% CI 11.03-149.28).

33082551,The trials and tribulations of determining HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets for diabetes mellitus.,"Glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) is considered the gold standard for predicting glycaemia-associated risks for the microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus over 5-10 years. The value of HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the care of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is unassailable, yet HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets remain contentious. Guidelines from diabetes care organizations recommend conflicting HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets - generally between 6.5% and 8%. However, all such organizations advocate for individualization of HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets, leaving both health-care providers and their patients confused about what HbA<sub>1c</sub> target is appropriate in an individual patient. In this Review, we outline the landmark T1DM and T2DM trials that informed the current guidelines, we discuss the evidence that drives individualized HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets, we examine the limitations of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and we consider alternatives for monitoring glycaemic control. Ultimately, in synthesizing this literature, we argue for an HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of <7% for most individuals, but emphasize the importance of helping patients determine their own personal goals and determinants of quality of life that are independent of a particular glycaemic target. We also recognize that as newer technologies and anti-hyperglycaemic therapies emerge, glycaemic targets will continue to evolve.",Nature reviews.

Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia are two of the most widely recognized metabolic irregularities in diabetes and two of the most well-known reasons for diabetic intricacies. Diabetes mellitus is a persistent illness brought about by metabolic irregularities in hyperglycemic pancreatic cells. Hyperglycemia can be brought about by an absence of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas (Type 1 diabetes mellitus) or inadequate insulin creation that does not work effectively (Type 2 diabetes mellitus). Present diabetes medication directs blood glucose levels in the systemic circulation to the typical levels.

32096204,The role of gut microbiota in mediating obesity and diabetes mellitus.,"This review inspects the relations between the microbiota and the intestinal immune system in the advancement of metabolic illnesses, such as obesity and diabetes mellitus. The role of the microbiota in intestinal immune defense and the control of metabolism are subject to examination. In type 1 diabetes, the adhesion proteins prompt inside the intestinal epithelium prompt a more significant immune response that may result in the destruction of pancreatic β cells by CD8+ T-lymphocytes, as well as increased articulation of interleukin-17, which is associated with autoimmunity. Studies suggest that the beginning of metabolic ailments and certain co-morbidities can be viewed in light of the protection between the gut microbiota and the intestinal immune system. The gut microbiota is analyzed as a key regulator of metabolic ailments. Research demonstrates that obese patients with type 2 diabetes have a certain gut microbiota and that the microbiota is translocated from the gut to the tissues in conjunction with the illness, which instigates inflammation. Research in animals and people suggests that a probiotic supplement may regulate the gut microbiota, thereby improving the prognosis for diabetes. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon relates to a decrease in the inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress, as well as a decrease in leaky gut. Such reactions increase insulin sensitivity and reduce autoimmune responses.",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,2020-Feb,"Pitocco D, Di Leo M, Tartaglione L, De Leva F, Petruzziello C, Saviano A, Pontecorvi A, Ojetti V",8,1440,diabetes,2025-11-22
38000983,Association between unstable diabetes mellitus and risk of pancreatic cancer.,"Deterioration of glycaemic control in people with long-standing diabetes mellitus (diabetes) may be a possible indicator of pancreatic cancer. However, the magnitude of the association between diabetes deterioration and pancreatic cancer has received little attention. We conducted a matched cohort study, nested within a population-based cohort of Australian women with diabetes. Women with unstable diabetes, defined as a change in medication after a 2-year period of stable medication use, were matched by birth year to those with stable diabetes, in a 1:4 ratio. We used flexible parametric survival models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 134,954 and 539,789 women in the unstable and stable diabetes cohorts, respectively (mean age 68 years). In total, 1,315 pancreatic cancers were diagnosed. Deterioration of stable diabetes was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer (HR 2.55; 95% CI 2.29-2.85). The risk was particularly high within the first year after diabetes deteriorated. HRs at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year were: 5.76 (95% CI 4.72-7.04); 4.56 (95% CI 3.81-5.46); and 3.33 (95% CI 2.86-3.89), respectively. The risk was no longer significantly different after 7 years. Deterioration in glycaemic control in people with previously stable diabetes may be an indicator of pancreatic cancer, suggesting investigations of the pancreas may be appropriate. The weaker longer-term (3-7 years) association between diabetes deterioration and pancreatic cancer may indicate that poor glycaemic control can be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer.",Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

Health outcomes in pediatric diabetes are currently poor, with trends indicating that they are worsening. Minority racial/ethnic groups are disproportionately affected by suboptimal glucose control and have a higher risk of acute and chronic complications of diabetes. Correct clinical management starts with timely and accurate classification of diabetes, but in children this is becoming increasingly challenging due to high prevalence of obesity and shifting demographic composition. The growing obesity epidemic complicates classification by obesity's effects on diabetes. Since the prevalence and clinical characteristics of diabetes vary among racial/ethnic groups, migration between countries leads to changes in the distribution of diabetes types in a certain geographical area, challenging the clinician's ability to classify diabetes. These challenges must be addressed to correctly classify diabetes and establish an appropriate treatment strategy early in the course of disease for all. This may be the first step in improving diabetes outcomes across racial/ethnic groups. This review will discuss the pitfalls in the current diabetes classification scheme that is leading to increasing overlap between diabetes types and heterogeneity within each type. It will also present proposed alternative classification schemes and approaches to understanding diabetes type that may improve the timely and accurate classification of pediatric diabetes type.",Pediatric diabetes,2020-Nov,"Siller AF, Tosur M, Relan S, Astudillo M, McKay S, Dabelea D, Redondo MJ",7,1527,diabetes,2025-11-22

39280004,Association and causality between diabetes and activin A: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Activin A, a cytokine belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily, mediates a multifunctional signaling pathway that is essential for embryonic development, cell differentiation, metabolic regulation, and physiological equilibrium. Biomedical research using diabetes-based model organisms and cellular cultures reports evidence of different activin A levels between diabetic and control groups. Activin A is highly conserved across species and universally expressed among disparate tissues. A systematic review of published literatures on human populations reveals association of plasma activin A levels with diabetic patients in some (7) but not in others (5) of the studies. With summarized data from publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWASs), a two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) analysis is conducted on the causality between the exposure and the outcome. Wald ratio estimates from single instruments are predominantly non-significant. In contrast to positive controls between diabetes and plasma cholesterol levels, inverse-variance-weighted (IVW), Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode MR methods all lead to no observed causal link between diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and plasma activin A levels. Unavailability of strong instruments prevents the reversal MR analysis of activin A on diabetes. In summary, further research is needed to confirm or deny the potential association between diabetes and plasma activin A, and to elucidate the temporal incidence of these traits in human populations. At this stage, no causality has been found between diabetes and plasma activin A based on TSMR analysis.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,Wang M,1,1660,diabetes,2025-11-22
32498935,Adult-onset autoimmune diabetes in 2020: An update.,"An increasing number of new cases of autoimmune diabetes occur during adulthood. Most are cases of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), a form of autoimmune diabetes with older mean age at onset, slower rate of beta-cell loss and longer period of insulin independence after onset when compared with type 1 diabetes. Unfortunately, patients with LADA are often misdiagnosed as having type 2 diabetes, the most frequent form of adult-onset diabetes, and show a sustained poor glycemic control over time. Recent evidence shows that this translates into a significantly increased risk of complications. Therefore, an enhanced awareness of LADA is essential.

Beyond its primary respiratory impact, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been implicated in various extra-pulmonary complications. Research studies reveal that the virus affects multiple organs, including the kidneys, liver, pancreas, and central nervous system (CNS), largely due to the widespread expression of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors. Clinical evidence shows that the virus can induce diabetes by disrupting pancreatic and liver functions as well as cause acute kidney injury. Additionally, neurological complications, including cognitive impairments and neuroinflammation, have been observed in a significant number of COVID-19 patients. This review discusses the mechanisms linking SARS-CoV-2 to acute kidney injury, Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM and T2DM), emphasizing its effects on pancreatic beta cells, insulin resistance, and the regulation of gluconeogenesis. We also explore how SARS-CoV-2 induces neurological complications, detailing the intricate pathways of neuro-invasion and the potential to trigger conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). By elucidating the metabolic and neurological manifestations of COVID-19 and the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, this review underscores the imperative for continued research and the development of effective therapeutic interventions to mitigate the long-term and short-term impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",The Yale journal of biology and medicine,2024-Dec,"Nyarko JA, Dogbe PM, Ativi LAE, Wutsika J, Agyenim EB, Awere-Duodu A, Botaeng AT, Ntim NAA",8,1655,diabetes,2025-11-22

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the most prevalent type of diabetes mellitus, and it is associated with both hereditary and lifestyle risk factors. South Africa is not exempt from this pandemic; hence, this paper aims to assess the prevalence and determinants of household self-reported diabetes mellitus in Gauteng, South Africa. Data were sourced from the Gauteng City-Region Observatory (GCRO) quality of life survey (2020/2021). Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were applied. The prevalence of household self-reported diabetes mellitus in Gauteng was 11.1%. The 'other population' group (which included Whites, Coloureds and Indians), as well as older respondents, higher household monthly food expenditure, poor self-perceived health status and household self-reported hypertension were factors that increased the odds of household self-reported diabetes mellitus. Only informal housing decreased the odds of household self-reported diabetes mellitus. Screening of diabetes mellitus among those with poor living conditions, no medical aid and lack of access to healthcare facilities such as Gauteng township and informal settlement residents should be intensified.

39720253,Sclerostin as a new target of diabetes-induced osteoporosis.,"Sclerostin, a protein synthesized by bone cells, is a product of the <i>SOST</i> gene. Sclerostin is a potent soluble inhibitor of the WNT signaling pathway, and is known to inhibit bone formation by inhibiting osteocyte differentiation and function. Currently, sclerostin has been the subject of numerous animal experiments and clinical investigations. By conducting a literature review, we have gained insights into the most recent advancements in research. Patients with both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes have high levels of serum sclerostin. Patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are both more likely to suffer from osteoporosis, and serum sclerostin levels are elevated in osteoporosis. Many studies have confirmed that sclerostin has been implicated in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, so we speculate that sclerostin plays an important role in osteoporosis through the glucose metabolism pathway, which may promote the osteoporosis of morbidity in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Based on this, we propose whether serum sclerostin can predict type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes-induced osteoporosis, and whether it can be a new target for the prevention and treatment of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes-induced osteoporosis, providing new ideas for clinicians and researchers.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,"Li Y, Luo Y, Huang D, Peng L",4,1313,diabetes,2025-11-22

Early identification of patients with a higher risk of developing diabetes could allow to take timely measures. However, no validated model exists to predict the risk of post-transplant diabetes mellitus. This retrospective study includes 267 adult patients who underwent kidney transplantation at the Antwerp University Hospital between January 2014 and August 2021. Post-transplant diabetes mellitus was diagnosed based on the American Diabetes Association definition at 3 months post-transplant. First, a logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors for post-transplant diabetes mellitus. Second, criteria to identify patients with a high risk (> 35%) of developing post-transplant diabetes mellitus at 3 months were established. At 3 months post-transplantation, 54 (20.2%) patients developed post-transplant diabetes mellitus. Univariable analysis showed that age, body mass index and HbA1c on the day of transplantation were associated with post-transplant diabetes mellitus. However, in a multivariable model with the same parameters, only HbA1c remained statistically significant. An absolute increase in HbA1c of 0.1% increases the odds for developing post-transplant diabetes mellitus by 28% (95% confidence interval 1.15-1.42). An HbA1c level ≥ 5.3% at transplantation, regardless of age or body mass index, is sufficient to identify patients with a post-transplant diabetes mellitus risk of ≥ 35% with a positive predictive value of 39% and a negative predictive value of 88%. The HbA1c value at transplantation was the strongest predictor for post-transplant diabetes mellitus at 3 months post-transplant. Furthermore, at least in our population, a pre-transplant HbA1c of ≥ 5.3% can be used as an easy tool to identify patients at high risk of early post-transplant diabetes mellitus.",Journal of nephrology,2023-Sep,"Laghrib Y, Massart A, de Fijter JW, Abramowicz D, De Block C, Hellemans R",6,1974,diabetes,2025-11-22

This national study aimed to assess the prevalence and clinical aspects of diabetes mellitus in Lebanon with special focus on type 1 (T1DM). A national multistage, random household sample survey was conducted, using face-to-face interviews with 1 questionnaire per household. A total of 4500 households were selected from all areas based on a pre-existing sampling frame of the Lebanese population. The prevalence of previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus in the surveyed population of 17 832 persons (mean age ~36 years) was 7.95%. The prevalence of T1DM in particular was estimated at 0.1%, or almost 1% of all detected cases of diabetes mellitus. Most persons with diabetes mellitus reported obtaining their usual care from endocrinologists rather than primary healthcare physicians. Delayed performance of haemoglobin A1c test was reported in 25% of 1418 patients. Hypoglycaemic episodes recently occurred in 30% of patients; of whom, at least one third required medical attention, including hospital admission. Diagnosed complications were reported in 22% of cases, with retinopathy being the most common. Prevalence of T1DM in this population was lower than international estimates. Diabetes mellitus management appears to be deficient, based on delays in standard control testing, hypoglycaemic episodes and diabetes mellitus-related complications. Coordination of diabetic care management should be devolved to primary healthcare physicians, who can keep track of the need for referral to various types of diabetes mellitus care.",Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,2020-Feb,"Bou-Orm I, Adib S",2,1659,diabetes,2025-11-22
36509174,Trends in delivery hospitalizations with pregestational and gestational diabetes mellitus and associated outcomes: 2000-2019.,"Pregestational diabetes mellitus and its associated risks may be increasing in the obstetrical population. This study aimed to characterize the trends in delivery hospitalizations with pregestational diabetes mellitus, the prevalence of chronic diabetes complications, and the risk for adverse outcomes. This repeated, cross-sectional study used the United States National Inpatient Sample to identify delivery hospitalizations with pregestational diabetes mellitus between 2000 and 2019. Trends in delivery hospitalizations with pregestational diabetes mellitus were assessed using joinpoint regression to determine the average annual percent change. Trends in chronic diabetes complications, including chronic kidney disease, neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetic retinopathy, were also analyzed. The risk for adverse obstetrical outcomes was compared between patients with and those without pregestational diabetes mellitus using adjusted logistic regression models that were adjusted for demographic, clinical, and hospital characteristics with adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals as measures of association. Of 76.7 million delivery hospitalizations, 179,885 (0.23%) had type 1 diabetes mellitus, 430,544 (0.56%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus, and 99,327 (0.13%) had unspecified diabetes mellitus. From 2000 to 2019, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus increased from 1.8 to 7.3 per 1000 deliveries for type 2 diabetes mellitus (average annual percent change, 8.0%; 95% confidence interval, 6.9%-9.2%), from 1.5 to 3.2 per 1000 deliveries for unspecified diabetes mellitus (average annual percent change, 3.9%; 95% confidence interval, 1.4%-6.3%), and from 2.7 in 2000 to 2.8 per 1000 deliveries (average annual percent change, 0.2%; 95% confidence interval, -0.8% to 1.3%) for type 1 diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of chronic diabetes mellitus complications increased from 2.7% to 5.6% over the study period (average annual percent change, 5.9%; 95% confidence interval, 3.7%-8.0%). Pregestational diabetes mellitus was associated with severe maternal morbidity, cesarean delivery, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, preterm birth, and shoulder dystocia. Pregestational diabetes mellitus increased over the study period, driven by a quadrupling in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Notably, the prevalence of chronic diabetes mellitus complications doubled concomitantly. Pregestational diabetes mellitus was associated with a range of adverse outcomes.

34369715,Role of Heavy Metals in Diabetes: Mechanisms and Treatment Strategies.,"Toxic metals affecting metabolic pathways have a broad range in the ecosystem from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Because of constant contamination from waste and untreated chemical effluents, their emissions have risen significantly over the last few decades, quickly gaining attention due to their crucial role in the development of several metabolic disorders, notably diabetes mellitus. Cadmium and arsenic not only spread widely in our atmosphere but are also linked to a wide range of health hazards. These are primarily accumulated in the liver, kidney, and pancreas once they reach the human body, where they have deleterious effects on the metabolism of glucose and its association with other metabolic pathways, particularly glycolysis, glycogenesis, and gluconeogenesis, by altering and impairing the specific activity of major enzymes. Impairment of hepatic glucose homeostasis plays a crucial role in diabetes mellitus pathogenesis. Impaired liver and kidney functions, as well as decreased pancreatic and muscle function, also contribute significantly to elevated levels of blood glucose. Heavy metals have the potential to cause changes in the conformation in these enzymes. They also impair hormonal balance by destroying the pancreas and adrenal glands. Such metals often facilitate the development of reactive oxygen species and inhibit antioxidant defense mechanisms, with multiple organs subsequently damaged.

The increased incidence of this type of diabetes mellitus has corresponded tem-porally to unprecedented increases in body weight and obesity prevalence in adolescents in various ethnic populations. Early treatment of insulin resistance is important to prevent the development of diabetes. In therapy, lifestyle modification is essential for weight loss, and if this is not enough, pharmacotherapy is required. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), another type of insulin-dependent diabetes, is characterised by early onset and autosomal dominant inheritance. MODY is mainly caused by β-cell defects, resulting in insufficient insulin secretion for a given blood glucose level. Unlike non-insulin-dependent diabetes in youth (NIDDM-Y), there is no significant increase in insulin resistance. The purpose of this article is to characterise and present types of diabetes other than type 1 found in the young population.","Pediatric endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism",2024-,"Tekielak A, Otto-Buczkowska E, Rusak E",3,1120,diabetes,2025-11-22
32371764,Sympathetic neural abnormalities in type 1 and type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Microneurographic recordings of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) have shown that sympathetic activation may characterize diabetes mellitus. However, it is recognized that comorbidities and metabolic abnormalities frequently associated with both type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) diabetes affect MSNA, generating potential confounding effects and making the association between sympathetic activation and diabetes mellitus still a controversial matter. The present meta-analysis evaluated 11 microneurographic studies enrolling 314 diabetes mellitus patients and healthy controls, and MSNA was chosen as the main variable of interest. Collection of the data included indirect adrenergic markers such as heart rate and venous plasma noradrenaline, together with hemodynamic, anthropometric and metabolic variables. A total of 11 microneurographic studies were evaluated including 314 diabetes mellitus patients and controls. Diabetes mellitus displayed MSNA significantly greater than controls (mean difference amounting to 8.1, 95% confidence interval 1.21-15.08, P < 0.05). This difference was ascribed to T2DM, since T1DM patients displayed MSNA values superimposable to controls. In T2DM MSNA was directly related to age (r = 0.83, β = 0.82, P < 0.04) and plasma insulin (r = 1.00, β = 2.25, P < 0.01) but not to other variables. T2DM-related sympathetic activation is detectable even when obesity, hypertension and metabolic syndrome are excluded; not found in T1DM; not associated with anthropometric and hemodynamic variables; and related to plasma insulin.",Journal of hypertension,2020-Aug,"Grassi G, Biffi A, Dell'Oro R, Quarti Trevano F, Seravalle G, Corrao G, Perseghin G, Mancia G",8,1604,diabetes,2025-11-22
38833191,Diabetes and Infectious Diseases with a Focus on Melioidosis.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) leads to impaired innate and adaptive immune responses. This renders individuals with DM highly susceptible to microbial infections such as COVID-19, tuberculosis and melioidosis. Melioidosis is a tropical disease caused by the bacterial pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, where diabetes is consistently reported as the most significant risk factor associated with the disease. Type-2 diabetes is observed in 39% of melioidosis patients where the risk of infection is 13-fold higher than non-diabetic individuals. B. pseudomallei is found in the environment and is an opportunistic pathogen in humans, often exhibiting severe clinical manifestations in immunocompromised patients. The pathophysiology of diabetes significantly affects the host immune responses that play a critical role in fighting the infection, such as leukocyte and neutrophil impairment, macrophage and monocyte inhibition and natural killer cell dysfunction. These defects result in delayed recruitment as well as activation of immune cells to target the invading B. pseudomallei. This provides an advantage for the pathogen to survive and adapt within the immunocompromised diabetic patients. Nevertheless, knowledge gaps on diabetes-infectious disease comorbidity, in particular, melioidosis-diabetes comorbidity, need to be filled to fully understand the dysfunctional host immune responses and adaptation of the pathogen under diabetic conditions to guide therapeutic options.",Current microbiology,2024-Jun,"Uthaya Kumar A, Ahmad Zan M, Ng CL, Chieng S, Nathan S",5,1476,diabetes,2025-11-22

32450525,The application of metabolomics in investigating anti-diabetic activity of medicinal plants.,"Diabetes mellitus is the most prevalent endocrine disease in the world and is likely to be the major epidemic in human history. In current years, many modern anti-diabetic medicines have been produced and introduced into the markets, however, long-term treatment of diabetes using synthetic drugs is limited. Medicinal plants play a great role in the treatment of diabetes. Many medicinal plants and their related traditional treatments for diabetes are used throughout the world and represent promising alternatives for the management of diabetes treatment. Metabolomics researches on diabetes have contributed to many aspects of exploring biomarkers and understanding the progression of the disease at metabolic levels. In addition, in the last decade, a number of metabolomics studies have focused on investigating the action mechanism of various herbal medicines. This paper aims to highlight and review a series of metabolomics studies that carried out on the role of herbal medicines on obesity and diabetes, finding potential biomarkers and also characterizing the metabolic disturbances associated with diabetes development. The findings showed that the metabolism of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (glucose, pyruvate, lactate), TCA cycle (succinate, citrate, β-hydroxybutyrate, 2-oxoglutarate), lipid metabolism (acetoacetate, acetate) and amino acid metabolic pathways (valine, leucine, and isoleucine, hippurate, creatine) were more significantly disturbed metabolic pathways and biomarkers in diabetic models and herbal medicines affect these metabolic pathways by different mechanisms.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2020-Aug,"Hasanpour M, Iranshahy M, Iranshahi M",3,1594,diabetes,2025-11-22
38470045,Prolactin effects on the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus.,"Prolactin (PRL) is a pituitary hormone promoting lactation in response to the suckling reflex. Beyond its well-known effects, novel tissue-specific and metabolic functions of PRL are emerging. To dissect PRL as a critical mediator of whole-body gluco-insulinemic sensitivity. PubMed-based search with the following terms 'prolactin', 'glucose metabolism', 'type 2 diabetes mellitus', 'type 1 diabetes mellitus', 'gestational diabetes mellitus' was performed. The identification of the PRL-glucose metabolism network poses the basis for unprecedented avenues of research in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2, as well as of gestational diabetes. In this regard, it is of timely relevance to define properly the homeostatic PRL serum levels since glucose metabolism could be influenced by the circulating amount of the hormone. This review underscores the basic mechanisms of regulation of pancreatic β-cell functions by PRL and provides a revision of articles which have investigated the connection between PRL unbalancing and diabetes mellitus. Future studies are needed to elucidate the burden and the role of PRL in the regulation of glucose metabolism and determine the specific PRL threshold that may impact the management of diabetes. A careful evaluation and context-driven interpretation of PRL levels (e.g., pregnancy, PRL-secreting pituitary adenomas, drug-related hyper- and hypoprolactinemia) could be critical for the correct screening and management of glucometabolic disorders, such as type 1 or 2 as well as gestational diabetes mellitus.",European journal of clinical investigation,2024-Jun,"Scairati R, Auriemma RS, Del Vecchio G, Di Meglio S, Pivonello R, Colao A",6,1568,diabetes,2025-11-22

To explore this causal relationship in individuals of European descent, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study was conducted. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of DM was used to represent the exposure factor (T1DM: n = 24,840; T2DM: n = 215,654), and GWAS of OPC represented the outcome (n = 3,448). Forty-one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to T1DM and fifty-four SNPs related to T2DM were identified as effective instrumental variables (IVs) in the two-sample MR analyses. In IVW estimates, neither T1DM nor T2DM significantly contributed to an increased risk of OPC [T1DM: OR 1.0322 (95% CI 0.9718, 1.0963), P = 0.3033; T2DM: OR 0.9998 (95% CI 0.9995, 1.0002), P = 0.2858].

34313011,Prevalence and clinical characteristics of fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus in Korean adults: A multi-institutional joint research.,"We aimed to determine the hospital-based prevalence and clinical features of fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus in Korea. We identified all patients with diabetes who regularly visited the Endocrinology outpatient clinics at eight centers for a period >1 year between January 2012 and June 2017. We investigated their medical records retrospectively. During this period, 76,309 patients with diabetes had been regularly followed up. Among them, 913 (1.2%) patients had type 1 diabetes mellitus . There were 462 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus whose data at the time of the first diagnosis could be identified (359 and 103 with non-ketosis and ketosis onset, respectively). Of these, 15 (3.2% of type 1 diabetes mellitus, 14.6% of ketosis onset diabetes) patients had fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus. The median ages at diagnosis were 40 and 27 years in the fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus and non-fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus groups, respectively. The patients with fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus had higher body mass index, lower glycated hemoglobin and fasting/peak C-peptide, and lower frequent glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody-positive rate (P =0.0010) at diagnosis. Furthermore, they had lower glycated hemoglobin at the last follow-up examination than those with non-fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus. In this study, the prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus was 1.2% among all patients with diabetes, and that of fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus was 3.2% among those newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Due to the genetic etiology of monogenic diabetes, molecular genetic testing can be used for diagnosis and classification.<b>Areas covered</b>: In addition to first-generation molecular analyses, many large clinical laboratories are transitioning to multiplexed next-generation sequencing panels to simultaneously assess patients for several of the most common genetic mutations seen in monogenic diabetes. With expanded development and adoption of next-generation sequencing panels, particularly in reference to laboratory settings, diagnostic testing for monogenic diabetes has the potential to be more accessible to the patient population.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Although molecular diagnostic testing is becoming increasingly prevalent, it is crucial to identify patients most likely to benefit from molecular testing versus those whose disease can be diagnosed and characterized with more traditional, less costly laboratory analyses. The continuous evolution of clinical molecular testing will be echoed in the clinical laboratory analysis of monogenic diabetes and continue to improve the diagnostic capabilities for monogenic diabetes mellitus.",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,2020-Apr,Campbell MR,1,1351,diabetes,2025-11-22
35957839,A Big Role for microRNAs in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.,"Maternal diabetes is associated with pregnancy complications and poses a serious health risk to both mother and child. Growing evidence suggests that pregnancy complications are more frequent and severe in pregnant women with pregestational type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie the different types of maternal diabetes may lead to targeted strategies to prevent or reduce pregnancy complications. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs), one of the most common epigenetic mechanisms, have emerged as key players in the pathophysiology of pregnancy-related disorders including diabetes. This review aims to provide an update on the status of miRNA profiling in pregnancies complicated by maternal diabetes. Four databases, Pubmed, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, and Scopus were searched to identify studies that profiled miRNAs during maternal diabetes. A total of 1800 articles were identified, of which 53 are included in this review. All studies profiled miRNAs during GDM, with no studies on miRNA profiling during pregestational T1DM and T2DM identified. Studies on GDM were mainly focused on the potential of miRNAs to serve as predictive or diagnostic biomarkers. This review highlights the lack of miRNA profiling in pregnancies complicated by T1DM and T2DM and identifies the need for miRNA profiling in all types of maternal diabetes. Such studies could contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that link maternal diabetes type with pregnancy complications.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2022-,"Masete M, Dias S, Malaza N, Adam S, Pheiffer C",5,1618,diabetes,2025-11-22

All patients with peripheral artery disease and/or diabetes mellitus and infrapopliteal revascularization in the Department of Vascular Surgery, Turku University Hospital during 2007-2015 were included. Tibial atherosclerosis was categorized into crural index classes of I-IV. Of the 497 patients, 180 were insulin-treated diabetes mellitus, 94 non-insulin-treated diabetes mellitus, and 223 patients without diabetes mellitus groups (diabetes mellitus 55.1%). Insulin-treated diabetes mellitus was the most ill, youngest (insulin-treated diabetes mellitus-median: 72.4, interquartile range: 64.0-79.5 versus non-insulin-treated diabetes mellitus-76.0, interquartile range: 67.9-83.6 versus patients without diabetes mellitus-77.3, interquartile range: 68.5-83.7, <i>p</i> < 0.001), had the highest body mass index (insulin-treated diabetes mellitus-median: 27.7, interquartile range: 24.0-31.8 versus non-insulin-treated diabetes mellitus-26.3, interquartile range: 23.2-30.3 versus patients without diabetes mellitus-23.9, interquartile range: 21.5-26.9, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and Charlson comorbidity index (insulin-treated diabetes mellitus-65.6% versus non-insulin-treated diabetes mellitus-46.8% versus patients without diabetes mellitus-10.8%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). After endovascular revascularization, limb salvage was poorer for insulin-treated diabetes mellitus (<i>p</i> = 0.046) and non-insulin-treated diabetes mellitus groups (<i>p</i> = 0.011) compared to surgery, but not for patients without diabetes mellitus (<i>p</i> = 0.15).

However, diabetes mellitus negates this female advantage. The prevalence change of prediabetes (prediabetes mellitus) and diabetes mellitus and diabetes mellitus‒associated cardiovascular risk factors have not been clearly described in women before menopause. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (1999-2018), this study estimated the age-adjusted prevalence of prediabetes mellitus (2005-2018), diagnosed diabetes mellitus, and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus in premenopausal women. Logistic regression was used to examine cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, central obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia, associated with prediabetes mellitus, diagnosed diabetes mellitus, or undiagnosed diabetes mellitus in premenopausal women. The magnitude of the association among age-matched men and postmenopausal women was compared. The analysis was conducted in 2022. Premenopausal women experienced an increased prevalence of prediabetes mellitus and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus, contrasting with steady trends in all U.S. adults over the last 2 decades. Premenopausal women with prediabetes mellitus or diabetes mellitus (versus those with normoglycemia) have significant obesity risk, and the risk is equivalent to that among age-matched men and higher than that among postmenopausal women. The association between prediabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia was significant in premenopausal women only. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension associated with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus were significant in premenopausal women and men of the same age, respectively. Diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus was associated with hypertriglyceridemia in men and postmenopausal women, respectively. Premenopausal women had increased prediabetes mellitus and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus in the past 2 decades.

36056854,Protein Uncoupling as an Innovative Practice in Diabetes Mellitus Treatment: A Metabolic Disorder.,"Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are unpaired electron carriers that uncouple oxygen intake by the electron transport chain from ATP production in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. The physiological activities of UCPs have been hotly contested, and the involvement of UCPs in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetes mellitus is among the greatest concerns. UCPs are hypothesised to be triggered by superoxide and then reduce mitochondrial free radical production, potentially protecting diabetes mellitus patients who are experiencing oxidative stress. The objectives of the study are to find out the newest ways to treat diabetes mellitus through protein uncoupling. Research and review papers are collected from different databases like google scholar, PubMed, Mendeley, Scopus, Science Open, Directory of open access journals, and Education Resources Information Center, using different keywords such as ""uncoupling proteins in diabetes mellitus treatment"", ""UCP 1"", ""UCP 2"", and 'UCP 3"". UCP1, UCP2, and UCP 3 are potential targets as uncoupling proteins for the treatment of diabetes mellitus for new drugs. New drugs treat the disease by reducing oxidative stress through thermogenesis and energy expenditure. UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3 have a role in fatty acid metabolism, negative control of insulin production, and insulin sensitivity by beta-cells. Polymorphisms in the UCP 1, 2, and 3 genes significantly reduce the risk of developing diabetes mellitus. Protein uncoupling indirectly targets the GPCR and islet of Langerhans.

35616045,Serological markers of intestinal barrier impairment do not correlate with duration of diabetes and glycated hemoglobin in adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Growing evidence suggests that diabetes mellitus is associated with impairment of the intestinal barrier. However, it is not clear so far if the impairment of the intestinal barrier is a consequence of prolonged hyperglycemia or the consequence of external factors influencing the gut microbiota and intestinal mucosa integrity. Aim of the study was to perform an estimation of relationship between serological markers of impairment of the intestinal barrier: intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), cytokeratin 18 caspase-cleaved fragment (cCK-18), and soluble CD14 (sCD14) and markers of prolonged hyperglycemia, such as the duration of diabetes mellitus and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) via a correlation analysis in patients with diabetes mellitus. In 40 adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 30 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus the estimation has been performed. Statistically significant positive correlation was found between cCK-18 and HbA1c (r=0.5047, p=0.0275) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus with fading insulitis (T1D). In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus with ongoing insulitis (T1D/INS) and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), no statistically significant positive correlations were found between serological markers of intestinal barrier impairment (I-FABP, cCK-18, sCD14) and duration of diabetes or levels of HbA1c. Similarly, in cumulative cohort of patients with T1D/INS and patients with T1D we revealed statistically positive correlation only between HbA1c and cCK-18 (r=0.3414, p=0.0311). Surprisingly, we found statistically significant negative correlation between the duration of diabetes mellitus and cCK-18 (r=-0.3050, p=0.0313) only in cumulative group of diabetic patients (T1D, T1D/INS, and T2D). Based on our results, we hypothesize that the actual condition of the intestinal barrier in diabetic patients is much more dependent on variable interactions between host genetic factors, gut microbiota, and environmental factors rather than effects of long-standing hyperglycemia (assessed by duration of diabetes mellitus or HbA1c).",Physiological research,2022-Aug,"Hoffmanová I, Sánchez D, Szczepanková A, Hábová V, Tlaskalová-Hogenová H",5,2120,diabetes,2025-11-22

35786198,Role of Macrophage in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Macrophage Polarization a New Paradigm for Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus are usually associated with meta-inflammation. β-cell failure is a marked feature observed in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a heterogeneous situation that is accompanied by not only defective insulin secretion but also peripheral insulin resistance. β-cells are the primary organ for insulin secretion; hence, it is crucial to maintain a significant β-cell mass in response to a variety of changes. Insulin resistance is a chief cause of T2DM, leading to increased free fatty acid (FFA) levels, which in turn elevates β-cell mass and insulin secretion as compensation for insulin insensitivity. It has recently been established that amplified numbers of innate immune cells, cytokines, and chemokines result in detrimental effects on islets in chronic conditions. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is the lymphokine that prevents arbitrary migration of macrophages and assembles macrophages at inflammatory loci. Inflammation is known to trigger monocytes to differentiate into macrophages. Progress of complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, as indicated through recent findings, is also dependent on the buildup of macrophages in tissues vulnerable to diabetic injury. The present article scientifically evaluates the present knowledge concerning the mechanisms of monocyte and macrophage-mediated injury recruitment in complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It also describes some of the established and experimental therapies that might bring about a reduction in these inflammatory complications. Recent discoveries in the field of drug delivery have facilitated phenotype-specific targeting of macrophages. This review highlights the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus, how macrophage induces type 2 diabetes mellitus and potential therapeutics for type 2 diabetes mellitus via macrophage-specific delivery.","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2023-,"Banu S, Sur D",2,1969,diabetes,2025-11-22
38089620,Advantages of omics approaches for elucidating metabolic changes in diabetic peripheral neuropathy.,"Various animal and cell culture models of diabetes mellitus (DM) have been established and utilized to study diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). The divergence of metabolic abnormalities among these models makes their etiology complicated despite some similarities regarding the pathological and neurological features of DPN. Thus, this study aimed to review the omics approaches toward DPN, especially on the metabolic states in diabetic rats and mice induced by chemicals (streptozotocin and alloxan) as type 1 DM models and by genetic mutations (MKR, db/db and ob/ob) and high-fat diet as type 2 DM models. Omics approaches revealed that the pathways associated with lipid metabolism and inflammation in dorsal root ganglia and sciatic nerves were enriched and controlled in the levels of gene expression among these animal models. Additionally, these pathways were conserved in human DPN, indicating the pivotal pathogeneses of DPN. Omics approaches are beneficial tools to better understand the association of metabolic changes with morphological and functional abnormalities in DPN.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2023-,"Yako H, Niimi N, Takaku S, Sango K",4,1090,diabetes,2025-11-22

39872315,A trend of osteocalcin in diabetes mellitus research: bibliometric and visualization analysis.,"Osteocalcin has attracted attention for its potential role in diabetes management. However, there has been no bibliometric assessment of scientific progress in this field. We analysed 1680 articles retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) between 1 January 1986 and 10 May 2024 using various online tools. These papers accumulated 42,714 citations,with an average of 25.43 citations per paper. Publication output increased sharply from 1991 onwards. The United States and China are at the forefront of this research area. The keywords were grouped into four clusters: 'Differential and functional osteocalcin genes', 'Differential expression of osteocalcin genes in relation to diabetes mellitus', 'Role of osteocalcin in the assessment of osteoporosis and diabetes mellitus', and 'Indirect involvement of osteocalcin in metabolic processes'. Analysis using the VoS viewer suggests a shift in research focus towards the correlation between osteocalcin levels and diabetic complications, the clinical efficacy of therapeutic agents or vitamins in the treatment of osteoporosis in diabetic patients, and the mechanisms by which osteocalcin modulates insulin action. The proposed focus areas are ""osteocalcin genes"", ""insulin regulation and osteoporosis "", ""different populations"", ""diabetes-related complications"" and ""type 2 diabetes mellitus"",""effect of osteocalcin expression on insulin sensitivity as well as secretion"",""osteocalcin expression in different populations of diabetic patients and treatment-related studies"".",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,"Liu Z, Mao Y, Yang K, Wang S, Zou F",5,1540,diabetes,2025-11-22

This study included 37 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus aged ≥65 years and 37 age- and sex-matched patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with dementia scoring <24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination were excluded. General cognition, memory, classic, and practical executive function were investigated. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus demonstrated lower psychomotor speed scores on Trail Making Tests A and B (P < 0.001, P < 0.013) than those with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The dysexecutive syndrome behavioral assessment revealed similar results in patients with types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus. The Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised verbal episodic memory and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Japanese version were similar in terms of general cognition, but worse delayed recall subset on the latter was associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (P = 0.038). A worse Trail Making Test-A performance was associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus and age (P < 0.004, P < 0.029). Executive function of psychomotor speed was worse in older outpatient adults without dementia with type 1 diabetes mellitus than in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus but with no significant differences in the comprehensive and practical behavioral assessment of dysexecutive syndrome.

The 2021 Norbert Freinkel Award Lecture.,"The field of diabetes in pregnancy has witnessed tremendous changes over the past 30 years, with an explosive growth in case numbers along with new and exciting opportunities to affect outcomes. Type 1 diabetes in pregnancy has increased by 40%, but type 2 diabetes in pregnancy, rarely seen 30 years ago, has more than doubled and, in some cases, tripled in prevalence. Compared with women with type 2 diabetes, women with type 1 diabetes have higher HbA1c, more large-for-gestational-age infants, and more preterm births. Women with type 2 diabetes have more chronic hypertension, more socioeconomic deprivation, and higher rates of perinatal mortality. Large randomized trials in women with diabetes in pregnancy have helped us understand the effectiveness of new technologies (i.e., continuous glucose monitoring) in women with type 1 diabetes, and the addition of metformin to insulin in women with type 2 diabetes, in improving pregnancy outcomes. Future endeavors, including artificial pancreas systems in women with type 1 diabetes and the use of continuous glucose monitoring, a better understanding of nutrition during pregnancy, and approaches to improve preconception and pregnancy self-care in women with type 2 diabetes, may lead to further improved outcomes.",Diabetes care,2022-Nov,Feig DS,1,1273,diabetes,2025-11-22

32874422,Imminent risk of COVID-19 in diabetes mellitus and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus patients.,"Diabetes mellitus is a non-infectious disease and has affected about 425 million adults globally and nearly 15.9 million of them reside in Africa. Moreover, the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus is very high in Africa and approximates to around 62%. Nearly 75% of the total deaths due to diabetes are in individuals lesser than 60 years of age. The multifaceted disease of diabetes mellitus produces chronic complications such as, neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, microangiopathy etc. These patients of diabetes mellitus are more susceptible to infections due to compromised immune system. Hence these patients of diabetes mellitus and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 infections. The dual impact of pathophysiology of COVID-19 infections in diabetes mellitus may increase morbidity and mortality in these patients. Hence there is need of health awareness in diabetics as well in the high-risk group for diabetes such as persons with hypertension and obesity. The scarcity of health resources, shortage of trained medical personnel and disease burden of infectious and non-infectious diseases has laid a heavy impact on the economy in Africa and this has been further strained due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The practice of preventive measures by the risk group of Undiagnosed Diabetes Mellitus patients will prevent them from getting infected by COVID-19 and at the same time decrease mortality rates and hence the undiscovered group that is the patients of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus needs to be vigilant regarding safe preventive practices.",The Pan African medical journal,2020-,"John JE, John NA",2,1601,diabetes,2025-11-22

An age-structured mathematical model was used to characterize type 2 diabetes mellitus epidemiology and trends in Oman between 1990 and 2050. The model was parametrized using current and quality data, including six nationally representative population-based epidemiological surveys for type 2 diabetes mellitus and its key risk factors. The projected type 2 diabetes mellitus prevalence increased from 15.2% in 2020 to 23.8% in 2050. The prevalence increased from 16.8 and 13.8% in 2020 among women and men to 26.3 and 21.4% in 2050, respectively. In 2020, 190,489 Omanis were living with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with 570,227 in 2050. The incidence rate per 1,000 person-years changed from 8.3 in 2020 to 12.1 in 2050. Type 2 diabetes mellitus' share of Oman's national health expenditure grew by 36% between 2020 and 2050 (from 21.2 to 28.8%). Obesity explained 56.7% of type 2 diabetes mellitus cases in 2020 and 71.4% in 2050, physical inactivity explained 4.3% in 2020 and 2.7% in 2050, whereas smoking accounted for <1% of type 2 diabetes mellitus cases throughout 2020-2050. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses affirmed these predictions. The type 2 diabetes mellitus epidemic in Oman is expected to increase significantly over the next three decades, consuming nearly one-third of the national health expenditure. The type 2 diabetes mellitus burden is heavily influenced by obesity. Interventions targeting this single risk factor should be a national priority to reduce and control the burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Oman.",Journal of diabetes investigation,2021-Jul,"Awad SF, Al-Mawali A, Al-Lawati JA, Morsi M, Critchley JA, Abu-Raddad LJ",6,1663,diabetes,2025-11-22

37015918,Discovery of IHMT-MST1-39 as a novel MST1 kinase inhibitor and AMPK activator for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.,"Insulin-producing pancreatic β cell death is the fundamental cause of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and a contributing factor to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Moreover, metabolic disorder is another hallmark of T2D. Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 (MST1) contributes to the progression of diabetes mellitus through apoptosis induction and acceleration of pancreatic β cell dysfunction. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy sensing kinase and its activation has been suggested as a treatment option for metabolic diseases. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of MST1 and activation of AMPK simultaneously represents a promising approach for diabetes therapy. Here, we discovered a novel selective MST1 kinase inhibitor IHMT-MST1-39, which exhibits anti-apoptosis efficacy and improves the survival of pancreatic β cells under diabetogenic conditions, as well as primary pancreatic islets in an ex vivo disease model. Mechanistically, IHMT-MST1-39 activated AMPK signaling pathway in hepatocytes in vitro, combination of IHMT-MST1-39 and metformin synergistically prevented hyperglycemia and significantly ameliorated glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in diabetic mice.

39106207,Monogenic Diabetes: A Comprehensive Overview and Therapeutic Management of Subtypes of Mody.,"Monogenic diabetes often occurs as a result of single-gene mutations. The illness is minimally affected by environmental and behavioral factors, and it constitutes around one to five percent of all cases of diabetes. Newborn diabetes mellitus (NDM) and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) are the predominant causes of monogenic diabetes, accounting for a larger proportion of cases, while syndromic diabetes represents a smaller percentage. MODY, a group of inherited non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus disorders, is quite common. However, it remains frequently misdiagnosed despite increasing public awareness. The condition is characterized by insulin resistance, the development of diabetes at a young age (before 25 years), mild high blood sugar levels, inheritance in an autosomal dominant pattern, and the preservation of natural insulin production. Currently, there are 14 distinct subtypes of MODY that have been identified. Each subtype possesses distinct characteristics in terms of their frequency, clinical symptoms, severity of diabetes, related complications, and response to medicinal interventions. Due to the clinical similarities, lack of awareness, and high expense of genetic testing, distinguishing between type I (T1D) and type II diabetes mellitus (T2D) can be challenging, resulting in misdiagnosis of this type of diabetes. As a consequence, a significant number of individuals are being deprived of adequate medical attention. Accurate diagnosis enables the utilization of novel therapeutic strategies and enhances the management of therapy in comparison to type II and type I diabetes. This article offers a concise overview of the clinical subtypes and characteristics of monogenic diabetes. Furthermore, this article discusses the various subtypes of MODY, as well as the process of diagnosing, managing, and treating the condition.

38870560,Incretin therapy in feline diabetes mellitus - A review of the current state of research.,"Incretin hormones potentiate the glucose-induced insulin secretion following enteral nutrient intake. The best characterised incretin hormones are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) which are produced in and secreted from the gut in response to nutrient ingestion. The property of incretins to enhance endogenous insulin secretion only at elevated blood glucose levels makes them interesting therapeutics for type 2 diabetes mellitus with a better safety profile than exogenous insulin. While incretin therapeutics (especially GLP-1 agonists, and more recently also GLP-1 / GIP dual agonists and other drugs that influence the incretin metabolism (e.g., dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors)) are already widely used treatment options for human type 2 diabetes, these drugs are not yet approved for the therapy of feline diabetes mellitus. This review provides an introduction to incretins and feline diabetes mellitus in general and summarises the current study situation on incretins as therapeutics for feline diabetes mellitus to assess their possible future potential in feline medicine. Studies to date on the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) in healthy cats largely confirm their insulinotropic effect known from other species. In diabetic cats, GLP-1RAs appear to significantly reduce glycaemic variability (GV, an indicator for the quality of glycaemic control), which is important for the management of the disease and prevention of long-term complications. However, for widespread use in feline diabetes mellitus, further studies are required that include larger numbers of diabetic cats, and that consider and test a possible need for dose adjustments to overweight and diabetic cats.

Based on the hygiene hypothesis, a growing body of evidence suggests a negative association between parasitic infections and diabetes in humans and animal models. The mechanism of parasite-mediated prevention of type 1 diabetes mellitus may be related to the adaptive and innate immune systems. Macrophage polarization is a new paradigm for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus, and different host macrophage subsets play various roles during parasite infection. Proinflammatory cytokines are released by M1 macrophages, which are important in the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Parasite-activated M2 macrophages prevent the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus and can influence the development of adaptive immune responses through several mechanisms, including Th2 cells and regulatory T cells.

To study neuropathy severity, the method of electroneuromyography was used; the velocities of motor and sensory excitation propagation along the caudal nerve fibers were measured. In modeled diabetes mellitus against the background of hyperglycemia, a marked decrease in motor and sensory propagation rates was observed, and an increase in the response durations was noted from week 12 to week 24, indicating pronounced neuropathy. In the fructose model, the motor response duration increased from week 12, which possibly indicates the development of peripheral neuropathy.",Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,2024-Aug,"Ivanov EV, Akhmetshina MR, Gizatulina AR, Gavrilova SA",4,970,diabetes,2025-11-22
33483027,The role of polysaccharides from natural resources to design oral insulin micro- and nanoparticles intended for the treatment of Diabetes mellitus: A review.,"Oral administration of insulin (INS) would represent a revolution in the treatment of diabetes, considering that this route mimics the physiological dynamics of endogenous INS. Nano- and microencapsulation exploiting the advantageous polysaccharides properties has been considered an important technological strategy to protect INS against harsh conditions of gastrointestinal tract, in the same time that improve the permeability via transcellular and/or paracellular pathways, safety and in some cases even selectivity for targeting delivery of INS. In fact, some polysaccharides also give to the systems functional properties such as pH-responsiveness, mucoadhesiveness under specific physiological conditions and increased intestinal permeability. In general, all polysaccharides can be functionalized with specific molecules becoming more selective to the cells to which INS is delivered. The present review highlights the advances in the past 10 years on micro- and nanoencapsulation of INS exploiting the unique natural properties of polysaccharides, including chitosan, starch, alginate, pectin, and dextran, among others.",Carbohydrate polymers,2021-Mar,"Meneguin AB, Silvestre ALP, Sposito L, de Souza MPC, Sábio RM, Araújo VHS, Cury BSF, Chorilli M",8,1130,diabetes,2025-11-22

Insulin-treated patients (n=115) previously diagnosed with T2DM had to be re-classified based on clinical phenotype and laboratory results, and were operationally defined as having an ambiguous diabetes type. They were compared against patients with definite T1DM and T2DM regarding 12 clinical and laboratory features typically different between diabetes types. Characteristics of patients with ambiguous diabetes type, representing approximately 6% of all patients with T1DM or T2DM seen at our specialized clinic, fell in between those of patients with definite T1DM and T2DM, both regarding individual features and with respect to a novel classification based on multi-variable regression analysis (P<0.0001). In conclusion, a substantial proportion of diabetes patients in a tertiary care centre presented with an ""ambiguous"" diabetes type.

However, the exact link between cognitive dysfunction and diabetes mellitus is still vague. This study aims to investigate some of the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment that associates diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance. We investigated the role of resveratrol as well on cognitive function in experimentally induced type 2 diabetes highlighting on its influence on the expression of brain miRNA 21. Resveratrol is a naturally occurring, biologically active compound that has numerous significant impacts on the body. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was induced by high fat diet followed a single dose of streptozotocin. Diabetic rats were treated with resveratrol for four weeks. Rats were sacrificed after neurobehavioral testing. Hippocampal tissues were used to assess expression of miRNA 21, GSK and oxidative stress markers. Serum samples were obtained to determine glucose levels, lipid profile and insulin levels. Hippocampal and serum AGEs were measured as well and HOMA IR was calculated. We detected memory impairment and disturbed insulin signaling in diabetic rats. These derangements were reversed by resveratrol treatment partially due to increased expression of miRNA-21. Our study pins the role of miRNA-21 in modulating brain insulin signaling and hence alleviating cognitive dysfunction accompanying diabetes mellitus.",Metabolic brain disease,2022-Oct,"El-Sayed NS, Elatrebi S, Said R, Ibrahim HF, Omar EM",5,1458,diabetes,2025-11-22

There are very few researches from Nepal that have evaluated the association of type-2 diabetes mellitus and thyroid dysfunction. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and spectrum of thyroid dysfunctions among type-2 diabetes mellitus patients. This was cross-sectional study conducted among 204 type-2 diabetes mellitus patients visiting the internal medicine department of a tertiary center located in Kathmandu, Nepal. The prevalence of thyroid disorders in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus was 27.94%. Subclinical hypothyroidism, which occurred in 14.71% of patients, was the most common thyroid disorder. The longer duration of diabetes, more than ten years, was associated with the increased thyroid disorders (p=0.025). The poor glycemic control, HbA1c ≥ 7%, was associated with significantly increased prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in type-2 diabetes mellitus patients (p=0.002). Female patients had higher prevalence of thyroid disorders than males, but this association was not statistically significant. The higher prevalence of thyroid disorders among patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus highlights the importance of screening type-2 diabetes mellitus patients for the presence of thyroid disorders.",Journal of Nepal Health Research Council,2023-Jul,"Ghimire S, Sangroula P, K C I, Deo RK, Ghimire S, Dhonju K",6,1372,diabetes,2025-11-22

The crosstalk between gut microbiota and host metabolism is closely related to T2DM. Currently, fragmented data hamper defining the relationship between probiotics and T2DM. This systematic review aimed at investigating the effects of probiotics on T2DM in animal models. We systematically reviewed preclinical evidences using PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases, recovering 24 original articles published until September 27th, 2019. This systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. We included experimental studies with animal models reporting the effects of probiotics on T2DM. Studies were sorted by characteristics of publications, animal models, performed analyses, probiotic used and interventions. Bias analysis and methodological quality assessments were examined through the SYRCLE's Risk of Bias tool. Probiotics improved T2DM in 96% of the studies. Most studies (96%) used Lactobacillus strains, and all of them led to improved glycaemia. All studies used rodents as models, and male animals were preferred over females. Results suggest that probiotics have a beneficial effect in T2DM animals and could be used as a supporting alternative in the disease treatment. Considering a detailed evaluation of the reporting and methodological quality, the current preclinical evidence is at high risk of bias.

We investigated the retinal, cognitive, and metabolic alterations in a Type II diabetic model induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and low-dose STZ (30 mg/kg). Long Evans rats were assigned to naïve control, HFD, or HFD+STZ groups. Diabetic rats were further stratified into Type I and Type II based on metabolic assessments. Optomotor response (OMR, visual function), electroretinograms (retinal function), and Y-maze (cognitive function) were tested. Serum was analyzed for 12 metabolic markers using a multiplex panel. Type I rats showed severe increases in blood glucose accompanied by impairments in insulin and glucose tolerance, reduced bodyweight, and low insulin levels. In contrast, Type II rats showed moderate changes in blood glucose and insulin and glucose tolerance with weights and insulin levels similar to naïve controls. Type I and II rats showed OMR deficits (p<0.05) and electroretinogram changes (p<0.05). No cognitive deficits were observed. Type I rats displayed reduced serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), C-Peptide, and leptin (p<0.05), and alterations in C-Peptide, PYY, and glucagon levels correlated with retinal function changes (p<0.05).

32539915,Recent clinical advances of glucokinase activators in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2.,"Glucokinase (GK) is an isozyme of hexokinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose. GK is present in many organs of the human body, including the liver and pancreas. GK plays an important role in promoting the synthesis of hepatic glycogen and balancing postprandial blood glucose. Mutations in the GK gene can result in the inclusion of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY2) and permanent neonatal Diabetes mellitus (PNDM). Glucokinase activators (GKAs) are a class of type 2 diabetes drugs designed for this target. In various animal models of type 2 diabetes, GKAs have been shown to have the ability to decrease blood glucose, and some GKAs also have the ability to stimulate β cell proliferation. However, due to the induction of hypoglycemia and increased liver burden, many candidates stopped in phase II clinical trials. Recently, dorzagliatin has reached the primary endpoint of phase III clinical trial, which can repair the core function of GK as a blood glucose sensor, and can delay or even reverse islet β -cell damage and functional decline. This provides a promising prospect for the study of GKAs as candidates for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

31014937,Levels of cytokines and GADA in type I and II diabetic patients.,"Diabetes Mellitus is described as a group of metabolic diseases in which the patient has higher blood glucose levels due to many causes. These include a defect in insulin secretion and failure of the body's cells to respond to the hormone. Cytokines and autoantibodies have a critical role in the pathogenesis of diabetes, especially type I. The aim of this study was to measure the serum levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 β), interleukin-3 (IL-3), interferon-gamma (INF- γ), and glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody (GADA) in patients with type I and type II diabetes mellitus. In this cross-sectional study, serum samples were taken from 250 individuals, including 100 samples from patients with type II diabetes mellitus, 100 samples from healthy controls, and 50 samples from patients with type I diabetes mellitus. Five milliliters of venous blood were taken from each individual and the samples were analyzed for cytokines (IL-1 β, IL-3, and INF- γ) and GABA using ELISA. In the study, we found that the serum levels of IL-1 β were significantly higher in the healthy control group compared to the patients with type I and type II diabetes mellitus. The levels of IL-3 and INF- γ were significantly higher in type II diabetes mellitus, while GABA serum levels were higher in type I diabetes mellitus. Our data showed that GADA is an important autoantibody, not only in type I but also in type II diabetes mellitus and can probably be used in the future for diagnosis of this disease. There was also a close association of GADA with systemic immunoregulation in type I and II diabetes mellitus. The relation of cytokines (IL-1 β, IL-3, and INF- γ) and GADA in patients with diabetes will also increase our understanding for the immunology of diabetes mellitus and to propose specific treatment on the basis of our findings.

32510127,DhHP-6 ameliorates hepatic oxidative stress and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus through the PI3K/AKT and AMPK pathway.,"Insulin resistance is one major features of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Deuterohemin-βAla-His-Thr-Val-Glu-Lys (DhHP-6), a novel microperoxidase mimetic designed and synthesized based on microperoxidase 11 (MP-11), can scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo. In our previous studies, we showed that oral DhHP-6 could reduce blood glucose and improve insulin resistance. To investigate the mechanisms of how DhHP-6 ameliorates oxidative stress and insulin resistance, we established T2DM mouse models and glucosamine-induced HepG2 cell insulin resistance models. The results suggested that DhHP-6 decreased blood glucose, increased antioxidant enzyme activity, and inhibited glycogen synthesis in T2DM mice. In addition, DhHP-6 improved insulin resistance by activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway in T2DM mice. Furthermore, DhHP-6 also activated PI3K/AKT and AMPK pathway in glucosamine-induced HepG2 cells. However, LY294002 did not completely inhibit AKT phosphorylation, and partially inhibited AMPK phosphorylation, whilst compound C only partially reduced AMPK phosphorylation, and also partially inhibited AKT phosphorylation, suggesting that AKT and AMPK interact to improve insulin resistance.

Metformin had a weak effect on steroidogenesis, but was not inferior to luteinizing hormone receptor agonist by its restorative effect on spermatogenesis and also reduced the number of defective forms of spermatozoa. Thus, the spermatogenesis-restoring effect of metformin and luteinizing hormone receptor agonist in type 2 diabetes mellitus are comparable, despite different mechanisms of action.",Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,2022-Feb,"Derkach KV, Bakhtyukov AA, Morina IY, Romanova IV, Bayunova LV, Shpakov AO",6,994,diabetes,2025-11-22
39141963,Multi-type maternal diabetes mellitus affects human placental villous geometric morphology: A three-dimensional imaging study.,"Diabetes mellitus leads to maldevelopment of the villous morphology in the human placenta, disrupting the exchange of materials between the maternal and fetal compartments, consequently compromising fetal development. This study aims to explore how different types of diabetes mellitus affect human placental villous geometric morphology including branching numbers and sizes (length, diameter). Here an optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based 3D imaging platform was utilized to capture 3D images of placental villi from different types of diabetes, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Different types of diabetes mellitus exhibit different effects on human placental villous geometric morphological parameters: GDM had greater placenta villous parameters at intermediate villous diameter (IVD), terminal villous diameter (TVD), terminal villous length (TVL) compared to the healthy, T1DM, and T2DM, and these differences were statistically significant. The TVD of T1DM and T2DM had significantly greater sizes than the healthy. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of villous branches among the three types of diabetes, but T1DM and GDM had more villous branches than healthy individuals. Diabetes mellitus affects the geometric morphology of human placental villi, with varying effects observed in pregnancies of different diabetes types. These findings offer a novel avenue for exploring underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and enhancing the management of women with diabetes from preconception through pregnancy.",Placenta,2024-Sep,"Gao X, Qin X, Pei S, Wang W, Wu R, Mei J, Liu Y, Xie Y, Ni G",9,1631,diabetes,2025-11-22

As a result, this study aimed to detect the prevalence and pattern of non-infectious skin disorders among patients with diabetes. This study was carried out at the Faiha Specialized Diabetes, Endocrine, and Metabolism Center, Basrah Province, Iraq, from September 2020 to September 2021. The data were collected from 347 patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The exclusion criteria were patients with skin changes due to some medications, pregnancy, iatrogenic factors, skin infections, established hypo- or hyper-thyroidism, Cushing or adrenal insufficiency, pituitary disorders, end-stage renal impairment, malignancy, and established rheumatological disease and those who were on chemotherapy. Full dermatological examinations and screenings were performed under the supervision of a dermatologist expert and all clinically definable cutaneous lesions were recorded. The prevalence of skin lesions was estimated at 71.5% in patients. Pruritus, xerosis, acrochordon, diabetic dermopathy, acanthosis nigricans, and insulin-related lipohypertrophy were the commonest skin lesions reported among the patients. The occurrence of skin lesions in diabetic patients was proportional to the female gender, duration of disease, obesity, insulin therapy, and worse glycemic control.

32180189,Rat Models of Virus-Induced Type 1 Diabetes.,"Studies performed in humans and animal models have implicated the environment in the etiology of type 1 diabetes (T1D), but the nature and timing of the interactions triggering β cell autoimmunity are poorly understood. Virus infections have been postulated to be involved in disease mechanisms, but the underlying mechanisms are not known. It is exceedingly difficult to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between viral infection and diabetes in humans. Thus, we have used the BioBreeding Diabetes-Resistant (BBDR) and the LEW1.WR1 rat models of virus-induced disease to elucidate how virus infection leads to T1D. The immunophenotype of these strains is normal, and spontaneous diabetes does not occur in a specific pathogen-free environment. However, β cell inflammation and diabetes with many similarities to the human disease are induced by infection with the parvovirus Kilham rat virus (KRV). KRV-induced diabetes in the BBDR and LEW1.WR1 rat models is limited to young animals and can be induced in both male and female rats. Thus, these animals provide a powerful experimental tool to identify mechanisms underlying virus-induced T1D development.","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",2020-,"Needell JC, Zipris D",2,1162,diabetes,2025-11-22
33859110,Risk for incident diabetes is greater in prediabetic men with HIV than without HIV.,"Diabetes mellitus is a major comorbidity in people with HIV (PWH). Hyperglycemia below diabetic range defines prediabetes (prediabetes mellitus). We compared the progression from prediabetes mellitus to diabetes mellitus in PWH and people without HIV (PWOH). Fasting glucose was measured semiannually in the MACS since 1999. Men with prediabetes mellitus (fasting glucose between 100 and 125 mg/dl, confirmed within a year by fasting glucose in the prediabetes mellitus range or HbA1c between 5.7 and 6.4%) were included. The first visit with prediabetes mellitus was the baseline visit. Incident diabetes mellitus was defined as fasting glucose at least 126 mg/dl, confirmed at a subsequent visit, or self-reported diabetes mellitus, or use of anti-diabetes mellitus medication. We used binomial transition models to compare the progression from prediabetes mellitus to diabetes mellitus by HIV serostatus, adjusted for age, number of previous prediabetes mellitus to diabetes mellitus transitions, ethnicity, BMI, family history of diabetes mellitus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Between 1999 and 2019, 1584 men (793 PWH; 791 PWOH) with prediabetes mellitus were included. At baseline, PWH were younger (48 vs. 51 years, P < 0.01), had lower BMI (26 vs. 27), were more frequently nonwhite (47 vs. 30%), and HCV-infected as per last measure (8 vs. 4%) than PWOH (all P < 0.01). Over a median 12-year follow-up, 23% of participants developed diabetes mellitus. In adjusted analyses, the risk for incident diabetes mellitus was 40% (95% CI: 0--80%) higher among PWH than PWOH (P = 0.04). Among men with prediabetes mellitus, PWH had an increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus adjusted for competing risk factors, warranting the evaluation of diabetes mellitus prevention strategies.","AIDS (London, England)",2021-Aug,"Slama L, Barrett BW, Abraham AG, Palella FJ, Kingsley L, Viard JP, Lake JE, Brown TT",8,1796,diabetes,2025-11-22
39247917,The application of predictive value of diabetes autoantibody profile combined with clinical data and routine laboratory indexes in the classification of diabetes mellitus.,"Currently, distinct use of clinical data, routine laboratory indicators or the detection of diabetic autoantibodies in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus is limited. Hence, this study was aimed to screen the indicators, and to establish and validate a multifactorial logistic regression model nomogram for the non-invasive differential prediction of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Clinical data, routine laboratory indicators, and diabetes autoantibody profiles of diabetic patients admitted between September 2018 and December 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Logistic regression was used to select the independent influencing factors, and a prediction nomogram based on the multiple logistic regression model was constructed using these independent factors. Moreover, the predictive accuracy and clinical application value of the nomogram were evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curves (CIC). A total of 522 diabetic patients were included in this study. These patients were randomized into training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. The predictors screened included age, prealbumin (PA), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), islet cells autoantibodies (ICA), islets antigen 2 autoantibodies (IA-2A), glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA), and C-peptide levels. Based on these factors, a multivariate model nomogram was constructed, which had an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.966 and 0.961 for the training set and validation set, respectively. Subsequently, the calibration curves demonstrated a strong accuracy of the graph; the DCA and CIC results indicated that the graph could be used as a non-invasive valid predictive tool for the differential diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus, clinically. The established prediction model combining patient's age, PA, HDL-C, ICA, IA-2A, GADA, and C-peptide can assist in differential diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus and provides a basis for the clinical as well as therapeutic management of the disease.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,"Xian J, Du R, Yuan H, Li J, Pei Q, Hao Y, Zeng X, Wang J, Ye T",9,2114,diabetes,2025-11-22
36757165,Adverse Effects of Tacrolimus and Its Associated Risk Factors in Renal Transplant Recipients.,"Tacrolimus, an important constituent of the immunosuppressant regimen for renal transplant recipients, can result in posttransplant diabetes mellitus. The adverse effect profile of tacrolimus is yet to be completely understood. The relationship between the blood level of tacrolimus and development of posttransplant diabetes mellitus has not been clearly elucidated in Indian populations. We conducted this study to investigate the frequency of posttransplant diabetes mellitus and other adverse effects of tacrolimus, to enumerate the risk factors associated with posttransplant diabetes mellitus development, and to correlate the blood levels of tacrolimus with its occurrence. This prospective observational study included 77 renal transplant patients receiving tacrolimus. The blood sugar levels (fasting and postprandial) were monitored, and patients were asked regularly about the adverse effects of tacrolimus experienced by them for 6 months posttransplant. Trough levels of tacrolimus in blood were correlated with occurrence of posttransplant diabetes mellitus. Posttransplant diabetes mellitus developed in 62.3% (48/77) of renal transplant recipients on a tacrolimus-based regimen. Other adverse effects observed included tremors, diarrhea, alopecia, cyto- megalovirus infection, headache, biopsy-proven calci- neurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and BK virus infection. Higher tacrolimus trough level at month 1 posttransplant was significantly associated with the development of posttransplant diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio = 1.379; 95% CI, 1.02-1.86). The best cutoff of tacrolimus trough level at month 1 posttransplant to reduce the risk of posttransplant diabetes mellitus was 8.1 ng/mL. There was a 5 times increased risk of developing posttransplant diabetes mellitus when tacrolimus trough level at month 1 posttransplant was >8.1 ng/mL (adjusted odds ratio = 5.4; 95% CI, 1.4-19.9). Posttransplant diabetes mellitus is a common adverse effect of tacrolimus among renal transplant recipients. A trough level >8.1 ng/mL at month 1 posttransplant was an important predictor for posttransplant diabetes mellitus.",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,2023-Jan,"Meera M, Manikandan S, Parameswaran S",3,2160,diabetes,2025-11-22

This study aimed to clarify the relationship of fQRS with diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Japanese patients. Approximately 702 individuals who had a routine health checkup at the Hokuriku Health Service Association (Toyama, Japan) in October 2014 were enrolled and categorized into one of the following four groups based on MetS and diabetes mellitus status: with diabetes mellitus (+) MetS+ (164 participants); diabetes mellitus+ without MetS (Mets-; 103 participants); diabetes mellitus- MetS+ (133 participants); and diabetes mellitus- MetS- (302 participants). fQRS was assessed using the results of electrocardiography. The prevalence of fQRS was statistically higher in patients with diabetes mellitus+ MetS+ (37%) and diabetes mellitus+ MetS- (35%), than those with diabetes mellitus- MetS+ (14%) or diabetes mellitus- MetS- (10%; P < 0.0001). Significant differences were observed between the fQRS(+) and fQRS(-) groups for age, sex, waist circumference, heart rate, hypertension, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, MetS and diabetes mellitus. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for traditional risk factors and diabetes mellitus was 0.72 (P = 0.0007, 95% confidence interval 0.67-0.76), and for traditional risk factors and MetS it was 0.67 (P = 0.28, 95% confidence interval 0.62-0.72). Patients with diabetes mellitus had more than threefold higher likelihood of showing fQRS (odds ratio 3.41; 95% confidence interval 2.25-5.22; P < 0.0001) compared with the reference group without diabetes mellitus, after adjusting for age, sex, dyslipidemia, hypertension and waist circumference. fQRS was observed more frequently in diabetes mellitus patients than in MetS and control individuals.

Participants were 10 to < 21 years of age at diagnosis; there were 484 with type 1 diabetes and 1236 with type 2 diabetes. Children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes were more likely to be female, overweight/obese, and from low-income, minority ethnic families. Children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes were more likely to present with diabetic ketoacidosis and have higher mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels at diagnosis. More than 70% in both cohorts achieved target HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels < 58 mmol/mol (< 7.5%) within 6 months, but fewer participants with type 1 than type 2 diabetes were able to maintain target HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels after 6 months consistently throughout 3 years post diagnosis. Of the 401 participants with type 2 diabetes with ≥ 24 months diabetes duration on enrolment in the registry, 47% required no insulin treatment. Median C-peptide levels were 1.43 mmol/l in the subset of participants with type 2 diabetes in whom it was measured, but only 0.06 mmol/l in the subset with type 1 diabetes. Although families of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes face greater socio-economic obstacles and risk factors for poor diabetes outcomes, the greater retention of residual endogenous insulin secretion likely contributes to the increased ability of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes to maintain target HbA<sub>1c</sub> during the first 3 years of diabetes diagnosis.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2020-May,"Van Name MA, Cheng P, Gal RL, Kollman C, Lynch J, Nelson B, Tamborlane WV",7,1561,diabetes,2025-11-22

The study aimed to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of diabetic patients regarding the bidirectional link and the role of medical healthcare professionals in providing oral health advice to their patients. A convenience sample of diabetic patients attending general practice-based medical and dental centers was invited to complete a questionnaire-based survey. The survey was anonymous, and the responses of the participants were not identifiable. A total of 241 participants completed the questionnaire; however, three survey responses were excluded as most of the critical questions were not answered. The majority (87.81%) of the participants reported with type 2 diabetes mellitus, while 11.76% had type 1 diabetes mellitus. Just over 61% of the participants reported brushing their teeth twice a day. The majority of participants (66.38%) said that their medical practitioner/diabetic educator never asked or examined their oral hygiene or any issues with the gums or teeth. The study noted that 54% of the participants never received any information regarding the bidirectional relationship between periodontal disease and diabetes mellitus and were unaware of the association. Patients with diabetes mellitus lack knowledge of the bidirectional association between periodontal disease and diabetes mellitus. In this regard, the study urged the need to implement European Federation of Periodontology and International Diabetes Federation guidelines effectively.

We aim to explore its clinical efficacy and impact on quality of life (QoL) in the diabetic population. In terms of clinical outcomes, use of FGM is associated with a significant reduction in glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level, notably in patients with suboptimal glycaemic control prior to commencement of FGM and reduction in time spent in hypoglycaemia. FGM demonstrated non-inferiority in device accuracy when compared to other well-established CGMs available in the market. Patients have reported improved QoL and treatment satisfaction measured by validated objective scores after consistent use of FGM. This results in a positive impact on patient psychosocial wellbeing and ultimately enhances patient compliance and optimisation of glycaemic control.

DM substantially affects numerous metabolic pathways, resulting in β-cell dysfunction, insulin resistance, abnormal blood glucose levels, impaired lipid metabolism, inflammatory processes, and excessive oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can affect the body's normal physiological function and cause numerous cellular and molecular changes, such as mitochondrial dysfunction. Animal models are useful for exploring the cellular and molecular mechanisms of DM and improving novel therapeutics for their safe use in human beings. Due to their health benefits, there is significant interest in a wide range of natural compounds that can act as naturally occurring anti-diabetic compounds. Due to rodent models' relatively similar physiology to humans and ease of handling and housing, they are widely used as pre-clinical models for studying several metabolic disorders.

Multiple prospective observational and experimental studies have shown a link between suboptimal sleep and impaired glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity and the development of type 2 diabetes. While prevalence rates of suboptimal sleep vary widely according to definition, assessment and sample, suboptimal subjective sleep quality appears to be a common reality for one-third of people with type 1 diabetes and over half of people with type 2 diabetes. Both physiological and psychosocial factors may impair sleep in these groups. In turn, suboptimal sleep can negatively affect glycaemic outcomes directly or indirectly via suboptimal daytime functioning (energy, mood, cognition) and self-care behaviours. Technological devices supporting diabetes self-care may have both negative and positive effects. Diabetes and its treatment also affect the sleep of significant others. Research on the merits of interventions aimed at improving sleep for people with diabetes is in its infancy. Diabetes and sleep appear to be reciprocally related. Discussion of sleep deserves a central place in regular diabetes care. Multi-day, multi-method studies may shed more light on the complex relationship between sleep and diabetes at an individual level.

Medical, dental and pharmacy claims data generated between 1 April 2015 and 31 March 2016 were obtained and analysed. Patients with medical and pharmacy claims of diabetes mellitus were allocated to the diabetes mellitus group. Patients with medical claims of acute upper respiratory inflammation, but without claims of diabetes mellitus, were allocated to the control group. The number of claims involving tooth loss, treatment of periodontal disease and visits to medical and dental institutions were obtained from the NDB. Descriptive statistics were used to compare the nature of tooth loss between patients with diabetes mellitus and the control groups. There were 5,248,405 patients in the control group and 1,570,082 patients in the diabetes mellitus group. Patients in the diabetes mellitus group showed a higher level of tooth loss than patients in the control group, among both sexes. Patients with diabetes mellitus tended to lose their posterior teeth at an earlier age than patients in the control group. Moreover, patients in the diabetes mellitus group showed greater tooth loss, regardless of whether or not periodontal disease was treated.

34617183,Expression of Bax and Bcl-2 Proteins in Left-Ventricular Cardiomyocytes in Wistar-Kyoto and SHR Rats with Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus.,"Loss of cardiomyocytes due to apoptotic or necrotic death is an important component of the pathogenesis of heart failure. Initiation of apoptosis by the mitochondrial pathway depends on the balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic factors, in particular, Bax and Bcl-2. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis in essential hypertension is studied in sufficient details. At the same time, apoptotic processes in the myocardium in diabetes mellitus alone and in combination with essential hypertension remain poorly understood. Here we studied the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 in the left ventricular cardiomyocytes of 38-week-old male Wistar-Kyoto rats and 38- and 57-week-old SHR rats with essential hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a combination of these pathologies. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was modelled by a single parenteral administration of streptozotocin in a dose 65 mg/kg. Expression of Bax and Bcl-2 was assessed by the immunohistochemical method. In essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus, the apoptotic processes in the ventricular myocardium were enhanced, as is seen from the increase in the content of the proapoptotic factor Bax and a decrease in the expression of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2.

38928130,Targeting Protein Kinases to Protect Beta-Cell Function and Survival in Diabetes.,"The prevalence of diabetes is increasing worldwide. Massive death of pancreatic beta-cells causes type 1 diabetes. Progressive loss of beta-cell function and mass characterizes type 2 diabetes. To date, none of the available antidiabetic drugs promotes the maintenance of a functional mass of endogenous beta-cells, revealing an unmet medical need. Dysfunction and apoptotic death of beta-cells occur, in particular, through the activation of intracellular protein kinases. In recent years, protein kinases have become highly studied targets of the pharmaceutical industry for drug development. A number of drugs that inhibit protein kinases have been approved for the treatment of cancers. The question of whether safe drugs that inhibit protein kinase activity can be developed and used to protect the function and survival of beta-cells in diabetes is still unresolved. This review presents arguments suggesting that several protein kinases in beta-cells may represent targets of interest for the development of drugs to treat diabetes.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024-Jun,Dalle S,1,1039,diabetes,2025-11-22
39157677,Risk cycling in diabetes and autism spectrum disorder: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"The relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains controversial. This study aimed to analyze the causal relationship between different types of DM and ASD by bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR). Single nucleotide polymorphisms for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and ASD were obtained from genome-wide association studies. Subsequently, inverse variance weighted, MR-Egger, and weighted median were used to test the exposure-outcome causality. Finally, MR-Egger's intercept, Cochran's Q, and leave-one-out method were used to assess horizontal pleiotropy, heterogeneity, and sensitivity of the results, respectively. The positive analysis showed that T2DM was associated with an increased risk of ASD, whereas neither T1DM nor GDM was associated with the risk of ASD. The reverse analysis showed that ASD was associated with an increased risk of T2DM, while it was not associated with the risk of either T1DM or GDM. MR-Egger intercept showed no horizontal pleiotropy (<i>p</i> > 0.05) for these results. Cochran's Q showed no heterogeneity expect for the results of T1DM on the risk of ASD, and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis showed these results were robust. This MR analysis suggests that T2DM and ASD are reciprocal risk factors and that they may create an intergenerational risk cycling in female patients. Aggressive prevention and treatment of T2DM and ASD help to break the trap of this risk cycling. Additionally, this study does not support a causal relationship between T1DM and ASD, as well as GDM and ASD. And more studies are needed in the future to continue to explore the interactions and underlying mechanisms between different types of DM and ASD.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,"Yu Y, Yang X, Hu G, Tong K, Wu J, Yu R",6,1788,diabetes,2025-11-22
34134677,"DPARD: rationale, design and initial results from the Dutch national diabetes registry.","Treatment of diabetes mellitus has majorly improved over the past century, however, the disease burden is high and its prevalence still expanding. Further insight in the diabetes population is imperative to improve the quality of diabetes care by enhancement of knowledge-based diabetes management strategies. To this end, in 2017 a Dutch nationwide consortium of diabetologists, paediatric endocrinologists, and diabetes patients has founded a national outpatient diabetes care registry named Dutch Pediatric and Adult Registry of Diabetes (DPARD). We aim to describe the implementation of DPARD and to provide an overview of the characteristics of patients included during the first 2 years. For the DPARD cohort with long-term follow-up of observational nature, hospital data are gathered directly from electronic health records and securely transferred and stored. DPARD provides weekly updated clinical information on the diabetes population care on a hospital-level benchmarked against the national average. Between November 2017 and January 2020, 20,857 patients were included from 8 (11%) Dutch hospitals with a level of care distribution representative of all diabetic outpatients in the Netherlands. Among patients with known diabetes type, 41% had type 1 diabetes, 51% type 2 diabetes, and 8% had diabetes due to other causes. Characteristics of the total patient population were similar to patients with unknown diabetes classification. HbA1c levels decreased over the years, while BMI levels showed an increase over time. The national DPARD registry aims to facilitate investigation of prevalence and long-term outcomes of Dutch outpatients with diabetes mellitus and their treatment, thus allowing for quality improvement of diabetes care as well as allowing for comparison of diabetes care on an international level.",BMC endocrine disorders,2021-Jun,"Bak JCG, Mul D, Serné EH, de Valk HW, Sas TCJ, Geelhoed-Duijvestijn PH, Kramer MHH, Nieuwdorp M, Verheugt CL",9,1831,diabetes,2025-11-22

Diabetes mellitus has been reported to influence the outcomes of patients with diverticular disease. Our study aimed to examine the inpatient outcomes and complications of patients with acute diverticulitis and coexisting diabetes mellitus. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to identify adult patients in 2014 admitted for acute diverticulitis. Primary outcomes were mortality, length of stay (LOS), and total hospitalization charges. Secondary outcomes were complications of acute diverticulitis and interventions. In total, 44 330 of patients with acute diverticulitis and diabetes mellitus were included in the analysis. Acute diverticulitis patients with diabetes mellitus had a higher rate of diverticular bleeding (P < 0.0001), but lower rates of abscess (P < 0.0001), obstruction (P < 0.0001) and colectomy (P < 0.0001) when compared to acute diverticulitis patients without diabetes mellitus. Complicated diabetes mellitus was associated with a longer LOS (P = 0.00003) and greater total hospitalization charges (P = 0.0021) compared to uncomplicated diabetes mellitus when coexisting with acute diverticulitis. Acute diverticulitis with diabetes mellitus is associated with a higher rate of diverticular bleeding, lower rates of abscess, obstruction, and colectomy compared to acute diverticulitis without diabetes mellitus. When coexisting with acute diverticulitis, complicated diabetes mellitus is not associated with higher rates of mortality or diverticulitis-related complications compared to uncomplicated diabetes mellitus.",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,2021-Nov,"Jiang Y, Rodgers B, Damiris K, Choi C, Ahlawat S",5,1658,diabetes,2025-11-22
35569007,Continuous glucose monitoring to assess glucose variability in type 3c diabetes.,"The effectiveness of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in maintaining glycaemic control in type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus has been well demonstrated. However, the degree of glycaemic variability (GV) in people with type 3c diabetes mellitus has not been fully explored using CGM. This study aims to evaluate GV in type 3c diabetes mellitus participants and compare it to type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Participants were grouped according to type of diabetes. GV, defined as percentage coefficient of variation (%CV), and other glycaemic indices were obtained using CGM (FreeStyle Libre, Abbott, Australia) from 82 participants across all three cohorts over a 14-day period. Comparison of baseline characteristics and GV were performed across all groups. Correlation of GV with C-peptide values, and whether pancreatic supplementation had an effect on GV were also assessed in the type 3c diabetes mellitus cohort. GV of type 3c diabetes mellitus participants was within the recommended target of less than %CV 36% (p = 0.004). Type 3c diabetes mellitus participants had the lowest GV among the three groups (p = 0.001). There was a trend for lower C-peptide levels to be associated with higher GV in type 3c diabetes mellitus participants (p = 0.22). Pancreatic enzyme supplementation in type 3c diabetes mellitus participants did not have an effect on GV (p = 0.664). Although type 3c diabetes mellitus participants were the least variable, they had the highest mean glucose levels and estimated HbA<sub>1c</sub> , which suggests that the concept of 'brittle' diabetes in type 3c diabetes mellitus is not supported by the results of CGM in this study and may be leading to poorer glycaemic control.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2022-Aug,"Lee VTY, Poynten A, Depczynski B",3,1748,diabetes,2025-11-22

We previously reported that travelers with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) infected with Plasmodium falciparum were three times more likely to develop severe malaria than non-diabetics. Here we explore the biological basis for this by testing blood from uninfected subjects with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, ex vivo, for their effects on parasite growth and rosetting (binding of infected erythrocytes to uninfected erythrocytes). Rosetting was associated with type 2 diabetes, blood glucose and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), while parasite growth was positively associated with blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), fibrinogen and triglycerides. This study establishes a link between diabetes and malaria virulence assays, potentially explaining the protective effect of good glycemic control against severe malaria in subjects with diabetes.",PloS one,2021-,"Ch'ng JH, Moll K, Wyss K, Hammar U, Rydén M, Kämpe O, Färnert A, Wahlgren M",8,1066,diabetes,2025-11-22

Since both diabetes mellitus and periodontitis have a high prevalence in the general population, the Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society of Periodontology and Implantology and the Italian Association of Clinical Diabetologists revised the present scientific literature in the present consensus report. A bi-directional interaction was demonstrated: Patients affected by type 1 and type 2 diabetes have a higher prevalence of periodontitis than the general population, due to several metabolic factors (e.g. chronic hyperglycemia, autoimmunity, dietary and life-style factors); similarly, periodontitis predisposes to type 2 diabetes mellitus mainly via the increase of systemic cytokines release. Conversely, improvement of metabolic control of diabetic patients delay the progression of periodontitis as well as periodontitis treatment reduces glycosylated hemoglobin levels in blood. Due to the bi-directional causal interaction between periodontitis and diabetes mellitus, a strict collaboration among dentists and diabetologists is required and strongly recommended. The inter-societies consensus proposes specific flow-diagrams to improve the treatment of patients and management of the general population regarding the issue of periodontitis and diabetes.","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2021-Aug,"Adda G, Aimetti M, Citterio F, Consoli A, Di Bartolo P, Landi L, Lione L, Luzi L",8,1356,diabetes,2025-11-22

37861021,From Gut to Glucose: A Comprehensive Review on Functional Foods and Dietary Interventions for Diabetes Management.,"In the realm of diabetes research, considerable attention has been directed toward elucidating the intricate interplay between the gastrointestinal tract and glucose regulation. The gastrointestinal tract, once exclusively considered for its role in digestion and nutrient assimilation, is presently acknowledged as a multifaceted ecosystem with regulatory supremacy over metabolic homeostasis and glucose metabolism. Recent studies indicate that alterations in the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota could potentially influence the regulation of glucose levels and glucose homeostasis in the body. Dysbiosis, characterized by perturbations in the equilibrium of gut microbial constituents, has been irrevocably linked to an augmented risk of diabetes mellitus (DM). Moreover, research has revealed the potential influence of the gut microbiota on important factors, like inflammation and insulin sensitivity, which are key contributors to the onset and progression of diabetes. The key protagonists implicated in the regulation of glucose encompass the gut bacteria, gut barrier integrity, and the gut-brain axis. A viable approach to enhance glycemic control while concurrently mitigating the burden of comorbidities associated with diabetes resides in the strategic manipulation of the gut environment through adapted dietary practices. This review aimed to provide a deep understanding of the complex relationship between gut health, glucose metabolism, and diabetes treatment. This study has presented an exhaustive overview of dietary therapies and functional foods that have undergone extensive research to explore their potential advantages in the management of diabetes. It looks into the role of gut health in glucose regulation, discusses the impact of different dietary elements on the course of diabetes, and evaluates how well functional foods can help with glycemic control. Furthermore, it investigates the mechanistic aspects of these therapies, including their influence on insulin sensitivity, β-cell activity, and inflammation. It deliberates on the limitations and potential prospects associated with integrating functional foods into personalized approaches to diabetes care.",Current diabetes reviews,2024-,"Patel N, Dinesh S, Sharma S",3,2214,diabetes,2025-11-22
34933708,Analysis of circRNA regulatory network in myocardial tissue of type 1 diabetic mice.,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus, also called insulin-dependent diabetes is associated with elevated blood glucose concentration arising from the inability of the pancreas to produce insulin. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a major cause of death in diabetic patients. CircRNAs have been reported to participate in various human diseases, including diabetic cardiomyopathy. In this study, the regulation network of circRNA in type 1 diabetes mellitus was investigated. Streptozotocin treatment was implemented to induce type 1 diabetes mellitus in the mouse model, and echocardiography was implemented to detect the heart function of the type 1 diabetes mellitus mouse. Also, the qRT-PCR assay was used to identify the circRNA expression in type 1 diabetes mellitus mouse myocardial tissue. Findings showed that heart function of type 1 diabetes mellitus mouse was significantly damaged than control group mouse and cardiac hypertrophy in type 1 diabetes mellitus mouse, circRNAs were aberrantly regulated in type 1 diabetes mellitus mouse myocardial tissue.

There are studies which have observed that diabetes mellitus is directly involved in carcinogenesis and is an independent risk factor for colorectal cancer. The diabetic patient requires a complex medical-surgical approach, so setting the risk criteria for them can be the starting point for improving the survival rate. Materials and methods: The association between colorectal cancer and diabetes mellitus as well as screening criteria were analyzed in a descriptive prospective study (442 patients) conducted in the Dr. I. Cantacuzino Clinical Hospital during 2017-2018. In the study, patients were distributed in two clusters, one with diabetes mellitus (N = 194) and one without diabetes mellitus (N = 248) in which basic clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed followed by screening colonoscopies. <b>Results:</b> Statistically significant (p 0.005) correlations were highlighted between 7 of the variables tested and the positive results on colonoscopy, which were subsequently combined to achieve a risk score. <b>Conclusions:</b> Diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor and a negative prognostic factor for colorectal cancer.

Insulin-producing, glucagon-producing, and proliferating cells were identified by immunohistochemistry. After APH administration, an increase in the number of β cells, a decrease in the number of α cells and cells synthesizing both insulin and glucagon (insulin-glucagon-positive) were observed; mitotic activity of β cells did not change.

Patients with KPD usually present with diabetic ketoacidosis without the classic phenotype of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. In most cases, they are Afro-American adults, who require insulin therapy for the management of acute decompensation, then usually encountering insulin-free remission for prolonged periods of time with diet or with non-insulin agents. Meanwhile, hypogonadism is a known condition that could be associated with higher risk of developing both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and could be a risk factor for decompensated diabetes. The association of KPD and hypogonadism is reported for the first time in literature. Here we report two peculiar cases of young African patients, affected by KPD and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, respectively Klinefelter's syndrome and primary ovarian failure. Both patients were treated promptly for the ketoacidosis with intravenous fluids combined with continuous insulin infusion, and then switched to subcutaneous regimen. After the correct clinical evaluation, oral antidiabetic drugs were added. KPD remains an under-recognized and under-diagnosed type of diabetes. As hypogonadism is strongly linked to dysmetabolic disorders, the evaluation of sex hormones should be performed at the onset of diabetes. Further studies should investigate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and its role in the development of KDP and its manifestations and complications.","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2023-,"Graziani A, Pollis RM, Bonora BM, Scaroni C, Sabbadin C",5,1547,diabetes,2025-11-22

We sought to provide insight into a unique diagnostic application of anti-GAD antibodies in patients potentially misdiagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We present a case series of patients who had a change in diagnosis from T2DM to autoimmune DM that was supported by positive anti-GAD antibodies. Patients were identified via a retrospective chart review of all anti-GAD antibodies tests ordered between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021 at a tertiary care academic hospital. Of the 23 patients with previous diagnosis of T2DM, positive anti-GAD antibodies supported the clinician's decision to change the diagnosis to autoimmune DM. The prominent clinical reasons for ordering anti-GAD antibodies in patients previously diagnosed as T2DM were patient presentation with diabetic ketoacidosis, features of insulin insufficiency, inadequate effect of oral diabetes mellitus medications, young age at diagnosis, and a family history of autoimmune conditions. Anti-GAD antibodies' positivity can support a change in diagnosis from T2DM to autoimmune DM, which has substantial impact on patient care.

Measurements of erythrocyte deformability together with determination of nitric oxide (NO) production and osmotic resistance were used for the characterization of erythrocyte functionality in lean (control) and obese Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats of two age categories. Obese ZDF rats correspond to prediabetic (younger) and diabetic (older) animals. As antioxidants were suggested to protect erythrocytes, we also investigated the potential effect of quercetin (20 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks). Erythrocyte deformability was determined by the filtration method and NO production using DAF-2DA fluorescence. For erythrocyte osmotic resistance, we used hemolytic assay. Erythrocyte deformability and NO production deteriorated during aging-both were lower in older ZDF rats than in younger ones. Three-way ANOVA indicates improved erythrocyte deformability after quercetin treatment in older obese ZDF rats only, as it was not modified or deteriorated in both (lean and obese) younger and older lean animals. NO production by erythrocytes increased post treatment in all experimental groups.

Patients are often not clinically recognized; however, the identification of HNF1A-MODY patients is crucial because they require different antihyperglycemic medical treatment than patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. We describe two adult patients with monogenic diabetes, both identified as HNF1A-MODY, genetically c.815G>A, p.Arg272His and c675delC, p.Ser225Argfs*8, respectively. They were misdiagnosed as having type 1 diabetes mellitus, and consequently, initiating insulin therapy led to hypoglycemia and unstable blood glucose control. Usually, sulfonylureas represent the basis of antidiabetic treatment in patients with HNF1A-MODY; however, all medical personnel involved in diabetes care should be aware of monogenic diabetes mellitus and the possibilities for genetic testing. The patients observed have shown the necessity of the identification and appropriate genetic diagnosis of HNF1A-MODY in order to discontinue insulin therapy and to initiate adjusted diabetes management.",Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,2021-Mar,"Schnedl WJ, Holasek SJ, Schenk M, Enko D, Mangge H",5,1190,diabetes,2025-11-22
36764736,Two siblings with a rare type of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY).,"Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a type of diabetes that does not entirely fit the usually encountered type 1 or type 2 diabetes. It is a monogenic, familial and non-autoimmune diabetes among children and young adults resulting from autosomal dominant gene mutations.MODY diagnosis is confirmed by molecular genetic testing, which is costly. Therefore, it is rarely done.Nearly 1%-6% of diabetes has a monogenic cause but this is frequently misclassified as type 1 diabetes mellitus due to the lack of genetic testing. Therefore, a correct diagnosis of MODY is crucial for determining the plan of management. Furthermore, having a patient with MODY in a family indicates screening other family members. In this case report, we highlight that paediatric diabetes cases are not always type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus since two siblings incidentally presented with hyperglycaemia and a confirmed diagnosis of MODY type 10 was ultimately made. Moreover, their mother who was previously labelled as a case of type 1 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed later as MODY after genetic testing.",BMJ case reports,2023-Feb,"Alhakim FR, AlKhayyat H",2,1096,diabetes,2025-11-22
39674485,Preliminary characterization of Ramaria botrytoides polysaccharide RB-P1-1 and analysis of its hypoglycemic effects by altering the gut microbiota and metabolites in mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Gut microbiota has a symbiotic relationship with the host and is closely linked to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Polysaccharides are natural bioactive compounds with beneficial effects on T2DM; however, the mechanisms underlying their effects remain unclear. This study investigated the hypoglycemic effects of a purified polysaccharide, RB-P1-1, from Ramaria botrytoides and assessed its association with gut microbiota and metabolite changes using 16S rDNA sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Hypoglycemic effects were evaluated after microbial community restoration via fecal microbiota transplantation. RB-P1-1 significantly improved hyperglycemia profiles and reshaped gut microbiota, increasing the abundance of Alistipes, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Odoribacter, Akkermansia, and Turicibacter. RB-P1-1 modulated microbiota metabolites associated with hypoglycemic effects, including pyridoxamine, L-histidine, quercetin, 3-phosphonopropionic acid, oleoylethanolamide, 3-ketocholanic acid, 4-phenylbutyric acid, LysoPC(P-16:0/0:0), LysoPC(18:2), and short-chain fatty acids, and altered various metabolic pathways involved in T2DM development. Gut microbiota that showed altered abundance were correlated with metabolites that showed altered concentration. Gut microbiota isolated from the RB-P1-1-treated group alleviated the symptoms associated with T2DM. These results suggest RB-P1-1 is an effective active ingredient in the treatment of T2DM by modulating gut microbiota and metabolites.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2025-Feb,"Ni Z, Chen L, Qian X, Yong Y, Wu M, Li Y, Li J, Wang Y, Li L, Shao Y, Chen A",11,1553,diabetes,2025-11-22

The purpose of this study was to examine the serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus with toxoplasmosis, and to explore their inter-relationship. Forty patients with diabetes mellitus, including 20 with type 1 and 20 with type 2, as well as 20 healthy subjects, voluntarily participated in the study. Each subject provided 5 mL of peripheral blood for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also had toxoplasmosis showed a significant increase in TGF-β levels and a decrease in IL-6 levels. In contrast, patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus displayed a slight increase in IL-6 and IL-17 levels compared to both the patients with type 2 diabetes and the healthy control group. Our findings show an increase in TGF-β and a decrease in IL-6, which may suggest a reduction in inflammation and beta cell destruction in individuals with type 2 diabetes and toxoplasmosis. The elevated serum levels of IL-6 and IL-17 in individuals with type 1 diabetes further support the exacerbation of inflammation.","Iranian journal of allergy, asthma, and immunology",2024-Dec,"Dabirzadeh M, Ghoryani M, Poursamimi J, Fouladi B",4,1265,diabetes,2025-11-22

It can be classified into two types: Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is considered a multifactorial disorder in which genetic factors such as cytokines play a major role. Cytokines play a role in immune modulation and are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in cytokines were studied extensively in different populations to determine their association with a predisposition to diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to estimate the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the cytokine genes TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ in 102 Jordanian diabetes mellitus patients in comparison to 50 controls and their association to diabetes mellitus susceptibility. Analysis was performed using the highly specific polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primers methodology. Our findings showed that the IL-10-1082 G/G genotype (P = 0.02) and the TGF-β1 codon 25*G allele (P < 0.01) may be considered risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, the IFN-γ-874*A allele (P = 0.04) seems to increase the predisposition to type 1 diabetes. Our study showed that the IL-10-1082 G/G genotype and TGF-β1 codon 25*G allele are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus while the IFN- γ -874*A allele is associated with type 1 diabetes.

Our study aimed to explore the associations between the ribosomal protein S26 (RPS26) gene rs1131017 polymorphisms and susceptibility to type 1 diabetes mellitus, latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Chinese Han population, and their correlations with clinical features. Genotyping of the rs1131017 variant was carried out for 1,006 type 1 diabetes mellitus patients, 210 LADA patients, 642 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and 2,099 control individuals.

We found that the expression levels of P2Y12 receptor in both celiac ganglia and liver were increased in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats which also displayed an enhanced activity of celiac sympathetic nerve discharge (SND). In addition, a marked decrease of hepatic glucokinase (GK) expression was accompanied by reduced hepatic glycogen synthesis in T2DM rats, whereas meanwhile the levels of NLRP3, active caspase-1, NF-κB, and interleukin-1β were elevated. All these abnormal alterations could be largely reversed after treatment of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting P2Y12. Our results indicate that the silence of P2Y12 by shRNA may effectively correct the anomalous activity of celiac SND and improve the dysfunctional hepatic glucokinase by counteracting hepatocyte inflammation and likely pyroptosis due to activated NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1 signaling, thereby attenuating hyperglycemia in T2DM rats.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2020-Dec,"Li L, Yang J, Liu B, Zou Y, Sun M, Li Z, Yang R, Xu X, Zou L, Li G, Liu S, Li G, Liang S",13,1063,diabetes,2025-11-22

Several findings indicate a role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in skin homeostasis. To investigate whether miRNA expression is altered in diabetic skin. Type 1 and 2 mouse models of diabetes were used. MiRNA profiling was performed on RNA extracted from the skin of type 1 diabetic mice and non-diabetic controls. Expression levels of pri-miRNAs and of miRNA-biogenesis genes were also analyzed. Biogenesis gene expression analysis was performed in human dermal fibroblasts cultured in hyperglycemic, hypoxic or oxidative stress conditions. Several miRNAs were differentially expressed in diabetic skin with a general down-modulation as compared to controls. Bioinformatics analysis of signature-miRNA target genes showed the enrichment in pathways involved in skin homeostasis, such as TGF-β and Wnt. MiRNA alteration in diabetic skin associated with reduced expression levels of DROSHA, DGCR8, XPO5, DICER1, AGO2, both as mRNA and protein. Reduced biogenesis gene expression did not correlate with accumulation of pri-miRNAs, which displayed differences in expression levels similar to those found for their mature miRNAs. Experiments with cultured fibroblasts showed that hypoxia and oxidative stress induced the down-regulation of miRNA-biogenesis genes in this skin cell type. A general down-regulation of differentially expressed miRNAs was found in diabetic skin.

Tropisetron, as a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, has a considerable role in the inflammation and oxidative stress lowering. This study aimed to investigate the effect of this 5-HT3 receptor antagonist on insulin secretion in male diabetic rats and the possible mechanisms. Animals were divided into five equal groups; the control, tropisetron, diabetes, tropisetron-diabetes and glibenclamide-diabetes (7 in each group). Tropisetron and glibenclamide were administrated for 2 weeks after inducing type 1 diabetes. We demonstrated that insulin secretion improved robustly in diabetes-tropisetron compared with the diabetic group. Oxidative stress biomarkers were lower in a diabetes-tropisetron group than in diabetic rats. Simultaneously, tropisetron administration promoted the expression of ZnT8 and GLUT2 and also beta-cell mass in pancreatic tissue, while the expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) was restrained. The histological evaluation confirmed our results. These effects were equipotent with glibenclamide, indicating that tropisetron can protect islets from the abnormal insulin secretion and morphological changes induced by type 1 diabetes. This effect might be partly related to the modulated UCP2/ZnT8 signal pathway and improved oxidative stress-induced damage.",The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,2020-Aug,"Naderi R, Shirpoor A, Samadi M, Pourheydar B, Moslehi A",5,1343,diabetes,2025-11-22
32815005,microRNA-143-3p contributes to inflammatory reactions by targeting FOSL2 in PBMCs from patients with autoimmune diabetes mellitus.,"Autoimmune diabetes mellitus (defined as ADM) comprises classical type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). In this study, microRNAs (miRNAs) expression profiles and functions in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of ADM patients were mapped and used to explore epigenetic regulation of the pathogenesis of ADM. PBMCs samples from T1DM patients, LADA patients, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, as well as age- and sex-matched healthy controls for T1DM and T2DM, respectively, were collected and were sequenced to screen the miRNAs expression profiles. The target genes were verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Silencing or overexpressing of the differentially expressed miRNAs, or simultaneously silencing the miRNAs and it's target gene, and then levels of the mRNAs, protein and cytokines were detected. miR-143-3p expression was upregulated in ADM patients. The target gene of miR-143-3p was identified as Fos-related antigen 2 (FOSL2). Transfection of a miR-143-3p inhibitor into PBMCs upregulated FOSL2 expression, resulting in a downregulated expression of the IL-2, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, and an upregulated expression of IL-6. Transfection of a miR-143-3p mimic into PBMCs downregulated FOSL2 expression, leading to an upregulation of IL-2 and TNF-α expression and a downregulation of IL-6 expression. When silencing FOSL2 while inhibiting miR-143-3p in PBMCs, there was no significant change in expression of the FOSL2 mRNA, protein and cytokines. The expression of miR-143-3p in PBMCs from ADM patients is upregulated. miR-143-3p could function in the pathogenesis of ADM by modulating the inflammatory reaction through FOSL2.",Acta diabetologica,2021-Jan,"Pan S, Li M, Yu H, Xie Z, Li X, Duan X, Huang G, Zhou Z",8,1699,diabetes,2025-11-22

The outcome of this study illustrates reduction in glucose and insulin levels significantly in zingerone-treated diabetic groups. Lipid parameters were resumed to normal in zingerone-treated diabetic group as demonstrated by significant reduction in triglycerides, cholesterols (total, low-density and very low-density) levels along with significant increase high-density cholesterols levels. Zingerone-treated diabetic groups exhibited significant reduction in LPO levels and restoration of GSH contents. Administration of zingerone to treated diabetic groups indicated improvement in antioxidant enzymes (GPx, GR, GST, SOD and CAT). Administration of zingerone to treated diabetic groups minimized degeneration of pancreatic β-cells as witnessed from histopathological studies. Our results demonstrate that zingerone modulates hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, oxidative biochemical markers and degenerative changes in β-cells of treated diabetic groups.",Archives of physiology and biochemistry,2021-Aug,"Anwer T, Alkarbi ZA, Hassan Najmi A, Alshahrani S, Siddiqui R, Khan G, Firoz Alam M",7,1167,diabetes,2025-11-22
34891123,Untargeted metabolomics analysis of the anti-diabetic effect of Red ginseng extract in Type 2 diabetes Mellitus rats based on UHPLC-MS/MS.,"Red ginseng is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that has long been used to treat diabetes, and its blood sugar-lowering activity has been confirmed. However, the mechanism of action of red ginseng on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) at the metabolic level is still unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of red ginseng extract in the treatment of T2DM rats based on untargeted metabolomics. The rat model of T2DM was induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) combined with streptozotocin (STZ), and serum samples were collected after four weeks of treatment. The ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q Exactive HF-X Mass Spectrometer was used to analyze the level of metabolites in serum to evaluate the differences in metabolic levels between different groups. The results of biochemical analysis showed that red ginseng extract intervention significantly improved the levels of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), serum glucose (GLU), and fasting insulin (FINS) after four weeks. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis was used to study the overall changes of rat metabolomics. After the intervention of red ginseng extract, 50 biomarkers showed a callback trend. Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis showed that the regulated pathways were D-arginine and D-ornithine metabolism, D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, and tryptophan metabolism. Generally, the results demonstrated that red ginseng extract had beneficial effects on T2DM, which could be mediated via ameliorating the metabolic disorders.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2022-Feb,"Yang Z, Dan Wang, Li Y, Zhou X, Liu T, Shi C, Li R, Zhang Y, Zhang J, Yan J, Zhu X, Li Y, Gong M, Wang C, Yuan C, Cui Y, Wu X",17,1658,diabetes,2025-11-22
38360449,Greater risk of type 2 diabetes progression in multifetal gestations with gestational diabetes: the impact of obesity.,"The relationship between gestational diabetes mellitus and adverse outcomes in multifetal pregnancies is complex and controversial. Moreover, limited research has focused on the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus specifically in multifetal pregnancies, resulting in conflicting results from existing studies. This study aimed to assess the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus between singleton and multifetal pregnancies in a large cohort of parturients with a 5-year follow-up. A retrospective study was conducted on a prospective cohort of pregnant individuals with pregnancies between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2020, followed up to 5 years after delivery. Glucose levels during pregnancy were obtained from the Meuhedet Health Maintenance Organization laboratory system and cross-linked with the Israeli National Diabetes Registry. The cohort was divided into 4 groups: singleton pregnancy without gestational diabetes mellitus, singleton pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus, multifetal pregnancy without gestational diabetes mellitus, and multifetal pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus. Gestational diabetes mellitus was defined according to the American Diabetes Association criteria using the 2-step strategy. Univariate analyses, followed by survival analysis that included Kaplan-Meier hazard curves and Cox proportional-hazards models, were used to assess differences between groups and calculate the adjusted hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Among 88,611 parturients, 61,891 cases met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 6.5% in the singleton pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus group and 9.4% in the multifetal pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus group. Parturients with gestational diabetes mellitus, regardless of plurality, were older and had higher fasting plasma glucose levels in the first trimester of pregnancy. The rates of increased body mass index, hypertension, and earlier gestational age at delivery were significantly higher in the gestational diabetes mellitus group among patients with singleton pregnancies but not among patients with multifetal pregnancies. Survival analysis demonstrated that gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with adjusted hazard ratios of type 2 diabetes mellitus of 4.62 (95% confidence interval, 3.69-5.78) in singleton pregnancies and 9.26 (95% confidence interval, 2.67-32.01) in multifetal pregnancies (P<.001 for both). Stratified analysis based on obesity status revealed that, in parturients without obesity, gestational diabetes mellitus in singleton pregnancies increased the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus by 10.24 (95% confidence interval, 6.79-15.44; P<.001) compared with a nonsignificant risk in multifetal pregnancies (adjusted hazard ratio, 9.15; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-90.22; P=.059). Among parturients with obesity, gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus for both singleton and multifetal pregnancies (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.66; [95% confidence interval, 2.81-4.67; P<.001] and 9.31 [95% confidence interval, 2.12-40.76; P=.003], respectively). Compared with gestational diabetes mellitus in singleton pregnancies, gestational diabetes mellitus in multifetal pregnancies doubles the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus. This effect is primarily observed in patients with obesity. Our findings underscore the importance of providing special attention and postpartum follow-up for patients with multifetal pregnancies and gestational diabetes mellitus, especially those with obesity, to enable early diagnosis and intervention for type 2 diabetes mellitus.",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,2024-Aug,"Naeh A, Maor-Sagie E, Hallak M, Toledano Y, Gabbay-Benziv R",5,3834,diabetes,2025-11-22
34162165,Effects of platelet rich plasma on experimentally induced diabetic heart injury.,"Diabetic heart is one of the common complications of diabetes mellitus. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous product rich in growth factors that can enhance tissue regeneration. This work was conducted to study the PRP ability to improve diabetes-inducing cardiac changes. Also, it sheds more light on the possible mechanisms through which PRP induces its effects. Rats were divided into; control, PRP, diabetic, and PRP-diabetic groups. Cardiac specimens were obtained and processed for biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical study. The diabetic group exhibited a significant increase in cardiac oxidative stress, inflammation, and cardiac injury markers if compared with the control group. Additionally, the cardiac tissue showed variable morphological changes in the form of focal distortion and loss of cardiac myocytes. Distorted mitochondria and heterochromatic nuclei were observed in the cardiac muscle fibers. The mean number of charcoal-stained macrophages, and mean area fraction for collagen fibers, mean number of PCNA-immune positive cardiac muscle were significantly decrease in PRP- diabetic group. Collectively, the results showed that PRP treatment ameliorated most of all these previous changes. CONCLUSION: PRP ameliorated the diabetic cardiac injury via inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation. It was confirmed by biochemical, histological, and immunohistochemical study.

T2DM is associated with dysbacteriosis, and studies have found that altering the gut microbiota has a positive effect on treatment. In addition to hyperglycaemia, T2DM often causes damage to multiple organs. However, there are few studies on organ damage from faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). T2DM mice were divided into four groups and were given phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (T2DM group), FMT (FMT group), <i>Lactobacillus</i> (LAB group), and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> (BIO group) by gavage for six weeks, respectively. Mice on a normal diet (control group) were gavaged with PBS for six weeks. After gavage treatment, FMT, LAB, and BIO groups were similar in lowering glucose, endotoxemia was slightly reduced, and the colonic mucus layer and liver lobules developed towards normal tissue. Surprisingly, we found that the FMT group had unique effects on islet cell regeneration, increased functional β cells, and insulin sensitivity. <i>Lactobacillus</i> has the best glucose-lowering effect, but FMT has obvious advantages in β-cell regeneration, which provides new treatment ideas for tissue damage caused by T2DM.",Archives of physiology and biochemistry,2024-Jun,"Wang Y, Yang Z, Tang H, Sun X, Qu J, Lu S, Rao B",7,1242,diabetes,2025-11-22
33632114,Exploration of SQC Formula Effect on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus by Whole Transcriptome Profile in Rats.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that has turned out to be a pandemic all over the world. In China, some traditional Chinese herbal formulas have enjoyed a high reputation in T2DM treatment for centuries. In this study, ShenQi compound (SQC) is proposed, a formula that has been performed on T2DM clinical therapeutics in China for many years. The efficacy of SQC in a diabetic rat model by measuring food and water intake and examining islet microcirculatory index involves islets microvessel quantity and density, islets size, pancreatic microvascular wall thickness is evaluated. Meanwhile, gene microarray experiments were performed to explore the molecular mechanism of SQC treatment. In addition, a western medicine, metformin, was employed as a comparison. The results indicated that SQC could effectively improve polydipsia, polyphagia and weight loss caused by diabetes as well as pancreatic tissue damage and vascular injury for T2DM. Meanwhile, the gene microarray experiments indicated that SQC may improve the T2DM by affecting the biological functions related to detection of chemical stimulus involved in sensory perception of smell, G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway, cytoplasmic translation. In addition, SQC presented curative effect by the regulated function associated with translation, while metformin presented curative effect by the regulated function associated coagulation. SQC is an effective therapeutic drug on T2DM, and presents curative effect by regulated function associated with translation.","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2021-,"Fu X, Zhou X, Liu Y, Lei Y, Xie H, Leng Y, Gao H, Xie C",8,1565,diabetes,2025-11-22

In the present study, T1DM and T2DM patients without manifestations of DR were included in our preliminary clinical retrospective observation study to investigate the differentiated retinal function at the preclinical stage. Then, T1DM and T2DM rat models with 12-week diabetic duration were constructed to explore the potential mechanism of the discrepancy in retinal disorders. Our data demonstrated T1DM patients presented a poor retinal function, a higher allele frequency for ALDH2GA/AA, and a depressed aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) activity and silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) level, compared to T2DM individuals. In line with this, higher amplitudes of neurovascular function-related waves of electroretinograms were found in T2DM rats. Furthermore, the retinal outer nuclear layers were reduced in T1DM rats. The levels of retinal oxidative stress biomarkers including total reactive oxygen species, NADPH oxidase 4 and mitochondrial DNA damage, and inflammatory indicators covering inducible/endothelial nitric acid synthase ratio, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6 were obviously elevated. Notably, the level of retinal ALDH2 and SIRT1 in T1DM rats was significantly diminished, while the expression of neovascularization factors was dramatically enhanced compared to T2DM. Together, our data indicated that the ALDH2/SIRT1 deficiency resulted in prominent oxidative stress and was in association with DR progression. Moreover, a differentiating ALDH2/SIRT1 expression may be responsible for the dissimilar severity of DR pathological processes in chronic inflammatory-related T1DM and T2DM.",Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2021-,"He M, Long P, Chen T, Li K, Wei D, Zhang Y, Wang W, Hu Y, Ding Y, Wen A",10,1905,diabetes,2025-11-22

The Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) model was prepared in 40 adult male Wistar rats. These rats were randomly divided into four groups (n=10/group), including the control (Con) group, AKI group, Dex preconditioning (DPreC) group, and resveratrol (Res) combined with Dex preconditioning (Res+DPreC) group. The AKI model was prepared in the AKI, DPreC, and Res+DPreC group. The DPreC group received Dex, while the Con and AKI group received normal saline. The Res+DPreC group received Res in addition to Dex preconditioning. Histopathologic, apoptotic, enzymatic, and inflammatory changes in myocardial tissue were observed or detected. Histopathologic, apoptotic, and enzymatic changes in myocardial tissue demonstrated that AKI induced myocardial injury in T2DM rats; Dex preconditioning could mitigate this injury; and RES enhanced this effect. Inflammatory changes suggested that Dex alleviated the inflammatory response induced by AKI in T2DM rats via regulating the expressions of SIRT1, TNF-<i>α</i>, IL-17A, and IL-10.

Of the 468 records screened, 28 patients (5.6%) had diabetes mellitus before starting clozapine. Among the 28 patients, 15 (53.6%) were females, and 13 (46.4%) were male. In three-fourths (75%) of the patients, clozapine was started while these patients were admitted to the inpatient unit. Twenty-six patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus and 2 patients had type 1 diabetes mellitus at the time of starting clozapine. Most patients also had deranged blood glucose levels at the time of starting clozapine and required close monitoring of blood glucose levels and also starting/continuation of antidiabetic medications. None of the patients developed diabetic ketoacidosis during the initial part of the treatment. At the mean follow-up duration of 16 months, most patients were on regular follow-up for more than 1 year, and their blood glucose levels were maintained close to the reference range. Majority of these patients showed good response to clozapine.

However, it has not yet evolved into a medical intervention, mainly because most developed inhibitors target the zinc in IDE's catalytic site, potentially causing toxicity to other essential metalloproteases. Since IDE is a cellular receptor for the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), we constructed a VZV-based inhibitor. We computationally characterized its interaction site with IDE showing that the peptide specifically binds inside IDE's central cavity, however, not in close proximity to the zinc ion. We confirmed the peptide's effective inhibition on IDE activity in vitro and showed its efficacy in ameliorating insulin-related defects in types 1 and 2 diabetes mouse models. In addition, we suggest that inhibition of IDE may ameliorate the pro-inflammatory profile of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells toward insulin.

The aim of this study was to determine whether Y396, a synthesized analog of rhynchophylline, could protect against endothelial dysfunction in diabetes and the underlying molecular mechanism. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Y396 could directly target the EGFR and inhibit its phosphorylation induced by high glucose and EGF, downstream translocation to the nucleus of E2F1, and its transcriptional activity and expression of Nox4. Diabetes-induced endothelium malfunction was ameliorated by Y396 treatment through EGFR inhibition. Downstream oxidative stress was decreased by Y396 in the aortas of type 1 diabetes mellitus mice and primary rat aorta endothelial cells (RAECs). Y396 could also ameliorate tunicamycin-induced oxidative stress in the aorta and RAECs.

32560821,Topical GDF11 accelerates skin wound healing in both type 1 and 2 diabetic mouse models.,"This study aimed to investigate the role of truncated growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), in which the recognition site of Furin from wild-type GDF11 was deleted to enhance the cellular stability, in skin wound healing in the setting of diabetes mellitus (DM) and the underlying mechanisms. Our study found that both truncated and natural GDF11s effectively accelerated wound healing processes in both T1DM and T2DM mice with a potency compatible to PDGF, bFGF, and EGF, but being much higher than GDF8. At the cellular level, GDF11 stimulated the proliferation and suppressed HG-induced apoptosis of HSFs. Further study revealed that GDF11 activated the YAP-Smad2/3-CTGF fibrotic signaling pathway by reversing HG-induced upregulation of phosphorylated form of YAP (p-YAP), increases p-Smad2/3 levels, and restoring HG-induced repression of CTGF expression by GDF11. Overall, the study shows that both natural and truncated GDF11s promote the healing process of skin wound in mice of both T1DM and T2DM partly via stimulating dermal fibrosis via the YAP-Smad2/3-CTGF pathway, suggesting it a potential agent for treating skin wound in diabetic population.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2020-Aug,"Li Q, Jiao L, Shao Y, Li M, Gong M, Zhang Y, Tan Z, Wang Y, Yang X, Wang Z, Zhang Y",11,1162,diabetes,2025-11-22

Lactic acid bacteria have shown efficacy in alleviating diabetes. We studied the remission effect of nine strains of lactic acid bacteria on the symptoms of high-fat diet- and streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetes and its mechanism in mice. The oral administration of Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum or Lactobacillus rhamnosus to mice every day for more than 12 weeks showed that the individual strains could reduce the fasting and postprandial blood sugar levels, improve glucose tolerance and prevent pancreatic damage. However, L. rhamnosus strains showed greater efficacy than Bifidobacterium strains in the regulation of blood lipid levels. The effects of lactic acid bacteria on the recovery of glycolipid metabolism disorder and gut microbiota dysbiosis showed inter- and intraspecific differences. In addition, the strains that exhibited hypoglycaemic effects played a beneficial role in reducing insulin resistance by contributing to the production of short-chain fatty acids and alleviation of inflammation. The ability of lactic acid bacteria to reduce inflammation was found to be closely related to their ability to alleviate diabetes mellitus.",Food & function,2020-Jul,"Wang G, Si Q, Yang S, Jiao T, Zhu H, Tian P, Wang L, Li X, Gong L, Zhao J, Zhang H, Chen W",12,1228,diabetes,2025-11-22
38569512,Beneficial Effects of Echinacoside on Cognitive Impairment and Diabetes in Type 2 Diabetic db/db Mice.,"Cognitive dysfunction is an important comorbidity of diabetes. Insulin resistance may play a critical role in diabetes-related cognitive impairment. Echinacoside (ECH), a natural phenylethanoid glycoside, is the active component of anti-diabetes prescriptions in traditional Chinese medicine. Its effect on modulating insulin resistance has been confirmed but modulating neurodegenerative disease remains unclear. Db/db mice, a spontaneous type 2 diabetes mode, were intragastrically administered ECH by 300 mg/kg or an equivalent volume of saline. Weight, blood glucose, and insulin resistance index were measured. Morris water maze test was performed to observe the compound effects on cognition. Hippocampal lesions were observed by histochemical analysis. In db/db mice, ECH alleviated diabetes symptoms, memory loss, and hippocampal neuronal damage. Next, the expression of CD44 and phosphorylated tau was upregulated in diabetic mice. In addition, the insulin receptor substrate-1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase /protein kinase B signaling pathway was dysregulated in diabetic mice. All these dysregulations could be reversed by ECH. This study provides theoretical support and experimental evidence for the future application of ECH in diabetic cognition dysfunction treatment, promoting the development of traditional medicines.","Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association",2024-Aug,"Qin F, Yan Y, Yang N, Hao Y",4,1335,diabetes,2025-11-22

Its prevalence is increasing rapidly. We investigated whether urologists' awareness and recognition of glucosuria contributed to the diagnosis of diabetes and regulation of blood glucose. A total of 39,053 patients were retrospectively evaluated between January 2018 and February 2019. Of them, 16,211 had undergone urinalysis for varied reasons. Glucosuria was semi-quantitatively measured as (+), (++), (+++), and (++++). Patients were assessed in terms of whether they had been referred to endocrinology or internal medicine departments within the 15 days and the presence/absence of a previous or new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus by measuring blood glucose and HgbA1c levels. Glucosuria was detected in 665 patients (4.1%), of whom 495 were included in the study. 417 (84.2%) had been previously diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, and 56 (11.3%) newly received a diabetes mellitus diagnosis. Blood glucose and HbA1c values were normal in 22 (4.4%) patients with glucosuria. HgbA1c value was determined as 7 or above in 381 (91.3%) of 417 cases with a previous diabetes mellitus diagnosis.

39693609,Right ventricular dysfunction in preclinical models of type I and type II diabetes.,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a growing clinical entity and major health burden characterized by comorbid diabetes mellitus and heart failure. DCM has been commonly associated with impaired function of the left ventricle (LV); however, DCM likely also occurs in the right ventricle (RV) which has distinct physiology and pathophysiology from the LV. RV dysfunction is the strongest determinant of mortality in several clinical contexts yet remains poorly studied in diabetes. We investigated RV-specific pathophysiology using two models of diabetes-a well-characterized type 2 diabetes (T2DM) model of high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) in the mouse and a large animal model of type I diabetes in domestic pigs rendered diabetic with STZ. RV global and systolic function deteriorated with diabetes, alongside hypertrophic and fibrotic remodeling. We report evidence of impaired RV insulin sensitivity, dysregulated RV metabolic gene expression, and impaired mitochondrial dynamics. Importantly, while some of these outcomes were similar to those widely reported in the LV, others were not, such as unchanged antioxidant gene expression and regulators of fatty acid uptake. Importantly, these RV-specific changes occurred in both male and female T2DM mice, together emphasizing the importance of distinguishing the RV from the LV when studying DCM and begging the consideration of RV-specific therapies.",Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,2025-Mar,"Polson S, Thornburg J, McNair B, Cook C, Straight E, Fontana K, Hoopes C, Nair S, Bruns DR",9,1418,diabetes,2025-11-22

Induction of diabetes was carried out by eating HFD and a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ). Diabetic rats were divided into three groups: diabetic control (DC), insulin, and Mg-treated (Mg). The non-diabetic control (NDC) group received a normal diet. Their offspring were fed on a regular diet for four months. Blood glucose and body weight of all animals were measured weekly, and IPGTT, urine volume, and water intake were measured monthly. In both parents and their offspring, the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp was conducted, and blood samples were obtained. In all groups, the expression of IRS1, Akt and GLUT4 genes in muscle was measured. The HFD-fed rats exhibited a significant increase in blood glucose, body weight and IPGTT. In diabetic parents and their offspring, Mg or insulin therapy lowered blood glucose, IPGTT, and HbA1c relative to the DC group. They also increased GIR in parents and their offspring. Compared to the DC group, the expression of IRS1, Akt and GLUT4 genes was increased in both parents. Mg had positive effects on the expression of IRS1, Akt and GLUT4 genes in Mg treated offspring and reduced IR in them. As a result, magnesium may have beneficial effects on IR by increasing the expression of IRS1, Akt and GLUT4 genes.",European journal of pharmacology,2021-Oct,"Rezazadeh H, Sharifi MR, Sharifi M, Soltani N",4,1542,diabetes,2025-11-22

Glucose level, ex vivo cardiac function as well as systemic and cardiac redox state were assessed. At the end of the study protocol, glucose level was lower in diabetic rats who consumed mineral water. Moreover cardiac function wasn't affected by mineral water intake, however, significant antioxidant effects were observed. Our study suggests that 4-week consumption of low mineral water from the spring ""Sneznik-1/79"" has important role in regulation of glycemia and altering redox state in favor of elevated antioxidant capacity without affecting heart function.

For this reason, it is important to try to identify new mechanisms that could be involved in diabetes. A new class of receptors has been reported, called orphan receptors because the associated ligand and signaling cascades are unknown. These receptors could be an important source of targets for the treatment of many diseases such as diabetes and its associated complications like diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, the aim of this work was to study expression of the orphan receptors GPR149, GPR153, GPR176, TAAR3, TAAR5 and TAAR9 in the kidney of diabetic rats. We used male Wistar rats at 10-12 weeks of age. Diabetes was induced by a single dose of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg i.p.). After 4 weeks, tissues were obtained, and the expression of the mRNAs was measured by RT-PCR. Our results showed that the orphan receptors are expressed in a different way in the kidney.

We hypothesize that differences in islet gene expression alternative splicing which can contribute to altered protein function also participate in islet dysfunction. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data from islets of obese diabetes-resistant and diabetes-susceptible mice were analyzed for alternative splicing and its putative genetic and epigenetic modulators. We focused on the expression levels of chromatin modifiers and SNPs in regulatory sequences. We identified alternative splicing events in islets of diabetes-susceptible mice amongst others in genes linked to insulin secretion, endocytosis or ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathways. The expression pattern of 54 histones and chromatin modifiers, which may modulate splicing, were markedly downregulated in islets of diabetic animals. Furthermore, diabetes-susceptible mice carry SNPs in RNA-binding protein motifs and in splice sites potentially responsible for alternative splicing events. They also exhibit a larger exon skipping rate, e.g., in the diabetes gene <i>Abcc8</i>, which might affect protein function. Expression of the neuronal splicing factor <i>Srrm4</i> which mediates inclusion of microexons in mRNA transcripts was markedly lower in islets of diabetes-prone compared to diabetes-resistant mice, correlating with a preferential skipping of SRRM4 target exons. The repression of <i>Srrm4</i> expression is presumably mediated via a higher expression of miR-326-3p and miR-3547-3p in islets of diabetic mice. Thus, our study suggests that an altered splicing pattern in islets of diabetes-susceptible mice may contribute to an elevated T2D risk.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021-Aug,"Wilhelmi I, Neumann A, Jähnert M, Ouni M, Schürmann A",5,1694,diabetes,2025-11-22

Zinc finger AN1-type domain 3 (ZFAND3), known as testis-expressed sequence 27, is a type 2 diabetes mellitus-susceptibility gene. Limited information is available regarding the physiological role of ZFAND3 <i>in vivo</i>. This study aimed to investigate the association between ZFAND3 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. ZFAND3 was significantly upregulated in the liver of diabetic mice compared to wild-type mice. To overexpress ZFAND3, we generated a ZFAND3-expressing adenovirus (Ad) vector using an improved Ad vector exhibiting significantly lower hepatotoxicity (Ad-ZFAND3). Glucose tolerance was significantly improved in Ad-ZFAND3-treated mice compared to the control Ad-treated mice. ZFAND3 overexpression in the mouse liver also improved insulin resistance. Furthermore, gluconeogenic gene expression was significantly lower in primary mouse hepatocytes transduced with Ad-ZFAND3 than those transduced with the control Ad vector. The present results suggest that ZFAND3 improves glucose tolerance by improving insulin resistance and suppressing gluconeogenesis, serving as a potential novel therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association",2022-Apr,"Shimizu K, Ogiya Y, Yoshinaga K, Kimura H, Michinaga S, Ono M, Taketomi A, Terada T, Sakurai F, Mizuguchi H, Tomita K, Nishinaka T",12,1366,diabetes,2025-11-22

Here, we showed that probiotic supplements significantly improved fasting blood glucose in a gestational diabetes mellitus rat model. To further understand the mechanisms of probiotics in gestational diabetes mellitus, the gut microbiota were analyzed via 16S rRNA sequencing. We found that compared with the normal pregnant group, the gestational diabetes mellitus rats had decreased diversity of gut microbiota. Moreover, probiotic supplementation restored the diversity of the gut microbiota in gestational diabetes mellitus rats, and the gut microbiota structure tended to be similar to that of normal pregnant rats. In particular, compared with gestational diabetes mellitus rats, the abundance of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria was higher after probiotic supplementation. Furthermore, activating carbohydrate metabolism and membrane transport pathways may be involved in the potential mechanisms by which probiotic supplements alleviate gestational diabetes mellitus. Overall, our results suggested that probiotic supplementation might be a novel approach to restore the gut microbiota of gestational diabetes mellitus rats and provided an experimental evidence for the use of probiotic supplements to treat gestational diabetes mellitus.","Journal of microbiology (Seoul, Korea)",2021-Sep,"Zheng QX, Jiang XM, Wang HW, Ge L, Lai YT, Jiang XY, Chen F, Huang PP",8,1471,diabetes,2025-11-22

The prevalence of DD in inmates was calculated by intentional sampling and collecting the following variables about: a) type of diabetes, value of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and treatment; b) comorbidities; c) epidemiological and prison variables; knowledge of hyperglycaemia/hypoglycaemia, and e) participation in educational activities. Optimal control was considered to exist if Hb1A<7.5% and high risk if Hb1Ac >9%. Test x2 was used in order to study the association among qualitative variables. Multivariate analysis was carried out using logistic regression to determine variables associated with disease control. The study group considered 4,307 male patients, 50.2 years of average age. Ninety-three cases of DD were detected (prevalence 2.16%). 22.6% were treated with insulin, 51.6% with oral antidiabetics (OAD) and 25.8% with both. Type 1 users were younger, thinner, diagnosed at a younger age, heavy drug users and acknowledged to know how to act in the event of hyperglycaemia/hypoglycaemia. Optimal control was more common in type 2 diabetics, but multivariate analysis only associated it with OAD treatment. The prevalence observed in DD is much lower than that of the population outside prison and may be underestimated. Optimal control is low, and risk is very high, the results may be biased by the type of population, frequently drug-dependent and with few healthy habits. It is recommended to implement diabetes programmes or improve existing ones in order to increase the diagnosis and management of the disease.",Revista espanola de sanidad penitenciaria,2020-,"Pagarolas-Soler M, Alonso-Gaitón P, Sapera-Miquel N, Valiente-Soler J, Sánchez-Roig M, Coll-Cámara A",6,1725,diabetes,2025-11-22

All patients less than 16 years old diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus between 01 January 2015 and 31 December 2021 were included in this retrospective, observational study. The electronic medical records of each patient were reviewed to collect data on demographics, presentation and ongoing diabetes care. Sixty-four paediatric patients were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus during the study period, giving an incidence of 25 cases per 100 000 person years. Half the patients presented with diabetic ketoacidosis, with 14 (22% of the total cohort) presenting in severe diabetic ketoacidosis. There was no significant increase in the incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus or proportion of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis across the years of the study. Patients that had a delayed diagnosis had an increased likelihood of presenting with severe diabetic ketoacidosis. Incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus in the paediatric population in this regional centre in Queensland, Australia, is similar to national data. High proportions of patients presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis and severe diabetic ketoacidosis were identified in the study population, with delayed diagnosis, a risk factor for severe diabetic ketoacidosis.",Journal of paediatrics and child health,2024-Nov,"Cousen S, Hiskens M, Signal D, Vangaveti V, Hariharan G",5,1438,diabetes,2025-11-22
33345923,Adverse neonatal outcomes associated with pregestational diabetes mellitus in infants born preterm.,"Pregestational diabetes mellitus is associated with a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Based on the available data, it is unclear whether infants born preterm to mothers with pregestational diabetes mellitus are at a higher risk of adverse outcomes than other preterm infants. This study aimed to quantify the neonatal complications associated with pregestational diabetes mellitus in infants born preterm. This was a retrospective cohort study of all nonanomalous singleton neonates born in Texas from 2006 to 2014. Analysis was limited to births between 24 and 36 weeks' gestation and excluded multiple births, stillbirths, fetal congenital anomalies, neonates born to mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus, and neonates born to mothers with chronic hypertension. Results were stratified by pregestational diabetes mellitus status. Neonatal outcomes of interest included infant death, neonatal intensive care unit admission, low 5-minute Apgar scores, assisted ventilation of >6 hours, surfactant administration, and seizures. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the association between pregestational diabetes mellitus and neonatal outcomes controlling for potential confounding variables. After predefined exclusions, 277,210 births were analyzed, 4164 of which were to mothers with pregestational diabetes mellitus. The comparison group consisted of mothers without pregestational diabetes mellitus. The preterm infant mortality rates between the pregestational diabetic and nondiabetic groups were similar. However, after adjusting for confounding variables, there was an increased risk of infant mortality for preterm neonates born to mothers with pregestational diabetes mellitus. In infants born preterm, pregestational diabetes mellitus was associated with an increased risk of infant death, low 5-minute Apgar score, prolonged assisted ventilation, surfactant requirement, and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Neonates born before 34 weeks' gestation had an increased risk of assisted ventilation of >6 hours, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and seizure. Neonates born to mothers with pregestational diabetes mellitus in the late preterm period between 34 and 36 weeks' gestation had an increased risk of low Apgar score at 5 minutes, assisted ventilation of >6 hours, surfactant use, and neonatal intensive care unit admission.

Currently, information on the bacterial diversity of patients with diabetes mellitus and periodontitis in Uganda is scanty. This study set out to describe the bacteria associated with periodontitis in patients with diabetes mellitus in Uganda, as part of a larger study describing the association between periodontal disease and diabetes mellitus. This was a case control involving 45 samples of gingival crevicular fluid collected from participants with periodontitis, the cases being 26 participants with diabetes mellitus and controls 19 participants without diabetes mellitus. Sequencing using the 16s Oxford nanopore long read protocol was followed by a bioinformatics analysis pipeline for alpha and beta diversity indices in the two groups. Multivariate tests were done to determine the differences in the bacterial composition in the two groups. Of the 739 Operational Taxonomic Units and 500 phyla identified, 37.9% (280/739) were from participants with diabetes mellitus. Analysis of beta diversity revealed a dissimilarity between the two study groups (CAP score = 0) with a significant association noted between periodontitis and the subgingival bacteria (P = 0.001).

Diabetes mellitus is one of the modifiable, independent, and major risk factors of ischemic stroke. This study aimed to find the prevalence of diabetes mellitus among patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted to the Department of Medicine in a tertiary care centre. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted to the Department of Medicine from 19 July 2023 to 19 November 2023 after obtaining ethical approval from the Institutional Review Committee. Detailed clinical history, random blood sugar and glycated haemoglobin were used to define diabetes mellitus. A convenience sampling method was used. The point estimate was calculated at a 95% Confidence Interval. Among 80 patients, diabetes mellitus was seen in 25 (31.25%) (21.09-41.41, 95% Confidence Interval). Among them, 19 (76%) had previously diagnosed and 6 (24%) had newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. The poor glycemic control was seen in 11 (44%).

38761257,Bone metabolism in diabetes: a clinician's guide to understanding the bone-glucose interplay.,"Skeletal fragility is an increasingly recognised, but poorly understood, complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Fracture risk varies according to skeletal site and diabetes-related characteristics. Post-fracture outcomes, including mortality risk, are worse in those with diabetes, placing these people at significant risk. Each fracture therefore represents a sentinel event that warrants targeted management. However, diabetes is a very heterogeneous condition with complex interactions between multiple co-existing, and highly correlated, factors that preclude a clear assessment of the independent clinical markers and pathophysiological drivers for diabetic osteopathy. Additionally, fracture risk calculators and routinely used clinical bone measurements generally underestimate fracture risk in people with diabetes. In the absence of dedicated prospective studies including detailed bone and metabolic characteristics, optimal management centres around selecting treatments that minimise skeletal and metabolic harm. This review summarises the clinical landscape of diabetic osteopathy and outlines the interplay between metabolic and skeletal health. The underlying pathophysiology of skeletal fragility in diabetes and a rationale for considering a diabetes-based paradigm in assessing and managing diabetic bone disease will be discussed.",Diabetologia,2024-Aug,"Sheu A, White CP, Center JR",3,1359,diabetes,2025-11-22
33804680,PAI-1 in Diabetes: Pathophysiology and Role as a Therapeutic Target.,"Hypofibrinolysis is a key abnormality in diabetes and contributes to the adverse vascular outcome in this population. Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 is an important regulator of the fibrinolytic process and levels of this antifibrinolytic protein are elevated in diabetes and insulin resistant states. This review describes both the physiological and pathological role of PAI-1 in health and disease, focusing on the mechanism of action as well as protein abnormalities in vascular disease with special focus on diabetes. Attempts at inhibiting protein function, using different techniques, are also discussed including direct and indirect interference with production as well as inhibition of protein function. Developing PAI-1 inhibitors represents an alternative approach to managing hypofibrinolysis by targeting the pathological abnormality rather than current practice that relies on profound inhibition of the cellular and/or acellular arms of coagulation, and which can be associated with increased bleeding events. The review offers up-to-date knowledge on the mechanisms of action of PAI-1 together with the role of altering protein function to improve hypofirbinolysis. Developing PAI-1 inhibitors may form for the basis of future new class of antithrombotic agents that reduce vascular complications in diabetes.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021-Mar,"Altalhi R, Pechlivani N, Ajjan RA",3,1333,diabetes,2025-11-22
36374817,Diagnostic and Therapeutic Application of Exosomal microRNAs Inducing Inflammation in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus is a class of noncommunicable chronic metabolic disorders marked by hyperglycemia due to insulin production, insulin action or both and has reached epidemic levels around the world. The two most frequent types of diabetes are type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite substantial improvements in the knowledge and treatment of DM, the associated incidence and mortality rates remain steadily increased. Reliable markers for the early detection, monitoring and focused treatment of DM are desperately required. Conversely, microRNAs (miRNAs) have received much significance due to their regulatory involvement in gene expression. Fascinatingly, exosomes can be enclosed into miRNAs to transport or distribute them into the target cells or tissues in which they have a physiological regulatory action. Thus, exosomal miRNAs are proving to be important regulators in the establishment and maintenance of DM, however, further mode of action will be needed to investigate in order to fully comprehend the pathophysiological process. Hereby, this review outlines the recent findings on the role of exosomal miRNAs intending to understand the precise function in diagnostic and therapeutic aspects in T2DM disease.",Critical reviews in immunology,2022-,"Preethi KA, Selvakumar SC, Sekar D",3,1260,diabetes,2025-11-22

In this study, Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were intraperitoneally injected with 75mg/kg streptozotocin to establish T1DM model, fecal samples were collected and DNA were extracted, 16S rRNA microbial gene clone library were constructed, and lastly high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were performed. The results showed that the abundances of pathogenic bacteria such as Ruminococcaceae, Shigella, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Rothia and Alistipes associated with infection and inflammation in T1DM rats were up-regulated, while the abundances of beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Faecalitalea, Butyricicoccus and Allobaculum were reduced. Among them, Butyricicoccus and Allobaculum protect intestinal barrier function by producing short-chain fatty acids. This study suggests that intestinal inflammation and reduction of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) caused by the imbalance of gut microbiota are crucial to the pathogenesis of T1DM.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2020-Apr,"Ma Q, Li Y, Wang J, Li P, Duan Y, Dai H, An Y, Cheng L, Wang T, Wang C, Wang T, Zhao B",12,1148,diabetes,2025-11-22
38123711,Kidney biopsy findings in children with diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetic nephropathy may begin in childhood, but clinical kidney disease ascribable to this is uncommon in children with type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus. We reviewed our experience of kidney biopsies in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Between 1995 and 2022, there were biopsies in 17 children, with various clinical indications for kidney biopsy, making this the largest series of biopsies in diabetic children with clinical kidney abnormalities. Four biopsies showed diabetic nephropathy, three showed the combination of diabetic nephropathy and IgA nephropathy, and ten showed a variety of conditions other than diabetic nephropathy: minimal change disease (2), membranous nephropathy (2), thin glomerular basement membrane lesion (2), non-glomerular chronic damage in Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (2), acute pauciimmune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis (1) and IgA nephropathy (1). Clinical clues of something other than diabetic nephropathy included acute kidney injury, microscopic haematuria or chronic kidney impairment with little or no proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome after a short duration of diabetes. We confirm that changes better known in adults with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus can occur in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus: overt diabetic nephropathy either on its own or combined with other conditions and kidney disorders other than diabetic nephropathy.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2024-Jun,"Weerasooriya L, Howie AJ, Wakeman MP, Cavanagh S, Milford DV",5,1426,diabetes,2025-11-22

32008502,Importance of Hypomagnesemia on New-Onset Diabetes Mellitus in Pediatric Renal Transplant Patients.,"Hypomagnesemia is considered as an independent risk factor for new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplant. New-onset diabetes mellitus is an important comorbidity associated with allograft failure. In this study, our aim was to investigate the correlation between hypomagnesemia and preva-lence of posttransplant diabetes mellitus. We retrospectively evaluated 189 pediatric renal transplant recipients who underwent their first renal transplant. A patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus before transplant was excluded from the analysis. Hypomagnesemia was defined as having serum magnesium levels lower than 1.7 mg/dL. Diabetes was defined according to American Diabetes Association criteria. Serum magnesium and glucose levels at month 1 after transplant were recorded. We evaluated the records of 188 patients. New-onset diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 7 patients (3.7%). Hypomagnesemia was shown in 50% of patients (64/120). Mean glucose levels were higher in those with hypomagnesemia than in patients without hypomagnesemia (119.2 vs 91.56 mg/dL, respectively; P = .01) A significant negative correlation was observed between serum magnesium and glucose levels (r = -0.53; P < .05). Mean serum magnesium level in patients with new-onset diabetes mellitus was lower than in patients without diabetes (1.56 ± 0.21 vs 1.75 ± 0.26 mg/dL; P = .052). Hypomagnesemia is a common problem in pediatric renal transplant. The relationship between serum magnesium and glucose levels suggests that hypomagnesemia plays a role in the development of new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplant.

32653024,The role of DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic condition characterised by β cell dysfunction and persistent hyperglycaemia. The disorder can be due to the absence of adequate pancreatic insulin production or a weak cellular response to insulin signalling. Among the three types of DM, namely, type 1 DM (T1DM), type 2 DM (T2DM), and gestational DM (GDM); T2DM accounts for almost 90% of diabetes cases worldwide.Epigenetic traits are stably heritable phenotypes that result from certain changes that affect gene function without altering the gene sequence. While epigenetic traits are considered reversible modifications, they can be inherited mitotically and meiotically. In addition, epigenetic traits can randomly arise in response to environmental factors or certain genetic mutations or lesions, such as those affecting the enzymes that catalyse the epigenetic modification. In this review, we focus on the role of DNA methylation, a type of epigenetic modification, in the pathogenesis of T2DM.",Clinical epigenetics,2020-Jul,"Ahmed SAH, Ansari SA, Mensah-Brown EPK, Emerald BS",4,989,diabetes,2025-11-22

The primary pathological mechanism of T1DM involves activated T cells infiltrating the pancreas, leading to islet inflammation and the destruction of β-cells. However, the question of whether exosomes derived from MSCs can suppress the migration of T cells to the pancreas in the context of T1DM remains unresolved. In this study, we observed that miR-25 was highly expressed in MSCs exosomes and associated with signaling pathways related to cell migration. In vitro assay, we synthesized a miR-25 mimic and transiently transfected it into activated T cells, which revealed that miR-25 can effectively reduce the expression of CXCR3. Additionally, according to the in vivo T1DM mouse model, we found that there was a significant increase in miR-25 levels in T1DM mice treated with MSCs and the number of T cells decreased. Overall, our findings suggest that MSCs exosomes containing miR-25 can impede the infiltration of activated T cells into the pancreas in T1DM by repressing CXCR3 expression in these cells.",Gene,2025-Feb,"Zhou B, Zhou N, Jiang J, Zhang X, Zhao X, Duan Y, Zhang Y",7,1196,diabetes,2025-11-22
39159661,Thyroid Hormone and Diabetes Mellitus Interplay: Making Management of Comorbid Disorders Complicated.,"Insulin and thyroid hormones play important roles in our body. Insulin helps regulate the glucose level while the thyroid hormones affect various cells and tissues, metabolizing protein, lipids, and glucose. Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis are potential hazards for type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is a high prevalence of hypothyroidism being more common compared to hyperthyroidism coexisting with diabetes mellitus. Thyroid hormones affect glucose metabolism through its action on peripheral tissues (gastrointestinal tract, liver, skeletal muscles, adipose tissue, and pancreas). High-level thyroid hormone causes hyperglycemia, upregulation of glucose transport, and reduction in glycogen storage. The reverse is observed during low levels of thyroid hormone along with insulin clearance. The net result of thyroid disorder is insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes mellitus can downsize the regulation of thyroid stimulating hormones and impair the conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine in peripheral tissues. Furthermore, poorly managed type 2 diabetes mellitus may result in insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, contributing to the proliferation of thyroid tissue and an increase in nodule formation and goiter size. Although metformin proves advantageous for both type 2 diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorder patients, other antidiabetics like sulfonylureas, pioglitazone, and thiazolidinediones may have adverse effects on thyroid disorders. Moreover, antithyroid drugs such as methimazole can weaken glycemic control in individuals with diabetes. Thus, an interplay between both endocrinopathies is observed and individualized care and management of the disorder needs to be facilitated.",Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,2024-Dec,"Chauhan A, Patel SS",2,1708,diabetes,2025-11-22

We aim to estimate the prevalence of suicide in patients with diabetes. A meta-analysis using PRISMA methodology was adopted to examine the incidence of suicide in diabetic patients. From inception to October 2022, three online databases (PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Web of Science) were used to search studies. We used random-effects model to analysis. And our primary outcome was the incidence of suicide death per 100 person-years, and other outcomes were prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. To explore the sources of heterogeneity in our study, we performed subgroup and meta-regression analyses. The suicide death rate in diabetic patients was 0.027 per 100 person-years, with a higher rate for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus compared to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The prevalence of suicidal ideation in diabetes patients was 0.175, with a higher prevalence in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus compared to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. The prevalence of suicide attempts in diabetes patients was 0.033, indicating a higher rate for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus compared to Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. The results indicate a high rate of suicide among people with diabetes, and this study identifies populations and regions at high risk for suicide. Our review emphasizes interventions in mental health and the improvement of suicide prevention programmes. The study investigated suicide death, suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in diabetic individuals. Suicide rates are elevated among diabetic patients, and various patient groups face distinct suicide risks. It is important to prioritize the mental well-being of diabetic individuals and enhance interventions, including personalized approaches, to inform public health efforts aimed at preventing and addressing suicide among diabetic patients.

32973072,Diabetes mellitus is associated with a higher risk for major depressive disorder in women than in men.,"Both diabetes mellitus and being female significantly increase the risk of being diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). The diagnosis of MDD, combined with diabetes mellitus, can be detrimental in terms of mortality and morbidity. We aimed at investigating the impact of diabetes mellitus on the gender gap in MDD over the course of a human lifetime. In a cross-sectional study over the course of 17 years, medical claims data of the general Austrian population (n=8 996 916) between 1997 and 2014 was analyzed. Of these, 123 232 patients with diabetes mellitus were extracted and compared with non-diabetic controls. In a cohort of 123 232 patients with diabetes mellitus and 1 933 218 controls (52% females, 48% males), women with diabetes had 2.55 times increased ORs to be diagnosed with MDD compared with women without diabetes (95% CI 2.48 to 2.62, p<0.001) between the age of 30 and 69 years. The effect of diabetes mellitus on the prevalence of MDD was significantly smaller in men (OR=1.85, 95% CI 1.80 to 1.91, p<0.001). Between 0 and 30 years and after age 70 years, the gender gap of MDD was not different between patients with and without diabetes mellitus. The peak of the gender gap in MDD in patients with diabetes mellitus was around the age of 40-49 years. A sensitivity analysis identified overweight, obesity and alcohol dependence as the most potent influencing factors of the widening of the gender gap among patients with diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is a stronger risk factor for MDD in women than in men, with the greatest width of the gender gap between 40 and 49 years.

31644828,Depression in context: Important considerations for youth with type 1 vs type 2 diabetes.,"Youth with diabetes are at increased risk for depression. However, severity and correlates of depressive symptoms may differ by diabetes type. Associations of depressive symptoms with global health, diabetes duration, and gender were compared between youth with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. A sample of 149 youth ages 12 to 21 diagnosed with either type 1 (n = 122) or type 2 (n = 27) diabetes were screened during routine clinic appointments. Regression models were constructed to examine differences by diabetes type. Adolescents with type 2 diabetes had significantly higher depressive symptom scores (4.89 vs 2.99, P = .025) than those with type 1 diabetes. A significant interaction between global health and diabetes type on depressive symptoms revealed inverse associations between global health and depressive symptoms that was stronger among youth with type 2 diabetes (β = -.98, P < .001) than type 1 (β = -.48, P < .001). Further probing revealed that among youth with better global health, adolescents with type 1 had more depressive symptoms than those with type 2 diabetes (β = .33, P = .035). Diabetes duration and depressive symptoms were positively associated among individuals with type 2 (β = .86, P = .043), but not type 1 diabetes. No gender differences were detected. These findings suggest that correlates of depressive symptoms in youth with diabetes differ by diabetes type. Global health appears to be an important correlate among youth with both types, whereas diabetes duration was only a significant factor among those with type 2 diabetes.

The risk of GC was 46% and 14% higher in individuals with T1DM and T2DM, respectively, than in those without diabetes. The risk of GC development in patients with diabetes showed a U-shape curve of change with DM duration. Our meta-analysis suggested that both T1DM and T2DM present a higher risk of GC development. The risk of GC may be influenced by the different time windows following the onset of diabetes.

Given the remarkable progress in patient risk characterization, there is particular interest in using molecular biomarkers to guide diabetes management. Metabolomics is an emerging molecular approach that helps better understand the etiology and promises the identification of novel biomarkers for complex diseases. Both targeted or untargeted metabolites extracted from cells, biofluids, or tissues can be investigated by established high-throughput platforms, like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) techniques. Metabolomics is proposed as a valuable tool in precision diabetes medicine to discover biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the progress of diabetes through personalized phenotyping and individualized drug-response monitoring.

People with diabetes have a much higher risk of impaired brain function and psychiatric disorders. Neurotrophins are factors that protect neuronal tissue and improve the function of the central nervous system, and among them is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The level and function of BDNF in diabetes seems to be disturbed by and connected with the presence of insulin resistance. On the other hand, there is evidence for the highly beneficial impact of physical activity on brain function and BDNF level. However, it is not clear if this protective phenomenon works in the presence of diabetes. In this review, we summarize the current available research on this topic and find that the results of published studies are ambiguous.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020-Jan,"Rozanska O, Uruska A, Zozulinska-Ziolkiewicz D",3,897,diabetes,2025-11-22

The reasons behind this phenomenon are not yet fully understood. Early life infections, prenatal and perinatal factors, and diet composition have been associated with the triggering of autoimmunity and the risk of presentation of T1DM. However, the rapid increase in new cases of the disease raises the hypothesis that lifestyle factors, which have traditionally been associated with type 2 diabetes, such as obesity and unhealthy eating patterns could also play a role in the genesis of autoimmune diabetes. This article aims to highlight the changing epidemiology of T1DM and the importance of properly recognizing the environmental factors behind it, as well as the connections with the pathogenesis of the disorder and the need to prevent or delay T1DM and its long-term complications.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2023-Mar,"Ogrotis I, Koufakis T, Kotsa K",3,881,diabetes,2025-11-22
33639846,The clinical profiles and outcomes of HIV-negative cryptococcal meningitis patients in type II diabetes mellitus.,"The clinical profiles and outcomes of cryptococcal meningitis have been shown to vary depending on the underlying condition. The aim of this study was to investigate clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with and without type II diabetes mellitus. A retrospective study was performed. Clinical data of HIV-negative cryptococcal meningitis patients with type II diabetes mellitus (n = 26) and without type II diabetes mellitus (n = 52) referring to the Jiangxi Chest Hospital between January 2012 to December 2018 were analyzed. The data were analyzed using chi square, none-parametric tests, and logistic regression. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. In this study, cryptococcal meningitis patients suffering from type II diabetes mellitus had a higher mortality (23.08% vs. 7.69%; P = 0.055), and required longer hospitalization (59.58 vs. 42.88 days; P = 0.132). Moreover, cerebrospinal fluid examinations revealed that cryptococcal meningitis patients with type II diabetes mellitus had higher opening pressure (271.54 vs. 234.23 mmH<sub>2</sub>O; P = 0.125).The results of multivariate regression analysis revealed that cryptococcal meningitis patients with type II diabetes were more often presented with visual disorders (28.54% vs. 11.54%; [95% CI 0.056-0.705]; p = 0.012), and had higher cerebrospinal fluid protein levels (1027.62 ± 594.16 vs. 705.72 ± 373.88 mg/l; [95% CI 1.000-1.002]; p = 0.016). Among patients with type II diabetes mellitus, nausea and vomiting was more frequent at the initial visit in those died (100% vs. 50%; p = 0.027), and 66% of died type II diabetes mellitus patients were poorly controlled blood glucose level, compared with 30% in survival type II diabetes mellitus patients. This study suggests that cryptococcal meningitis patients with type II diabetes mellitus differ significantly from cryptococcal meningitis patients without type II diabetes mellitus with respect to clinical symptoms such as visual disorders and cerebrospinal fluid examination.

33723651,Liraglutide targets the gut microbiota and the intestinal immune system to regulate insulin secretion.,"Liraglutide controls type 2 diabetes (T2D) and inflammation. Gut microbiota regulates the immune system and causes at least in part type 2 diabetes. We here evaluated whether liraglutide regulates T2D through both gut microbiota and immunity in dysmetabolic mice. Diet-induced dysmetabolic mice were treated for 14 days with intraperitoneal injection of liraglutide (100 µg/kg) or with vehicle or Exendin 4 (10 µg/kg) as controls. Various metabolic parameters, the intestinal immune cells were characterized and the 16SrDNA gene sequenced from the gut. The causal role of gut microbiota was shown using large spectrum antibiotics and by colonization of germ-free mice with the gut microbiota from treated mice. Besides, the expected metabolic impacts liraglutide treatment induced a specific gut microbiota specific signature when compared to vehicle or Ex4-treated mice. However, liraglutide only increased glucose-induced insulin secretion, reduced the frequency of Th1 lymphocytes, and increased that of TReg in the intestine. These effects were abolished by a concomitant antibiotic treatment. Colonization of germ-free mice with gut microbiota from liraglutide-treated diabetic mice improved glucose-induced insulin secretion and regulated the intestinal immune system differently from what observed in germ-free mice colonized with microbiota from non-treated diabetic mice. Altogether, our result demonstrated first the influence of liraglutide on gut microbiota and the intestinal immune system which could at least in part control glucose-induced insulin secretion.",Acta diabetologica,2021-Jul,"Charpentier J, Briand F, Lelouvier B, Servant F, Azalbert V, Puel A, Christensen JE, Waget A, Branchereau M, Garret C, Lluch J, Heymes C, Brousseau E, Burcelin R, Guzylack L, Sulpice T, Grasset E",17,1574,diabetes,2025-11-22
34371877,Supplementation of Morin Restores the Altered Bone Histomorphometry in Hyperglycemic Rodents via Regulation of Insulin/IGF-1 Signaling.,"Pathological mechanisms underlining diabetic bone defects include oxidative damage and insulin/IGF-1 imbalance. Morin is a bioflavonoid with antioxidant and anti-diabetic effects. This study evaluates morin's protective effects against altered bone histomorphometry in diabetic rats through assessing insulin/IGF-1 pathway as a potential mechanism. Diabetic animals were administered two morin doses (15 and 30 mg/kg) for 5 weeks. Different serum hepatic and renal functions tests were assessed. Bone density and histomorphometry in cortical and trabecular tissues were evaluated histologically. The expressions of insulin, c-peptide and IGF-1 were estimated. In addition, the enzymatic activities of the major antioxidant enzymes were determined. Diabetic-associated alterations in serum glucose, aminotransferases, urea and creatinine were attenuated by morin. Diabetic bone cortical and trabecular histomorphometry were impaired with increased fibrosis, osteoclastic functions, osteoid formation and reduced mineralization, which was reversed by morin; particularly the 30 mg/kg dose. Insulin/IGF-1 levels were diminished in diabetic animals, while morin treatment enhanced their levels significantly. Diabetes also triggered systemic oxidative stress noticeably. The higher dose (30 mg/kg) of morin corrected the endogenous antioxidant enzymatic activities in diabetic rats. Findings indicate the potential value of morin supplementation against hyperglycemia-induced skeletal impairments. Activation of insulin/IGF-1 signaling could be the underlining mechanism behind these effects.",Nutrients,2021-Jul,"Abuohashish HM, AlAsmari AF, Mohany M, Ahmed MM, Al-Rejaie SS",5,1588,diabetes,2025-11-22

The purpose of this study is to assess hepatitis B vaccination coverage among adults with and without diabetes mellitus. Data from the 2014-2018 National Health Interview Survey were analyzed in 2020 to determine hepatitis B vaccination series completion (≥3 doses) among adults aged 18-59 and ≥60 years with diabetes mellitus. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors independently associated with hepatitis B vaccination among adults aged 18-59 and ≥60 years with diabetes mellitus. In 2018, among adults aged 18-59 years with diabetes mellitus, 33.2% had received hepatitis B vaccination (≥3 doses), an increase of 9.7 percentage points from 2014 (p<0.05). Among adults aged ≥60 years with diabetes mellitus, coverage was 15.3% in 2018 and did not increase during 2014-2018. Coverage was not significantly different among adults with diabetes mellitus compared with those without diabetes mellitus, even after controlling for the assessed factors. Among adults with diabetes mellitus aged 18-59 and ≥60 years, younger age, having some college or college education, having been tested for HIV, being healthcare personnel, or having traveled to hepatitis B virus-endemic areas were independently associated with an increased likelihood of vaccination. Self-reported hepatitis B vaccination coverage among adults with diabetes mellitus remains suboptimal.

32781250,The STING-IRF3 pathway is involved in lipotoxic injury of pancreatic β cells in type 2 diabetes.,"Lipotoxic injury of pancreatic β cells is an important pathological feature in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) can recognize its own DNA leaked into the cytoplasm from damaged mitochondria or nuclei of the host cell, thus activating its downstream factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), causing inflammation and apoptosis. The STING-IRF3 signaling pathway is closely related to glycolipid metabolism, but its relationship with the lipotoxicity of pancreatic β cells has rarely been reported. Here, we investigated the role of the STING-IRF3 signaling pathway in lipotoxicity-induced inflammation, apoptosis, and dysfunction of pancreatic β cells. We examined the activation of STING and IRF3 in islets of db/db mice and identified the role of the STING-IRF3 signaling pathway in palmitic acid (PA)-induced lipotoxic injury of INS-1, a rat insulinoma cell line. STING and phosphorylated IRF3 including downstream interferon-β were upregulated in islets of db/db mice and PA-induced INS-1 cells. Gene silencing of STING or IRF3 ameliorated PA-induced INS-1 cell inflammation and apoptosis, and reversed impaired insulin synthesis. Additionally, PA induced downregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT signaling pathway, and impaired high glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was reversed after knockdown of STING or IRF3. Our results suggest that activation of the STING-IRF3 pathway triggers inflammation and apoptosis of pancreatic β cells, leading to β-cell damage and dysfunction. Hence, inhibition of this signaling pathway may represent a novel approach for β-cell protection in T2DM.",Molecular and cellular endocrinology,2020-Dec,"Hu HQ, Qiao JT, Liu FQ, Wang JB, Sha S, He Q, Cui C, Song J, Zang N, Wang LS, Sun Z, Chen L, Hou XG",13,1642,diabetes,2025-11-22

The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of insulin dependence on the risk of 30-day perioperative adverse events after TSA in patients with diabetes mellitus using a large national database. We retrospectively identified patients with diabetes mellitus who underwent TSA in the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database from 2011 to 2020. Patients were grouped as having insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The primary outcome was 30-day complication, and secondary outcome variables included 30-day readmission, reoperation, and death. Multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusted for baseline differences were performed. The cohort included 5888 patients with diabetes mellitus who underwent TSA, with 1705 patients in the insulin-dependent group and 4183 patients in the non-insulin-dependent group. The 30-day postoperative complication rate was higher in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (8.7%) than in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (5.6%). The 30-day hospital readmission rate was higher in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (4.8%) than in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (3.3%). These significant differences in complication and readmission rates persisted in the multivariable logistic regression analyses after adjusting for baseline differences between the two groups. Reoperation and death were not associated with insulin dependence. Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have higher odds of episode-of-care complication and readmission compared with patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, even after adjusting for between-group baseline differences.

35672565,MicroRNA and Diabetic Bone Disease.,"The incidence of diabetes is increasing worldwide. Diabetes mellitus is characterized by hyperglycemia, which in the long-term damages the function of many organs including the eyes, the vasculature, the nervous system, and the kidneys, thereby imposing an important cause of morbidity for affected individuals. More recently, increased bone fragility was also noted in patients with diabetes. While patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) have low bone mass and a 6-fold risk for hip fractures, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an increased bone mass, yet still display a 2-fold elevated risk for hip fractures. Although the underlying mechanisms are just beginning to be unraveled, it is clear that diagnostic tools are lacking to identify patients at risk for fracture, especially in the case of T2DM, in which classical tools to diagnose osteoporosis such as dual X-ray absorptiometry have limitations. Thus, new biomarkers are urgently needed to help identify patients with diabetes who are at risk to fracture. Previously, microRNAs have received great attention not only for being involved in the pathogenesis of various chronic diseases, including osteoporosis, but also for their value as biomarkers. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on microRNAs and their role in diabetic bone disease and highlight recent studies on miRNAs as biomarkers to predict bone fragility in T1DM and T2DM. Finally, we discuss future directions and challenges for their use as prognostic markers.",Current osteoporosis reports,2022-Jun,"Daamouch S, Emini L, Rauner M, Hofbauer LC",4,1514,diabetes,2025-11-22
36692892,The unique pathophysiological features of diabetes mellitus secondary to total pancreatectomy: proposal for a new classification distinct from diabetes of the exocrine pancreas.,"Diabetes of the exocrine pancreas (DEP; a.k.a. pancreatic diabetes or pancreatogenic diabetes or type 3c diabetes mellitus or T3cDM) refers to different diabetes types resulting from disorders of the exocrine pancreas. DEP is characterized by the structural and functional loss of glucose-normalizing insulin secretion in the context of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction. Among these forms, new-onset diabetes mellitus secondary to total pancreatectomy (TP) has unique pathophysiological and clinical features, for which we propose a new nomenclature such as post-total pancreatectomy diabetes mellitus (PTPDM). TP results in the complete loss of pancreatic parenchyma, with subsequent absolute insulinopenia and lifelong need for exogenous insulin therapy. Patients with PTPDM also exhibit deficiency of glucagon, amylin and pancreatic polypeptide. These endocrine abnormalities, coupled with increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, deficiency of pancreatic enzymes and TP-related modifications of gastrointestinal anatomy, can lead to marked glucose variability and increased risk of iatrogenic (insulin-induced) severe hypoglycemic episodes ('brittle diabetes'). We believe that diabetes mellitus secondary to TP should not be included in the DEP spectrum in light of its peculiar pathophysiological and clinical features. Therefore, we propose a new classification for this entity, that would likely provide more accurate prognosis and treatment strategies.",Expert review of endocrinology & metabolism,2023-Jan,"Infante M, Ricordi C",2,1461,diabetes,2025-11-22

We have reported previously that daily leptin injections help to alleviate these symptoms. Therefore, we hypothesized that leptin gene therapy could help to normalize the neuroendocrine dysfunction seen in T1D. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were injected i.v. with a lentiviral vector containing the leptin gene or green fluorescent protein. Ten days later, they were injected with the vehicle or streptozotocin (STZ). HPA function was assessed by measuring norepinephrine (NE) levels in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and serum corticosterone (CS). Treatment with the leptin lentiviral vector (Lepvv) increased leptin and insulin levels in non-diabetic rats, but not in diabetic animals. There was a significant reduction in blood glucose levels in diabetic rats due to Lepvv treatment. Both NE levels in the PVN and serum CS were reduced in diabetic rats treated with Lepvv. Results from this study provide evidence that leptin gene therapy in STZ-induced diabetic rats was able to partially normalize some of the neuroendocrine abnormalities, but studies with higher doses of the Lepvv are needed to develop this into a viable option for treating T1D.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021-Dec,"Clark KA, Shin AC, Sirivelu MP, MohanKumar RC, Maddineni SR, Ramachandran R, MohanKumar PS, MohanKumar SMJ",8,1292,diabetes,2025-11-22

The gestational diabetes mellitus group consisted of 87 pregnant women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus, and the control group consisted of 93 healthy pregnant women without gestational diabetes mellitus. Serum Metrnl levels were determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The two groups were similar in terms of demographic features. The median serum Metrnl level was found to be 1.16 ng/mL in the gestational diabetes mellitus group, while it was determined as 2.2 ng/mL in the control group (p=0.001). The two groups were divided into two subgroups based on participants' body mass index, normal weight and overweight. The lowest median Metrnl level was detected in the normal weight gestational diabetes mellitus group, followed by the overweight gestational diabetes mellitus group, normal weight control group, and overweight control group (1.1, 1.2, 2, and 2.4 ng/mL, respectively). Receiver operating curve analysis was performed to determine the value of the serum Metrnl level in terms of predicting gestational diabetes mellitus.

In addition, LB also down regulated the glucose metabolism related genes PEPCK and GSK3β. The glucose uptake, consumption and glycogen content were increased. Moreover, LB-treated diabetic mice also showed hypoglycaemic effects.

We sought to facilitate the identification of monogenic diabetes by creating a new tool that we validated in a pediatric maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) cohort. We first created the DIAgnose MOnogenic DIAbetes (DIAMODIA) criteria based on the pre-existing, but incomplete, MODY calculator. This new score is composed of four strong and five weak criteria, with patients having to display at least one weak and one strong criterion. The effectiveness of the DIAMODIA criteria was evaluated in two patient cohorts, the first consisting of patients with confirmed MODY diabetes (n=34) and the second of patients with T1DM (n=390). These DIAMODIA criteria successfully detected 100% of MODY patients. Multiple correspondence analysis performed on the MODY and T1DM cohorts enabled us to differentiate MODY patients from T1DM. The three most relevant variables to distinguish a MODY from T1DM profile were: lower insulin-dose adjusted A1c score ≤9, glycemic target-adjusted A1c score ≤4.5, and absence of three anti-islet cell autoantibodies. We validated the DIAMODIA criteria, as it effectively identified all monogenic diabetes patients (MODY cohort) and succeeded to differentiate T1DM from MODY patients.

Inflammation associated with the onset and exacerbation of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an essential factor in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiovascular complications. Diabetes-induced myocardial dysfunction is characterized by myocardial fibrosis, which includes structural heart changes, myocardial cell death, and extracellular matrix protein accumulation. The mice groups in this study were divided as follows: Cont, control (db/m mice); T2DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus mice (db/db mice); Vil.G, db/db + vildagliptin 50 mg/kg/day, positive control, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor; Bla.C, db/db + blackcurrant 200 mg/kg/day. In this study, Bla.C treatment significantly improved the homeostatic model evaluation of glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) indices and diabetic blood markers such as HbA1c in T2DM mice. In addition, Bla.C improved cardiac function markers and cardiac thickening through echocardiography. Bla.C reduced the expression of fibrosis biomarkers, elastin and type IV collagen, in the left ventricle of a diabetic cardiopathy model. Bla.C also inhibited TD2M-induced elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines in cardiac tissue (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, and TGF-β). Thus, Bla.C significantly improved cardiac inflammation and cardiovascular fibrosis and dysfunction by blocking inflammatory cytokine activation signals. This showed that Bla.C treatment could ameliorate diabetes-induced cardiovascular complications in T2DM mice.

37154595,Assessing the Relationship Between Gut Microbiota and Posttransplant Diabetes Mellitus.,"The incidence of diabetes significantly increases after kidney transplant, and the associated gut microbiota are closely related to diabetes. However, the gut microbiota of recipients with diabetes after kidney transplant remain unexplored. Feces samples from recipients with diabetes 3 months after kidney transplant were collected and analyzed using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our study included 45 transplant recipients: 23 posttransplant diabetes mellitus recipients, 11 recipients without diabetes mellitus, and 11 recipients with preexisting diabetes mellitus. No significant differences in intestinal flora richness and α diversity were observed among the 3 groups. However, principal coordinate analysis based on UniFrac distance revealed significant differences in β diversity. At the phyla level, the abundance of Proteobacteria in posttransplant diabetes mellitus recipients decreased (P = .028), whereas that of Bactericide (P = .004) increased. At the class level, the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria (P = .037) decreased, whereas thatofBacteroidia (P=.004)increased.Attheorderlevel, the abundanceof Enterobacteriales (P = .039)decreased, whereasBacteroidales (P=.004)increased.Atthe family level, the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae (P = .039) and Peptostreptococcaceae (P = .008) decreased, whereas Bacteroidaceae (P = .010) increased. At the genus level,the abundance of Lachnospiraceae incertae sedis (P = .008) decreased, whereas Bacteroides (P = .010) increased. Furthermore, KEGG analysis identified 33 pathways, among which the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids was closely related to gut microbiota and posttransplant diabetes mellitus. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of the gut microbiota from posttransplant diabetes mellitus recipients. The microbial composition of stool samples of post- transplant diabetes mellitus recipients was significantly different from recipients without diabetes and with preexisting diabetes. The number of bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids decreased, whereas pathogenic bacteria increased.",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,2023-Apr,"Long J, Feng Z, Zhou H, Liu J, Zhang J, Ouyang J",6,2102,diabetes,2025-11-22
38774228,Association between diabetes mellitus and primary biliary cholangitis: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Previous observational studies have demonstrated a link between diabetes mellitus(DM) and primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Nevertheless, since these relationships might be confused, whether there is any causal connection or in which direction it exists is unclear. Our investigation aimed to identify the causal associations between DM and PBC. We acquired genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets for PBC, Type 1 diabetes(T1DM), and Type 2 diabetes(T2DM) from published GWASs. Inverse variance-weighted (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median (WM), Simple mode, and weighted mode methods were used to determine the causal relationships between DM(T1DM or T2DM) and PBC. Sensitivity analyses were also carried out to ensure the results were robust. To determine the causal relationship between PBC and DM(T1DM or T2DM), we also used reverse MR analysis. T1DM was associated with a higher risk of PBC (OR 1.1525; 95% CI 1.0612-1.2517; <i>p</i> = 0.0007) in the IVW method, but no evidence of a causal effect T2DM on PBC was found (OR 0.9905; 95% CI 0.8446-1.1616; <i>p</i> = 0.9071) in IVW. Results of the reverse MR analysis suggested genetic susceptibility that PBC was associated with an increased risk of T1DM (IVW: OR 1.1991; 95% CI 1.12-1.2838; <i>p</i> = 1.81E-07), but no evidence of a causal effect PBC on T2DM was found (IVW: OR 1.0101; 95% CI 0.9892-1.0315; <i>p</i> = 0.3420). The current study indicated that T1DM increased the risk of developing PBC and vice versa. There was no proof of a causal connection between PBC probability and T2DM.

35488240,The incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus among women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies.,"Previous studies have shown that polycystic ovary syndrome is a predictor of gestational diabetes mellitus, but we do not know exactly how many polycystic ovary syndrome patients may develop gestational diabetes mellitus. Currently, the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus among women with polycystic ovary syndrome varies greatly across studies, ranged from 4.12% to 59.50%. Besides, many factors have been found to be related to the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus among women with polycystic ovary syndrome, but the results among different studies are not consistent. The possible causes of inconsistencies between the current estimates were unclear. This review aimed at exploring the pooled incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus among women with polycystic ovary syndrome, summarizing possible causes of the inconsistencies in the current estimates, try to provide a reference for prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus and polycystic ovary syndrome in the future. Systematic searches of different databases (including EMBASE, Web of Science, MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, CNKI and PubMed) were conducted for studies published until 31 May 2021. Statistical analyses were performed using R software, the pooled incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus among polycystic ovary syndrome patients was combined using random effects model. Cochrane's ""Tool to Assess Risk of Bias in Cohort Studies"" was used for quality assessment. Twenty-two longitudinal studies were included. A total of 24,574 women with polycystic ovary syndrome were identified in the 22 articles, of which 4478 were reported with gestational diabetes mellitus. The pooled incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus among women with polycystic ovary syndrome was 20.64%, with a 95% CI of 14.64% to 28.30%. In the meta-regression model, several variables including age, area, quality score and sample size were suggested as significant sources of heterogeneity, accounted for 77.57% of the heterogeneity across studies. Evidence in this review suggests that gestational diabetes mellitus were common among women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

34042213,"Lysophosphatidylinositol, especially albumin-bound form, induces inflammatory cytokines in macrophages.","Lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) is a glycero-lysophospholipid and a natural agonist against GPR55. The roles of the LPI/GPR55 axis in the pathogenesis of inflammation have been controversial. In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the roles of the LPI/GPR55 axis in inflammation, especially the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α from macrophages. We treated RAW264.7 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) with LPI and observed that LPI induced the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α from these cells, as well as the phosphorylation of p38. These responses were inhibited by treatment with CID16020046 (CID), an antagonist against GPR55, or SB202190, an inhibitor of p38 cascade or knockdown of GPR55 with siRNA. Treatment with CID or ML-193, another antagonist against GPR55, attenuated the elevation of inflammatory cytokines in the plasma or tissue of db/db mice and in a septic mouse model induced using lipopolysaccharide, suggesting contributions to the improvement of insulin resistance and protection against organ injuries by treatment with CID or ML-193, respectively. In human subjects, although the serum LPI levels were not different, the levels of LPI in the lipoprotein fractions were lower and the levels in the lipoprotein-depleted fractions were higher in subjects with diabetes. LPI bound to albumin induced the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α from RAW264.7 cells to a greater degree than LPI bound to LDL or HDL. These results suggest that LPI, especially the albumin-bound form, induced inflammatory cytokines depending on the GPR55/p38 pathway, which might contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity-induced inflammation and acute inflammation.",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2021-Jun,"Kurano M, Kobayashi T, Sakai E, Tsukamoto K, Yatomi Y",5,1687,diabetes,2025-11-22

The present study aims to identify the best hit selective androgen <i>receptor</i> (AR) modulator by <i>in silico</i> studies and then investigates its antidiabetic effects in high-fat diet- and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T2DM male rat model. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) studies were carried out using Maestro 13.1 and Desmond (2023-2024). Cytotoxicity and insulin secretion were measured in MIN6 cell lines. T2DM was induced using high-fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks, followed by single STZ (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). OneTouch Ultra glucometer was used to measure fasting blood glucose. Gene expression was determined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Histopathology was carried out using hematoxylin and eosin stain. Through molecular docking, we identify ligandrol as a potential hit. Ligandrol showed a good binding affinity (-10.74 kcal/mol). MD showed that ligandrol is stable during the 100 ns simulation. Ligandrol increases insulin secretion in a dose-dependent manner <i>in vitro</i> in 2 h. Ligandrol (0.3 and 1 mg/kg, orally) significantly decreased the body weight and fasting blood glucose levels compared with the HFD and STZ group. Gene expression showed that ligandrol significantly increased the AR-targeted gene, <i>neurogenic differentiation 1</i>, compared with the HFD and STZ group. Histopathological staining studies showed that ligandrol prevents pancreatic islet degeneration compared with the HFD and STZ group. Our findings suggest that ligandrol's protective effect on pancreatic islets leading to its antidiabetic effect occurs through the activation of AR.",Assay and drug development technologies,2024-,"Sugumar D, Ghosh R, Rymbai E, Chandrasekaran J, Krishnamurthy PT, P RS, Sahu S, Selvaraj D",8,1778,diabetes,2025-11-22
33978765,Silencing circANKRD36 inhibits streptozotocin-induced insulin resistance and inflammation in diabetic rats by targeting miR-145 via XBP1.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is defined as a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia, which results from a deficiency in insulin secretion and/or insulin action. In diabetic patients, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is in the majority. We explored the effects of circANKRD36 on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced insulin resistance and inflammation in diabetic rats with the aim of uncovering the underlying mechanism. STZ was used to induce the in vivo T2DM rat model. After circANKRD36 interference, blood glucose, insulin and adiponectin were respectively detected. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay (TUNEL) were conducted to examine inflammation and apoptosis in T2DM rats, and western blot was used for detecting apoptosis-related proteins. The binding relationships among circANKRD36, miR-145 and XBP1 were examined by luciferase reporter assay. Results showed that circANKRD36 was expressed at a high level in T2DM rats, while silencing circANKRD36 led to decreased blood glucose and insulin, accompanied by increased adiponectin level, and ameliorating insulin resistance. Silencing circANKRD36 alleviated the inflammation and suppressed cell apoptosis in the pancreatic tissues of T2DM rats, which was abated by miR-145 inhibitor. The binding of miR-145 to XBP1 was then confirmed. Additionally, miR-145 inhibitor increased the level of XBP1 in T2DM rats, which was decreased in the presence of circANKRD36 silencing. This study is the first to prove that silencing circANKRD36 inhibits STZ-induced insulin resistance and inflammation in diabetic rats by targeting miR- 145 via XBP1. The results warrant the importance of circRNAs as drug target and thereby pave way for the development of newer therapeutic measures for T2DM.",Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

31580241,"Incidence, Risk Factors, and Follow-Up of Diabetes Mellitus After Liver Transplant: A Prospective Study From Iran.","Diabetes mellitus is one of the metabolic consequences of solid-organ transplant. Most reports on this condition are from cross-sectional or retrospective studies. In this prospective study, we evaluated the incidence, risk factors, and short-term follow-up of diabetes mellitus in recipients of liver transplant at the Shiraz Liver Transplant Center (Shiraz, Iran). Recipients of liver transplant who were ≥ 16 year old and were seen from February 2017 until February 2018 were included. Anthropologic measurements and diabetes history were taken between 2 and 4 weeks after transplant. Fasting blood sugar and 75-g oral glucose tolerance test were measured. We diagnosed patients with diabetes mellitus and patients with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance test based on American Diabetes Association criteria. These patients were promptly followed for at least 6 months. Of the 397 recipients who were included in this study, 35.5% were female and 64.5% were male. Overall, the most common reason for transplant was primary sclerosing cholangitis (22.5%). We had 42 living donors and 355 deceased donors, with none being unrelated donors. At first visit (3.8 ± 1.6 wk posttransplant), 20.4% of recipients did not have diabetes, 24.2% were diagnosed with preexisting diabetes mellitus, 31.2% had impaired fasting blood sugar or oral glucose tolerance test, and 24.2% were determined to have posttransplant diabetes mellitus. At last visit (13.6 ± 4.9 mo posttransplant), prevalence for posttransplant diabetes mellitus was 10.8%. Multivariate regression analysis showed that age correlated with development of impaired glucose tolerance test or posttransplant diabetes mellitus (odds ratio 1.060; 95% confidence interval, 1.026-1.095; P < .001). In this prospective cohort study, we followed recipients posttransplant and reevaluated the prevalence of posttransplant diabetes mellitus.

34265071,Representativeness of the Swiss Diabetes Registry - a single centre analysis.,"The Swiss Diabetes Registry (SwissDiab) is a multicentre, longitudinal, observational study of outpatients with diabetes receiving treatment at tertiary care centres. The aim of this study was to evaluate the representativeness of the participants at the study centre in the Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes at the Cantonal Hospital of St Gallen by comparing diabetes-related characteristics of participating and nonparticipating patients. The study included 493 SwissDiab participants enrolled between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2016 and 640 nonparticipating patients treated at the centre during the same time period. For participants and nonparticipating patients, demographic characteristics, clinical findings, blood chemistry and medication were retrieved from the SwissDiab baseline visit and the medical record &plusmn;6 months from the first available outpatient visit to the clinic for diabetes-related care within the study period. Nonparticipating patients were further divided into three subgroups: (i) excluded from SwissDiab, or having received (ii) &ge;6 months or (iii) &lt;6 months of prior diabetes treatment at the centre. Differences in diabetes-related clinical characteristics were determined using simple bivariate (nonparametric) statistical analyses stratified by diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2. Compared with nonparticipants, participants smoked less (diabetes mellitus type 1: 24% vs 45%; diabetes mellitus type 2: 21% vs 29%), had higher educational attainment (diabetes mellitus type 1: 39% vs 21%; and diabetes mellitus type 2: 25% vs 18%) and lower glycated haemoglobin levels (diabetes mellitus type 1: 7.2% vs 7.8%; diabetes mellitus type 2: 7.2% vs 8.1%). In diabetes mellitus type 2, the proportion of females (30% vs 38%) and a migration background (36% vs 49%) were lower among participants. (All p-values &lt;0.05.) In a stratified analysis SwissDiab participants had slightly better controlled diabetes than nonparticipating patients with &ge;6 months of prior treatment, whereas the diabetes of patients recently referred to the clinic (with &lt;6 months of prior treatment) and patients excluded from participation in SwissDiab were less well controlled. The observed differences in clinical characteristics between study participants and nonparticipating patients indicate that SwissDiab is likely to overestimate the state of diabetes care and management.

Materials and methods: 82 children were examined, they were divided into groups by presence of gingivitis and diabetes mellitus. The level of interleukin-18 in oral fluid was determined by immunoassay. Results: In patients with chronic catarrhal gingivitis and type I diabetes mellitus the level of interleukin-18 in oral fluid is the highest (70.91±7.48 pg / ml); the level of interleukin-18 in children with diabetes mellitus and healthy gums is high enough too, it is 14.87±1.11 pg / ml. Interleukin-18 is 3.41±0.25 pg / ml in healthy children with healthy gums. It is 5.74±0.27 pg / ml in somatically healthy children with chronic catarrhal gingivitis. Conclusions: We indicated that an increase in the value of interleukin-18 in oral fluid is associated with the presence of diabetes mellitus in children. Moreover, this cytokine can be considered as a potential biomarker of gum inflammation in children with diabetes mellitus.","Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)",2021-,"Maksymenko AI, Sheshukova OV, Kuz IO, Lyakhova NA, Tkachenko IM",5,1167,diabetes,2025-11-22

The current study was designed to compare the antidepressant effect of some antidiabetic drugs such as vildagliptin, pioglitazone, glyburide, and metformin on depression-related or unrelated to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM was induced by high-fat diet and streptozotocin, while diabetes-unrelated depression was induced by reserpine. Antidiabetic agents reduced diabetes-associated depression as indicated by the reduction in the immobility time in the forced swim test, elevation of cortical and hippocampal serotonin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and the increase in serum β-Amyloid 1-42 (Aβ1-42) levels. Antidiabetic agents also reduced serum corticosterone levels suggesting their inhibitory effect on hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. The antidepressant activity of the tested compounds was associated with reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation in brain. Vildagliptin showed the highest, while glyburide showed the least antidiabetic and antidepressant activity. Antidepressant activities of pioglitazone and metformin were comparable. The difference in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities between groups showed the same pattern of the antidepressant effect suggesting that these two pathways may play role in ameliorating depression in diabetic rats. On the other hand, the administration of reserpine in small doses (0.2 mg/kg) induced depression associated with hyperglycemia in non-diabetic rats. Although all treatments improved glycemic parameters to similar levels, vildagliptin showed the greatest effect on Aβ1-42, serotonin, norepinephrine, and BDNF levels. In conclusion, vildagliptin seems to be the leading drug among the tested antidiabetics and may be the most appropriate antidiabetic for managing diabetes-associated depression.",Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,2020-Aug,"Soliman E, Essmat N, Mahmoud MF, Mahmoud AAA",4,1904,diabetes,2025-11-22

Diabetes mellitus has been found to pose important health risks to the developing fetus, mother, and offspring. Here, we investigated the protective effects of S14G-humanin, a potent humanin analogue, against maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in mice with diabetes mellitus. The results show that S14G-humanin administration reduced the blood glucose levels and elevated the serum insulin levels in diabetes mellitus mice. The parameters of serum lipid metabolism including low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein in diabetes mellitus mice were also decreased after S14G-humanin administration. Intervention with S14G-humanin also increased the fetus alive ratio and fetal length, as well as decreased fetal and placenta weights. In addition, we demonstrate that S14G-humanin elevated the activity of the anti-oxidative enzymes catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase and reduced the inflammatory cytokines levels in the placentas of diabetes mellitus mice. The significantly increased endoplasmic reticulum stress in the placentas of diabetes mellitus mice was also attenuated by S14G-humanin administration.

Although some studies suggest that exercise can improve the cognitive decline associated with diabetes, the potential effects of endurance training (ET) accompanied by Matricaria chamomilla (M.ch) flowers extract on cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes has been poorly understood. Forty male Wistar rats were randomized into 5 equal groups of 8: healthy-sedentary (H-sed), diabetes-sedentary (D-sed), diabetes-endurance training (D-ET), diabetes-Matricaria chamomilla. (D-M.ch), and diabetes-endurance training-Matricaria chamomilla. (D-ET-M.ch). Nicotinamide (110 mg/kg, i.p.) and Streptozotocin (65 mg/kg, i.p.) were utilized to initiate type 2 diabetes. Then, ET (5 days/week) and M.ch (200 mg/kg body weight/daily) were administered for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of the experiment, cognitive functions were assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test and a passive avoidance paradigm using a shuttle box device. Subsequently, using crystal violet staining, neuron necrosis was examined in the CA3 area of the hippocampus. Diabetic rats showed cognitive impairment following an increase in the number of necrotic cells in region CA3 of the hippocampal tissue. Also, diabetes increased serum levels of lipid peroxidation and decreased total antioxidant capacity in serum and hippocampal tissue. ET + M.ch treatment prevented the necrosis of neurons in the hippocampal tissue. Following positive changes in hippocampal tissue and serum antioxidant enzyme levels, an improvement was observed in the cognitive impairment of the diabetic rats receiving ET + M.ch. Therefore the results showed that treatment with ET + M.ch could ameliorate memory and inactive avoidance in diabetic rats. Hence, the use of ET + M.ch interventions is proposed as a new therapeutic perspective on the death of hippocampal neurons and cognitive deficit caused by diabetes.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2021-Mar,"Heidarianpour A, Mohammadi F, Keshvari M, Mirazi N",4,1989,diabetes,2025-11-22

The outcome was defined as a newly detected diabetes mellitus or pre-diabetes by a blood test. The risk models were developed using logistic regression (LR) and interpretable machine learning (ML) methods. Models were validated using area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), precision-recall curve (AUC-PR), and calibration plots. Two existing diabetes mellitus risk models were included for comparison. The prevalence of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetes mellitus was 15.08%. In addition to known risk factors (age, BMI, WHR, SBP, waist circumference, and smoking status), we found that sleep duration, and vigorous recreational activity time were also significant risk factors of diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetes mellitus. Both LR (AUC-ROC = 0.812, AUC-PR = 0.448) and ML models (AUC-ROC = 0.822, AUC-PR = 0.496) performed well in the validation sample with the ML model showing better discrimination and calibration. The performance of the models was better than the two existing models. Sleep duration and vigorous recreational activity time are modifiable risk factors of diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetes in Chinese adults. Non-laboratory-based risk assessment models that incorporate these lifestyle factors can enhance case detection of diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetes.",Journal of diabetes investigation,2022-Aug,"Dong W, Tse TYE, Mak LI, Wong CKH, Wan YFE, Tang HME, Chin WY, Bedford LE, Yu YTE, Ko WKW, Chao VKD, Tan CBK, Lam LKC",13,1918,diabetes,2025-11-22

37877941,Fetal hyperechogenic pancreas and gestational diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus is the most common metabolic disorder in pregnancy, and it is associated with detrimental short- and long-term consequences to both the fetus and the mother. Some studies in the literature have found an association between the identification of fetal hyperechogenic pancreas via prenatal ultrasound and the presence of gestational diabetes mellitus. The aim of our study was to assess the association of fetal hyperechogenic pancreas with gestational diabetes mellitus using the meta-analytic method. We searched electronic databases for articles describing association (or lack of) between fetal hyperechogenic pancreas and gestational diabetes mellitus. For each study, we identified patients with or without fetal hyperechogenic pancreas and with or without gestational diabetes mellitus. We then calculated risk ratios for gestational diabetes mellitus using the meta-analytic Mantel-Haenszel method with a random effect to estimate the risk ratio. We identified 286 patients in 2 studies. The risk ratio of gestational diabetes mellitus in women with fetal hyperechogenic pancreas was 3.34, P<0.0001 (95% CI, 1.56-7.17; I<sup>2</sup>=82% [95% CI 22.7-95.7%]). The presence of a fetal hyperechogenic pancreas was associated with gestational diabetes mellitus. We concluded that the detection of fetal pancreas echogenicity may be a promising indicator of gestational diabetes mellitus that, pending further research studies, can potentially help the clinician in making this diagnosis.",Minerva obstetrics and gynecology,2024-Oct,"Taylor MK, Sisti G",2,1519,diabetes,2025-11-22

Data on medical, dental, and pharmacy claims generated between April 2015 and March 2016 were analyzed in patients with diabetes mellitus aged 50-74 years who used outpatient services during this period. Patients initiating medical and pharmacy claims related to diabetes mellitus were defined as having diabetes mellitus. Number of teeth was defined as number of teeth in conjunction with periodontitis due to the nature of the data source. Descriptive statistics were used to investigate the association between number of teeth and public health expenditure. Data on a total of 1,017,758 patients with diabetes mellitus were analyzed. Patients with the fewest teeth incurred higher medical expenses. The largest mean difference in medical expenditure was observed between patients with 5-9 teeth and those with over 28 teeth. The results of this study suggest that public health expenditure on patients with diabetes mellitus differs based on number of teeth.",The Bulletin of Tokyo Dental College,2021-Mar,"Suzuki S, Noda T, Nishioka Y, Myojin T, Kubo S, Imamura T, Kamijo H, Sugihara N",8,1197,diabetes,2025-11-22

37839502,β-cell neogenesis: A rising star to rescue diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM), a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose, is caused by various degrees of insulin resistance and dysfunctional insulin secretion, resulting in hyperglycemia. The loss and failure of functional β-cells are key mechanisms resulting in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of β-cell failure, and exploring approaches for β-cell neogenesis to reverse β-cell dysfunction may provide novel strategies for DM therapy. Emerging studies reveal that genetic susceptibility, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative stress, islet inflammation, and protein modification linked to multiple signaling pathways contribute to DM pathogenesis. Over the past few years, replenishing functional β-cell by β-cell neogenesis to restore the number and function of pancreatic β-cells has remarkably exhibited a promising therapeutic approach for DM therapy. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the underlying mechanisms of β-cell failure in DM, highlight the effective approaches for β-cell neogenesis, as well as discuss the current clinical and preclinical agents research advances of β-cell neogenesis.

38054414,Screening of Mutations in Maturity-onset Diabetes of the Young-related Genes and <i>RFX6</i> in Children with Autoantibody-negative Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is the most common type of monogenic diabetes. To date, mutations have been identified in 14 different genes of patients with a clinical diagnosis of MODY. This study screened mutations in 14 MODY-related genes and the regulator factor X6 (<i>RFX6</i>) gene in children. The presence of clinical features of MODY and negative results for three autoantibody markers of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in children and adolescents were used as inclusion criteria for genetic testing. The screening panel for next-generation sequencing included 14 MODY-related genes (<i>GCK, HNF4A, HNF1A, HNF1B, PDX1, NEUROD1, KLF11, CEL, PAX4, INS, BLK, ABCC8, KCNJ11</i>, and <i>APPL1</i>) and the <i>RFX6</i> gene. Twenty-four different variants in MODY-related genes were identified in 49 children diagnosed with autoantibody-negative T1DM. Twelve variants were classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) while 12 were interpreted as variant of unknown significance. Nine of the P/LP variants were found in <i>GCK</i>, two in <i>HNF1B</i>, and one in <i>ABCC8</i>. Three variants were novel, and one was a <i>de novo</i> variant. All but one of the variants exhibited heterozygotic inheritance. The frequencies of the MODY subtypes differed from previous reports. Although GCK-MODY was the most frequent mutation in Turkish children, similar to previous studies, the second most prevalent MODY subtype was HNF1B-MODY.

40056062,Estimation of Salivary Ferritin Levels in Subjects with Chronic Periodontitis with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Ferritin is an iron storage protein essential for iron homeostasis regulation and an indicator of iron stores. It is an acute phase reactant and is elevated in inflammation and chronic infection. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease with periodontopathogens possessing haemolytic activity which leads to increased local iron concentration and iron disorder. Inflammation and excess systemic iron are mediating risk factors of type 2 diabetes mellitus. To evaluate and compare the salivary ferritin levels in subjects with chronic periodontitis with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Unstimulated saliva sample was collected by standardized spitting technique from 45 individuals, aged between 30 and 65 years divided into three groups. Group I-Healthy individuals, Group II-Subjects with chronic periodontitis with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Group III-Subjects with chronic periodontitis without type 2 diabetes mellitus. The salivary ferritin levels are analysed using latex-enhanced turbidimetric assay in an autoanalyzer.

It also aims to identify potential pharmacological and herbal treatments that effectively address both OLP and the metabolic dysfunctions associated with DM. This study employs a two-way MR approach to investigate the potential causal relationships between diabetes type and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, and the risk of OLP. We analyzed differentially expressed genes from the OLP dataset in the Genomics Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, cross-referencing these with HbA1c-related genes for enrichment analysis. Additionally, the Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb) and Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database (TCMSP) were utilized to assess the effectiveness of specific drugs, herbs, and ingredients in treating OLP while managing blood glucose levels. The MR analysis revealed a significant association between Type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and an increased risk of OLP, unlike Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This finding indicates a unique immunological interaction in T1DM that may predispose individuals to OLP. The drug prediction analysis focused on core targets linked to OLP and HbA1c, evaluating the therapeutic potential of retinoic acid, prednisone, and thalidomide for treating OLP and regulating blood glucose levels. Additionally, herbal medicines such as Ecliptae herbaand Amygdalus communis vas, along with herbal ingredients like quercetin, luteolin, and 17-beta-estradiol, were identified for their anti-inflammatory properties and potential to mitigate metabolic dysfunction in diabetes. The study highlighted a complex interplay between diabetes and OLP, underscoring the efficacy of integrated therapeutic strategies that target both conditions. The findings suggest that both pharmaceutical and herbal treatments can effectively manage the clinical manifestations of OLP and associated metabolic challenges. This holistic approach to treatment could significantly enhance patient outcomes by addressing the interconnected aspects of these chronic conditions.",BMC oral health,2024-Oct,"Yao M, Lu Y, Liu T, Shang H, Lu H, Dong B, Xu Y",7,2207,diabetes,2025-11-22
37143390,Prevalence of impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia in people with diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta-analysis from 21 countries and regions.,"Impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH) is a complication of glucose-lowering therapies for diabetes. The purpose of this review was to estimate the pooled prevalence of IAH and unawareness of hypoglycaemia (UAH). We searched the major databases from inception to 8 August 2022 and included all cross-sectional and cohort studies reporting IAH prevalence in people with diabetes. A random-effects model was used to pool effect values. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to identify study-level characteristics affecting prevalence. Sixty-two studies from 21 countries published between 2000 and 2022 were included, with 39,180 participants (type 1 diabetes: 19,304 vs. Type 2 diabetes: 14,650). The pooled prevalence was 23.2% (95% CI: 18.4%-29.3%) via the Clarke questionnaire, 26.2% (95% CI: 22.9%-29.9%) via the Gold score, and 58.5% (95% CI: 53.0%-64.6%) via the Pedersen-Bjergaard method, all from studies classified as presenting a moderate and low risk of bias. The prevalence of IAH was generally higher in people with type 1 diabetes than in those with type 2 diabetes and lowest in Europe. Meta-regression results show that the duration of diabetes was a factor influencing the prevalence of IAH. The prevalence of UAH by the Pedersen-Bjergaard method was 17.6 (95% CI: 14.9%-20.3%). IAH is a prevalent risk event among people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, showing clinical heterogeneity and regional variability. UAH, an adverse progression of IAH, is also a serious burden.

Control or Streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg, iv)-induced T1DM adult male Wister rats were treated with the vehicle and Salidroside (100 mg/kg, orally) for 8 weeks daily. As compared to T1DM-induced rats, Salidroside improved kidney structure, reduced urinary protein and albumin level, increased creatinine clearance, and suppressed renal fibrosis. It also decreased mRNA and protein levels of Wnt1, Wnt3, and TGF-β1, phosphorylation of Smad-3, total and nuclear levels of β-catenin, and levels and activities of cleaved caspase-3. Concomitantly, Salidroside significantly increased the levels of p-β-catenin (Ser<sup>33/37</sup> /Thr<sup>41</sup> ) and suppressed protein levels of Axin-2, fibronectin, and, mRNA and protein levels of collagen IIIa, the main targets of β-catenin. In both control and T1DM rats, Salidroside significantly lowered fasting glucose levels and reduced renal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) p-and GS3Kβ (Ser9) but significantly increased levels of SOD and GSH. In conclusion, Salidroside protected the kidney of rats against T1DM-induced injury and fibrosis by activating GS3Kβ-induced inhibition of Wnt1/Wnt3a β-catenin.

The results showed that WPM supplementation significantly reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) and serum lipid levels in T2DM mice induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) combined with streptozotocin (STZ), with improved glucose tolerance, liver and kidney injury, and insulin resistance. In addition, WPM significantly inhibited the expression of gluconeogenesis-related genes <i>G6pase</i>, <i>Pepck</i>, <i>Foxo1</i>, and <i>Pgc</i><i>-1α</i>. Further study by miRNA high-throughput sequencing revealed that WPM supplementation mainly altered the liver miRNA expression profile of T2DM mice by increasing the expression of miR-144-3p_R-1 and miR-423-5p, reducing the expression of miR-22-5p_R-1 and miR-30a-3p. GO and KEGG analyses showed that the target genes of these miRNAs were mainly enriched in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. WPM supplementation significantly increased the level of PI3K, p-AKT, and GSK3β in the liver of T2DM mice. Taken together, WPM exerts antidiabetic effects by improving the miRNA profile and activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to inhibit gluconeogenesis. This study implies that PM can act as a dietary supplement to attenuate T2DM.",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2023-Jun,"Deng X, Liang J, Wang L, Niu L, Xiao J, Guo Q, Liu X, Xiao C",8,1345,diabetes,2025-11-22
31679079,Platelet aggregation is not altered among men with diabetes mellitus.,"Platelets are pivotal in arterial thrombosis, and platelet hyperresponsiveness may contribute to the increased incidence of cardiovascular events in diabetes mellitus. Consequently, we hypothesized that increased in vitro platelet aggregation responses exist in men with diabetes mellitus. The Danish Cardiovascular Screening Trial (DANCAVAS) is a community-based cardiovascular screening trial including men aged 65-74 years. Platelet aggregation was tested using 96-well light transmission aggregometry with thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP), adenosine diphosphate, collagen type 1, arachidonic acid and protease-activated receptor-4 in three concentrations. Further, cardiovascular risk factors and coronary artery calcification (CAC), estimated by CT scans and ankle-brachial index, were obtained. Included were 720 men aged 65-74 years, 110 with diabetes mellitus. Overall, there was no difference in platelet aggregation among men with versus without diabetes mellitus when adjusting for or excluding platelet inhibitor treatment and men with established cardiovascular disease (CVD). This was true for all agonists, e.g., 10 µM TRAP-induced platelet aggregation of median 69% (IQR 53-75) versus 70% (IQR 60-76) in men with versus without diabetes mellitus. Platelet aggregation did not correlate with HbA<sub>1c</sub> or CAC. Men with diabetes mellitus displayed higher CAC, median 257 Agatston units (IQR 74-1141) versus median 111 Agatston units (IQR 6-420) in the remaining individuals, p < 0.0001.

Specifically, the count of nonfertile spermatozoa (immotile and jerking cells) increased, while fertile fraction (progressively motile and low motile cells) decreased. These shifts were responsible for lower index of spermatozoon motility (proportion of fertile to infertile sums of spermatozoa) in the progeny of females with experimental type 1 diabetes mellitus.

33460395,DIAGNOSIS OF ENDOCRINE DISEASE: Diagnosing and classifying diabetes in diseases of the exocrine pancreas.,"Diabetes in the setting of diseases of the exocrine pancreas has long existed as a known, but underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, disorder. It currently finds itself in a state of taxonomic dereliction and requires a long overdue refurbishment. Correct conceptualisation is a key precondition for knowledge development in this disorder. This article lays out the epistemological foundation for diabetes of the exocrine pancreas (DEP) and presents a synthesis of the current interdisciplinary discourse on diagnosing and classifying DEP. A diagnosis of DEP in people with no medical records of pre-existing diabetes is generally based on the most up-to-date biochemical criteria endorsed by the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes. The presence of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction is not considered a mandatory diagnostic criterion for DEP but is rather a significant risk factor for developing DEP. DEP principally comprises post-pancreatitis diabetes mellitus, pancreatic cancer-related diabetes, and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, which are mutually exclusive with autoimmune diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Other exclusions and stipulations apply. The DEP criteria will be instrumental in aiding optimal design and conduct of clinical studies, uniform collection of health utilisation data, meaningful comparison of scientific findings across countries, and clear communication among stakeholders (healthcare providers, patients, medical regulatory authorities, pharmaceutical industry).",European journal of endocrinology,2021-Apr,"Petrov MS, Basina M",2,1531,diabetes,2025-11-22

Specific correlations between the risk of DM in pregnancy, asthma and the consequences of these diseases to the mother and her baby are also explored. The discussion concerning, on the one hand, the impact of asthma-related inflammatory condition on the metabolism of carbohydrates, and, on the other, the presence of chronic hyperglycemia and inflammatory markers observed in patients with asthma, is still ongoing. In the case of asthma and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), a correlation with the dysfunction of the immune system and the genetic background has been suggested, and in the case of type 2 (T2DM), the vital role of obesity and insulin resistance (IR) to promote excessive proinflammatory immune response. The data indicate that both asthma and DM affect mutually their clinical presentations, including the prognostic values and therapeutic possibilities. The ongoing controversy concerning the effective and safe anti-asthma and hypoglycemizing therapy does not allow for a definitive therapeutic consensus in this group of patients, despite the suggested role of metformin and hyperglycemizing effects of glucocorticoids.

36646201,Carbon nanomaterials: A growing tool for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus is a growing disease that affects people of different ages due to deficiencies in insulin action and secretion. Diabetes causing long-term hyperglycemia damages, destroys, and fails essential organs, including kidneys, eyes, hearts, nerves, and blood vessels. The involvement of pathogenic factors makes diabetes mellitus a severe disease. The autoimmune process results in insulin deficiency by destroying the beta-cells in the pancreas. This leads to insulin resistance. As a result of defects and abnormalities in fat, carbohydrate, and protein synthesis, insulin does not work as it should on the target tissues. As diabetes mellitus becomes, more severe, long-term and effective treatment becomes necessary. A wide range of nanomaterials can be used to treat diabetes mellitus in patients. In addition to being potential imaging, diagnostic, and treatment agents for diabetes mellitus, carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) are another group of nanoparticles that exhibit potential interest. The CNMs acts as implantable nanosensor to track and detect blood glucose level in patients with diabetes. CNMS are possible drug carriers that can treat diabetes mellitus selectively, precisely, and effectively. Diabetes mellitus can be diagnosed and treated with CNMs due to their structural specificity and high drug-loading efficiency. The present review explores CNMs for their types, synthesis, and anti-diabetic properties.

In particular, revealing the early symptoms of the disorders, the pathology lurking behind the complications and their optimal management. In diabetes mellitus, MSK complications are common and are largely due to similar pathogenetic factors responsible for the internal organ complications associated with diabetes leading to chronic low-intensity inflammatory processes. MSK disorders develop by vasculopathy, neuropathy, arthropathy or combinations of the above, which are not specific to diabetes. However, their prevalence is significantly increased in diabetes and contributes to the disability impairing patients' quality of life. Locomotor disease affects approximately 34.4-83.5 % of patients suffering from type-2 diabetes mellitus. Several musculoskeletal abnormalities (cheiroarthropathy, Dupuytren's contracture, trigger finger, ect.) can be diagnosed upon physical examination, although certain symptoms (frozen shoulder, neurogenic arthropathy, septic arthritis, etc.) require differential diagnostic considerations.

34214583,Sirtuin 1 as the mechanism of action of agents used in the diabetes mellitus pharmacotherapy.,"SIRT1 (sirtuin 1, a member of histone deacetylase III family) is responsible for deacetylation of lysine in histones and the conservation of DNA in the state of transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin. SIRT1 is also capable of deacetylation of transcription factors, as well as other regulatory proteins. The SIRT1 activity plays a unique role in the prevention of metabolic memory, reducing many pathways leading to chronic diabetic complications or diseases concomitant with diabetes. Factors modifying expression and/or activity of SIRT1 may be especially helpful for patients with diabetes. This article attempts to sum up the current state of knowledge about agents commonly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes which might have an impact on the SIRT1 expression and activity. It is the review of several studies regarding drug-induced pleiotropic activity and the way in which their interference with cellular pathways gives us better understanding of this activity, as well as the influence of therapy on the course of the disease.",European journal of pharmacology,2021-Sep,"Stelmaszyk A, Mikołajczak P, Dworacka M",3,1045,diabetes,2025-11-22
38955861,Immune checkpoint inhibitors-induced diabetes mellitus (review).,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become extensively utilized in the early-stage treatment of various cancers, offering additional therapeutic possibilities for patients with advanced cancer. However, certain patient populations are susceptible to experiencing toxic adverse effects from ICIs, such as thyrotoxicosis, rashes, among others. Specifically, ICIDM, induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors, exhibits characteristics similar to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, T1DM). ICIDM is characterized by a rapid onset and may coincide with severe ketoacidosis. Despite a favorable response to insulin therapy, patients typically require lifelong insulin dependence. After discussing the autoimmune adverse effects and the specifics of ICIs-induced diabetes mellitus (ICIDM), it is important to note that certain patient populations are particularly susceptible to experiencing toxic adverse effects from ICIs. Specifically, ICIDM, which is triggered by immune checkpoint inhibitors, mirrors the characteristics of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, T1DM). This article conducts an in-depth analysis of the literature to explore the pathogenesis, disease progression, and treatment strategies applicable to diabetes induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIDM).",Endocrine,2024-Nov,"Chen J, Hou X, Yang Y, Wang C, Zhou J, Miao J, Gong F, Ge F, Chen W",9,1328,diabetes,2025-11-22

Recently, it has become common in children, adolescents and adults. Aim of the work - to highlight the challenges in differentiating T1DM (type1 diabetes mellitus) from T2DM (type2 diabetes mellitus) in early onset diabetes in youth depending on clinical and laboratory characteristics. Our cross-sectional study was performed on 200 newly diagnosed diabetic patients aged (18-30) years. All patients were subjected to detailed medical history and full clinical examination. Laboratory investigations included FBS, 2hPP, HbA1C, fasting C peptide and GADA. About 59% (118) of our patients were T2DM while (82) 41% were T1DM. T1DM was more dominant than T2DM in age group less than 25 years (T1DM 79% versus T2DM 21%, P<0.001), while T2DM was more than T1DM in age group more than 25 years (T2DM 93% versus T1DM 17%, P<0.001). GADA was detected in 73.2% of T1DM patient and it was high titer while GADA was detected in only 8% of T2DM with low titer, in addition GADA positive patients were significantly younger than negative patients, age (20.9±2.5 years vs. 26.4±3.5 years respectively) (P <0.001). About 8% of phenotypically type 2 diabetic youth had GADA positive antibodies which did not confer impact on c peptide level or glycemic control yet type 1 diabetics who were GADA negative had a better glycemic control.",Georgian medical news,2022-Dec,"Halawa M, Elhefnawy M, Eid Y, Elhalawany S, Hegab A, Hendawy L",6,1403,diabetes,2025-11-22
33968046,A Novel Resolution of Diabetes: C-C Chemokine Motif Ligand 4 Is a Common Target in Different Types of Diabetes by Protecting Pancreatic Islet Cell and Modulating Inflammation.,"Systemic inflammation is related to hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus (DM). C-C chemokine motif ligand (CCL) 4 is upregulated in type 1 & type 2 DM patients. This study aimed to investigate if CCL4 could be a potential target to improve blood sugar control in different experimental DM models. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, <i>Lepr<sup>db</sup></i> /JNarl diabetic mice, and C57BL/6 mice fed a high fat diet were used as the type 1 DM, type 2 DM, and metabolic syndrome model individually. Mice were randomly assigned to receive an anti-CCL4 neutralizing monoclonal antibody. The pancreatic β-cells were treated with streptozotocin for <i>in vitro</i> experiments. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, inhibition of CCL4 controlled blood sugar, increased serum insulin levels, increased islet cell proliferation and decreased pancreatic interleukin (IL)-6 expression. In the type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome models, CCL4 inhibition retarded the progression of hyperglycemia, reduced serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6 levels, and improved insulin resistance <i>via</i> reducing the phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 in skeletal muscle and liver tissues. CCL4 inhibition directly protected pancreatic β-cells from streptozotocin stimulation. Furthermore, CCL4-induced IL-6 and TNF-α expressions could be abolished by siRNA of CCR2/CCR5. In summary, direct inhibition of CCL4 protected pancreatic islet cells, improved insulin resistance and retarded the progression of hyperglycemia in different experimental models, suggesting the critical role of CCL4-related inflammation in the progression of DM. Future experiments may investigate if CCL4 could be a potential target for blood sugar control in clinical DM.",Frontiers in immunology,2021-,"Chang TT, Lin LY, Chen JW",3,1753,diabetes,2025-11-22
33394623,Barriers and facilitators to type 2 diabetes management in the Caribbean region: a qualitative systematic review.,"The objective of this systematic review was to summarize the barriers and facilitators to type 2 diabetes mellitus management in the Caribbean region. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Caribbean is of significant concern. Poor management of type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the risks of complications and death. Several studies have been conducted to explore the barriers and facilitators to type 2 diabetes mellitus management in the Caribbean; however, a systematic review has yet to be conducted. Eligible participants were adults (aged 18 and above) with type 2 diabetes mellitus, their families/carers, and health care professionals whose work involves the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Caribbean. The review included studies that focused on their views, experiences, attitudes, understandings, perceptions, and perspectives regarding the barriers and facilitators to type 2 diabetes mellitus management. Electronic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL/BNI (EBSCOhost), PsycINFO, AMED, Web of Science, and Scopus were conducted from database inception to March 2020. Additionally, gray literature was searched via EThOS, OpenGrey, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. JBI methodology for conducting qualitative systematic reviews was followed. Screening of studies, assessment of methodological quality, and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. Findings from studies were synthesized using a meta-aggregation approach, and confidence in the findings was ranked using the ConQual approach. Eight studies were included in the review, all of which focused on patients' perspectives. There were five synthesized findings, including i) cultural demands and pressures impact self-management and general care of type 2 diabetes mellitus (low confidence evidence); ii) support systems' influence on the general management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (moderate confidence evidence); iii) personal and environmental background/circumstances can encourage and limit good self-management and general management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (high confidence evidence); iv) psychological factors that influence patients' actions towards the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (moderate confidence evidence); and v) psychological factors and their influence on patients' adherence to type 2 diabetes mellitus management (low confidence evidence). Patients in the Caribbean have multiple barriers and facilitators that limit and promote effective management of their type 2 diabetes mellitus. Identifying the barriers and facilitators to type 2 diabetes mellitus management in the Caribbean will assist with development of effective type 2 diabetes mellitus management programs. However, further qualitative studies on barriers and facilitators to type 2 diabetes mellitus management in the Caribbean that target health care professionals and families/carers should be conducted.

Streptozotocin/nicotinamide induced diabetic rats were enrolled as an animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Animals were divided into control, diabetic, and Gln (1000 mg/l in drinking water, eight weeks) treated diabetic groups. Gln alleviated renal inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers (tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 6, glutathione peroxidase, total superoxide dismutase, and glutathione), decreased serum uric acid and creatinine, and restored renal histopathological changes (glomerular volume, sclerosis, and leukocyte infiltration). Additionally, Gln ameliorated other complications, including systemic oxidative stress (serum malondialdehyde and nitric oxide, serum and liver glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and total superoxide dismutase, and liver catalase), insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, and hyperlipidaemia. Collectively, Gln attenuates diabetic nephropathy and other complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus in rats through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.",Archives of physiology and biochemistry,2023-Apr,"Nasri M, Adibhesami G, Mahdavifard S, Babaeenezhad E, Ahmadvand H",5,1172,diabetes,2025-11-22

However, its key components and metabolites have low bioavailability and poor host absorption. To clarify the anti-diabetic mechanism of A. asphodeloides extract (AAE), we examined the anti-diabetic effects of AAE in rats with diabetes induced by a high-fat diet and streptozotocin. Faeces levels of the main components and metabolites of AAE were significantly higher than levels in plasma, which indicated that gut microbiota might play important roles in its anti-diabetic effect. Microbiological studies showed that unabsorbed components increased the diversity of the gut microbiota, enriched potentially beneficial bacteria, and suppressed potentially harmful bacteria. In vitro studies showed that AAE promoted the proliferation of Blautia coccoides, a bacterium with positive implication for diabetes, in a dose-dependent manner. AAE also promoted pancreatic cell regeneration and restored the function of pancreatic islet cells via peroxiredoxin 4 overexpression. Overall, these results suggest that AAE alleviates diabetes via modulating gut microbiota and protein expression.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2021-Jan,"Yan D, Fan P, Sun W, Ding Q, Zheng W, Xiao W, Zhang B, Zhang T, Zhang T, Shi J, Chen X, Chen P, Zhang J, Hao Y, Sun X, Pang X, Dong Y, Xu P, Yu L, Ma B",20,1211,diabetes,2025-11-22
32931602,The effects of high-fat diet and metformin on urinary metabolites in diabetes and prediabetes rat models.,"High-fat diet (HFD) interferes with the dietary plan of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, many diabetes patients consume food with higher fat content for a better taste bud experience. In this study, we examined the effect of HFD on rats at the early onset of diabetes and prediabetes by supplementing their feed with palm olein oil to provide a fat content representing 39% of total calorie intake. Urinary profile generated from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was used to construct the orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) score plots. The data provide insights into the physiological state of an organism. Healthy rats fed with normal chow (NC) and HFD cannot be distinguished by their urinary metabolite profiles, whereas diabetic and prediabetic rats showed a clear separation in OPLS-DA profile between the two diets, indicating a change in their physiological state. Metformin treatment altered the metabolomics profiles of diabetic rats and lowered their blood sugar levels. For prediabetic rats, metformin treatment on both NC- and HFD-fed rats not only reduced their blood sugar levels to normal but also altered the urinary metabolite profile to be more like healthy rats. The use of metformin is therefore beneficial at the prediabetes stage.",Biotechnology and applied biochemistry,2021-Oct,"Lee YF, Sim XY, Teh YH, Ismail MN, Greimel P, Murugaiyah V, Ibrahim B, Gam LH",8,1322,diabetes,2025-11-22

The main aims of this review are to describe the relationship between obesity, appetite, weight management, hormonal mechanisms of diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism post-bariatric surgery. An in-depth literature search was conducted to identify scientific studies, which analyzed the correlation between diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism post-bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery decreases hypothyroidism, reduces the need for pharmacological action (such as levothyroxine), controls the weight and body fat and increases the sensitivity to leptin and insulin. The reduction of the stomach and intestine by bariatric surgery is an evolutionary and beneficial action, because it may lead to a drastic decrease on numbers of conditions such as diabetes, obesity, hypothyroidism, and others. Thus, new studies should also focus on patients' post-operatory conditions, such as lifetime, regulation and functioning of organs after reduced nutrition, and consumption and delivery of nutrients to health maintenance.",Current diabetes reviews,2020-,"Goes LG, da Luz Eltchechem C, Wouk J, Malfatti CRM, da Silva LA",5,1206,diabetes,2025-11-22

This was a retrospective cohort study of women with diabetes mellitus referred to University of Naples Federico II from January 2018 to January 2020 for antenatal monitoring. Only women who underwent antenatal monitoring with C-CTG were included in the study. For the purpose of this study only the C-CTG recorded at the time of outpatient admission were analyzed. Women were divided into four groups: 1) women with diabetes mellitus type 1; 2) women with diabetes mellitus type 2; 3) women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM); 4) control group without diabetes mellitus. The primary outcome of the study was the C-CTG short term variability (STV).

33760134,Islet transplantation ameliorates diabetes-induced testicular interstitial fibrosis and is associated with inhibition of TGF-β1/Smad2 pathway in a rat model of type 1 diabetes.,"Islet transplantation (IT) is considered the most effective endocrine replacement therapy for diabetes mellitus (DM). Studies have demonstrated that IT can repair testicular structural injury caused by inflammatory and oxidative stress in a diabetic rat model. However, highly effective exogenous antioxidant and anti-inflammatory drugs can achieve this effect. Testicular interstitial fibrosis caused by long-term hyperglycemia is however difficult to reverse or recover. Thus far, there are no effective drugs that prevent or relieve testicular interstitial fibrosis. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the potential benefit of IT on testicular interstitial fibrosis induced by DM and its underlying molecular mechanisms. In the present study, Wistar rats were used to establish a DM model by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. The diabetic models then underwent IT or received insulin treatment after 12 weeks. IT was more effective than insulin treatment in ameliorating diabetic-induced testicular interstitial fibrosis, Leydig cells apoptosis, testosterone deficiency and poor sperm motility. IT and insulin treatment both significantly inhibited the upregulation of TGF-β1 and phosphorylated Smad2 in DM, with IT being more effective than insulin. The present study's findings proved that IT effectively protects diabetic-induced testicular interstitial fibrosis probably by inhibiting the TGF-β1/Smad2 signaling pathway, which offers hope in male patients with DM complicating with testicular interstitial fibrosis.",Molecular medicine reports,2021-May,"Zheng YC, Feng YL, Wang YH, Kong LJ, Zhou MS, Wu MM, Liu CY, Weng HC, Wang HW",9,1536,diabetes,2025-11-22
34753800,Downregulation of Erythrocyte miR-210 Induces Endothelial Dysfunction in Type 2 Diabetes.,"Red blood cells (RBC) act as mediators of vascular injury in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). miR-210 plays a protective role in cardiovascular homeostasis and is decreased in whole blood of T2DM mice. We hypothesized that downregulation of RBC miR-210 induces endothelial dysfunction in T2DM. RBC were coincubated with arteries and endothelial cells ex vivo and transfused in vivo to identify the role of miR-210 and its target protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) in endothelial dysfunction. RBC from patients with T2DM and diabetic rodents induced endothelial dysfunction ex vivo and in vivo. miR-210 levels were lower in human RBC from patients with T2DM (T2DM RBC) than in RBC from healthy subjects. Transfection of miR-210 in human T2DM RBC rescued endothelial function, whereas miR-210 inhibition in healthy subjects RBC or RBC from miR-210 knockout mice impaired endothelial function. Human T2DM RBC decreased miR-210 expression in endothelial cells. miR-210 expression in carotid artery plaques was lower in T2DM patients than in patients without diabetes. Endothelial dysfunction induced by downregulated RBC miR-210 involved PTP1B and reactive oxygen species. miR-210 mimic attenuated endothelial dysfunction induced by RBC via downregulating vascular PTP1B and oxidative stress in diabetic mice in vivo.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted by distributing online questionnaires to 2430 adult members (> 18 years) of two user panels consisting of people with diabetes who have volunteered to share information about their life with diabetes. The questionnaire included items on COVID-19-specific worries as well as such worries related to diabetes, sociodemographic and health status, social relations, diabetes-specific social support, diabetes distress and changes in diabetes-specific behaviours. Responses were analysed with descriptive statistics and logistic regressions. People with diabetes have COVID-19-specific worries related to their diabetes. More than half were worried about being overly affected due to diabetes if infected with COVID-19, about one-third about being characterized as a risk group due to diabetes and not being able to manage diabetes if infected. Logistic regressions showed that being female, having type 1 diabetes, diabetes complications and diabetes distress, feeling isolated and lonely, and having changed diabetes behaviours were associated with being more worried about COVID-19 and diabetes.

39374079,Diabetes induces modifications in costameric proteins and increases cardiomyocyte stiffness.,"Several studies have demonstrated that diabetes mellitus can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and remains the principal cause of death in these patients. Costameres connect the sarcolemma with the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, facilitating the transmission of mechanical forces and cell signaling. They are related to cardiac physiology because individual cardiac cells are connected by intercalated discs that synchronize muscle contraction. Diabetes impacts the nanomechanical properties of cardiomyocytes, resulting in increased cellular and left ventricular stiffness, as evidenced in clinical studies of these patients. The question of whether costameric proteins are affected by diabetes in the heart has not been studied. This work analyzes whether type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) modifies the costameric proteins and coincidentally changes the cellular mechanics in the same cardiomyocytes. The samples were analyzed by immunotechniques using laser confocal microscopy. Significant statistical differences were found in the spatial arrangement of the costameric proteins. However, these differences are not due to their expression. Atomic force microscopy was used to compare intrinsic cellular stiffness between diabetic and normal cardiomyocytes and obtain the first elasticity map sections of diabetic living cardiomyocytes. Data obtained demonstrated that diabetic cardiomyocytes had higher stiffness than control. The present work shows experimental evidence that intracellular changes related to cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix communication occur, which could be related to cardiac pathogenic mechanisms. These changes could contribute to alterations in the mechanical and electrical properties of cardiomyocytes and, consequently, to diabetic cardiomyopathy.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> The structural organization of cardiomyocyte proteins is critical for their efficient functioning as a contractile unit in the heart. This work shows that diabetes mellitus induces significant changes in the spatial organization of costamere proteins, <i>t</i> tubules, and intercalated discs.

A nationwide population-based study from of the ARNO Diabetes Observatory.,"To investigate diabetes treatment initiation and continuation in the next sixth months in newly diagnosed Italian subjects. We analyzed administrative claims of 11,300,750 Italian residents. Subjects with incident diabetes were identified by glucose lowering drug prescriptions, disease-specific co-payment exemptions and hospital discharge codes occurring in 2018 but not in 2017. Incident cases were 65,932 of whom 91.4% received the prescription of a glucose lowering drug. Among the latter, those receiving a prescription of a noninsulin medication but no insulin were 84.8%, those receiving a prescription of insulin only were 9.4%, and those receiving prescriptions of both insulin and noninsulin drugs were 5.8%. Metformin was the most frequently drug initially prescribed in noninsulin treated subjects (~85%) and sulphonylurea receptor (SUR) agonists collectively ranked as second (~13%). Lispro (35%) and glargine (34%) were the most frequently prescribed molecules in subjects who were insulin treated. Differences in prescriptions were found in age categories, with increased use of SUR agonists across decades. In the first six months, as many as 50% of noninsulin treated patients continued with the initial drug, ~15% added a second agent, ~5% switched to another medication, and ~30% discontinued any glucose lowering treatment. These data document that current guidelines are often neglected because prescriptions of SUR agonists as first agent are still quite common and insulin is prescribed more than expected.

Standardized Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (R-UCLA) and an analysis of patient test results including 10 indicators of blood glucose control were used for data collection. Correlation analysis, i.e. Pearson's linear correlation coefficient (r, parametric method), was used for hypothesis verification. Less than one-fifth (16%) of the patients included in the study had higher loneliness index (based on the R-UCLA scale), and this loneliness index (total result) was significantly correlated with higher blood pressure. No significant correlations were demonstrated between loneliness and the other 9 indicators of blood glucose control. Systolic blood pressure was significantly correlated with loneliness in patients with diabetes.

32634859,Histological validation of a type 1 diabetes clinical diagnostic model for classification of diabetes.,"Misclassification of diabetes is common due to an overlap in the clinical features of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Combined diagnostic models incorporating clinical and biomarker information have recently been developed that can aid classification, but they have not been validated using pancreatic pathology. We evaluated a clinical diagnostic model against histologically defined type 1 diabetes. We classified cases from the Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) biobank as type 1 (n = 111) or non-type 1 (n = 42) diabetes using histopathology. Type 1 diabetes was defined by lobular loss of insulin-containing islets along with multiple insulin-deficient islets. We assessed the discriminative performance of previously described type 1 diabetes diagnostic models, based on clinical features (age at diagnosis, BMI) and biomarker data [autoantibodies, type 1 diabetes genetic risk score (T1D-GRS)], and singular features for identifying type 1 diabetes by the area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic (AUC-ROC). Diagnostic models validated well against histologically defined type 1 diabetes. The model combining clinical features, islet autoantibodies and T1D-GRS was strongly discriminative of type 1 diabetes, and performed better than clinical features alone (AUC-ROC 0.97 vs. 0.95; P = 0.03). Histological classification of type 1 diabetes was concordant with serum C-peptide [median < 17 pmol/l (limit of detection) vs. 1037 pmol/l in non-type 1 diabetes; P < 0.0001]. Our study provides robust histological evidence that a clinical diagnostic model, combining clinical features and biomarkers, could improve diabetes classification. Our study also provides reassurance that a C-peptide-based definition of type 1 diabetes is an appropriate surrogate outcome that can be used in large clinical studies where histological definition is impossible.

We provide a summary of the pathophysiological basis for the legacy effect and discuss some translational research. Results from trials of early diabetes and observational cohort studies suggest that a long-term effect of early glycaemic control exists; however, long-term follow-up from trials in participants with established diabetes is not supportive. Additionally, findings for the legacy effect are more conclusive for microvascular complications than macrovascular events. Overall, these results suggest that the glycaemic legacy effect is a long-term benefit (or risk) conferred to individuals in the early stages of diabetes and which is muted over time as individuals' vasculature changes and they develop complications from diabetes.",Diabetologia,2021-Oct,"Folz R, Laiteerapong N",2,928,diabetes,2025-11-22
35928354,The role of renal damage markers in the diagnosis of early stages of kidney injury in patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults.,"Serum creatinine level begins to increase after a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by 50% and more, so the question emerged about a more accurate method of determining GFR. The study aimed to determine the role of renal damage markers in the diagnosis of early-stage renal disease in patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA). We included 84 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) caused by diabetic kidney disease (DKD), as well as 25 representatives of the control group. Patients were divided into three groups - 43 people with LADA, 21 with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and 20 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). GFR was assessed using six formulas after establishing the category of GFR and albuminuria. The GFR rate estimated by the CKD-EPI formula in patients with LADA and DKD did not significantly differ from that of CKD-EPI cysC, slightly different from MDRD GFR (10.6% higher, respectively) but 21.9% lower compared to CG formula. In patients with LADA and T1DM, GFR was higher in cases with existing albuminuria, regardless of the formulas used. Thus, the non albuminuria phenotype is accompanied by a greater degree of renal impairment, which indicates the need to determine serum cystatin C in the early stages of LADA. Cystatin C levels are the most accurate, early, and independent predictor of the development and progression of CKD in patients with DM, including LADA.",Journal of medicine and life,2022-Jun,"Tsaryk I, Pashkovska N",2,1461,diabetes,2025-11-22

36326552,Induction of Type I Diabetes Mellitus in Beagle Dogs Using Alloxan and Streptozotocin.,"This article describes a protocol for chemically inducing type I diabetes mellitus in beagle dogs using a mixture of alloxan (ALX) and streptozotocin (STZ). ALX and STZ are both cytotoxic, diabetogenic agents that cause necrosis of pancreatic β-cells and therefore halt the production of insulin. Although both compounds are widely used in experimental animal models of diabetes, standard protocols employing a single high dose of either agent are also implicated in adjacent organ damage. In contrast, combined administration of ALX and STZ allows for the use of lower doses, a method that effectively destroys β-cells and circumvents unwanted adverse effects. The procedures described in this protocol produce persistent, insulin-dependent hyperglycemia in beagle dogs using combined doses of ALX and STZ lower than those previously described for a single intravenous administration. This model can be used to test experimental compounds indicated for the treatment of diabetes. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

31546272,Clinical Impact of the TCF7L2 Gene rs7903146 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Risk Polymorphism in Women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: Impaired Glycemic Control and Increased Need of Insulin Therapy.,"The single nucleotide polymorphism in <i>TCF7L2</i> rs7903146 is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes mellitus. Mechanisms by which this mutation acts, and its impact on the clinical course of the diseases remain unclear. Here we investigated the clinical impact of the T risk allele in women with gestational diabetes mellitus. We genotyped the C/T polymorphism in 164 Caucasian women with GDM (German n=114; Greek n=50). The impact of the T allele on the results of the 75g oral-glucose-tolerance-test, and on the required therapy (diet/lifestyle or insulin) was investigated. During oral-glucose-tolerance-test, women harboring the T allele displayed significantly higher glucose values at 60 min (p=0.034) and were more likely to require insulin therapy even after adjusting for confounders, such as BMI and age. These results provide evidence that the T risk allele in <i>TCF7L2</i> rs7903146 is associated with failure in early postprandial glycemic control and requirement of insulin therapy in women with gestational diabetes mellitus, even after adjusting for confounding factors such BMI and age.","Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association",2020-Oct,"Potasso L, Perakakis N, Lamprinou A, Polyzou E, Kassanos D, Peter A, Päth G, Seufert J, Laubner K",9,1156,diabetes,2025-11-22
32022993,Risk and population attributable fraction of metabolic syndrome and impaired fasting glucose for the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus among middle-aged Japanese individuals: Aichi Worker's Cohort Study.,"The Japanese government started a nationwide screening program for metabolic syndrome (MetS) to prevent cardiovascular diseases and diabetes in 2008. Although impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is a strong predictor for type 2 diabetes mellitus, the program does not follow up IFG in non-MetS individuals. This study aimed to examine the risk and the population attributable fraction (PAF) of MetS and IFG for incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Japanese workers (3,417 men and 714 women) aged 40-64 years without a history of diabetes were prospectively followed. MetS was defined as either abdominal obesity plus two or more metabolic risk factors, or being overweight in the case of normal waist circumference plus three or more metabolic risk factors. IFG was defined as fasting blood glucose 100-125 mg/dL. During a mean 6.3 years, 240 type 2 diabetes mellitus cases were identified. Compared with those without MetS and IFG, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of non-MetS individuals with IFG, MetS individuals without IFG and MetS individuals with IFG for type 2 diabetes mellitus were 4.9 (3.4-7.1), 2.4 (1.6-3.5) and 8.3 (5.9-11.5), respectively. The corresponding PAFs for type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence were 15.6, 9.1 and 29.7%, respectively. IFG represented a higher risk and PAF than MetS for type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence in middle-aged Japanese individuals. The coexistence of MetS and IFG showed the highest risk and PAF for type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence.

33394721,Use of cardiovascular imaging in risk restratification of the diabetic patient.,"Diabetes mellitus is no longer considered a cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk equivalent, but the optimal methods of risk stratification are a matter of debate. The coronary calcium score (CCS) is a measure of the burden of atherosclerosis and is widely used for CVD risk stratification in the general population. We review recently published data to describe the role of the CCS in people with diabetes mellitus. People with diabetes mellitus have 10-year event rates for CVD and CVD mortality that are considered high, at a much lower level of CCS than the general population. Different categories of CCS are pertinent to men and women with diabetes mellitus. CCS may be particularly useful in clinical settings when CVD risk is known to be increased but difficult to quantify, for example peri-menopausal women, young persons with diabetes, type 1 diabetic individuals and others. With modern techniques, the radiation dose of a CSS has fallen to levels wherein screening and surveillance could be considered. The CCS is able to quantify CVD risk in people with diabetes mellitus when there is clinical uncertainty and identifies those with very high event rates. Future research should aim to identify effective risk reduction strategies in this important group.","Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",2021-Apr,"Bellinge JW, Lee SC, Schultz CJ",3,1266,diabetes,2025-11-22

Despite the advances in the current therapeutic methods, further development of anti-diabetic therapies is necessary. Mitochondrial dysfunction is known to be implicated in diabetes development. Moreover, specific types of mitochondrial diabetes have been discovered, such as MIDD (maternally inherited diabetes and deafness) and DAD (diabetes and Deafness). Hereditary mitochondrial disorders are caused by certain mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which encodes for a substantial part of mitochondrial proteins and mitochondrial tRNA necessary for mitochondrial protein synthesis. Study of mtDNA mutations is challenging because the pathogenic phenotype associated with such mutations depends on the level of its heteroplasmy (proportion of mtDNA copies carrying the mutation) and can be tissue-specific. Nevertheless, modern sequencing methods have allowed describing and characterizing a number of mtDNA mutations associated with human disorders, and the list is constantly growing.

37037264,The role of weight control in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus: Bariatric surgery.,"Diabetes mellitus is one of the major epidemics in the United States. It is heavily associated with obesity and multiple metabolic derangements that lead to long term morbidity, mortality as well as financial burden. Although medical therapy has been the mainstay in the management of diabetes mellitus, there remains a large portion of this patient population which struggles to obtain adequate glycemic control and long-term weight control with medical management alone. Bariatric surgery is a powerful tool in combating diabetes mellitus and affects glucose homeostasis through a variety of pathways. While it does provide a durable pathway for weight loss, improvement in glucose homeostasis is not only affected by the weight loss seen after bariatric surgery. Changes in gut hormone secretion, insulin regulation, and gut microbial composition also affect how these operations improve glucose homeostasis. Through improvement in the management of diabetes mellitus, comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, in turn demonstrate improvement.

Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to further evaluate the causal association between fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), T1DM, T2DM and vitiligo. We used aggregated genome-wide association data from the Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) online database of European adults vitiligo; HbA1c data were from IEU. Fasting blood glucose data were obtained from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). T1DM and T2DM data were from FinnGen. We used bidirectional two-sample and multivariate MR analyses to test whether dysglycemic measures (fasting blood glucose, HbA1c), diabetes-related measures (T1DM, T2DM) are causatively associated with vitiligo. Inverse variance weighting (IVW) method was used as the main test method, MR-Egger, Weighted mode and Weighted median were used as supplementary methods. We found no statistically significant evidence to support a causal association between dysglycemic traits and vitiligo, but in the correlation analysis of diabetic traits, our data supported a positive causal association between T1DM and vitiligo (p = 0.018). In the follow-up multivariate MR analysis, our results still supported this conclusion (p = 0.016), and suggested that HbA1c was not a mediator of T1DM affecting the pathogenesis of vitiligo. No reverse causality was found in any of the reverse MR Analyses of dysglycemic traits and diabetic traits. Our findings support that T1DM is a risk factor for the development of vitiligo, and this conclusion may explain why the co-presentation of T1DM and vitiligo is often seen in observational studies.

This review has been written with the objective of identifying the widely-marketed anti-diabetic drugs which can be efficiently repurposed for the treatment of other diseases or disorders. It is an updated, comprehensive review, describing the protective role of various classes of anti-diabetic drugs in mitigating the macro and micro vascular complications of diabetes mellitus, and differentiating these drugs on the basis of their mode of action. Notably, metformin, the anti-diabetic drug most commonly explored for cancer therapy, has also exhibited some antimicrobial effects. Unlike class specific effects, few instances of drug specific effects in managing cardiovascular complications have also been reported. A major drawback is that the pleiotropic effects of anti-diabetic drugs have been mostly investigated only in diabetic patients.

This retrospective study included 621 deliveries in 429 Japanese women with diabetes between 1982 and 2020. The association of the delivery date with clinical features was analyzed using the generalized estimating equations to adjust for the within-person correlation. The mean age of delivery and the mean diabetes duration increased over time (both P < 0.001), while the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy decreased (P = 0.006). The mean HbA1c values during pregnancy decreased significantly over time (all P < 0.001). The decreasing trends were associated with preterm delivery (P = 0.021) but not with other perinatal outcomes. The time trends were significantly different between patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and with type 2 diabetes mellitus in large for gestational age (LGA) and stillbirth (both P for interaction <0.05).

34784620,Shear Wave Elastography Reveals a High Prevalence of NAFLD-related Fibrosis even in Type 1 Diabetes.,"The association between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and advanced stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is well known. Some studies indicate a relevant prevalence also in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), but so far there is only limited data. To determine the prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-related liver fibrosis in individuals with T1DM and compare to those with type 2 diabetes. Diabetic patients from a single diabetes care centre were screened for liver fibrosis by sonographic shear wave elastography (SWE). In addition, all patients received laboratory evaluation including non-alcoholic fatty liver fibrosis score and Fibrosis-4 Index. Three hundred and forty patients were included in the study, of these, 310 received SWE. Overall 254 patients (93 with type 1 and 161 with type 2 diabetes) had reliable measurements and were included in the final analysis. In patients with type 1 diabetes, the prevalence of NAFLD-related liver fibrosis was 16-21%, depending on the method of detection. Significant liver fibrosis was observed in 30-46% of patients with type 2 diabetes. Our data revealed an unexpectedly high prevalence of NAFLD-related liver fibrosis in patients with type 1 diabetes. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies using SWE to diagnose advanced NAFLD in type 1 diabetes in a non-preselected cohort. Considering the findings of our study, regular screening for hepatic complications must be recommended for all diabetic patients, even for those with type 1 diabetes.","Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association",2022-Aug,"Meyer G, Dauth N, Grimm M, Herrmann E, Bojunga J, Friedrich-Rust M",6,1534,diabetes,2025-11-22

We compared the frequency and results of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing in adults with early-onset and usual-onset diabetes and assessed factors related to guideline concordance. Population-level databases from Alberta, Canada (∼4.5 million) were used to identify adults with incident diabetes. The cohort was stratified by age at diagnosis (< 40 vs. ≥ 40 years) and then followed for 365 days for HbA1c testing. Adjusted multivariable analyses were used to identify clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with guideline concordance. Among 23,643 adults with incident diabetes (mean age 54.1 ± 15.4 years; 42.1 % female), 18.9 % had early-onset diabetes. Early-onset diabetes was associated with lower frequency of testing (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 0.80; 95 % CI 0.70-0.90) and above target glycaemic levels compared to usual-onset diabetes (aOR, 1.45; 95 % CI 1.29-1.64). Factors associated with guideline concordant frequency of HbA1c testing were rural residence and insulin use. In our universal care setting with premium-free health care, early-onset diabetes was associated with lower rates of HbA1c testing and sub-optimal glycaemic control compared to those with usual-onset diabetes.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,2024-Jul,"Sriskandarajah A, Metcalfe A, Nerenberg KA, Butalia S",4,1369,diabetes,2025-11-22

Mast cells play a key role in health and survival mechanisms, especially as sentinel cells that can stimulate protective immune responses. On the other hand, it has been shown that mast cells are involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, and recently a possible pathogenetic role of mast cells in diabetes has been proposed. In this review we summarize the evidence on the increased presence of mast cells in the pancreas of subjects with type 1 diabetes, which is due to the autoimmune destruction of insulin secreting beta cells, and discuss the differences with type 2 diabetes, the other major form of diabetes. In addition, we describe some of the pathophysiological mechanisms through which mast cells might exert their actions, which could be targeted to potentially protect the beta cells in autoimmune diabetes.",Cells,2021-Jul,"Masini M, Suleiman M, Novelli M, Marselli L, Marchetti P, De Tata V",6,1006,diabetes,2025-11-22

We aimed to explore the functional mechanisms of miR-222 in the inflammatory response in GDM by mediating C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and NLRP3 inflammasomes. GDM models were established by intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin, and the levels of miR-222 and CXCR4 in GDM patients' placenta tissues as well as GDM mice' placenta and pancreatic tissues were determined. The GDM mice were treated with miR-222 Antagomir/Agomir or overexpressed CXCR4 to evaluate the apoptosis and pathological changes in tissues, and the levels of blood glucose, insulin, biochemical indices, inflammatory factors and inflammasome-related proteins. Importantly, the target relation between miR-222 and CXCR4 was verified. MiR-222 was increased while CXCR4 was decreased in GDM patients and mice. The down-regulated miR-222 and up-regulated CXCR4 could promote insulin sensitivity and insulin level, while inhibit apoptosis, inflammation and glucagon level in GDM mice. Moreover, CXCR4 was targeted by miR-222. We demonstrated that the silenced miR-222 could suppress inflammatory response in GDM mice by promoting CXCR4 and inactivating NLRP3 inflammasomes, which may contribute to GDM treatment.",Life sciences,2021-Feb,"Zhang H, Luan S, Xiao X, Lin L, Zhao X, Liu X",6,1340,diabetes,2025-11-22

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of pioglitazone on functional, structural, and biochemical properties of PVAT in an experimental model of type-2 diabetes (T2DM). T2DM was induced by high-fat-diet/low-dose-streptozotocin in rats, and pioglitazone (20 mg/kg/p.o.) was administered for 6 weeks. Changes in biochemical parameters, PVAT-mass, vascular-reactivity in thoracic-aorta, as well as PVAT adipocytokine and <i>PPARG</i>-expression levels, and histopathology were evaluated. Pioglitazone administration improved blood glucose and lipid profiles in T2DM. Pioglitazone did not change the anticontractile effect of PVAT on aortic contractile reactivity and besides, had no influence on endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation responses. Pioglitazone administration increased PVAT-mass and tumor necrotizing factor-α levels, while adiponectin, leptin, and interleukin-6 levels were unchanged. Also, a prominent increase was observed in <i>PPARG</i>-expression in T2DM-Pio group. Moreover, pioglitazone decreased liver steatosis, aortic wall thickening, and myocardial damage, whereas increased adipocyte size and adiposity in PVAT.

However, when working with these models, it is important to consider factors that could influence experimental outcome. This is particularly important given the wide variety of models available, each with specific characteristics that could be influenced by extrinsic or intrinsic factors. Blood glucose concentrations, a commonly used and valid endpoint in these models, are particularly susceptible to manipulation by these factors. These include potential effects of intrinsic factors such as strain, sex, and age and extrinsic factors such as husbandry practices and experimental protocols. These variables should therefore be taken into consideration when the model is chosen and the experiments are designed.

Periodontitis in diabetic patients can aggravate insulin resistance; however, its molecular and biological mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects of diabetic periodontitis on liver function and determine the mechanism by which artesunate improves liver function. Rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes were divided into five groups: normal control (NC), diabetic periodontitis (DM + PD), artesunate intervention (ART), insulin intervention (INS), and combined medication intervention (ART + INS) groups. Drug interventions were then administered to the rats in each group as follows: 50 mg/kg artesunate to the ART group, 6 U/kg insulin to the INS group, and 50 mg/kg artesunate + 6 U/kg insulin to the ART + INS group. Blood samples, liver tissues, and the maxillary alveolar bone were collected postsacrifice. ART was found to significantly ameliorate hyperglycemia, blood lipid concentrations, and liver function. The levels of inflammatory factors reduced; the effect was more pronounced in the ART + INS group. Artesunate presumably inhibits the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway and expression of downstream inflammatory factors, thereby exerting a protective effect on diabetes-related liver function.

Of the male sexual dysfunction resulting from diabetes mellitus, significant focus is afforded to erectile dysfunction. Nevertheless, ejaculatory dysfunction constitutes important sexual sequelae in diabetic men, with up to 35%-50% of men with diabetes mellitus suffering from ejaculatory dysfunction. Despite this, aspects of its pathophysiology and treatment are less well understood than erectile dysfunction. The main disorders of ejaculation include premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation, anejaculation and retrograde ejaculation. Although ejaculatory dysfunction in diabetes mellitus can have complex multifactorial aetiology, understanding its pathophysiological mechanisms has facilitated the development of therapies in the management of ejaculatory dysfunction. Most of our understanding of its pathophysiology is derived from diabetic animal models; however, observational studies in humans have also provided useful information in elucidating important associative factors potentially contributing to ejaculatory dysfunction in diabetic men. These have provided the potential for more tailored treatment regimens in patients depending on the ejaculatory disorder, other co-existing sequelae of diabetes mellitus, specific metabolic factors as well as the need for fertility treatment. However, evidence for treatment of ejaculatory dysfunction, especially delayed ejaculation and retrograde ejaculation, is based on low-level evidence comprising small sample-size series and retrospective or cross-sectional studies. Whilst promising findings from large randomised controlled trials have provided strong evidence for the licensed treatment of premature ejaculation, similar robust studies are needed to accurately elucidate factors predicting ejaculatory dysfunction in diabetes mellitus, as well as for the development of pharmacotherapies for delayed ejaculation and retrograde ejaculation. Similarly, more contemporary robust data are required for fertility outcomes in these patients, including methods of sperm retrieval and assisted reproductive techniques in retrograde ejaculation.",Andrology,2023-Feb,"Desai A, Chen R, Cayetano A, Jayasena CN, Minhas S",5,2389,diabetes,2025-11-22
39072872,Mortality patterns in Dutch diabetes outpatients.,"Diabetes mellitus is a major cause of death. Outpatients with diabetes have more complications than patients in general practice; mortality patterns have only been studied in the total diabetes population. This study aims to assess mortality, causes, and predictors in outpatients with diabetes. A cohort study, included people with diabetes mellitus from the nationwide Dutch Paediatric and Adult Registry of Diabetes (DPARD) visiting diabetes outpatient clinics in 2016-2020. DPARD data were linked to Statistics Netherlands (CBS), comprising data on mortality, ethnicity and education. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression. During a median follow-up of 3.1 years among 12 992 people with diabetes, mortality rates per 10 000 person-years were 67.7 in adult type 1 diabetes and 324.2 in type 2 diabetes. The major cause of non-cardiovascular death was malignancy. During the pandemic years of influenza (2018) and COVID (2020), mortality rates peaked. Age, smoking and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of <60 ml/min were associated with all-cause mortality. In type 2 diabetes, additional factors were male sex, body mass index <20 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, diabetes duration <1 year and hypertension. Mortality among Dutch outpatients with diabetes is high. Smoking and renal failure were associated with mortality in both types. Further focus on early detection and treatment of mortality-associated factors may improve clinical outcomes.","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2024-Oct,"Bak JCG, de Vries SAG, Serné EH, Groenwold RHH, de Valk HW, Mul D, Sas TCJ, Bizino M, Nieuwdorp M, Kramer MHH, Verheugt CL",11,1505,diabetes,2025-11-22

Since it appears to have a similar pathophysiology as other microvascular complications of diabetes it can be considered to be the fourth chronic microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus. There is a three-fold increase in risk of periodontal disease among patients with diabetes mellitus. Periodontitis in diabetes is associated with increased myocardial infarctions, strokes and renal related complications, poor glycaemic control and an increase in the risk of dying of cardiorenal causes. However, treatment of periodontal disease has been demonstrated to improve glucose control and reduce inflammatory markers. Improvements in periodontal health among patients with diabetes mellitus can be achieved with better oral health education, oral examination in diabetic clinics during regular visits and annual dental examinations by qualified dentists. Dental treatments for periodontal infections include mechanical disruption of the pathogenic biofilm using scaling and planing, use of systemic antibiotics to treat refractory pathogens and specialized dental surgery in advanced disease.",JPMA.

This age- and sex-matched case-control study involved 18 patients with unclassified diabetes, 18 patients with classic type 1 diabetes, 13 patients with type 2 diabetes, and 18 healthy individuals. Metagenomics facilitated the profiling of the gut microbiota, while untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to quantify the serum lipids and metabolites. Our findings revealed a unique gut microbiota composition in unclassified diabetes patients, marked by a depletion of <i>Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus</i> and <i>Clostridium</i> and an increase in <i>Ruminococcus torques</i> and <i>Lachnospiraceae bacterium 8_1_57FAA</i>. Comparative analysis identified the combined marker panel of five bacterial species, seven serum biomarkers, and three clinical parameters could differentiate patients with UDM from HCs with an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.85-1). Notably, the gut microbiota structure of patients with unclassified diabetes resembled that of type 2 diabetes patients, especially regarding disrupted lipid and branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Despite sharing certain metabolic features with type 2 diabetes, unclassified diabetes presents unique features. The distinct microbiota and metabolites in unclassified diabetes patients suggest a significant role in modulating glucose, lipid, and amino acid metabolism, potentially influencing disease progression. Further longitudinal studies are essential to explore therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiota and metabolites to modify the disease trajectory.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,"Zhang J, Wu L, Zhang Z, Li D, Han R, Ye L, Zhang Y, Hong J, Gu W",9,1781,diabetes,2025-11-22

Though the pathogenesis of molecular mechanisms remains still unclear, there are solid evidence that disturbed immune homeostasis leads to pancreatic β cell failure. Currently, autoimmunity and uncontrolled inflammatory signaling pathways have been considered the major factors in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Many components of immune system have been reported to implicate pancreatic β cell failure, including helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, regulatory T cells and gut microbiota. Immune modulation of those components using small molecules and antibodies, and fecal microbiota transplantation are undergoing in many clinical trials for the treatment of type I and type II diabetes.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a physiologically dynamic regulatory barrier that maintains the consistency of the fluid microenvironment composition of the brain. However, the differences in BBB conditions between children and adults and the contribution of the BBB to the severity of cognitive impairments remain unclear. We generated adult-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) and juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus (JDM) diabetic rat models and investigated BBB functions in these models during the early stages of type 1 diabetes. We performed a BBB permeability assay using sodium fluorescein, a small-molecule fluorescent dye, to evaluate endothelial transport from the blood to the central nervous system. One week after diabetes onset, BBB permeability increased in the hippocampus and striatum of JDM rats, but no changes were observed in the frontal cortex and hypothalamus of JDM rats or for any region of DM rats. The double staining of tight junction proteins and astrocytes revealed no changes in the hippocampus and striatum of JDM rats. These results suggested that the observed increase in BBB permeability during early-stage diabetes onset in JDM rats, which did not depend on the expression of the interendothelial tight junction protein, claudin-5, may affect stylized neural development and cognitive function.",Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2021-,"Tsuneoka Y, Nishimura T, Oka JI",3,1509,diabetes,2025-11-22

Yet, its distinguishing feature of acute pulmonary complications associated with hyperglycemia and the catabolic metabolism associated with a relative insulin deficiency poses challenges to the application of traditional definitions and treatments for diabetes mellitus. People with CF (pwCF) undergo rigorous annual screening starting at age 10, a process that is challenging for patients and limited by sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. As pwCF continue to live longer, over 50% are expected to develop CFRD over their lifetime, including up to 20% of adolescents. Increasing numbers of people with CFRD will make this disease increasingly relevant to diabetes practitioners. Evidence-guided practice in CFRD care is limited by small and short studies. Our current understanding of CFRD may change significantly with the recent introduction of CF Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) modulator medications.

The course of glycemic control at 12 months after starting steroids was classified into three groups: Improved, Unchanged, or Worsened. Factors affecting these groups were investigated. Furthermore, we created two scores: (1) time of diabetes mellitus onset and baseline body mass index; (2) time of diabetes mellitus onset and baseline C-peptide index. Diabetes mellitus occurring at the same time as autoimmune pancreatitis, body mass index ≥22 kg/m<sup>2</sup> , and C-peptide index ≥1.1 were each worth 1 point. Scores were summed and totals of 0-2 were compared between groups. Ten patients were in the Improved group, 10 were in the Unchanged group, and 13 were in the Worsened group. The baseline body mass index and baseline C-peptide index were lower in the Worsened group than in the Improved group (P < 0.05 each). In addition, the scores were lower in the Worsened group than in the other groups (P < 0.05).

The meal tolerance test (MTT) is simple to administer physiological insulin-stimulating test. Previous studies have reported that several CPR-related indices are useful markers for predicting insulin requirement in type 2 diabetes. In the present study, we investigated the serum CPR response during the MTT in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in order to clarify the clinical utility of the MTT. Methods We performed the MTT using a test meal with timed measurements of the serum CPR level based on the oral glucose tolerance test over 180 minutes and tested the correlation of various CPR-related indices and clinical factors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients The subjects were patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had been admitted to our hospital for diabetes management and education. The final study population consisted of 68 patients. Results The fasting CPR level was correlated with the 24-hour urinary CPR excretion and body mass index. The serum CPR level at 120 minutes in the MTT was strongly correlated with the area under the curve of CPR during the MTT. The patients who needed insulin therapy at 6 months after hospitalization showed a significant lower incremental CPR value from 0 to 120 minutes in the MTT than those who did not need insulin therapy. Conclusion The plasma C-peptide levels at 0 and 120 minutes in the MTT provide essential information for the clinical management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2020-,"Wakasaki H, Shono T, Nakao R, Yamamoto S, Minaga T, Fukuda S, Matsumoto R, Ohoshi T, Naka K, Nanjo K",10,1688,diabetes,2025-11-22

This raises the question, whether this is an association only or whether diabetes itself can cause pulmonary fibrosis. Recent studies in mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes demonstrated that diabetes causes pulmonary fibrosis. Both types of diabetes trigger a cascade, starting with increased DNA damage, an impaired DNA repair, and leading to persistent DNA damage signaling. This response, in turn, induces senescence, a senescence-associated-secretory phenotype (SASP), marked by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, finally resulting in fibrosis. Restoring DNA repair drives fibrosis into remission, thus proving causality. These data can be translated clinically to patients with type 2 diabetes, characterized by long-term diabetes and albuminuria. Hence there are several arguments, to substitute the term ""idiopathic"" pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in patients with diabetes (and exclusion of other causes of lung diseases) by the term ""diabetes-induced pulmonary fibrosis"" (DiPF). However, future studies are required to establish this term and to study whether patients with diabetes respond to the established therapies similar to non-diabetic patients.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2021-,"Kopf S, Kumar V, Kender Z, Han Z, Fleming T, Herzig S, Nawroth PP",7,1309,diabetes,2025-11-22

37560999,Utility of Polygenic Scores for Differentiating Diabetes Diagnosis Among Patients With Atypical Phenotypes of Diabetes.,"Misclassification of diabetes type occurs in people with atypical presentations of type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although current clinical guidelines suggest clinical variables and treatment response as ways to help differentiate diabetes type, they remain insufficient for people with atypical presentations. This work aimed to assess the clinical utility of 2 polygenic scores (PGSs) in differentiating between T1D and T2D. Patients diagnosed with diabetes in the UK Biobank were studied (N = 41 787), including 464 (1%) and 15 923 (38%) who met the criteria for classic T1D and T2D, respectively, and 25 400 (61%) atypical diabetes. The validity of 2 published PGSs for T1D (PGST1D) and T2D (PGST2D) in differentiating classic T1D or T2D was assessed using C statistic. The utility of genetic probability for T1D based on PGSs (GenProb-T1D) was evaluated in atypical diabetes patients. The joint performance of PGST1D and PGST2D for differentiating classic T1D or T2D was outstanding (C statistic = 0.91), significantly higher than that of PGST1D alone (0.88) and PGST2D alone (0.70), both P less than .001. Using an optimal cutoff of GenProb-T1D, 23% of patients with atypical diabetes had a higher probability of T1D and its validity was independently supported by clinical presentations that are characteristic of T1D. PGST1D and PGST2D can be used to discriminate classic T1D and T2D and have potential clinical utility for differentiating these 2 types of diseases among patients with atypical diabetes.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2023-Dec,"Billings LK, Shi Z, Wei J, Rifkin AS, Zheng SL, Helfand BT, Ilbawi N, Dunnenberger HM, Hulick PJ, Qamar A, Xu J",11,1529,diabetes,2025-11-22
36272822,"Cardiac Autonomic Neuropathy in Type 1 and 2 Diabetes: Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Management.","Cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is a serious complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is independently associated with major cardiovascular events, morbidity, and mortality. This narrative review examines the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management and identifies areas of future research to address the challenge posed by CAN. We conducted a comprehensive literature search using a range of sources, including the electronic databases PubMed Central, Google Scholar, OVID, and Open Athens, to search for studies on CAN, diabetes mellitus, lifestyle intervention, and cardiovascular risk. We set inclusion criteria to consider review articles or original research published in peer-reviewed journals that examined CAN in diabetes. Epidemiologic data indicate a varied prevalence of CAN in type 1 and 2 diabetes, with prevalences of 17% to 73%) depending on clinical and demographic factors. Indeed, duration of diabetes and hyperglycemia are the strongest risk factors for CAN development in type 1 diabetes. However, in type 2 diabetes, multifactorial risk factors, including obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, are associated with the development of CAN. Insulin resistance, which underpins type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, has a direct role in the pathogenesis of CAN. Lifestyle interventions, including dietary measures and tailored exercise programs, have been beneficial in improving cardiac autonomic function primarily measured through heart rate variability. In addition, weight loss through bariatric surgery also improves heart rate variability and may prevent or reduce CAN progression in people living with obesity and concomitant type 2 diabetes. For optimization in type 2 diabetes, both lifestyle and targeted pharmacologic interventions are required to achieve glycemic/metabolic targets, and weight loss is required to prevent or reverse early CAN or prevent the progression to definite and severe CAN. The focused use of diagnostic testing for CAN, including cardiac autonomic reflex testing in those at high risk of CAN, will enable earlier diagnosis. This testing will allow timely interventions at a reversible stage. Future research should examine targeted early diagnostic testing with subsequent intervention with a combination of lifestyle measures and newer pharmacotherapeutics (eg, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists), which have produced significant cardiovascular benefit in diabetes.",Clinical therapeutics,2022-Oct,"Williams S, Raheim SA, Khan MI, Rubab U, Kanagala P, Zhao SS, Marshall A, Brown E, Alam U",9,2497,diabetes,2025-11-22

We provide the first comprehensive catalog for syndromes with diabetes mellitus. We conducted a systematic review of MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, PubMed, OMIM, and Orphanet databases for case reports, case series, and observational studies published between 1946 and January 15, 2020, that described diabetes mellitus in adults and children with monogenic or chromosomal syndromes. Our literature search identified 7,122 studies, of which 160 fulfilled inclusion criteria. Our analysis of these studies found 69 distinct diabetes syndromes. Thirty (43.5%) syndromes included diabetes mellitus as a cardinal clinical feature, and 56 (81.2%) were fully genetically elucidated. Sixty-three syndromes (91.3%) were described more than once in independent case reports, of which 59 (93.7%) demonstrated clinical heterogeneity. Syndromes associated with diabetes mellitus are more numerous and diverse than previously anticipated. While knowledge of the syndromes is limited by their low prevalence, future reviews will be needed as more cases are identified. The genetic etiologies of these syndromes are well elucidated and provide potential avenues for future gene identification efforts, aid in diagnosis and management, gene therapy research, and developing personalized medicine treatments.",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,2021-Sep,"Shi D, Motamed M, Mejía-Benítez A, Li L, Lin E, Budhram D, Kaur Y, Meyre D",8,1446,diabetes,2025-11-22

The present study was to investigate the impact of combined vanadium and insulin for proper control and protection against endothelial dysfunction in T1DM rats. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups; control non-treated; control vanadium treated; T1DM; T1DM + insulin; T1DM + vanadium; T1DM + insulin + vanadium treated groups. At the end of the experiment (6 weeks), serum C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, IL-6, endothelin-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, fasting glucose serum lipogram, liver homogenate SOD activity and MDA levels were determined. Concomitant insulin and vanadium treatment improved the diabetic metabolic disturbances in addition to endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory markers.

We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Library databases and other databases for case-control studies related to risk factors for new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation published between January 2005 and July 2019. A meta-analysis of data on risk factors for new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation from the included studies was carried out. A narrative review of risk factors for new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation was also carried out. A total of 24 case-control studies were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 7,140 patients. There were 1,598 patients with new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation, and 5,542 patients without new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation. The meta-analysis results showed that age, polycystic kidney disease, family history of diabetes, body mass index, acute rejection, tacrolimus use, hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis C virus infection and hypertension were associated with new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation, whereas sex, sirolimus use, cyclosporin A use, steroid use and cytomegalovirus infection were not associated with new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation. Older age, body mass index, family history of diabetes, tacrolimus use, history of hypertension, polycystic kidney disease, acute rejection, hepatitis B virus infection and hepatitis C virus infection are risk factors for new-onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation.

32008491,Analysis of Risk Factors for Posttransplant Diabetes Mellitus After Kidney Transplantation: Single-Center Experience.,"Posttransplant diabetes mellitus may severely affect the short-term and long-term outcomes of grafts and patient survival in kidney transplant recipients. The annual incidence rate of posttransplant diabetes mellitus ranges from 4% to 25%. In this study, our aim was to determine the possible risk factors in patients diagnosed with this disease. From November 1975 to May 2019, our transplant team performed 3012 kidney transplant procedures at different units within Baskent University Transplantation Centers. We retrospectively analyzed data of patients who were diagnosed with posttransplant diabetes mellitus between 2010 and 2019. The diagnosis was made according to the 2001 American Diabetes Association criteria (fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 126 mg/dL [7 mmol/L] in 2 measurements or random blood glucose level ≥ 200 mg/dL [11.1 mmol/L] within 12 months posttransplant). For this study, 400 patients (292 male, 108 female) with end-stage renal disease and without diabetes met the initial inclusion criteria; 270 received hemodialysis, 26 received peritoneal dialysis, and 104 underwent preemptive kidney transplant. In this patient group, 62 patients (15.5%) developed post-transplant diabetes mellitus. When we compared patients who developed and did not develop posttransplant diabetes mellitus, cause of end-stage renal disease, dialysis type and duration, type of donor (living or deceased), and graft survival posttransplant were similar between groups. Baseline fasting plasma glucose level was significantly higher in patients who developed posttransplant diabetes mellitus (90 vs 85 mg/dL; P = .034). Patients who developed the disease were significantly older. In our study, recipient age was the only risk factor for posttransplant diabetes mellitus. Older recipients should be examined more carefully for posttransplant diabetes mellitus, and less diabetogenic immunosuppressive drugs may be preferred.",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,2020-Jan,"Gulsoy Kirnap N, Bozkus Y, Haberal M",3,1926,diabetes,2025-11-22
33329383,Hepatic Transcriptome Analysis Revealing the Molecular Pathogenesis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Zucker Diabetic Fatty Rats.,"Around 9% of the adult population in the world (463 million) suffer from diabetes mellitus. Most of them (~90%) belong to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which is a common chronic metabolic disorder, and the number of cases has been reported to increase each year. Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat provides a successful animal model to study the pathogenesis of T2DM. Although previous hepatic transcriptome studies revealed some novel genes associated with the occurrence and development of T2DM, there still lacks the comprehensive transcriptomic analysis for the liver tissues of ZDF rats. We performed comparative transcriptome analyses between the liver tissues of ZDF rats and healthy ZCL rats and also evaluated several clinical indices. We could identify 214 and 104 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and lncRNAs in ZDF rats, respectively. Pathway and biofunction analyses showed a synergistic effect between mRNAs and lncRNAs. By comprehensively analyzing transcriptomic data and clinical indices, we detected some typical features of T2DM in ZDF rats, such as upregulated metabolism (significant increased lipid absorption/transport/utilization, gluconeogenesis, and protein hydrolysis), increased inflammation, liver injury and increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In addition, of the 214 DEGs, 114 were known and 100 were putative T2DM-related genes, most of which have been associated with substance metabolism (particularly degradation), inflammation, liver injury and ER stress biofunctions. Our study provides an important reference and improves understanding of molecular pathogenesis of obesity-associated T2DM. Our data can also be used to identify potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets, which should strengthen the prevention and treatment of T2DM.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2020-,"Xia C, Zhang X, Cao T, Wang J, Li C, Yue L, Niu K, Shen Y, Ma G, Chen F",10,1795,diabetes,2025-11-22
33329376,Overexpression of microRNA-216a-3p Accelerates the Inflammatory Response in Cardiomyocytes in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus by Targeting IFN-α2.,"<b>Background:</b> Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic, hyperglycemia-associated, metabolic disorder. Heart disease is a major complication of T2DM. The present study aimed to explore the effects of miR-216a-3p on cardiomyocyte proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation in T2DM through the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway involving interferon-α2 (IFN-α2) mediation. <b>Methods:</b> T2DM was induced in rats by a high-fat diet, in combination with an intraperitoneal injection of low-dose streptozotocin. ELISAs were conducted to measure inflammatory-related factors in serum. Next, isolated cardiomyocytes were used in loss- and gain-of-function experiments, followed by MTT and flow cytometry assays, conducted to evaluate cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis. <b>Results:</b> Our results revealed an increase in the inflammatory response in T2DM rat models, accompanied by significantly increased expression of miR-216a-3p and TLR pathway-related genes. However, a decrease in the expression of IFN-α2 was observed. Moreover, the presence of an miR-216a-3p inhibitor and si-IFN-α2 increased the expression of TLR pathway-related genes and cell apoptosis, whereas cell proliferation was significantly decreased in the cardiomyocytes. <b>Conclusion:</b> We found that in T2DM, miR-216a-3p inhibited the proliferation and enhanced the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes and generated an inflammatory response through activation of the TLR pathway and targeting of IFN-α2.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2020-,"Liu X, Zhang Y, Liang H, Xu Y",4,1483,diabetes,2025-11-22

37814478,Effect of lawsone-preconditioned mesenchymal stem cells on the regeneration of pancreatic β cells in Type 1 diabetic rats.,"Diabetes is one of the major health issues globally. Type 1 diabetes mellitus develops due to the destruction of pancreatic β cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) having remarkable self-renewal and differentiation potential, can regenerate β cells. MSCs preconditioned with bioactive small molecules possess enhanced biological features and therapeutic potential under in vivo environment. Interestingly, compounds of naphthoquinone class possess antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory properties, and can be explored as potential candidates for preconditioning MSCs. This study analyzed the effect of lawsone-preconditioned human umbilical cord MSCs (hUMSCs) on the regeneration of β cells in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced Type 1 diabetes (T1D) rats. hUMSCs were isolated and characterized for the presence of surface markers. MSCs were preconditioned with optimized concentration of lawsone. T1D rat model was established by injecting 50 mg/kg of STZ intraperitoneally. Untreated and lawsone-preconditioned hUMSCs were transplanted into the diabetic rats via tail vein. Fasting blood sugar and body weight were monitored regularly for 4 weeks. Pancreas was harvested and β cell regeneration was evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining, and gene expression analysis. Immunohistochemistry was also done to assess the insulin expression. Lawsone-preconditioned hUMSCs showed better anti-hyperglycemic effect in comparison with untreated hUMSCs. Histological analysis presented the regeneration of islets of Langerhans with upregulated expression of βcell genes and reduced expression of inflammatory markers. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong insulin expression in the preconditioned hUMSCs compared with the untreated hUMSCs. It is concluded from the present study that lawsone-preconditioned hMSCs were able to exhibit pronounced anti-hyperglycemic effect in vivo compared with hUMSCs alone.",Cell biochemistry and function,2023-Oct,"Masnoon J, Ishaque A, Khan I, Salim A, Kabir N",5,1898,diabetes,2025-11-22
38450737,Does the duration of diabetes increase the risk of cancer? A nationwide population-based cohort of patients with new-onset diabetes and a matched reference cohort.,"Diabetes mellitus and cancer are both common health issues, but the correlation between these two diseases remains unclear. We investigated the association of cumulative exposure of diabetes mellitus as an indication of hyperglycemia in terms of disease duration on multiple cancer types. We hypothesized that the risk of cancer would increase over time after the onset of diabetes. The study population consisted of a population-based cohort of 398,708 people and it was constructed from the Finnish CARING project. The Diabetes group consisted of 185,258 individuals, and the non-diabetic reference group comprised 187,921 individuals. Over 4.1 million person-years were accumulated, and the median follow-up time was 10.55 years. In the diabetes group, 25,899 cancer cases were observed compared with 23,900 cancers in the non-diabetic group. We did not find a clear relationship between the duration of diabetes mellitus and most cancer types examined. However, for cancers of the pancreas, prostate gland, bronchus, and lungs, a temporal relationship was found. Furthermore, even within the cancer types where the relationship was detected, it did not change over time. These findings indicate that diabetes does not independently increase the risk of cancer. Instead, the development of diabetes may be attributed to shared risk factors with cancer, such as obesity and/or insulin resistance accompanied by hyperinsulinemia. Thus, it is likely that the clock for increased cancer risk starts ticking already before onset of diabetes and hyperglycemia.",International journal of cancer,2024-Jun,"Lohi P, Auvinen A, Niskanen L, Partonen T, Haukka J",5,1557,diabetes,2025-11-22

Outcomes included glycated hemoglobin, the occurrence of hypoglycemic events, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-h postprandial glucose (2hPG) levels. The statistical analysis was performed using R 4.1.3 software. We included 19 studies involving 2013 participants, all of which were RCTs. Meta-analysis results revealed that compared to self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), FGM significantly reduced glycated hemoglobin levels in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus [mean difference = -0.74 [95 % CI-1.16, -0.32], P < 0.01] and type 1 diabetes mellitus combined with type 2 diabetes mellitus [mean difference = -1.14 [95 % CI-3.14, 0.87], P < 0.01], with a greater effect in participants aged ≤65 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean difference = -1.38 [95 % CI-2.05, -0.72], P < 0.01). However, there was no effect of FGM on the improvement of glycated hemoglobin levels in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [P = 0.45]. Furthermore, fasting plasma glucose levels and 2-h postprandial glucose levels were significantly lower in FGM than SMBG, and the number of hypoglycemic events was also significantly lower. Comparing SMBG with FGM indicated that FGM improves fasting plasma glucose levels, 2-h postprandial glucose levels, and glycated hemoglobin levels, and it reduces the number of hypoglycemic events.",Journal of diabetes and its complications,2022-Nov,"Gao Y, Zhou M, Xu X, Chen WY",4,1949,diabetes,2025-11-22

39192271,Association between mean platelet volume and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus among women with history of gestational diabetes mellitus.,"The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between mean platelet volume (MPV) and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), among women with and without a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Eight thousand one hundred eighty-one parous women of the '2007-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)' were classified into GDM and non-GDM groups based on self-reported GDM history. We investigated the independent association between the MPV and the risk of T2DM in these groups via multivariable regression analysis. A subgroup analysis was done for the GDM group. After comprehensive adjustment for potential covariates, a significant positive correlation was observed between MPV and the risk of T2DM in women with a history of GDM (OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.13-2.01, P = 0.006). There was a linear relationship between MPV and T2DM among women with a history of GDM, with each unit increase in MPV increasing the risk of T2DM by 50%. Subgroup analysis and interaction tests revealed a stronger significant effect on women with GDM history who had HbA1c ≥ 7%. MPV is strongly associated with the incidence of T2DM among U.S. parous women with prior GDM, indicating that MPV may be a potential biomarker of T2DM among women with a history of GDM.",BMC endocrine disorders,2024-Aug,"Wei Y, Lin Y, Huang L, Wang C, Li R",5,1287,diabetes,2025-11-22

These drugs have thus come into widespread use for treating type 2 diabetes (T2DM). However, mechanistic comparisons and effects of combining these drugs have not been adequately studied. Employing diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and db/db mice as models of the early and advanced stages of T2DM, we evaluated effects of single or combined use of liraglutide (a GLP-1RA) and ipragliflozin (a SGLT2i). Treatments with liraglutide and/or ipragliflozin for 28 days improved glycemic control and reduced hepatic lipid accumulation similarly in DIO mice. In contrast, in db/db mice, despite similar favorable effects on fatty liver, liraglutide exerted no beneficial effects on glycemic control. Improved glycemic control in db/db mice treated with ipragliflozin was accompanied by increased pancreatic β-cell area and insulin content, both of which tended to rise further when ipragliflozin was combined with liraglutide. Our data suggest that liraglutide is more efficient at an earlier stage and ipragliflozin can be effective in both stages. In addition, their combined use is a potential option for treating advanced stage diabetes with fatty liver disease.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021-Oct,"Koike M, Saito H, Kohno G, Takubo M, Watanabe K, Ishihara H",6,1361,diabetes,2025-11-22
39736865,Quantitative ultrasound imaging reveals distinct fracture-associated differences in tibial intracortical pore morphology and viscoelastic properties in aged individuals with and without diabetes mellitus - an exploratory study.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder that increases fragility fracture risk. Conventional DXA-based areal bone mineral density (aBMD) assessments often underestimate this risk. Cortical Backscatter (CortBS) ultrasound, a radiation-free technique, non-invasively analyzes cortical bone's viscoelastic and microstructural properties. This study aimed to evaluate CortBS's discriminative performance in DM patients compared to DXA and characterize changes in cortical bone microstructure in Type 1 and Type 2 DM (T1DM, T2DM) patients. This <i>in-vivo</i> study included 89 DM patients (T1DM = 39, T2DM = 48) and 76 age- and sex-matched controls. DXA measured aBMD, while CortBS measurements were taken at the anteromedial tibia using a medical ultrasound scanner with custom software. Multivariate analysis of variance assessed the impact of DM type on CortBS and DXA measurement results. Partial least squares discriminant analyses with cross-validation were used to compare the discrimination performance for vertebral, non-vertebral, and any fragility fractures, adjusting for gender, age, and anthropometric parameters (weight, height, BMI). Fractures occurred in 8/23 T1DM, 17/18 T2DM, and 16/55 controls. DXA parameters were reduced in fracture patients, with significant diabetes impact. T2DM was associated with altered CortBS parameters, reduced scatterer density, and larger pores. CortBS outperformed DXA in discriminating fracture risk (0.61 ≤ AUC(DXA) ≤ 0.63, 0.68 ≤ AUC(CortBS) ≤ 0.69). Both T1DM and T2DM showed altered bone metabolism, with T2DM linked to impaired tissue formation. CortBS provides insights into pathophysiological changes in diabetic bone and provided superior fracture risk assessment in DM patients compared to DXA.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,"Dehnen C, Galindo A, Hoff P, Palme O, Maurer L, Raum K, Wiebe E",7,1766,diabetes,2025-11-22

The purinergic system is one of the most important inflammatory pathways in T2DM condition, and P2X7R and P2X4R are the primary purinergic receptors in SG that regulate inflammatory homeostasis. This study aimed to evaluate P2X7R and P2X4R expression, and morphological changes in the submandibular gland (SMG) in T2DM. Twenty-four 5-week-old mice were randomly assigned to control (CON) and diabetes mellitus (DM) groups (n = 12 each). Body weight, diet, and blood glucose levels were monitored weekly. The histomorphology of the SMG and the expression of the P2X7R, and P2X7R was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) at 11 and 13 weeks of age. Our findings indicate a significant increase in food consumption, body weight, and blood glucose levels in the DM group. Although a significant increase in P2X7R and P2X4R expression was observed in the DM groups, the receptor location remained unchanged. We also observed a significant increase in the acinar area in the DM13w group, and a significant decrease in the ductal area in the DM11w and DM13w groups.

Rats were divided into: control, diabetes mellitus (DM, streptozotocin + nicotinamide) and diabetes mellitus + empagliflozin (DM + EMPA, 10 mg/kg/day) groups. 56 days after inducing diabetes mellitus testis histological changes and serum biochemical factors along with the level of Bax, Bcl2 and Nrf2 genes expression in the testicular tissue were assessed. A significant decrease in the mean total volume of testis and its components, the level of Bcl2 and Nrf2 gene expression (p < 0.001) along with a significant increase in the level of IL-6, TNF-α, MDA, Bax gene expression were observed in the DM group compared to the control group (p < 0.001). In the DM + EMPA group, the mean total volume of testis and its components, the level of Bcl2 gene expression (p< 0.01) and Nrf2 (p < 0.001) significantly increased whereas the mean level of IL-6 (p < 0.01), TNF-α (p < 0.001), MDA (p < 0.001), Bax (p < 0.001) gene expression significantly decreased compared to the DM group.

30961498,Macrovascular Complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has emerged as a pandemic. It has different complications, both microvascular and macrovascular. The purpose of this review is to summarize the different types of macrovascular complications associated with T2DM. A comprehensive review of the literature was performed to identify clinical studies, which determine the macrovascular complications associated with T2DM. Macrovascular complications of T2DM include coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias and sudden death, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral artery disease. Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death in diabetic patients. Many clinical studies have shown a connection between T2DM and vascular disease, but almost always other risk factors are present in diabetic patients, such as hypertension, obesity and dyslipidaemia. T2DM causes a variety of macrovascular complications through different pathogenetic pathways that include hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance. The association between T2DM and cardiovascular disease is clear, but we need more clinical studies in order to identify the pure effect of T2DM.",Current vascular pharmacology,2020-,"Viigimaa M, Sachinidis A, Toumpourleka M, Koutsampasopoulos K, Alliksoo S, Titma T",6,1135,diabetes,2025-11-22

32488498,Renal denervation improves vascular endothelial dysfunction by inducing autophagy via AMPK/mTOR signaling activation in a rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus with insulin resistance.,"Recent clinical and animal studies have shown that renal denervation (RDN) improves insulin sensitivity and endothelial dysfunction. However, the specific mechanism remains incompletely understood. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of RDN on endothelial dysfunction of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T<sub>2</sub>DM) rat models with insulin resistance and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with or without high-fat diet allocated in different groups, combined with low-dose streptozotocin which induces a rat model to develop T<sub>2</sub>DM with insulin resistance. RDN was conducted 1 week after the rat models fully developed T<sub>2</sub>DM. The animals were sub-divided into four groups randomly: control group (CON, n = 6), diabetic group (T<sub>2</sub>DM, n = 6), diabetic with sham surgery group (Sham, n = 6) and diabetic with RDN group (RDN, n = 6). Rats in all groups were studied at baseline, both preoperatively and 4 weeks after RDN, respectively. Western blot was used to detect the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein and the expression of autophagy-related proteins Beclin1, LC3 and p62 and autophagy signaling pathway AMPK/mTOR proteins and apoptosis-related protein caspase-3 in the aorta endothelial cells. In addition, the effects of ACE2 on autophagy of human umbilical vein insulin resistance endothelial cell culture in vitro were also studied. RDN decreased plasma and renal tissue norepinephrine levels. The Von Willebrand factor level was also decreased, while the plasma level of nitric oxide (NO) was significantly increased after RDN. Compared with the T<sub>2</sub>DM group and the Sham group, the endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent diastolic function of the RDN group was improved significantly, the expression of Beclin1, LC3, ACE2 and eNOS proteins was higher, and the level of p62 protein was decreased. Furthermore, we found that RDN can activate the expression of p-AMPK and inhibit the expression of p-mTOR. In cell culture experiment, ACE2 activated p-AMPK and inhibited p-mTOR, thus promoting autophagy. RDN may not only increase the expression of ACE2 in the vascular endothelium, but also can via ACE2 activate p-AMPK and inhibit p-mTOR, thus promoting autophagy and improving endothelial dysfunction.",Acta diabetologica,2020-Oct,"Wang Y, Rijal B, Xu M, Li Z, An Y, Zhang F, Lu C",7,2348,diabetes,2025-11-22
33162804,Klotho deficiency aggravates diabetes-induced podocyte injury due to DNA damage caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a progressive disease, the main pathogeny of which is podocyte injury inducing glomerular filtration barrier and proteinuria. The occurrence and development of DN could be partly attributed to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by mitochondria. However, research on how mitochondrial dysfunction (MtD) ultimately causes DNA damage is poor. Here, we investigated the influence of Klotho deficiency on high glucose (HG)-induced DNA damage <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. First, we found that the absence of Klotho aggravated diabetic phenotypes indicated by podocyte injury accompanied by elevated urea albumin creatinine ratio (UACR), creatinine and urea nitrogen. Then, we further confirmed that Klotho deficiency could significantly aggravate DNA damage by increasing 8-OHdG and reducing OGG1. Finally, we demonstrated Klotho deficiency may promote MtD to promote 8-OHdG-induced podocyte injury. Therefore, we came to a conclusion that Klotho deficiency may promote diabetes-induced podocytic MtD and aggravate 8-OHdG-induced DNA damage by affecting OOG1.",International journal of medical sciences,2020-,"Chen Z, Zhou Q, Liu C, Zeng Y, Yuan S",5,1098,diabetes,2025-11-22

The objective of this study was to assess the association between prepregnancy liver enzyme levels and subsequent risk of gestational diabetes mellitus. Data from a total of 236,109 women who participated in the National Health Screening Examination between 2011 and 2015 was analysed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus in relation to pregravid liver enzyme levels. Subgroup analyses were performed according to pregravid obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Approximately 5.7% and 1.1% of women developed gestational diabetes mellitus with and without insulin treatment requirement respectively. Pregravid gamma-glutamyl transferase and alanine aminotransferase levels with greater than or equal to the 4th quartile were associated with significantly increased risks of gestational diabetes mellitus requiring insulin treatment in women with obesity and with MetS, (odds ratios [ORs] with 6.228 and 9.505, respectively, P < .001 for both). In women without obesity and without MetS, the risks of gestational diabetes mellitus requiring insulin treatment were also significant (ORs with 2.837 and 3.029, respectively, P < .001 for both). The elevated pregravid liver enzymes were associated with gestational diabetes mellitus without insulin treatment requirement, but minimally. The elevated pregravid liver enzyme levels were significantly associated with the subsequent risk of gestational diabetes mellitus, especially gestational diabetes mellitus requiring insulin treatment, not only in women with obesity or MetS, but also in women without obesity or MetS.",Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,2021-Apr,"Kim WJ, Chung Y, Park J, Park JY, Han K, Park Y, Park IY, Ko HS",8,1744,diabetes,2025-11-22

The most alarming is possibly the escalation propensity of diabetes, in recent years, where a nearly ten-fold increase has been witnessed over the past thirty years in Saudi Arabia. However, the number of research arbitrations on the prevalence and incidence of DM is woefully inadequate, as compared to developed countries. Apart from this, most of the existing research data carried out in Saudi Arabia is cross-sectional, with small sample sizes, which most often involve only certain parts of the country. Consequently, the present scenario demands more multidimensional and multisectoral research to strengthen the evidence base and to accumulate greater knowledge as a basis for measures and programmes to confront diabetes and its complications.

The metabolomic difference and similarity between patients with and without diabetes mellitus have not been well studied in the context of MDD. We aimed to examine these differences and common serum metabolomics patterns, pathways and biomarkers that can comprehensively reflect the pathogenetic difference and similarity between these MDD groups. We performed a metabolomics analysis of serum samples of healthy controls (n = 6), patients with MDD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 13), and patients with MDD without type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 27). Metabolomics analysis was conducted using capillary electrophoresis Fourier transform mass spectrometry and a candidate compound was assigned to the 496 (290 cation, 206 anion) peaks. Moreover, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the candidate biomarkers for distinguishing between MDD patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Principal component analysis revealed no clear distinction among the three groups, while naive partial least squares discriminant analysis yielded three relatively good and distinct populations based on the first principal component. Energy conversion by the tricarboxylic acid cycle represented the highest percentage among the top 30 positive factors of the first principal component, and glutamate metabolism and urea cycle represented the highest percentage among the top 30 negative factors of the first principal component. Synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies had high impact in MDD with type 2 diabetes mellitus group and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism had high impact in MDD without type 2 diabetes mellitus group for the pathway. Patterns of serum metabolites may be different among MDD with type 2 diabetes mellitus, MDD without type 2 diabetes mellitus, and healthy controls groups. Specifically, comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus could affect metabolomics pathway and alter the distribution of serum metabolites in patients with MDD.

31057117,The Emerging role of Branch Chain Amino Acids in the Prediction of Diabetes: A Brief Review.,"Diabetes is a chronic condition; those with diabetes are at high risk of developing diabetes complications. One important approach to tackle the diabetes burden is to screen for undiagnosed diabetes and to identify factors that lead to the risk of developing diabetes in the future. The earlier identification of individuals at risk of developing diabetes is crucial for delaying or preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes. Numerous studies have demonstrated that circulating concentrations of branch chain amino acids (BCAAs) predict the risk for developing diabetes; thus, contributing to the recent resurgence of interest in these common analytes. The present review aimed to address the recent findings regarding BCAAs and their role in insulin resistance and diabetes. Recent studies demonstrate that BCAAs are strongly associated with a number of pathological mechanisms causing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The research findings related to BCAA signaling pathways and metabolism broaden our understanding of this topic. However, it remains unclear how increased levels of BCAAs will assist in the prediction of future insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes.

This study preliminarily explored the roles of TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) and S100B in osteogenic dysfunction induced by glycolipid toxicity. In this study, a diabetic rat model and TLR4-knockdown diabetic rat model were used in vivo. MC3T3-E1 cells in a high glucose and palmitic acid environment were used as glycolipid toxicity cell models in vitro. We investigated the effects of TLR4 and S100B on osteogenesis by overexpression or inhibition of TLR4 and S100B in vitro. We found that when TLR4 or S100B was inhibited, ALP and OCN were significantly up-regulated and p-ERK was significantly down regulated in the glycolipid model. These results suggest that TLR4/S100B may play a role in reducing glycolipid toxicity by regulating ERK phosphorylation.",International immunopharmacology,2021-Aug,"Liang B, Shen X, Lan C, Lin Y, Li C, Zhong S, Yan S",7,1096,diabetes,2025-11-22
34472814,Diabetes in Pre-independence India: Rediscovering a Forgotten Era.,"Around 300- 400 AD, ancient Indian physicians described a condition akin to diabetes mellitus which was called ""Madhumeha"". Sushrutha and Charaka, are also credited with describing two types of diabetes which would roughly correspond to type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. However, little is known about the history of diabetes in India between the first and 19th century AD. A thorough search of literature revealed a large number of publications on diabetes from India in the 1800s and early 1900s, mostly from Calcutta and the Madras Presidency, suggesting that the prevalence of diabetes was high in these two places. Building on the observations made by a number of English physicians, Chunilal Bose in 1907 suggested the link between diabetes and lifestyle in India. Amazingly, India did not have to wait long after the discovery of insulin by Banting and Best at Toronto in 1921, to get its own supply. Around this time, Dr. J.P. Bose, eminent physician and diabetologist from Calcutta made remarkable contributions to the study of diabetes in India. He was also the first to describe the dramatic effects of insulin administration to children with type 1 diabetes in India. All these facts have remained largely forgotten which prompted the authors to delve deep into the history of diabetes in pre-independence India.

Recent scientific reports suggest that people with type 1 diabetes mellitus also develop insulin resistance, which is generally considered to be a distinctive feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The causes of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes mellitus were explored, but there was a lack of publications that connected the risk factors of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes mellitus with the proposition of repair mechanisms that are offered by quaternary prevention. Toward this end, the present review is an attempt to combine the previous reports on the causes of insulin resistance in type 1 diabetes mellitus and a brief review of quaternary prevention.

33446887,Induced regulatory T cells suppress Tc1 cells through TGF-β signaling to ameliorate STZ-induced type 1 diabetes mellitus.,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune condition in which the immune system destroys insulin-producing pancreatic β cells. In addition to well-established pathogenic effector T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs) have also been shown to be defective in T1D. Thus, an increasing number of therapeutic approaches are being developed to target Tregs. However, the role and mechanisms of TGF-β-induced Tregs (iTregs) in T1D remain poorly understood. Here, using a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced preclinical T1D mouse model, we found that iTregs could ameliorate the development of T1D and preserve β cell function. The preventive effect was associated with the inhibition of type 1 cytotoxic T (Tc1) cell function and rebalancing the Treg/Tc1 cell ratio in recipients. Furthermore, we showed that the underlying mechanisms were due to the TGF-β-mediated combinatorial actions of mTOR and TCF1. In addition to the preventive role, the therapeutic effects of iTregs on the established STZ-T1D and nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse models were tested, which revealed improved β cell function. Our findings therefore provide key new insights into the basic mechanisms involved in the therapeutic role of iTregs in T1D.",Cellular & molecular immunology,2021-Mar,"Zhou L, He X, Cai P, Li T, Peng R, Dang J, Li Y, Li H, Huang F, Shi G, Xie C, Lu Y, Chen Y",13,1218,diabetes,2025-11-22

Change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> from baseline to 12 months was the primary outcome, and change in healthcare costs and biomedical variables were secondary outcomes. 3DFD participants had worse glycaemic control and higher healthcare costs than control participants at baseline. 3DFD participants had greater improvement in glycaemic control compared with control participants [-14 mmol/mol (-1.3%) vs. -6 mmol/mol (-0.6%) respectively, P < 0.001], adjusted for confounding. Total follow-up healthcare costs remained higher in the 3DFD group compared with the control group (mean difference £1715, 95% confidence intervals 591 to 2811), adjusted for confounding. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £398 per mmol/mol unit decrease in HbA<sub>1c</sub> , indicating the 3DFD intervention was more effective and costed more than usual care.

35796583,Poor glycemic control rather than types of diabetes is a risk factor for sarcopenia in diabetes mellitus: The MUSCLES-DM study.,"Though poor glycemic control and insulin treatment are reported to be associated with sarcopenia in type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes may be a stronger risk for sarcopenia. We therefore studied the effect of the type of diabetes, glycemic control, and insulin therapy on the prevalence and characteristics of sarcopenia. A total of 812 Japanese patients with diabetes (type 1: n = 57; type 2: n = 755) were enrolled in this study. Sarcopenia was defined as low handgrip strength or slow gait speed and low appendicular skeletal muscle mass. Among participants aged ≥65 years, the sarcopenia prevalence rate was higher among patients with type 1 diabetes (20.0%) than among those with type 2 diabetes (8.1%). The prevalence rate of low handgrip strength was higher in type 1 diabetes (50.0%) than in type 2 diabetes (28.7%). In logistic regression analysis, type 1 diabetes was significantly associated with the prevalence of low handgrip strength. In logistic regression analysis, medication with insulin was significantly associated with the prevalence of sarcopenia; this association was not retained after adjusting for HbA1c. The prevalence of sarcopenia in older adult patients was higher in those with type 1 diabetes than in those with type 2 diabetes. Among the components of sarcopenia, the difference was most prominent in the frequency of low handgrip strength. Poor glycemic control rather than type of diabetes or insulin treatment was revealed to be a primary risk factor for sarcopenia in diabetes mellitus.",Journal of diabetes investigation,2022-Nov,"Hiromine Y, Noso S, Rakugi H, Sugimoto K, Takata Y, Katsuya T, Fukuda M, Akasaka H, Osawa H, Tabara Y, Ikegami H",11,1521,diabetes,2025-11-22
35370955,MOTS-c and Exercise Restore Cardiac Function by Activating of NRG1-ErbB Signaling in Diabetic Rats.,"Pathologic cardiac remodeling and dysfunction are the most common complications of type 2 diabetes. Physical exercise is important in inhibiting myocardial pathologic remodeling and restoring cardiac function in diabetes. The mitochondrial-derived peptide MOTS-c has exercise-like effects by improving insulin resistance, combatting hyperglycemia, and reducing lipid accumulation. We investigated the effects and transcriptomic profiling of MOTS-c and aerobic exercise on cardiac properties in a rat model of type 2 diabetes which was induced by feeding a high fat high sugar diet combined with an injection of a low dose of streptozotocin. Both aerobic exercise and MOTS-c treatment reduced abnormalities in cardiac structure and function. Transcriptomic function enrichment analysis revealed that MOTS-c had exercise-like effects on inflammation, myocardial apoptosis, angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation and migration, and showed that the NRG1-ErbB4 pathway might be an important component in both MOTS-c and exercise induced attenuation of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes. Moreover, our findings suggest that MOTS-c activates NRG1-ErbB4 signaling and mimics exercise-induced cardio-protection in diabetes.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2022-,"Li S, Wang M, Ma J, Pang X, Yuan J, Pan Y, Fu Y, Laher I",8,1221,diabetes,2025-11-22

Since then, along with many other countries worldwide, Ireland has imposed intermittent strict lockdowns to mitigate the spread of the virus. To investigate the impact of lockdown on glycaemic control in young adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Pre- and post-lockdown HbA1c levels were recorded for 118 patients attending the Young Adult Diabetes clinic in Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, and the results were compared. Changes in weight, insulin requirements and incidence of DKA/severe hypoglycaemia were also assessed. HbA1c results were 3.81 mmol/mol lower post-lockdown. Weight increased by 1.8 kg. Both of these results were statistically significant. Lockdown was associated with improved glycaemic control in young adult diabetic patients, and also with an increase in body weight.

On the other hand, blood glycaemic control remains the primary therapeutic target for diabetic patients. Dietary starch is the main determinant of blood glucose. But dietary starch tolerance levels fluctuate between individuals, which might be due to difference in genetic variants of alpha-amylase enzyme. Additionally, genetic variability of cereal carbohydrates may also influence glucophenotype in terms of a specific glycaemic and biochemical derangement. Therefore, personalised carbohydrate/ starch based diets are needed to ensure optimum blood glycaemic control in diabetic subjects in prospective studies.",JPMA.

33872592,Gestational diabetes and fetal growth in twin compared with singleton pregnancies.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with accelerated fetal growth in singleton pregnancies but may affect twin pregnancies differently because of the slower growth of twin fetuses during the third trimester of pregnancy and their greater predisposition to fetal growth restriction. This study aimed to evaluate the association of gestational diabetes mellitus with longitudinal fetal growth in twin pregnancies and to compare this association with that observed in singleton pregnancies. This was a retrospective cohort study of all women with a singleton or twin pregnancy who were followed up at a single tertiary referral center between January 2011 and April 2020. Data on estimated fetal weight and individual fetal biometric indices were extracted from ultrasound examinations of eligible women. Generalized linear models were used to model and compare the change in fetal weight and individual biometric indices as a function of gestational age between women with and without gestational diabetes mellitus in twin pregnancies and between women with and without gestational diabetes mellitus in singleton pregnancies. The primary outcome was estimated fetal weight as a function of gestational age. The secondary outcomes were longitudinal growth of individual fetal biometric indices and the rate of small for gestational age and large for gestational age at birth. A total of 26,651 women (94,437 ultrasound examinations) were included in the analysis: 1881 with a twin pregnancy and 24,770 with a singleton pregnancy. The rate of gestational diabetes mellitus in the twin and singleton groups was 9.6% (n=180) and 7.6% (n=1893), respectively. The estimated fetal weight in singleton pregnancies with gestational diabetes mellitus was significantly higher than that in pregnancies without gestational diabetes mellitus (P<.001) starting at approximately 30 weeks of gestation. The differences remained similar after adjusting for maternal age, chronic hypertension, nulliparity, and neonatal sex (P<.001). In twin pregnancies, fetal growth was similar between pregnancies with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (P=.105 and P=.483 for unadjusted and adjusted models, respectively). The findings were similar to the association of gestational diabetes mellitus with the risk of large for gestational fetuses and the growth of each biometric index. When stratified by type of gestational diabetes mellitus treatment, twin pregnancies with gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with accelerated fetal growth only in the subgroup of women with medically treated gestational diabetes mellitus (P<.001), which represented 12% (n=21) of the twin pregnancy group with gestational diabetes mellitus. In contrast to singleton pregnancies, twin pregnancies with gestational diabetes mellitus is less likely to be associated with accelerated fetal growth. This finding has raised the question of whether the diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes mellitus and the blood glucose targets in women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus should be individualized for twin pregnancies.",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,2021-Oct,"Ashwal E, Berger H, Hiersch L, Yoon EW, Zaltz A, Shah B, Halperin I, Barrett J, Melamed N",9,3110,diabetes,2025-11-22
31775555,The Role of Physical Therapists in Fighting the Type 2 Diabetes Epidemic.,"In 2014, the total prevalence of diabetes was estimated to be 422 million people worldwide. Due to the aging population and continued increase in obesity rates, the prevalence is expected to rise to 592 million by 2035. Diabetes can lead to several complications, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, lower extremity amputation, and musculoskeletal impairments. Up to 80% of patients referred for outpatient physical therapy have diabetes or are at risk for diabetes, providing an opportunity for physical therapists to intervene. Therefore, we asked, ""What is the role of physical therapists in fighting the diabetes epidemic?"" Physical therapists commonly prescribe physical activity for the treatment of diabetes and other chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and osteoarthritis. Physical therapists may also screen for risk factors for diabetes and diabetes-related complications and modify traditional musculoskeletal exercise prescription accordingly. Physical therapists must advocate for regular physical activity as a key component of the treatment of chronic diseases in all patient interactions. This commentary (1) describes the diabetes epidemic and the health impact of diabetes and diabetes-related complications, (2) highlights the physical therapist's role as front-line provider, and (3) provides recommendations for physical therapists in screening for diabetes risk factors and diabetes-related complications and considerations for patient management.

Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) has been implicated in diabetic osteoporosis. We established streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model and examined the relevant osteoporosis factors in different experimental groups, the WT-CON group, WT-STZ group, KO-CON group and KO-STZ group, respectively. No obvious protection of TLR4 deletion was shown in mice with diabetes. There was no obvious difference in the body weight or blood glucose concentration between WT-STZ group and KO-STZ group. However, TLR4 deletion reduced the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation. Furthermore, TLR4 knockout attenuated STZ-induced diabetic osteoporosis via inhibiting osteoblasts and pre-inflammation factors mediated by the NF-κB pathway. TLR4 deletion ameliorated STZ-induced diabetic osteoporosis in mice, and TLR4 may be used as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of diabetic osteoporosis.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2021-Mar,"Cao Y, Han X, Wang Z, Liu Y, Wang Y, Zhang R, Ye J, Zou L, Dai W",9,1033,diabetes,2025-11-22

The impact of diabetes mellitus on outcome after CSR implantation is at present unknown. We aimed to explore the impact of CSR in refractory angina patients with diabetes mellitus. Data from consecutive patients undergoing CSR implantation at four different centres between 2014 and 2018 were included. Patients were divided according to the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. Primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate the clinical response to CSR implantation defined as an improvement of ≥ 1 classes of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Classification. A total of 219 patients were included, 116 (53%) of whom had diabetes mellitus. The median age of the population was 69 years and 167 patients (76%) were male. There were no significant differences between groups of patients with and without diabetes mellitus with respect to CCS class at baseline (p value = 0.32) and at follow-up (p = 0.75). Over a median follow-up of 393 [224-1004] days, 84 (72%) of the patients with diabetes mellitus met the primary outcome, similarly to those without diabetes mellitus (p = 0.28). Fifty-three patients (24%) did not have an improvement in CCS class and no one experienced worsening of angina.

As a proof-of-concept report, the goal of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the indirect non-thermal plasma (INTP) device in disinfecting polycarbonate filters established with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO1) biofilms as well as wound disinfection in diabetic murine wounds. Dorsal excisional wounds in BALB/c, polygenic TALLYHO, and monogenic db/db mice established with PAO1 infection all demonstrated a 3-log colony-forming unit (CFU) reduction when subjected to a course of 20-min INTP treatments. Importantly, blood glucose and body weights in these animals were not significantly impacted by plasma treatment over the study period. Plasma safety was also analyzed via complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panels, showing no deleterious systemic effects after 3 consecutive days of 20-min plasma applications. Therefore, the results obtained demonstrated the Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were highly sensitive to INTP in vitro, CFU reduction of infectious Pseudomonas in wounds of diabetic mice after INTP treatment is far superior to that of non-treated infected wounds, and the application of INTP shows no indication of toxic effects. Our results are consistent with indirect non-thermal atmospheric plasma as a promising adjunct to disinfecting wounds.","Shock (Augusta, Ga.)",2020-Nov,"Cooley CR, McLain JM, Dupuy SD, Eder AE, Wintenberg M, Kelly-Wintenberg K, Wintenberg A, Collier JJ, Burke SJ, Karlstad MD",10,1527,diabetes,2025-11-22
32196999,Prevalence of mild cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with serum galectin-3 level.,"Galectin-3 (Gal3) contributes to insulin resistance, inflammation and obesity, the three risk factors for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. A total of 134 hospitalized type 2 diabetes mellitus patients were assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment method, and divided into 65 MCI and 69 controls. Levels of variables, Gal3 and Aβ42, were investigated in relation with cognitive function in both type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with MCI and high-fat diet/streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetes mellitus rats. Significantly higher levels of serum Gal3 and lower levels of plasma Aβ42 (all P < 0.05) were found in the MCI type 2 diabetes mellitus group as compared with the non-MCI type 2 diabetes mellitus control. Partial correlation analysis showed that Gal3 is negatively correlated with both MMSE score (r = -0.51, P < 0.01) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment score (r = -0.47, P < 0.001) after adjustment for glycated hemoglobin, homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and Aβ42 in all type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, with a stronger effect seen in the MCI type 2 diabetes mellitus group after further analysis with MCI strata. A simple logistic regression model showed that Gal3 and Aβ42 are significantly associated with MCI type 2 diabetes mellitus patients after adjustment with the covariates sex, age, body mass index, glycated hemoglobin, homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and antidiabetic drugs. Serum and brain Gal3 levels were significantly increased in high-fat diet/streptozotocin diabetic rats, which correlate to the impairment of learning and memory ability. Gal3 inhibitor modified citrus pectin decreased serum and brain Gal3 levels in diabetic rats, accompanied by the amelioration of learning and memory impairment. Gal3 might be associated with cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and serum Gal3 level might be a new risk factor of MCI in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.",Journal of diabetes investigation,2020-Sep,"Ma S, Li S, Lv R, Hou X, Nie S, Yin Q",6,1985,diabetes,2025-11-22

The occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus in women is the strongest predictor of the development of type 2 diabetes in the future. A non-concurrent cohort and case-control study design and the guidelines for STROBE checklist were used for the study. We reviewed medical records for the time period from the archives of the hospitals. The short-listed women and their children were invited to participate in a 'Women with gestational diabetes mellitus' research activity from November 2012-February 2016. Blood tests, physiological indicators and demographic questionnaires were applied for data collection. A total of 57 women and 57 children participated in the research activity. The risk factors for progression of gestational diabetes mellitus to type 2 diabetes included education level and the 1-h blood glucose level for the antepartum 100-g oral glucose tolerance test and the 2-h blood glucose level for the postpartum 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. However, these risk factors did not have a significant impact on the body mass index and body fat of the women's children. Healthcare providers should adopt a breadth of health education strategies to remind women with gestational diabetes mellitus to be aware of certain risk factors, and to urge them and their children to return for regular follow-up visits.

Currently, the application of traditional therapeutic drugs for diabetes mellitus has great limitations and can only temporarily control blood glucose but not fundamentally cure it. Mesenchymal stem cells, as pluripotent stromal cells, have multidirectional differentiation potential, high self-renewal, immune regulation, and low immunogenicity, which provide a new idea and possible development direction for diabetes mellitus treatment. Regenerative medicine with mesenchymal stem cells treatment as the core treatment will become another treatment option for diabetes mellitus after traditional treatment. Recently, human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells have been widely used in basic and clinical research on diabetes mellitus and its complications because of their abundance, low ethical controversy, low risk of infection, and high proliferation and differentiation ability.

38013301,The essential role of glutamine metabolism in diabetic cardiomyopathy: A review.,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a pathophysiological condition caused by diabetes mellitus and is the leading cause of diabetes mellitus-related mortality. The pathophysiology of DCM involves various processes, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, ferroptosis, and abnormal protein modification. New evidence indicates that dysfunction of glutamine (Gln) metabolism contributes to the pathogenesis of DCM by regulating these pathophysiological mechanisms. Gln is a conditionally essential amino acid in the human body, playing a vital role in maintaining cell function. Although the precise molecular mechanisms of Gln in DCM have yet to be fully elucidated, recent studies have shown that supplementing with Gln improves cardiac function in diabetic hearts. However, excessive Gln may worsen myocardial injury in DCM by generating a large amount of glutamates or increasing O-GlcNacylation. To highlight the potential therapeutic method targeting Gln metabolism and its downstream pathophysiological mechanisms, this article aims to review the regulatory function of Gln in the pathophysiological mechanisms of DCM.",Medicine,2023-Nov,Zhang Y,1,1120,diabetes,2025-11-22
34416751,Controls of Hyperglycemia Improves Dysregulated Microbiota in Diabetic Mice.,"Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by T-cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing beta cells. Evidence shows that patients with T1DM and mice used in specific diabetic models both exhibit changes in their intestinal microbiota and dysregulated microbiota contributes to the pathogenesis of T1DM. Islet transplantation (Tx) is poised to play an important role in the treatment of T1DM. However, whether treatment of T1DM with islet Tx can rescue dysregulated microbiota remains unclear. In this study, we induced diabetic C57BL/6 mice with streptozotocin. Then treatment with either insulin administration, or homogenic or allogenic islet Tx was performed to the diabetic mice. Total DNA was isolated from fecal pellets and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing was used to investigate intestinal microbiota composition. The overall microbial diversity was comparable between control (nonstreptozotocin treated) and diabetic mice. Our results showed the ratio of the Bacteroidetes: Firmicutes between nondiabetic and diabetic mice was significant different. Treatment with islet Tx or insulin partially corrects the dysregulated bacterial composition. At the genus level, Bacteroides, Odoribacter, and Alistipes were associated with the progression and treatment efficacy of the disease, which may be used as a biomarker to predict curative effect of treatment for patients with T1DM.

35601149,Artemether Alleviates Diabetic Kidney Disease by Modulating Amino Acid Metabolism.,"Diabetes is a worldwide metabolic disease with rapid growing incidence, characterized by hyperglycemia. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), has a high morbidity according to the constantly increasing diabetic patients and always develops irreversible deterioration of renal function. Though different in pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and therapies, both type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can evolve into DKD. Since amino acids are both biomarkers and causal agents, rarely report has been made about its metabolism which lies in T1DM- and T2DM-related kidney disease. This study was designed to investigate artemether in adjusting renal amino acid metabolism in T1DM and T2DM mice. Artemether was applied as treatment in streptozotocin (STZ) induced T1DM mice and db/db T2DM mice, respectively. Artemether-treated mice showed lower FBG and HbA1c and reduced urinary albumin excretion, as well as urinary NAG. Both types of diabetic mice showed enlarged kidneys, as confirmed by increased kidney weight and the ratio of kidney weight to body weight. Artemether normalized kidney size and thus attenuated renal hypertrophy. Kidney tissue UPLC-MS analysis showed that branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) and citrulline were upregulated in diabetic mice without treatment and downregulated after being treated with artemether.

39613664,Pretransplant Diabetes Mellitus and Kidney Transplant Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Studies have shown that kidney transplantation is affected by pretransplant comorbidities. However, their impacts on mortality and graft loss remain inconsistent. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to collect data from multiple studies to analyze the impact of pretransplant diabetes mellitus on kidney transplant outcomes. We conducted comprehensive searches of the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases to identify studies that met the inclusion criteria. All-cause mortality and graft loss were compared between patients with pretransplant diabetes mellitus and patients without pretransplant diabetes mellitus. The impact of pretransplant diabetes mellitus was assessed using pooled hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. This meta-analysis included 103,983 kidney transplant recipients with diabetes mellitus and 271,667 kidney transplant recipients without diabetes mellitus. All-cause mortality was 68% (HR:1.68, 95% CI 1.65-1.71, P < .01) greater in patients with pretransplant diabetes mellitus than in patients without diabetes mellitus. Additionally, graft loss was 11% (HR:1.11, 95% CI 1.07-1.15, P < .01) greater in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients. The heterogeneity in the 2 analyses was very significant and meta-regression was used to determine the source of heterogeneity. Unfortunately, it was not found in the analysis of all-cause mortality. However, in the analysis of graft loss, sample size and median age at transplantation may be sources of high heterogeneity. Pretransplant diabetes mellitus is associated with increased risk of mortality and graft loss. However, due to significant heterogeneity and insufficient evidence, further studies are still needed to support our conclusions.",Transplantation proceedings,2024-Dec,"Liu C, Chen Q, Sun Z, Liang G, Yan F, Niu Y",6,1742,diabetes,2025-11-22
32096754,Exploring the Protective Effect of ShenQi Compound on Skeletal Muscle in Diabetic Macrovasculopathy Mice.,"ShenQi compound (SQC) is a traditional herbal formula, which has been used to treat Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and complications for years. The aim of this study was to explore the preventive and protective effects of SQC recipe on the skeletal muscle of diabetic macrovasculopathy mice, which provides a theoretical basis for the clinical use of this formula. We evaluated the effect of SQC in a diabetic vasculopathy mouse model by detecting a series of blood indicators (blood glucose, lipids and insulin) and performing histological observations. Meanwhile, we explored the molecular mechanism of SQC treatment on skeletal muscle by genome expression profiles. The results indicated that SQC could effectively improve blood glucose, serum lipids (total cholesterol (TC), Triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)) and insulin (INS) levels in diabetic vasculopathy mice, as well as alleviating skeletal muscle tissue damage for diabetic macrovasculopathy. Meanwhile, compared with rosiglitazone, SQC showed a better effect on blood glucose fluctuation. Moreover, the gene microarray analysis indicated that SQC might improve T2DM by affecting biological functions related to cell death and cell adhesion. Moreover, 7 genes (Celsr2, Rilpl1, Dlx6as, 2010004M13Rik, Anapc13, Gm6097, Ddx39b) might be potential therapeutic targets of SQC. All these results indicate that SQC is an effective preventive and protective drug for skeletal muscle in diabetic macrovasculopathy, and could alleviate skeletal muscle tissue damage through affecting biological functions related to cell death and cell adhesion.","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2020-,"Duan Y, Gao H, Su H, Liu A, Liu Y, Yuan H, Xie C",7,1676,diabetes,2025-11-22
34220706,COVID-19 and Diabetes: Understanding the Interrelationship and Risks for a Severe Course.,"The relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus is complicated and bidirectional. On the one hand, diabetes mellitus is considered one of the most important risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19. Several factors that are often present in diabetes mellitus are likely to contribute to this risk, such as older age, a proinflammatory and hypercoagulable state, hyperglycemia and underlying comorbidities (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and obesity). On the other hand, a severe COVID-19 infection, and its treatment with steroids, can have a specific negative impact on diabetes itself, leading to worsening of hyperglycemia through increased insulin resistance and reduced β-cell secretory function. Worsening hyperglycemia can, in turn, adversely affect the course of COVID-19.

33550691,Metformin as a potential protective therapy against tuberculosis in patients with diabetes mellitus: A retrospective cohort study in a single teaching hospital.,"The convergence of tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) is a new challenge in Asia as a result of the rising prevalence of diabetes mellitus with higher TB infection rates, and also because diabetes mellitus itself enhances TB disease activity and consequently the spread of TB. We aimed to address the risk presented by diabetes mellitus for TB infection. Patients with diabetes mellitus were retrospectively recruited. The baseline assessments included age, sex, body mass index, fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate. TB was determined by meeting the international classification of disease, for TB diagnosis and receiving anti-TB treatment for at least 2 months. In total, 9,750 individuals with diabetes mellitus were recruited. The event rate of TB was 47 (0.48%). Younger age, lower proportion of men, higher fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin values, and better renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio) were observed in the metformin-exposed groups. Old age and male sex were associated with higher TB infection risk on multivariate analysis. Metformin users had a significantly lower risk for TB infection, whereas insulin users had a higher risk for TB infection. However, glycemic status had no effect on TB infection risk. This study provides clinical evidence from a survey of TB in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Old age, male sex and insulin use were risk factors for TB infection. Metformin remains the first choice of treatment for diabetes mellitus and has a potential protective effect against TB infection.",Journal of diabetes investigation,2021-Sep,"Fu CP, Lee CL, Li YH, Lin SY",4,1682,diabetes,2025-11-22
33042003,Ghrelin Protects Against Insulin-Induced Hypoglycemia in a Mouse Model of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Insulin-induced hypoglycemia is a major limiting factor in maintaining optimal blood glucose in patients with type 1 diabetes and advanced type 2 diabetes. Luckily, a counterregulatory response (1) system exists to help minimize and reverse hypoglycemia, although more studies are needed to better characterize its components. Recently, we showed that the hormone ghrelin is permissive for the normal CRR to insulin-induced hypoglycemia when assessed in mice without diabetes. Here, we tested the hypothesis that ghrelin also is protective against insulin-induced hypoglycemia in the streptozotocin (2) mouse model of type 1 diabetes. STZ-treated ghrelin-knockout (KO) (3) mice as well as STZ-treated wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to a low-dose hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp procedure. The STZ-treated ghrelin-KO mice required a much higher glucose infusion rate than the STZ-treated WT mice. Also, the STZ-treated ghrelin-KO mice exhibited attenuated plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine responses to the insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Taken together, our data suggest that without ghrelin, STZ-treated mice modeling type 1 diabetes are unable to mount the usual CRR to insulin-induced hypoglycemia.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2020-,"Shankar K, Gupta D, Mani BK, Findley BG, Osborne-Lawrence S, Metzger NP, Liu C, Berglund ED, Zigman JM",9,1218,diabetes,2025-11-22
32342452,Exercise and Type 2 Diabetes.,"The epidemic of diabetes mellitus has already become a serious global health threat. In the past three decades, the number of people with diabetes mellitus has quadrupled globally, and diabetes mellitus is known as the ninth major cause of death in the world nowadays. The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is in coincidence with the augmentation of obesity in most developed countries as well as in developing countries. A sedentary lifestyle is well-known as one of the major reasons for the rising epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus besides the other reasons such as adopting energy-dense diets relative to the actual need for energy and population aging. Exercise as a regular physical activity at a medium to vigorous intensity is found to be an efficient influencer that would switch back most of the known type 2 diabetes mellitus factors toward healthier positions. Exercise is proven to have clinical benefits, such as improved insulin sensitivity, reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) and increased peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>peak) which are definitely preventive toward diabetes. Exercise training can favorably affect glycemic parameters, the lipid profile, blood pressure, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Exercise improves blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes, reduces cardiovascular risk factors, and regulates body weight by reducing body fat percentage and enhancing lean mass. In this chapter, the effect of regular exercise on the prevention of diabetes and short-term glucose and energy metabolism will be discussed. In addition, the effect of exercise on most common complications of type 2 diabetes including cardiovascular diseases, dyslipidemia, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy will be reviewed.",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2020-,"Amanat S, Ghahri S, Dianatinasab A, Fararouei M, Dianatinasab M",5,1777,diabetes,2025-11-22
33188364,COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus: from pathophysiology to clinical management.,"Initial studies found increased severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in patients with diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, COVID-19 might also predispose infected individuals to hyperglycaemia. Interacting with other risk factors, hyperglycaemia might modulate immune and inflammatory responses, thus predisposing patients to severe COVID-19 and possible lethal outcomes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), is the main entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2; although dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) might also act as a binding target. Preliminary data, however, do not suggest a notable effect of glucose-lowering DPP4 inhibitors on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Owing to their pharmacological characteristics, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors might cause adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 and so cannot be recommended. Currently, insulin should be the main approach to the control of acute glycaemia. Most available evidence does not distinguish between the major types of diabetes mellitus and is related to type 2 diabetes mellitus owing to its high prevalence. However, some limited evidence is now available on type 1 diabetes mellitus and COVID-19. Most of these conclusions are preliminary, and further investigation of the optimal management in patients with diabetes mellitus is warranted.",Nature reviews.

32994121,β-cell replenishment: Possible curative approaches for diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a disorder of heterogeneous etiology marked by persistent hyperglycemia. Exogenous insulin is the only treatment for type 1 diabetes (T1D). Islet transplantation is a potential long cure for T1D but is disapproved due to the possibility of immune rejection in the later stage. The approaches used for treating type 2 diabetes (T2D) include diet restrictions, weight management and pharmacological interventions. These procedures have not been able to boost the quality of life for diabetic patients owing to the complexity of the disorder. Hence, research has embarked on permanent ways of managing, or even curing the disease. One of the possible approaches to restore the pancreas with new glucose-responsive β-cells is by their regeneration. Regeneration of β-cells include islet neogenesis, dedifferentiation, and trans-differentiation of the already differentiated cells. This review briefly describes the islet development, functions of β-cells, mechanism and factors involved in β-cell death. It further elaborates on the potential of the existing and possible therapeutic modalities involved in the in-vivo replenishment of β-cells with a focus on exercise, diet, hormones, small molecules, and phytochemicals.","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2020-Oct,"Rathwa N, Patel R, Palit SP, Parmar N, Rana S, Ansari MI, Ramachandran AV, Begum R",8,1244,diabetes,2025-11-22

Structured questionnaires consisting of 12 different statements on the knowledge base of oral manifestations of diabetes mellitus were distributed to 447 Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Following this oral examination, brushing and dental visit history were noted, and CPI index and DMFT indices were recorded in all the patients. Results showed that the knowledge about oral manifestations of diabetes mellitus was poor with a mean value of 4.92 out of a possible score of 12. Among the study subjects, the average score of men was 4.42 while that of females, was 5.41. These scores, when subjected to statistical analysis, were highly significant. (P value- 0.005) Subjects also showed significantly high DMFT (P value <0.001) and CPI scores (P value- 0.270).

35672599,A stronger association of diabetes mellitus with impaired hyperaemia using a novel ECG-gated device compared with peripheral arterial tonometry.,"Impaired digital reactive hyperaemia and flicker-stimulated retinal vascular response are commonly reported risk markers of cardiovascular disease. This is the first study to determine the correlation of these risk markers with diabetes mellitus by comparing our novel flicker-modulated ECG-gated fundoscope with the EndoPAT2000 system. In total, 119 controls and 120 participants with diabetes mellitus partook in this cross-sectional study. The EndoPAT2000 system assessed digital reactive hyperaemia under fasting conditions. A mydriatic ECG-gated fundoscope with a novel flicker module acquired digital retinal images of the left eye before, during and after flicker stimulation. An inhouse semi-automated software measured retinal vessel diameters using a validated protocol with two observers repeating measurements in a subset of 10 controls and 10 participants with diabetes mellitus. Intra- and inter-observer reliability analyses occurred by the interclass correlation coefficient. A receiver operating characteristic curve established associations of variables with diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus was more strongly associated with flicker-stimulated retinal arteriolar calibre change from baseline (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.75-0.87, p < 0.0001) than reactive hyperaemia index. Median flicker-stimulated arteriolar calibre change from baseline (controls: 2.74%, IQR 1.07 vs diabetes mellitus: 1.64%, IQR 1.25, p < 0.0001) and reactive hyperaemia index (controls: 1.87, IQR 0.81 vs diabetes mellitus: 1.60, IQR 0.81, p = 0.003) were lower in diabetes mellitus than controls. Intra- and inter-observer reliability coefficients were high from 0.87 to 0.93.

34233930,Profile of Podocyte Translatome During Development of Type 2 and Type 1 Diabetic Nephropathy Using Podocyte-Specific TRAP mRNA RNA-seq.,"Podocyte injury is important in development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Although several studies have reported single-cell-based RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of podocytes in type 1 DN (T1DN), the podocyte translating mRNA profile in type 2 DN (T2DN) has not previously been compared with that of T1DN. We analyzed the podocyte translatome in T2DN in podocin-Cre; Rosa26<sup>fsTRAP</sup>; eNOS<sup>-/-</sup>; <i>db/db</i> mice and compared it with that of streptozotocin-induced T1DN in podocin-Cre; Rosa26<sup>fsTRAP</sup>; eNOS<sup>-/-</sup> mice using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) and RNA-seq. More than 125 genes were highly enriched in the podocyte ribosome. More podocyte TRAP genes were differentially expressed in T2DN than in T1DN. TGF-β signaling pathway genes were upregulated, while MAPK pathway genes were downregulated only in T2DN, while ATP binding and cAMP-mediated signaling genes were downregulated only in T1DN. Genes regulating actin filament organization and apoptosis increased, while genes regulating VEGFR signaling and glomerular basement membrane components decreased in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic podocytes. A number of diabetes-induced genes not previously linked to podocyte injury were confirmed in both mouse and human DN. On the basis of differences and similarities in the podocyte translatome in T2DN and T1DN, investigators can identify factors underlying the pathophysiology of DN and novel therapeutic targets to treat diabetes-induced podocyte injury.",Diabetes,2021-Oct,"Wang Y, Niu A, Pan Y, Cao S, Terker AS, Wang S, Fan X, Toth CL, Ramirez Solano MA, Michell DL, Contreras D, Allen RM, Zhu W, Sheng Q, Fogo AB, Vickers KC, Zhang MZ, Harris RC",18,1513,diabetes,2025-11-22

However, the underlying mechanisms remain partially elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effect of baicalein on protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK)/nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway for the alleviation of oxidative stress and apoptosis. Human liver HL-7702 cells were stimulated with 60.5 mM of glucose to induce oxidative stress and treated with baicalein. The apoptosis was determined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. The regulation of the PERK/Nrf2 pathway by baicalein was determined by immunoblotting in both HL-7702 cells and liver tissues from diabetic mice. We found that baicalein significantly alleviated the oxidative stress and apoptosis in HL-7702 cells stimulated with glucose. Mechanistic studies showed that baicalein downregulated PERK and upregulated Nrf2, two key proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress, in both HL-7702 cells and liver tissues from diabetic mice receiving baicalein treatment. Furthermore, the subcellular localization of Nrf2 and the regulation of downstream proteins including heme oxygenase-1 and CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) by baicalein were also investigated. Our results suggest that the regulation of the PERK/Nrf2 pathway is one of the mechanisms contributing to the bioactivities of baicalein to improve diabetes-associated complications.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2020-Jan,"Dong Y, Xing Y, Sun J, Sun W, Xu Y, Quan C",6,1488,diabetes,2025-11-22
39420751,Gut microbial metabolic signatures in diabetes mellitus and potential preventive and therapeutic applications.,"Diabetes mellitus can be subdivided into several categories based on origin and clinical characteristics. The most common forms of diabetes are type 1 (T1D), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). T1D and T2D are chronic diseases affecting around 537 million adults worldwide and it is projected that these numbers will increase by 12% over the next two decades, while GDM affects up to 30% of women during pregnancy, depending on diagnosis methods. These forms of diabetes have varied origins: T1D is an autoimmune disease, while T2D is commonly associated with, but not limited to, certain lifestyle patterns and GDM can result of a combination of genetic predisposition and pregnancy factors. Despite some pathogenic differences among these forms of diabetes, there are some common markers associated with their development. For instance, gut barrier impairment and inflammation associated with an unbalanced gut microbiota and their metabolites may be common factors in diabetes development and progression. Here, we summarize the microbial signatures that have been linked to diabetes, how they are connected to diet and, ultimately, the impact on metabolite profiles resulting from host-gut microbiota-diet interactions. Additionally, we summarize recent advances relating to promising preventive and therapeutic interventions focusing on the targeted modulation of the gut microbiota to alleviate T1D, T2D and GDM.",Gut microbes,2024-,"Garcia-Gutierrez E, O'Mahony AK, Dos Santos RS, Marroquí L, Cotter PD",5,1445,diabetes,2025-11-22

However, there are inconsistent findings regarding the impact of AT use on the risk of diabetes mellitus in humans. We examined the association between AT and incident diabetes mellitus using classical and Bayesian meta-analysis. We searched Pubmed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar for studies listed from database inception to 25 February 2022. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies reporting associations of estrogen therapy (ET) and non-estrogen anti-resorptive therapy (NEAT) with incident diabetes mellitus were included. Two reviewers independently extracted research data such as ET and NEAT, diabetes mellitus, risk ratios (RRs), and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for incident diabetes mellitus associated with ET and NEAT from individual studies. This meta-analysis included data from nineteen original studies, consisting of fourteen ET and five NEAT studies. ET was associated with reduced risk of diabetes mellitus in the classical meta-analysis (RR: 0.90; 95 % CI: 0.81-0.99). Slightly stronger results were found in the meta-analysis of RCTs (RR: 0.83; 95 % CI: 0.77-0.89). The probability that RR < 1.0 was 95 % in the overall analysis and 99 % in RCTs under weakly informative prior. Although NEAT was associated with reduced risk of diabetes mellitus overall (RR: 0.80; 95 % CI: 0.67-0.97), this was not found in the RCT meta-analysis (RR: 0.90; 95 % CI: 0.75-1.10). Under weakly informative prior, the probabilities that NEAT reduces diabetes mellitus by >0 % were 99 %, and 73 % in the overall and RCT meta-analysis, respectively. In conclusion, meta-analysis provided consistent evidence against the hypothesis that AT increases diabetes risk. ET may reduce the risk of diabetes mellitus.

33439743,Metformin ameliorates ROS-p53-collagen axis of fibrosis and dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus-induced left ventricular injury.,"The link between oxidative stress (ROS), apoptosis (p53) and fibrosis (collagen) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-induced cardiac injury in the presence and absence of the antidiabetic drug, metformin has not been investigated before. T2DM was induced in rats by a combination of high carbohydrate and fat diets (HCFD) and streptozotocin (50 mg/kg) injection. The protection group started metformin (200 mg/kg) treatment 14 days prior to the induction of diabetes and continued on metformin and HCFD until being sacrificed at week 12. Diabetes significantly induced blood levels of ROS and left ventricular p53 and collagen expression that was inhibited by metformin. Metformin also significantly reduced glycated haemoglobin and dyslipidemia induced by diabetes. In addition, a significant correlation between ROS-p53-collagen axis and glycaemia and hyperlipidaemia was observed. These findings show that metformin provides substantial protection against diabetic cardiomyopathy-induced ROS-p53 mediated fibrosis and dyslipidemia.",Archives of physiology and biochemistry,2023-Jun,"Al-Ani B, Alzamil NM, Hewett PW, Al-Hashem F, Bin-Jaliah I, Shatoor AS, Kamar SS, Latif NSA, Haidara MA, Dawood AF",10,1033,diabetes,2025-11-22
33021114,Protective effects of quercetin and crocin in the kidneys and liver of obese Sprague-Dawley rats with Type 2 diabetes: Effects of quercetin and crocin on T2DM rats.,"Quercetin and crocin are the main active constituents of Eucommia and Gardenia species, respectively. This study was conducted to explore the effects of quercetin and crocin on fat reduction and renal fibrosis and the relationship of these compounds with autophagy. First, a model of high-fat diet- and streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetes was established and then subjected model animals to 8 weeks of metformin, quercetin and crocin gavage. Then, a high glucose-induced rat mesangial cells (RMCs) model was established, and these cells were cocultured with quercetin and crocin. The results showed that quercetin and crocin can decrease fasting blood glucose levels, reduce fat accumulation in the liver, alleviate renal fibrosis, and reduce blood lipid levels. Quercetin and crocin increased autophagy-related protein (LC3, Atg5, Beclin-1 and p-AMPK) levels in the liver and decreased autophagy-related protein (LC3, Atg5, Beclin-1 and p-AMPK) levels in the kidneys. Moreover, quercetin and crocin inhibited the excessive proliferation of RMCs induced by high-glucose (HG) conditions, decreased autophagy-related protein (LC3, Atg5, Beclin-1 and p-AMPK) levels, and decreased TGF-β1 expression. Importantly, cotreatment with quercetin and crocin had a more significant effect than treatment with either compound alone. These results suggest that combined administration of quercetin and crocin can more significantly reduce blood glucose/lipid levels and improve renal fibrosis than administration of either compound alone and that AMPK-dependent autophagy might be involved in this process. <i>Eucommia ulmoides</i> Oliv. and <i>Gardenia</i> could be developed as drugs for Type 2 diabetes treatment.",Human & experimental toxicology,2021-Apr,"Lai LL, Lu HQ, Li WN, Huang HP, Zhou HY, Leng EN, Zhang YY",7,1706,diabetes,2025-11-22

Circadian disturbances are associated with the onset, progression and severity of diabetes mellitus. We conducted a literature survey using the key terms - circadian, diabetes, circadian and diabetes, clock genes and diabetes, chronotherapy and peripheral clocks in science direct, PubMed, Google, and Embase till August 23, 2021. Misalignment between peripheral clocks located in pancreas, intestine, liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle and with the central oscillator alters the secretion of insulin, incretins, adipokines and soluble factors resulting in the derangement of metabolism leading to chronic hyperglycemia. Management of circadian health restores glucose homeostasis confirming that chronotherapy will help in the management of diabetes mellitus. Further, administration of circadian clock modifiers has proved potential therapeutic agents to treat diabetes mellitus. The aim of the review is to highlight the molecular mechanisms linking biological clock and diabetes mellitus and how they are useful for effective management of the disease.",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2022-Nov,"Sankaranarayanan C, Subramanian P",2,1177,diabetes,2025-11-22
38313111,"Identifying Adult Population at Risk for Undiagnosed Diabetes Mellitus in Medan City, Indonesia Targeted on Diabetes Prevention.","Diabetes mellitus is a health problem in Indonesia, where its prevalence rises annually. The condition may negatively impact one's quality of life and lead to significant complications-over 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the most common diabetes type worldwide. To implement diabetic prevention interventions and achieve effective diabetes mellitus control, screening for undiagnosed diabetes mellitus in high-risk populations is essential. This study aimed to identify people at risk for undiagnosed diabetes mellitus using the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). This cross-sectional study was carried out, which involved 300 people in Medan City between the ages of 30-75. The study was conducted between July 14 and October 20, 2020. The Finnish Diabetes Risk Score and anthropometric measurements (weight, height, and waist circumference) were used to evaluate each respondent. Low, medium, and high-risk outcome categories were created. All responders underwent oral glucose tolerance tests, with results classified as normal, prediabetes, or diabetes. The Chi-square test was used to examine the data and identify potential risk variables for diabetes mellitus. Of 300 individuals, 91.7% were female, and 8.3% were male. 33.7% of participants had a low risk of acquiring diabetes, 55.0% had an intermediate risk, and 11.3% had a high risk. 70% of participants who took an oral glucose tolerance test had blood glucose levels that were normal (less than 100 mg/dl), 18.7% had blood glucose levels suggestive of prediabetes (between 100 and 125 mg/dl), and 11.3% had blood glucose levels suggestive of diabetes (126 mg/dl or higher). Ages 54 to 64 years and older, high body mass index and central obesity, a lack of vegetables and fruits in the daily diet, inactivity, uncontrolled hypertension, a history of hyperglycemia, and a family history of diabetes were all linked to a significant increase in the risk of developing diabetes. Most respondents at low risk of developing type 2 diabetes had normal blood sugar levels, while those at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes had high blood glucose levels (p = 0.005). Oral glucose tolerance testing and the FINDRISC questionnaire may be used to identify individuals who are at high risk for developing diabetes and to encourage them to adopt healthy behaviours.","Medical archives (Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina)",2023-,"Siregar FA, Asfriyati, Makmur T, Bestari R, Lubis IA, Zein U",6,2381,diabetes,2025-11-22
32653635,Economic cost of diabetes in the Eastern Mediterranean region countries: A meta-analysis.,"Non communicable diseases including diabetes imposes substantial financial burden on households, societies and nations in both developed and developing countries. However, there is no information on the extent of diabetes expenditure in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMRO). Therefore, this study aimed to identify the treatment costs of diabetes in this area. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on treatment expenditures of diabetes in EMRO countries. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS and WEB OF SCIENCES databases to find out published manuscripts on treatment cost of diabetes. Information was extracted using data extraction sheets and then the data were imported into STATA software version.11. Mean annual treatment cost of diabetes per patient, annual treatment costs of diabetes per patient by Diabetes Mellitus (DM) complications and finally, cost of chronic diabetes complications per patient were pooled and reported. After reviewing title, abstract and the full text of identified articles; a total of seven studies were reported appropriate data for this meta-analysis. The pooled annual treatment cost per diabetes patient for EMRO countries was 1150 US$ (95% CI: 595-2221) which was 3358 US$ (95% CI: 2200-5124) in EMRO countries except of Iran compared to 255 US$ (92-708) in Iran. The treatment cost of diabetes was higher in males, insulin-used and in the patient with family history of diabetes. The cost of diabetes was significantly increased with the duration of diabetes (P = 0.001) as well. According to the results, the largest share of costs is related to medication costs. Finally, the pooled average annual treatment cost per patient by diabetes mellitus complications was varied from 2828 US$ in the patients that have cerebrovascular disease complication to 7261 US$ in the patients with Stroke complication. This study demonstrated that the annual treatment cost of diabetes is varied within EMRO countries. Qatar and Iran have spent the highest and lowest cost for diabetes, respectively. This may be due to the large socioeconomic differences between countries and special conditions of them such as currency value in the region.",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2020-,"Ansari-Moghaddam A, Setoodehzadeh F, Khammarnia M, Adineh HA",4,2234,diabetes,2025-11-22
32176740,Glycemic control and fetal growth of women with diabetes mellitus and subsequent hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.,"Pregnant women with diabetes mellitus (DM) are at high risk for hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP). Women with poor control DM sometimes have heavy-for-dates infants. However, women with HDP sometimes have light-for-dates infants. We aim to clarify the relationship between glycemic control and fetal growth in women with DM and/or subsequent HDP. Of 7893 women gave singleton birth at or after 22 gestational weeks, we enrolled 154 women with type 1 DM (T1DM) or type 2 DM (T2DM) whose infants did not have fetal abnormalities. Among women with T1DM or T2DM, characteristics of the three groups (with HDP, without HDP, and with chronic hypertension [CH]) were compared. No women with T1DM had CH, but 19 (17.4%) of 109 with T2DM did. HDP incidence was similar between women with T1DM (22.2%) and T2DM without CH (16.7%). Among women with T1DM, the incidences of fetal growth restriction (FGR) with and without HDP were similar. However, among women with T2DM without CH, this incidence was significantly higher among those with HDP (33.3%) than among those without HDP (5.3%), was significantly more common with HbA1c levels at first trimester ≥ 7.2% (33.3%) than with those < 7.2% (5.6%), and significantly more numerous without pre-pregnancy therapies for DM (23.3%) than with them (3.3%). Among women with T2DM and HDP, those with FGR had smaller placenta SDs and higher insulin dosages at delivery than those without light-for-dates. In multivariate analysis, the presence of diabetic nephropathy was a predictor of T1DM and HDP (P = 0.0105), whereas HbA1c levels ≥ 7.2% before pregnancy was a predictor of T2DM and HDP (P = 0.0009). Insulin dosage ≥ 50U/day at delivery (P = 0.0297) and the presence of HDP (P = 0.0116) independently predicted T2DM, HDP, and FGR development. Insufficient pre-pregnancy treatment of DM increased the risk of HDP.",PloS one,2020-,"Morikawa M, Kato-Hirayama E, Mayama M, Saito Y, Nakagawa K, Umazume T, Chiba K, Kawaguchi S, Okuyama K, Watari H",10,1857,diabetes,2025-11-22
39675543,Arsenic exposure accelerates type 1 diabetes mellitus progression via pyroptosis pathway in mice.,"The relationship between arsenic exposure and the development of diabetes mellitus has garnered significant interest in recent years. However, current experimental studies have not definitively established the role of arsenic in the onset of diabetes mellitus. To investigate this relationship specifically concerning type 1 diabetes mellitus, Streptozocin (STZ) was utilized as an inducer to initiate the fundamental pathological changes associated with the disease. A high dose of STZ (50 mg/kg) served as the positive control, while a low dose of STZ (20 mg/kg) was administered in combination with arsenic at varying doses. The objective was to determine whether arsenic enhances the effects of STZ, thereby leading to an expedited onset and progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The preliminary investigation into the impact of arsenic exposure on experimental type 1 diabetic mice focused on the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD mediated pyroptosis pathway. The results showed that fasting blood glucose (FBG) was increased, glucose tolerance was impaired, insulin sensitivity was decreased, fasting serum insulin and the homeostatic model assessment-β (HOMA-β) were significantly reduced, hair arsenic content was increased, reactive oxygen species(ROS), interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 contents were increased, and the pathological morphology of pancreas was more serious in the combined group. Moreover, the expression levels of proteins associated with the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis pathway were elevated in the combined group. This study illustrates that exposure to arsenic, combined with low-dose STZ, not only leads to pancreatic injury in mice, impacting insulin secretion and causing elevated blood glucose levels, thereby hastening the progression of type 1 diabetes, but also induces pyroptosis in pancreatic tissues by influencing the NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD signaling pathway, further facilitating the development of type 1 diabetes.",Chemico-biological interactions,2025-Jan,"Lei L, Chen M, Qin C, Cai L, Liang B",5,1957,diabetes,2025-11-22
35657281,Diagnosis and Management of Monogenic Diabetes in Pregnancy.,"Monogenic diabetes occurs in up to 3% of people with diabetes. Mutations in over 40 different genes are responsible. The most common genes affected are HNF1A, HNF4A, GCK, and HNF1B. Additionally, other types of diabetes with a genetic aetiology include neonatal diabetes and diabetes plus syndrome. Each of these genetic subtypes has a different phenotype and requires distinctive treatments. Due to the overlap of monogenic diabetes with type 1 and 2 diabetes and even gestational diabetes, they can often be misdiagnosed. During pregnancy, individual subtypes require treatment that is different from standard diabetes care, so recognition and prompt diagnosis of monogenic diabetes are important to avoid inadequate treatment. We describe the management of monogenic diabetes for the most significant subtypes, focussing on the impact on and management in pregnancy. A genetic diagnosis of diabetes can alter long-term treatment in those with diabetes. In pregnancy and the postnatal period, this can involve specific management changes determined by the gene affected and whether there is a fetal inheritance of the gene. Where inheritance of the genotype influences the outcomes, cell-free fetal testing will hopefully soon become a diagnostic tool for early recognition of fetal mutations.",Current diabetes reviews,2023-,"Edensor S, Jones O, Chakera AJ",3,1295,diabetes,2025-11-22
34631896,Clinical and Genetic Characteristics of <i>ABCC8</i> Nonneonatal Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major chronic metabolic disease in the world, and the prevalence has been increasing rapidly in recent years. The channel of K<sub>ATP</sub> plays an important role in the regulation of insulin secretion. The variants in <i>ABCC8</i> gene encoding the SUR1 subunit of K<sub>ATP</sub> could cause a variety of phenotypes, including neonatal diabetes mellitus (<i>ABCC8-</i>NDM) and <i>ABCC8</i>-induced nonneonatal diabetes mellitus (<i>ABCC8</i>-NNDM). Since the features of <i>ABCC8</i>-NNDM have not been elucidated, this study is aimed at concluding the genetic features and clinical characteristics. We comprehensively reviewed the literature associated with <i>ABCC8</i>-NNDM in the following databases: MEDLINE, PubMed, and Web of Science to investigate the features of <i>ABCC8</i>-NNDM. Based on a comprehensive literature search, we found that 87 probands with <i>ABCC8</i>-NNDM carried 71 <i>ABCC8</i> genetic variant alleles, 24% of whom carried inactivating variants, 24% carried activating variants, and the remaining 52% carried activating or inactivating variants. Nine of these variants were confirmed to be activating or inactivating through functional studies, while four variants (p.R370S, p.E1506K, p.R1418H, and p.R1420H) were confirmed to be inactivating. The phenotypes of <i>ABCC8</i>-NNDM were variable and could also present with early hyperinsulinemia followed by reduced insulin secretion, progressing to diabetes later. They had a relatively high risk of microvascular complications and low prevalence of nervous disease, which is different from <i>ABCC8-</i>NDM. Genetic testing is essential for proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment for patients with <i>ABCC8</i>-NNDM. And further studies are required to determine the complex mechanism of the variants of <i>ABCC8</i>-NNDM.",Journal of diabetes research,2021-,"Li M, Han X, Ji L",3,1839,diabetes,2025-11-22
33438543,"Outcomes of Clinical Treatments Among Patients with Diabetes Mellitus in Selangor, Malaysia: A Retrospective Study.","It is important to assess how well patients respond to their medical treatments by observing the results that appear during the clinical treatments. As such, the clinical treatments and results must obtain information on how effective recommended treatments were for patients with diabetes. This study examines how patients with diabetes mellitus responded towards their clinical treatments, where the probability distribution of patients and the types of treatment received were derived from the Rasch probabilistic model. This is a retrospective study wherein data were collected from patients' medical records at a local public hospital in Selangor, Malaysia. Clinical and demographic information such as fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), family history, type of diabetes (type 1 or type 2), types of medication (oral or insulin), compliance with treatments, gender, race and age were chosen as the agents of measurement. The use of Rasch analysis in the present study helped to compare the patients' responses towards the DM treatments and identify the types of treatment they received. Results from the Wright map show that a majority of the diabetes mellitus patients who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes have no controlled readings of HbA1c during their first and second visits to the medical center. However, patients with a family history of diabetes mellitus who took oral medication have controlled readings of fasting blood glucose based on the probabilistic outcomes of the treatment received by the patients. Controlled readings were found only in the readings of fasting blood glucose during the first and second visits, followed by family history, types of medication received, and compliance with the treatment. This study has recommended that type 2 patients with diabetes without a family history of diabetes mellitus need to exercise more control over the readings of HbA1c.",Current diabetes reviews,2021-,"Mahmud Z, Abrahhim SA, Sulong S",3,1910,diabetes,2025-11-22
37927197,Neurological and metabolic related pathophysiologies and treatment of comorbid diabetes with depression.,"The comorbidity between diabetes mellitus and depression was revealed, and diabetes mellitus increased the prevalence of depressive disorder, which ranked 13th in the leading causes of disability-adjusted life-years. Insulin resistance, which is common in diabetes mellitus, has increased the risk of depressive symptoms in both humans and animals. However, the mechanisms behind the comorbidity are multi-factorial and complicated. There is still no causal chain to explain the comorbidity exactly. Moreover, Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, insulin and metformin, which are recommended for treating diabetes mellitus-induced depression, were found to be a risk factor in some complications of diabetes. Given these problems, many researchers made remarkable efforts to analyze diabetes complicating depression from different aspects, including insulin resistance, stress and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal axis, neurological system, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Drug therapy, such as Hydrogen Sulfide, Cannabidiol, Ascorbic Acid and Hesperidin, are conducive to alleviating diabetes mellitus and depression. Here, we reviewed the exact pathophysiology underlying the comorbidity between depressive disorder and diabetes mellitus and drug therapy. The review refers to the available literature in PubMed and Web of Science, searching critical terms related to diabetes mellitus, depression and drug therapy. In this review, we found that brain structure and function, neurogenesis, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and glucose and lipid metabolism were involved in the pathophysiology of the comorbidity. Obesity might lead to diabetes mellitus and depression through reduced adiponectin and increased leptin and resistin. In addition, drug therapy displayed in this review could expand the region of potential therapy. The review summarizes the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity.

32566683,Function of Adenosine 2A Receptor in High-Fat Diet-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy.,"Peripheral diabetic neuropathy (DPN) is a complication observed in up to half of all patients with type 2 diabetes. DPN has also been shown to be associated with obesity. High-fat diet (HFD) affects glucose metabolism, and the impaired glucose tolerance can lead to type 2 diabetes. There is evidence to suggest a role of adenosine 2A receptors (A2ARs) and semaphorin 3A (Sema3a) signaling in DPN. The link between the expression of Sema3a and A2AR in DPN was hypothesized, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the regulation of Sema3a by A2AR in the spinal cord and the functional implications thereof in DPN. We examined the expression of A2ARs and Sema3a, as well as Neuropilin 1 and Plexin A, the coreceptors of Sema3a, in the dorsal horn of the lumbar spinal cord of an animal model with HFD-induced diabetes. Our results demonstrate that HFD dysregulates the A2AR-mediated Sema3a expression, with functional implications for the type 2 diabetes-induced peripheral neuropathy.

38382166,Current status of diabetes mellitus care and management in the Philippines.,"In this paper, we discuss the existing data on the burden of diabetes in the Philippines and present the status of management, prevention, and control of diabetes in the country. A review of literature was conducted to synthesize the status of diabetes mellitus in the Philippines. An estimated 4.3 million Filipinos were diagnosed with diabetes, while 2.8 million remained undiagnosed in 2021. Diabetic retinopathy is a top cause of preventable blindness in Region 3, Philippines. Diabetic nephropathy contributes to 38% of renal disease cases in the Philippines. The 2021 Philippine Guidelines on Periodic Health Examination (PhEX) advocate for the utilization of fasting blood sugar (FBS) as a screening measure for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in healthy adults aged 40 years and older or in those with specified risk factors. The alternative option of hemoglobin A1c is (HbA1c) deemed appropriate but comes with a conditional recommendation due to its uneven accessibility across different regions of the country. Treatment guidelines align between the Philippines and the US. Initial medical nutrition therapy involves healthy habits, progressing to pharmacologic treatment if necessary. Financial constraints, seen in limited insurance coverage and high out-of-pocket costs, impede care, amplifying disease impact. The complex diabetes care, encompassing pharmacotherapy, nutrition, exercise, and monitoring, faced challenges during COVID-19 quarantines.

Herein, we synthesize a collagen based hybrid scaffold incorporated with a silica-resorcinol composite and cross-linked with an oxidized fenugreek seed polysaccharide to stimulate scar-less healing in chronic wounds with type-I diabetes and microbial infection. The spectroscopic analyses of the hybrid scaffolds reveal the chemical and structural integrity of collagen. The hybrid scaffolds are shown to be appropriate for in vivo tissue regeneration through cytocompatibility and hemocompatibility studies. Scaffolds were applied to diabetic albino rats induced with chronically infected burn wounds with respective controls. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses of the granulation tissue collected from the hybrid scaffold treated animal groups showed improved angiogenesis, reepithelialization and TGF-β3 expression, which eventually led to scar-less wound healing.

We evaluated the rate of complications in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients, and patients without diabetes in the 30-day postoperative period following ankle fracture surgery. We also analyzed hospital length of stay, unplanned readmission, unplanned reoperation, and death. Patients who underwent operative management for ankle fractures between 2012 and 2016 were identified in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program® database using Current Procedural Terminology codes. Multiple logistic regression was implemented. Adjusted odds ratios were calculated along with the 95% confidence interval. A total of 19,547 patients undergoing ankle surgery were identified from 2012 to 2016. Of these patients, 989 (5.06%) had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 1256 (6.43%) had noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and 17,302 (88.51%) did not have diabetes mellitus. Compared to patients without diabetes, patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus had significantly greater adjusted odds of superficial surgical site infections, deep surgical site infections, osteomyelitis, wound dehiscence, pneumonia, unplanned intubation, mechanical ventilation, urinary tract infection, cardiac arrest, bleeding requiring transfusion, sepsis, hospital length of stay, unplanned readmission, unplanned reoperation, and death following ankle fracture surgery.

38782076,Potential of FGF21 in type 2 diabetes mellitus treatment based on untargeted metabolomics.,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has promise for treating diabetes and its associated comorbidities. It has been found to reduce blood glucose in mice and humans; however, its underlying mechanism is not known. Here, the metabolic function of FGF21 in diabetes was investigated. Diabetic db/db mice received intraperitoneal injections of FGF21 for 28 days, the serum of each mouse was collected, and their metabolites were analyzed by untargeted metabolomics using UHPLC-MS/MS. It was found that FGF21 reduced blood glucose and oral glucose tolerance without causing hypoglycemia. Moreover, administration of FGF21 reduced the levels of TG and LDL levels while increasing those of HDL and adiponectin.

34172940,Type 2 diabetes mellitus in older adults: clinical considerations and management.,"The past 50 years have seen a growing ageing population with an increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); now, nearly half of all individuals with diabetes mellitus are older adults (aged ≥65 years). Older adults with T2DM present particularly difficult challenges. For example, the accentuated heterogeneity of these patients, the potential presence of multiple comorbidities, the increased susceptibility to hypoglycaemia, the increased dependence on care and the effect of frailty all add to the complexity of managing diabetes mellitus in this age group. In this Review, we offer an update on the key pathophysiological mechanisms associated with T2DM in older people. We then evaluate new evidence relating particularly to the effects of frailty and sarcopenia, the clinical difficulties of age-associated comorbidities, and the implications for existing guidelines and therapeutic options. Our conclusions will focus on the effect of T2DM on an ageing society.",Nature reviews. Endocrinology,2021-Sep,"Bellary S, Kyrou I, Brown JE, Bailey CJ",4,982,diabetes,2025-11-22

The study included 130 women: T1DM (n = 40), T2DM (n = 35), gestational diabetes (GDM, n = 40) and the control group (n = 15). The serum concentrations of NT, 8-isoprostane, and TAC were measured by ELISA methods. Elevated 8-isoprostane levels were observed in all patients with DM, but this biomarker's maximum values have been seen in T1DM and T2DM on insulin groups. A similar tendency was observed for the concentration of NT in both the 1st and 3rd trimesters. TAC levels showed a statistically relevant decrease in all DM groups compared to the control. The correlation analysis showed a direct correlation between HbA1c and serum 8-isoprostane levels in the 1st (r = .27) and 3rd (r = .3) pregnancy trimesters as well as inverse correlation with TAC level (r = -.48). Direct (NT, 8-isoprostane) and inverse correlations (TAC) were fixated for this biomarker concentration and preeclampsia rates.

40391534,Direct Thrombin Inhibitors Suppress Type 1 Diabetes Development through PI3K/p-AKT Pathway.,"Diabetes mellitus type-1 is an immunological disease associated with low insulin release and hyperglycemia due to beta cell loss. No clear studies show the relationship between the coagulation cascade activation and diabetes mellitus type-1 development. The present work aimed to clarify the function of the active coagulation system in the progression of diabetes mellitus type-1 (T1DM). Furthermore, the possible protective action of direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) against T1DM caused by streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1DM in mice model was examined. Forty Balb/c male albino mice were distributed into four different groups, with 10 mice in each group: normal, dabigatran (DAB)-treated, STZtreated, and STZ+DAB. Blood glucose, blood platelets, serum insulin, nuclear consistency, and pancreas histopathological changes were evaluated. Moreover, the expressions of PI3K, p-Akt, insulin, and fibrinogen were investigated in the pancreatic tissues via immunofluorescent technique. The findings displayed enhanced islet expression of fibrinogen, p-Akt, and PI3K proteins along with thrombocytopenia in STZ-injected mice when equated to control. Furthermore, treatment with STZ reduced pancreatic insulin expression. DAB and STZ-cotreatment significantly diminished pancreatic tissue expression of fibrinogen, PI3K, and p-AKT, as well as increased platelet counts and pancreatic insulin expression. The evidence supported the activation of coagulation cascade in T1DM through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Using direct antithrombin therapy may open new avenues for T1DM prevention in high-risk diabetes individuals.",Current molecular pharmacology,2024-,"Alharbi AG, Ali HM, Alhowail AH, Aldubayan MA, Abdel-Bakky MS",5,1613,diabetes,2025-11-22

Moreover, prevalence rates for both are expected to rise dramatically over coming decades. The high prevalence rates of both diseases and wellrecognized association of diabetes as a risk factor for HF make it inevitable that both diseases co-exist in a large number of patients, complicating their management and increasing the risk of a poor outcome. Management of diabetes has been shown to impact clinical events in patients with HF and there is emerging evidence that agents used to treat diabetes can reduce HF events, even in non-diabetic patients.

Here, we compared the structural information of chondroitin sulfate (CS) from different origins and the effects on activity of α-amylase and blood glucose have been investigated. The inhibitory effects of shark and porcine CSs against α-amylase activity is obvious with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 11.97 and 14.42 mg/ml, respectively, but the bovine CS almost no effect. From the data of fluorescence spectroscopic analyses, CSs from shark and pig quench Try fluorescence intensity of the enzyme, whereas bovine CS induces an increase. In vivo, oral administration of shark and porcine CSs efficiently suppresses postprandial blood glucose levels in normal and diabetic mice. Our study found that CSs from different sources showed different biological functions even if both molecular weight and disaccharide subunit composition are almost the same, and demonstrated that the CSs from shark and pig as α-amylase inhibitors could be regarded as a novel functional food ingredient in T2DM management.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2021-Aug,"Pang H, Li J, Miao Z, Li SJ",4,1219,diabetes,2025-11-22

The expression of <i>parp-1</i> and <i>bax</i> genes was estimated on mRNA levels using real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. <b>Results.</b> After 8 weeks, diabetic rats had weight loss, while blood glucose was increased about 4.9-fold compared to control group. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> administration to diabetic animals had no effect on these parameters. It was found that total serum alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly elevated in diabetic rats as compared to control animals and was restored by vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Diabetes was accompanied by reduction of nicotinamidadenindinucleotide, a substrate of poly-ADP-ribosylation, level by 31.7% as compared to control rats, which was not reversed in response to vitamin D<sub>3</sub> treatment. In diabetic hearts, the mRNA expression level of <i>parp-1</i> gene was 2.8-fold higher compared to control rats and partially decreased by vitamin D3 treatment. Less significant alterations were observed in diabetic hearts for the mRNA expression level of <i>bax</i> gene that was 2.0-fold higher compared to control animals and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> normalized it. These results indicate that cardiomyocytes have a tendency to apoptosis. <b>Conclusions.</b> The findings suggest that investigated genes can be targets at the transcriptional level for vitamin D action that may be contributed to the improving metabolic/signaling pathways induced by diabetes mellitus.",Endocrine regulations,2021-May,"Kuchmerovska T, Guzyk M, Tykhonenko T, Yanitska L, Pryvrotska I, Diakun K",6,1778,diabetes,2025-11-22

The existence and uniqueness of the positive periodic solution of the impulsive model at double fixed time is confirmed for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) using the [Formula: see text] function. Further, the global asymptotic stability of the positive periodic solution is achieved following Floquet multiplier theory and comparison principle. Additionally, the permanence of the system is confirmed in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) via the comparison theorem.

With overweight and obesity being a global epidemic, choosing the appropriate weight loss plan for patients with diabetes seems to be of particular concern for healthcare professionals. Since diabetes and cardiovascular diseases frequently coexist, modern pharmacological therapeutic models aim at addressing both. Therapeutic targets in diabetic population that address glycemic control, adequate lipid and blood pressure control proves to limit the incidence of cardiovascular events, reduce the risk of chronic complications and improve patients quality of life. Similarly, dietary managment in this population should also concentrate on the reduction of reversible cardiovascular risk factors. Nutritional recommendations for diabetic patients should be individualized to meet their expectations and lifestyle in order to ensure compliance and long-term effects. As diabetic population is more vulnerable to further health risks associated with diet induced metabolic changes, inadequate intake of dietary components and increased cardiovascular risk, nutrition plans should be addressed more carefully in this group.",Primary care diabetes,2022-Apr,"Wołos-Kłosowicz K, Bandurska-Stankiewicz E",2,1284,diabetes,2025-11-22
34598934,Complexity of antidiabetic medication regimen is associated with increased diabetes-related distress in persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes-related distress is present in a high proportion of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We hypothesized that complexity of the antidiabetic medication regimen is a factor that is associated with diabetes-related distress. This was a retrospective study including a group of 74 patients managed at a tertiary care center. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, steroid-induced diabetes, post-transplant diabetes, and other types of diabetes were excluded. Patients were screened using the Diabetes Distress Scale-2 (DDS-2). A Diabetes Medication Complexity Scoring (DMCS) system was developed to objectively assess the diabetes medication complexity. Based on DMCS, participants were categorized into three groups: low (n=26), moderate (n=22), and high (n=26) medication complexity. Complexity groups were similar in sociodemographic characteristics, diabetes duration, body mass index, and blood pressure as well as the prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hypoglycemic episodes. However, there were significant differences for HbA1c with higher HbA1c in the high and moderate complexity groups than in the low group (p=0.006). The microvascular complications were also more common in higher complexity groups (p=0.003). The prevalence of diabetes-related distress (DDS-2 ≥6) was 34.6% in the low, 36.4% in the moderate and 69.2% in the high complexity groups (p=0.021). There were significant differences in DDS-2 score among complexity groups (p=0.009), with higher DDS-2 score in the high complexity group compared with the moderate (p=0.008) and low complexity groups (p=0.009). The difference in DDS-2 score remained significant after adjusting for HbA1c (p=0.024) but did not reach statistical significance after controlling for both HbA1c and microvascular complications (p=0.163).

33830396,The protective effect of hydrogen-rich water on rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"The hydrogen-rich water (HW) has been reported to possess a beneficial role in patients with diabetes. However, a systemic evaluation with an appropriate animal model is necessary to reveal its mechanisms and efficacy. Herein, the protective effects of drinking HW on lipid and glucose metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats were investigated. The well-modeled T2DM rats (induced by high-fat diet combined with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) injection) were divided into two groups (n ≥ 15 of each): fed a high-fat diet and drinking distilled water or HW at a constant concentration above 1.0 ppm; normal rats were used as control group (n ≥ 10): fed a regular diet and drinking distilled water. Several biomarkers of lipid and glucose metabolism, oxidative stress ,and inflammation were evaluated after drinking distilled water or HW for 3 weeks. The effect of HW on liver, kidney, and spleen of T2DM rats was also analyzed by HE and Oil Red O staining. The results showed that drinking HW suppressed the increase in glucose, total cholesterol, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Moreover, HW also ameliorates hyperglycemia-induced liver, kidney, and spleen dysfunction. Overall, this study indicates that patients with T2DM may be able to improve their condition by supplementing HW as daily drinking water.",Molecular and cellular biochemistry,2021-Aug,"Zheng M, Yu H, Xue Y, Yang T, Tu Q, Xiong K, Deng D, Lu L, Huang N",9,1357,diabetes,2025-11-22
32203408,Young-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus - implications for morbidity and mortality.,"Accumulating data suggest that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in younger people (aged <40 years), referred to as young-onset T2DM, has a more rapid deterioration of β-cell function than is seen in later-onset T2DM. Furthermore, individuals with young-onset T2DM seem to have a higher risk of complications than those with type 1 diabetes mellitus. As the number of younger adults with T2DM increases, young-onset T2DM is predicted to become a more frequent feature of the broader diabetes mellitus population in both developing and developed nations, particularly in certain ethnicities. However, the magnitude of excess risk of premature death and incident complications remains incompletely understood; likewise, the potential reasons for this excess risk are unclear. Here, we review the evidence pertaining to young-onset T2DM and its current and future burden of disease in terms of incidence and prevalence in both developed and developing nations.

39749985,The Relationship of Serum Diabetes Antibodies With the Development of Early Diabetic Retinopathy Findings in Children With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.,"To explore how serum diabetes autoantibodies are related to the development of early diabetic retinopathy in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus. In this prospective and observational study, 62 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who had not yet developed clinical diabetic retinopathy were followed up for at least 5 years. Healthy volunteers aged 10 to 20 years were also included. Insulin, pancreatic islet cells, and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) autoantibodies were measured with an RIA kit at the time of type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosis. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) was used to evaluate the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and parafoveal vascular density (PVD) for the development of early diabetic retinopathy among the groups. Patients' OCTA findings were compared with those of healthy volunteers. The obtained data were analyzed via IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 27.0. Spearman's rank correlation test and regression analysis were performed to determine independent predictors of OCTA and type 1 diabetes mellitus parameters. Eighteen boys and 44 girls with type 1 diabetes mellitus with a median age of 15.6 years (range: 10.08 to 20.88 years) were evaluated. Healthy control participants with a median age of 15.3 years (range: 14.2 to 18.2 years) were also included. The mean FAZ was greater in the type 1 diabetes mellitus group than in the healthy control group (<i>P</i> = .013 and .119, respectively). The mean PVD was significantly lower in the type 1 diabetes mellitus group than in the healthy control group. There was no significant correlation between serum diabetes autoantibodies (GAD and insulin autoantibodies) and FAZ or PVD (FAZ and GAD; <i>r</i> = 0.138, <i>P</i> = .286, FAZ and anti-insulin; <i>r</i> = 0.100, <i>P</i> = .441, PVD and GAD; <i>r</i> = -0.151, <i>P</i> = .24, PVD and anti-insulin; <i>r</i> = -0.087, <i>P</i> = .499). Type 1 diabetes mellitus in children without clinically detectable diabetic retinopathy is associated with impaired retinal microcirculation and irregularities at the FAZ margin. Impaired retinal microcirculation and irregularities were associated with glycated hemoglobin levels in the study group.

38709441,Changes of RNA m<sup>6</sup>A/m<sup>5</sup>C Modification Regulatory Molecules in Ferroptosis of T2DM Rat Pancreas.,"N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenine (m<sup>6</sup>A) and 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) are two common forms of RNA methylation that play an important role in the epigenetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). One type of cell death, ferroptosis, has been implicated in islet β-cell damage in T2DM. Notably, RNA methylation, an upstream regulatory mechanism of mRNAs, can regulate the expression of ferroptosis signaling molecules, thereby affecting cell proliferation and death. Here, we found that the ferroptosis signaling pathway was activated in pancreas of T2DM rats, followed by significant changes in m<sup>6</sup>A/m<sup>5</sup>C modification regulatory molecules. These detection data together with the prediction results that m<sup>6</sup>A and m<sup>5</sup>C exist in the mRNAs of ferroptosis molecules, we speculate that m<sup>6</sup>A and m<sup>5</sup>C are probably involved in pancreatic cell damage by modifying of ferroptosis signaling molecules. In short, our findings provide a new research idea for future studies on the molecular mechanisms of pancreatic cell damage and point to a new direction for exploring the mechanisms of ferroptosis from the perspective of RNA methylation modification.",Cell biochemistry and biophysics,2024-Jun,"Liu X, Wang N, Gu S, He Z",4,1211,diabetes,2025-11-22

32334065,Treatment of insulin resistance in obesity-associated type 2 diabetes mellitus through adiponectin gene therapy.,"Global rise in obesity-associated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has led to a major healthcare crisis. Development of efficient treatments to treat the underlying chronic inflammation in obesity-associated T2DM, is an unmet medical need. To this end, we have developed a plasmid adiponectin (pADN) based nanomedicine for the treatment of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Adiponectin is a potent anti-inflammatory/anti-diabetic adipokine, which is downregulated in obesity. In this study, nanomicelles comprising chitosan conjugated to oleic acid and adipose homing peptide (AHP) were developed to deliver pADN to adipocytes. Cationic chitosan-oleic-AHP micelles were 112 nm in size, encapsulated 93% of pADN and protected gene cargo from DNase I mediated enzymatic degradation. In vitro, the nanomicellar formulation significantly increased adiponectin production compared to free plasmid as well as standard transfecting agent FuGENE®HD. Single dose subcutaneous administration of pADN-chitosan-oleic-AHP to obese-diabetic rats, resulted in improved insulin sensitivity for up to 6 weeks, which matched the glucose disposal ability of healthy rats. Serum adiponectin level in pADN-chitosan-oleic-AHP treated rats was comparable to healthy rats for up to 3 weeks post treatment. Overall, the results indicate that pADN-chitosan-oleic-AHP based therapy is a promising treatment approach for obesity-associated T2DM.",International journal of pharmaceutics,2020-Jun,"Banerjee A, Sharma D, Trivedi R, Singh J",4,1430,diabetes,2025-11-22

37808264,Assessing Knowledge on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Child Health.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a diagnosis of glucose intolerance during pregnancy. The risk of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity for the child and mother increases when GDM develops. Preventing the development of GDM could help lower the prevalence of obesity and type II diabetes mellitus morbidity rates in children of affected mothers. The purpose of the study was to identify the awareness level of females ages 12 and 51 years, on the long-term risk of obesity and T2DM on their children in Australia and Samoa. This is a quantitative study involving 202 females, from across Australia and Samoa, between April 2021 and November 2021, comparing the level of knowledge between a developing and developed country. In Australia and Samoa, 15% (n=16) and 34% (n=33) of females respectively, were aware of the long-term complications of GDM on their children. These findings indicate that there is inadequate knowledge regarding the long-term consequences associated with GDM on both the risk for T2DM in women and the risk for long-term complications for their children. The greatest source of information in both countries was obtained from physicians or midwives, 52% (n=105). This supports the need for increased education on GDM, through social media, the internet, and community health professionals.

Ceramides are primarily recognized as lipid bilayer building blocks, but recent work has shown that these endogenous molecules are important intracellular signalling mediators and may exert some diabetogenic effects via molecular pathways involved in insulin resistance, β-cell apoptosis and inflammation. In the present review, we consider the available evidence on the possible roles of ceramides in diabetes mellitus and introduce eight different molecular mechanisms mediating the diabetogenic action of ceramides, categorized into those predominantly related to insulin resistance vs those mainly implicated in β-cell dysfunction. Specifically, the mechanistic evidence involves β-cell apoptosis, pancreatic inflammation, mitochondrial stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, adipokine release, insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation, oxidative stress and insulin synthesis.

In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, there was an elongation in P, Pd, PR, QTc, QTd, QTcd, JT, JTc, JTd, Tp-Te and Tp-Te/QT, Tp-Te/QTc, Tp-Te/JT, Tp-Te/JTc ratios were higher (P < 0.05). In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, pulmonary artery pressure was higher than control group (P = 0.001). Prolongation of QTc, thickness of left ventricle end-diastolic diameter and left ventricle posterior wall diameter were higher in the HbA1c ≥9% subgroup. When adjusted for age there was no significant correlation between left ventricle parameters and HbA1c. Atrial conduction delay and impairment of ventricular repolarization were significantly high and there was a predisposition for the development of pulmonary artery hypertension in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Poor glycemic control was not a risk factor for propensity of left ventricle hypertrophy and left ventricle dysfunction.",Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,2022-Jan,"Bezen D, Türkmenoğlu Y, İrdem A",3,1526,diabetes,2025-11-22
34416793,A case of monogenic diabetes mellitus caused by a novel heterozygous <i>RFX6</i> nonsense mutation in a 14-year-old girl.,"Monogenic diabetes mellitus (DM) is a single gene disorder, primarily characterized by impairment in the development or function of pancreatic beta cells. A 14-year-old girl was initially diagnosed with type 2 DM. The patient did not have any anti-islet autoantibody and showed acanthosis nigricans. She was managed with long-acting insulin and oral hypoglycemic agent, but HbA<sub>1c</sub> was still 9.3% after 1 year of management. Her mother already had type 2 DM at 46-year-old and was on medication. Under the possibility of familial monogenic DM, targeted exome sequencing was performed which included 29 genes associated with monogenic DM. Nonsense mutation of the gene <i>RFX6</i> (c.2661T>A, p.Tyr887∗) was found. After adding Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, HbA<sub>1c</sub> improved from 8.8 to 6.8% and body mass index (BMI) also improved from 31.0 to 29.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. It may be worth investigating genetic etiology in early-onset autoantibody-negative DM for specific genetic diagnosis and better management.",Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,2021-Dec,"Kim GL, Kwak SH, Yu J",3,1045,diabetes,2025-11-22
34902230,Abdominal volume index trajectories and risk of diabetes mellitus: Results from the China Health and Nutrition Survey.,"Abdominal obesity is a risk factor for developing diabetes mellitus, but trajectories of abdominal obesity over time and incident diabetes mellitus have not been considered. We derived trajectories of abdominal volume index (AVI) over 16 years of follow up, and examined the associations between AVI trajectories and risk of diabetes mellitus. Data were used from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, and 5,267 participants were enrolled to fit the trajectory of AVI by using latent class growth models. Multivariate logistic regression models explored the relationship between different AVI trajectories and risk of diabetes mellitus. In addition, we examined the slope of the AVI trajectories in relation to age to identify appropriate life course intervention opportunities for the prevention of diabetes mellitus. Three trajectories were derived reflecting graded categories in the speed and slope of increase in AVI over time: slow, intermediate and fast increase group, respectively. After multivariate adjustment, the odds ratios for diabetes mellitus among those in the intermediate and fast increase groups were 1.81 (95% confidence interval 1.37-2.38, P < 0.001) and 2.80 (95% confidence interval 1.85-4.24, P < 0.001) respectively, relative to the slow increase group. The distribution of AVI slope in the slow increase group showed an inverted ""U"" shape, whereas the fast increase group presented a ""U"" shape. AVI trajectory is associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus. These results provide new insights on the relationship between abdominal adiposity and diabetes mellitus, which in turn can help improve clinical and public health intervention for diabetes mellitus prevention.",Journal of diabetes investigation,2022-May,"Hu X, Appleton AA, Ou Y, Zhang Y, Cai A, Zhou Y, Dong H",7,1708,diabetes,2025-11-22
