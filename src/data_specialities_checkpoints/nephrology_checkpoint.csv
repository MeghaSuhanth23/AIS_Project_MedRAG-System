31982214,Critical Care Nephrology: Core Curriculum 2020.,"The intensive care unit (ICU) is a common source of high-acuity nephrology consultations. Although advanced chronic kidney disease is associated with increased ICU mortality, the prognosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy is far worse, with short-term mortality rates that often exceed 50%. As such, it is essential that practicing nephrologists be comfortable caring for critically ill patients. This Core Curriculum article emphasizes the developments of the last decade since the last Core Curriculum installment on this topic in 2009. We focus on some of the most common causes of AKI in the critical care setting and use these AKI causes to delve into specific topics most relevant to critical care nephrology, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, evolving concepts in fluid management, and shock. We conclude by reviewing the basics of palliative care nephrology and dialysis decision making in the ICU.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2020-Mar,"Griffin BR, Liu KD, Teixeira JP",3,988,nephrology,2025-11-22
34247745,Introduction to Nephrocardiology.,"The interaction between nephrology and cardiovascular medicine is much broader than the cardiorenal syndrome. Many different aspects of cardiovascular medicine are interconnected with and substantially influenced by the conditions that fall into the realm of nephrology, and vice versa. Those aspects include pathophysiology, risk factors, epidemiology, prognosis, prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy. Discovery of the interconnected areas and development of appropriate knowledge and skill to optimally approach those circumstances can improve the quality of care and outcome of a large population of patients. Therefore, establishment of the distinct subspeciality of nephrocardiology is imperative.",Cardiology clinics,2021-Aug,Hatamizadeh P,1,712,nephrology,2025-11-22

32891309,The Nephrologist as an Ultrasonographer.,"Ultrasonography is increasingly being used in the practice of nephrology, whether it is for diagnosis or management of acute or chronic kidney dysfunction, until progression to end-stage kidney disease, including preoperative assessment, access placement, and diagnosis and management of dysfunctional hemodialysis access. Point-of-care ultrasounds are also being used by nephrologists to help manage volume status, especially in patients admitted to the intensive care units, and more recently, for guiding fluid removal in the outpatient dialysis units. Fundamental knowledge of sonography has become invaluable to the nephrologist, and performance and interpretation of ultrasound has now become an essential tool for practicing nephrologists to provide patient-centered care, maximize efficiency, and minimize fragmentation of care. This review will address the growing role of ultrasonography in the management of a patient with CKD from the point of initial contact with the nephrologist throughout the spectrum of kidney disease and its consequences.",Advances in chronic kidney disease,2020-May,"Koratala A, Teodorescu V, Niyyar VD",3,1057,nephrology,2025-11-22

Many medical schools and training programs are integrating POCUS into their curriculum. Especially with the technological advances of newer handheld ultrasound devices, POCUS has now become a component adjunct to clinical examination, in the clinic and bedside in critical care units. The diagnostic utility of POCUS lies both in early identification of critical kidney disease, and also extra-renal pathologies from a focused cardiac ultrasound, lung ultrasound, and integrated fluid assessment. There is a need to incorporate POCUS in training in pediatric nephrology and establish competency standard criteria. This review shall cover how POCUS helps in enhancing patient care in pediatric kidney disorders and critical children, and the recent advances.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2023-Jun,"Sethi SK, Raina R, Koratala A, Rad AH, Vadhera A, Badeli H",6,900,nephrology,2025-11-22

35690406,Nephrology Policy: Kidney Transplantation.,"Kidney transplant policy has not historically been considered a domain of nephrology policy; despite that, the US transplant system is marked by missed opportunities that prevent patients from accessing a kidney transplant. Policymakers in the federal government are focused on growing the inadequate supply of kidneys, especially on increasing procurement of deceased donor organs, and reducing kidney discards. There are many more challenges in transplantation that require the attention of experts in nephrology policy, whether in the Administration, Congress, advocacy organizations, or clinical practice. Thoughtful policy solutions are needed to improve transplant equity, balance competing patient desires, increase living donation, develop and implement measures of transplant center performance, and create an infrastructure for the long-term management of transplant recipients.",Advances in chronic kidney disease,2022-Jan,Godwin M,1,888,nephrology,2025-11-22
39192232,How artificial intelligence is transforming nephrology.,"Current research in nephrology is increasingly focused on elucidating the complexity inherent in tightly interwoven molecular systems and their correlation with pathology and related therapeutics, including dialysis and renal transplantation. Rapid advances in the omics sciences, medical device sensorization, and networked digital medical devices have made such research increasingly data centered. Data-centric science requires the support of computationally powerful and sophisticated tools able to handle the overflow of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This is a context in which artificial intelligence (AI) and, more specifically, machine learning (ML) can provide a clear analytical advantage, given the rapid advances in their ability to harness multimodal data, from genomic information to signal, image and even heterogeneous electronic health records (EHR). However, paradoxically, only a small fraction of ML-based medical decision support systems undergo validation and demonstrate clinical usefulness. To effectively translate all this new knowledge into clinical practice, the development of clinically compliant support systems based on interpretable and explainable ML-based methods and clear analytical strategies for personalized medicine are imperative. Intelligent nephrology, that is, the design and development of AI-based strategies for a data-centric approach to nephrology, is just taking its first steps and is by no means yet close to its coming of age. These first steps are not even homogeneously taken, as a digital divide in access to technology has become evident between developed and developing countries, also affecting underrepresented minorities. With all this in mind, this editorial aim to provide a selective overview of the current use of AI technologies in nephrology and heralds the ""Artificial Intelligence in Nephrology"" special issue launched by BMC Nephrology.",BMC nephrology,2024-Aug,"Hueso M, Vellido A",2,1919,nephrology,2025-11-22
34194006,Big Data in Nephrology.,"A huge array of data in nephrology is collected through patient registries, large epidemiological studies, electronic health records, administrative claims, clinical trial repositories, mobile health devices and molecular databases. Application of these big data, particularly using machine-learning algorithms, provides a unique opportunity to obtain novel insights into kidney diseases, facilitate personalized medicine and improve patient care. Efforts to make large volumes of data freely accessible to the scientific community, increased awareness of the importance of data sharing and the availability of advanced computing algorithms will facilitate the use of big data in nephrology. However, challenges exist in accessing, harmonizing and integrating datasets in different formats from disparate sources, improving data quality and ensuring that data are secure and the rights and privacy of patients and research participants are protected. In addition, the optimism for data-driven breakthroughs in medicine is tempered by scepticism about the accuracy of calibration and prediction from in silico techniques. Machine-learning algorithms designed to study kidney health and diseases must be able to handle the nuances of this specialty, must adapt as medical practice continually evolves, and must have global and prospective applicability for external and future datasets.",Nature reviews.

36253030,Natural Language Processing in Nephrology.,"Unstructured data in the electronic health records contain essential patient information. Natural language processing (NLP), teaching a computer to read, allows us to tap into these data without needing the time and effort of manual chart abstraction. The core first step for all NLP algorithms is preprocessing the text to identify the core words that differentiate the text while filtering out the noise. Traditional NLP uses a rule-based approach, applying grammatical rules to infer meaning from the text. Newer NLP approaches use machine learning/deep learning which can infer meaning without explicitly being programmed. NLP use in nephrology research has focused on identifying distinct disease processes, such as CKD, and extraction of patient-oriented outcomes such as symptoms with high sensitivity. NLP can identify patient features from clinical text associated with acute kidney injury and progression of CKD. Lastly, inclusion of features extracted using NLP improved the performance of risk-prediction models compared to models that only use structured data. Implementation of NLP algorithms has been slow, partially hindered by the lack of external validation of NLP algorithms. However, NLP allows for extraction of key patient characteristics from free text, an infrequently used resource in nephrology.",Advances in chronic kidney disease,2022-Sep,"Van Vleck TT, Farrell D, Chan L",3,1321,nephrology,2025-11-22
34112638,Use of rituximab in paediatric nephrology.,"Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody capable of depleting B cell populations by targeting the CD20 antigen expressed on the cell surface. Its use in oncology, initially in B cell lymphoma and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, predates its current utility in various fields of medicine wherein it has become one of the safest and most effective antibody-based therapies. It was subsequently found to be effective for rheumatological conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis. Over the past decade, rituximab has generated a lot of interest in nephrology and has become an emerging or accepted therapy for multiple renal conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, lupus nephritis, vasculitis, nephrotic syndrome and in different scenarios before and after kidney transplantation. This review outlines its current use in paediatric nephrology practice, focusing on the knowledge required for general paediatricians who may be caring for children prescribed this medication and reviewing them on a shared care basis.",Archives of disease in childhood,2021-Nov,"Sinha R, Agrawal N, Xue Y, Chanchlani R, Pradhan S, Raina R, Marks SD",7,1101,nephrology,2025-11-22

36799506,Perception and satisfaction of nephrology education and training in Iraq.,"Interest in training in nephrology is declining around the world. This is a particularly worrisome issue for future nephrology practice with the aging population and the increasing number of patients with kidney disease. We wished to understand the perception and measure the satisfaction of Iraqi medical interns regarding nephrology and explore factors affecting career decisions towards becoming a specialist nephrologist. A web-based authors-constructed survey consisting of a Likert-type scale questionnaire to assess perception and satisfaction was used. It comprised multiple-choice yes/no/maybe questions and addressed the willingness to pursue a career in nephrology. Iraqi medical interns in their final 2 years of training, 2021-2022, were assessed. One hundred and twenty internal medicine Iraqi fellows participated in the survey (response rate 84.2%). Sixty-eight fellows (74%) described nephrology as a complex science. Acid-base and electrolytes disorders and transplantation were the most challenging topics, followed by glomerular diseases. Twenty-one fellows (23%) were satisfied with the quality of training and nephrology education during their medical school, residency and internship. In addition, 14% stated that they would pursue a future career in nephrology. The most selected barrier (34%) against choosing nephrology was a fellow's perception of the patient's complexity and the potentially futile outcome. The majority (76%) of Iraqi medical interns are currently not satisfied with nephrology training and education. One in seven would pursue a future career in nephrology. New targeted innovative approaches are urgently needed for the various grades of trainees to highlight the benefits of nephrology as a career.",The journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh,2023-Mar,"Ali A, Al-Omar D, Lami F, Bhandari S",4,1747,nephrology,2025-11-22

33409671,Urology and nephrology: etymology of the terms.,"Earlier than has been thought, multiple seventeenth- and eighteenth-century authors used the term urologia, perhaps independently, to cover the established science of ""the urines"". Two early eighteenth-century authors, Schurig and Fezer, seemingly prepared manuscripts, both most probably lost, with the term in the very title. Mid-nineteenth-century uses reflected growing, especially Anglophone, interest in microscopic urinalysis. Only toward the end of the nineteenth century did urology take on the sense of genito-urinary medicine and surgery. This expanded sense of urology may be dated back to 1896, specifically the naming of the Association française d'urologie.",International urology and nephrology,2021-Jun,Janssen DF,1,672,nephrology,2025-11-22
39508711,Nursing Care and Postgraduate Education of Nephrology and Dialysis Nurses in Italy.,"<b>Introduction.</b> Patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing renal replacement therapy have complex care needs. To address this, nephrology and dialysis nurses must possess expertise in advanced specialist and disciplinary skills. The aim of this review is to analyze post-graduate academic training pathways and clinical-care training in the field of nephrology and dialysis nursing in the Italian context. <b>Methodology.</b> A narrative review of the literature was conducted in May 2024, using databases such as CINAHL and Medline-PubMed, with a selection criterion limited to primary and secondary studies published in Italian and English. To supplement the search, particularly within the Italian context, grey literature sources were consulted. <b>Results.</b> Post-graduate nephrology nursing education in Italy is mainly offered through First-Level Masters, as well as Second Level Masters and specialization courses, which are provided at various academic institutions. Analysis of the educational programs revealed the presence of common ""core"" teachings across all pathways, covering renal disease pathophysiology, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and dialysis nursing care, alongside significant heterogeneity in other proposed teachings. Clinical-care training emerged as a fundamental aspect in both post-graduate education, professional integration for newcomers, and continuous professional development. <b>Conclusions.</b> The growing healthcare need for specialist skills suggests the necessity of integrating field-based training with standardized post-graduate academic pathways, possibly in collaboration with relevant Nursing Scientific Societies. This synergy would not only promote the enhancement of nursing competencies but also ensure a high quality of care delivery.",Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia,2024-Oct,"Mancin S, Bragaglia F, Andreoli D, Morales Palomares S, Cangelosi G, Sguanci M, Bedin M, Godino L, Fabbri C, Gazineo D, Ferrara G, Mazzoleni B",12,1805,nephrology,2025-11-22
36371118,Postgraduate Education and Training for the Nephrology Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners.,"There is no consistent educational model to introduce the physician assistant and/or nurse practitioner to nephrology. The job descriptions of the nephrology physician assistant/nurse practitioner may be similar, but the training, state and federal licensing, background, and recertification are different for the 2 professions adding a level of complexity to the training of the physician assistant/nurse practitioner new to nephrology. On-the-job training is the most common modality, but formats, content, mentors, and practices vary from organization to organization and even within organizations. The advantage of on-the-job training is its flexibility while the disadvantage is its nonspecific outcomes. As nephrology practices vary widely and range from single provider private practices to multiprovider academic practices, it is difficult if not impossible to develop a generic orientation model.

38403395,Patient-Centered Research and Innovation in Nephrology.,"Patient involvement in research can improve the relevance of research, consequently enhancing the recruitment, retention, and uptake of interventions and policies impacting patient outcomes. Despite this, patients are not often involved in the design and conduct of research. The research agenda and innovations are frequently determined by the interest of health and industry professionals rather than proactively aligning with the priorities of patients. It is now being encouraged and recommended to engage patients in research priority setting to ensure interventions and trials report outcomes valuable to patients, moving away from a history of overlooking the outcomes that reflect the feel and function of patients. Involving patients ensures constant innovative research in nephrology, as this broader depth of evidence fortifies reliability and validity through knowledge gained from lived experience. Findings from such research can enhance clinical practice and strengthen decision-making and policy to support better outcomes. We aim to outline principles and strategies for patient involvement in research, including setting research priorities, identifying and designing interventions, selecting outcomes, and disseminating and translating research. Principles and strategies including engagement, education and training, empowerment, and connection and community provide guidance in patient involvement. There are increasing efforts to involve patients across all stages of research including setting research priorities. Efforts are rising to involve patients across all stages of research including priority setting, identifying and designing interventions, selecting outcomes, and dissemination and translation.

39340488,Clinical Genetic Testing in Nephrology: Core Curriculum 2024.,"Implementation of clinical genetic testing into the routine diagnostic workup of patients with kidney disorders can improve care when employed with proper patient selection. Due to advances in technology, testing with curated gene panels associated with kidney diseases are commercially available, are relatively inexpensive, and have quick turnaround time. While this may reduce barrier to entry, their adoption into routine nephrology care may be hindered when practitioners do not have comfort and experience ordering or interpreting these tests. Identifying patients who may have a monogenic etiology of their kidney disease will increase the diagnostic yield of testing, avoid unnecessary use of resources, and reduce anxiety around unclear or secondary findings. Genetic testing can end one's diagnostic odyssey and help identify other family members at risk. Additionally, obtaining a genetic result can aid diagnostic precision, enhance understanding of disease, and may allow for alterations in treatment plans and screening for extrarenal manifestations of disease as well as clarify prognosis and aid in family planning. In this Core Curriculum, using a case-based approach, we highlight these and other topics in clinical genetic testing to enhance utilization in the general nephrology patient population.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2024-Nov,"Aron AW, Dahl NK",2,1318,nephrology,2025-11-22
35582171,Nephrology Considerations in the Management of Durable and Temporary Mechanical Circulatory Support.,"Durable and temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) use is growing for a range of cardiovascular indications. Kidney dysfunction is common in people evaluated for or receiving durable or temporary MCS and portends worse outcomes. This kidney dysfunction can be due to preexisting kidney chronic kidney disease (CKD), acute kidney injury (AKI) related to acute cardiovascular disease necessitating MCS, AKI due to cardiac procedures, and acute and chronic MCS effects and complications. Durable MCS, with implantable continuous flow pumps, is used for long-term support in advanced heart failure refractory to guideline-directed medical and device therapy, either permanently or as a bridge to heart transplantation. Temporary MCS-encompassing in this review intra-aortic balloon pumps (IABP), axial flow pumps, centrifugal flow pumps, and venoarterial ECMO-is used for diverse situations: high-risk percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), acute decompensated heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and resuscitation after cardiac arrest. The wide adoption of MCS makes it imperative to improve understanding of the effects of MCS on kidney health/function and of kidney health/function on MCS outcomes. The complex structure and functions of the kidney, and the complex health states of individuals receiving MCS, makes investigations in this area challenging, and current knowledge is limited. Fortunately, the increasing nephrology toolbox of noninvasive kidney health/function assessments may enable development and testing of individualized management strategies and therapeutics in the future.

36371116,"Kidney Pathology Education for Nephrology Fellows: Past, Present, and Future.","Kidney pathology education is a critical component in training of nephrology fellows, as well as for continuing medical education for practicing nephrologists. Kidney pathology images are included on nephrology fellow board exams, and clinicopathologic correlation of kidney biopsy findings is critical in everyday clinical practice. Nephropathology training is a requirement by the American College of Graduate Medical Education within nephrology fellowship curricula. However, greater than one-third of fellowship program directors believe that nephropathology training for their fellows is not sufficient. During the Coronavirus Disease-19 pandemic, the use of digital learning has become commonplace with virtual conferences (local, national, and international) and online meetings becoming the norm for education. Nephrology has become a leader in free open-access online medical education, both prior to and, to even a greater extent, during the pandemic. Here, we review available resources to nephrology fellows and other learners to supplement nephropathology training, which includes medical blogs, journal clubs, interactive quizzes and games, online conferences, podcasts, and mentorship opportunities.

This Core Curriculum illustrates how ultrasonography can be incorporated into clinical decision making across the spectrum of kidney disease to optimize the care nephrologists provide to patients. Sonography is valuable in outpatient and inpatient settings for the diagnosis and management of acute and chronic kidney disease, evaluation of cystic disease, urinary obstruction, pain, hematuria, proteinuria, assessment of volume status, and in providing guidance for kidney biopsy. As kidney disease advances, ultrasound is useful in the placement and maintenance of temporary and permanent access for dialysis. After kidney transplantation, ultrasonography is critical for evaluation of allograft dysfunction and for biopsies. Sonography skills expedite patient care and enhance the practice of nephrology and are relatively easily acquired with training. It is our hope that this curriculum will encourage nephrologists to learn and apply this valuable skill.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2024-Apr,"Niyyar VD, Ross DW, O'Neill WC",3,1081,nephrology,2025-11-22
34351594,Engaging medical students and residents in nephrology education: an updated scoping review.,"There is global recognition that interest in nephrology among pediatric and adult trainees is waning, while the burden of kidney disease continues to wax. There is a growing need to engage trainees in nephrology education. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature on nephrology education for medical students and residents published in the last six years, collate the findings, and extract major themes in order to better define the gaps in this field. A systematic literature search was conducted on four major academic search engines including MEDLINE (OvidSP), ERIC, EMBASE and Web of Science until October 22, 2020, retrieving a total of 2,694 studies. Forty studies published after September 2014 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These studies were analyzed based on study focus, type of study design, and outcomes. The studies fell into three main areas of focus: (a) factors that influence interest in nephrology careers (b) current gaps in nephrology knowledge and (c) innovative educational strategies. Barriers to engaging learners in nephrology include a lack of exposure, lack of mentorship, and perceived complexity of nephrology. Baseline awareness is deficient in the management of chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury. Applying active learning strategies may reduce the perceived barriers to understanding nephrology. The importance of engaging the future nephrology workforce is well-recognized. Nephrologist educators should focus their efforts in studying curriculum interventions and their impact not only on learner satisfaction, but also future behavior, career choices, and patient outcomes.",Journal of nephrology,2022-Jan,"Prasad C, Sanger S, Chanchlani R, Kirpalani A, Noone D",5,1664,nephrology,2025-11-22

Kidney organoids are now used for disease modeling and drug screening, but they also have potential as tools for clinical transplantation therapy. One of the options to achieve this goal would be to assemble multiple renal progenitor cells (nephron progenitor, ureteric bud, stromal progenitor) to reproduce the organotypic kidney structure from PSCs. At least from mouse PSCs, all the three progenitors have been induced and assembled into such ""higher order"" kidney organoids. We will provide an overview of the developmental nephrology required for the induction of renal progenitors and discuss recent advances and remaining challenges of kidney organoids for clinical transplantation therapy.",European journal of cell biology,2024-Dec,"Ibi Y, Nishinakamura R",2,944,nephrology,2025-11-22
35368786,Internal Medicine Residents' Perceptions of Nephrology as a Career: A Focus Group Study.,"Interest in nephrology as a career has declined dramatically over the past several years. Only 62% of nephrology fellowship positions are filled for the upcoming 2020 appointment year. The purpose of this study was to identify perceptions, attitudes, motivators, and barriers to a career in nephrology among internal medicine residents. We recruited focus groups of internal medicine residents (<i>N</i>=25) from the University of Colorado, and asked questions aimed at exploring perceptions, attitudes, and barriers to a career in nephrology, and ways to increase interest in nephrology. All focus groups were conducted on the University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus. Focus group sessions were recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to identify key concepts and themes. Residents described many barriers to a career in nephrology, including lack of exposure, lack of advances in the field, low monetary compensation, high complexity, lack of role models/mentors, and low-prestige/noncompetitive nature of the field. Most residents had no exposure to outpatient nephrology. Lack of new therapeutics was a significant deterrent to nephrology. Nephrology teaching in medical school was described as not clinically relevant and too complicated. Several residents felt they were not smart enough for nephrology. Only three residents had a role model within nephrology. Residents used the word ""stigmatized"" to describe nephrology, and discussed how low prestige decreased their interest in a field. Participants expressed suggestions to increase interest in nephrology through earlier and more outpatient nephrology exposure, enhanced interactions with nephrologists, and research and advancements in the field. Residents identified several modifiable barriers to a career in nephrology. Changing how nephrology is taught in medical school, enhancing interactions with nephrologists through increased exposure, and highlighting research and advancements in nephrology may change the perception of nephrology and increase the number of residents entering the field.",Kidney360,2020-Oct,"Beck N, Furgeson S, Chonchol M, Kendrick J",4,2088,nephrology,2025-11-22

However, there is a risk that professional boundaries may become blurred due to the perceived closeness of this relationship. This systematic review sought to explore the experiences of nephrology clinicians in establishing and maintaining a professional relationship with people experiencing end-stage kidney disease who are receiving HD treatment. A search strategy was created using JBI systematic review guidelines for six databases (PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and JBI library). Qualitative studies were eligible for inclusion when the participants were nephrology clinicians who provided HD treatment or management of patients in a hospital outpatient HD unit or a community HD centre. Three studies met the inclusion criteria and the findings were synthesised into two themes (1) establishing a professional relationship and (2) coping mechanisms. All three studies focused on nephrology clinicians realising the importance of treating patients as individuals. Nephrology clinicians demonstrated advanced communication skills, empathy and compassion when interacting with patients, which seemed to contribute to patient satisfaction. This systematic review found some qualitative evidence to explain how nephrology clinicians establish and maintain a professional clinician-patient relationship with patients in the HD unit.

33951266,Qualitative research methods and its application in nephrology.,"Chronic kidney disease is associated with an increased risk of mortality, comorbidities and life-threatening complications. Invasive treatments including dialysis or transplantation, complex pharmacological therapies, dietary restrictions and the ongoing need to attend follow-up appointments can place a substantial treatment burden on patients and carers and impair quality of life. This highlights the need for care that is responsive to the needs of patients and involves them in decision-making to achieve the most appropriate healthcare outcomes. Shared decision-making and collaborative approaches to care require a deep awareness of the lived experiences and goals of patients. Qualitative research methods can provide insights into patients' experiences, values and priorities and inform practice and policy by uncovering their preferences for care. Qualitative methods are increasingly being used in standalone projects or in mixed methods studies (complementing quantitative studies) to make valuable contributions to patient-centred research. Patient-centred care, collaborations between patient and care provider, and shared decision-making that integrates with the patient's goals are central to quality healthcare. The efficacy of qualitative research lies in its ability to elicit patients' perspectives, values, priorities and goals that underpin shared decision making and care. This article discusses examples of how qualitative research has informed practice and policy in nephrology, provides a summary of qualitative research methods and outlines a guide on how to appraise, interpret and apply qualitative data.","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2021-Oct,"Guha C, Viecelli AK, Wong G, Manera K, Tong A",5,1634,nephrology,2025-11-22

38292495,"Perceptions towards Nephrology Specialty: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.","There is a decline in the interest in pursuing a career in nephrology globally as well as locally in Northern Ireland. There is also an expansion in the burden of kidney disease worldwide due to a combination of factors like higher detection rates, increase in population size and improved life expectancy. Workforce shortages in nephrology have a direct impact on provision of care for people with kidney disease. Understanding perceptions among doctors towards nephrology is an important factor in acknowledging the barriers in recruitment and advocating evidence based changes to improve current practices. The aim of this study is to explore both the positive and the negative perceptions among medical students and trainees towards nephrology as a specialty in order to understand the factors that are most influential in either choosing or forgoing a career in nephrology. Scoping review methodology was used to address the research question through a phenomenological lens. Sixteen articles were included that studied the perceptions towards nephrology mainly through questionnaires and also through direct quotations. Basic numerical analysis and content analysis was completed. A total of 3745 participants including medical students, trainees and consultants participated in the 16 studies were included in this review at an international level. Most of the studies used survey (questionnaire) as their methodology (n= 10). The seven themes that emerged to describe perceptions towards nephrology were exposure to specialty; complex specialty; mentorship; work-life balance; financial compensation; personal interest; and procedural component. Exposure to specialty was the most influential factor in future career choice decision. The other factors that could improve recruitment in nephrology include innovative and novel teaching methods, good role models, flexible training and working patterns, and adequate financial remuneration. In order to rekindle interest in nephrology we need a multi-pronged approach based on ensuring early exposure to the specialty, good mentorship, holistic clinical experience covering different aspects of the specialty and the opportunity of flexibly moulding one's interests and skills whilst ensuring service provision, and with an emphasis on adequate financial remuneration.",The Ulster medical journal,2024-Jan,"Prabhavalkar S, Puri A, Shivashankar G",3,2324,nephrology,2025-11-22

The practice of nephrology has come a long way in managing this disease, though there remains room for improvement. The private domain, where more than half of the adult nephrology workforce operates, faces serious challenges. Interest has decreased in the field, leading to diminished recruitment. There has been a reduction in both reimbursement rates and revenues. We discuss the current state of private practice nephrology and strategies to reinvigorate our discipline. There needs to be a focus on preparing fellows during training not only for academic careers, but also for effective functioning in the environment of private practice and development of pathways for growth. We believe that private practice nephrology must expand its frontiers to be fulfilling professionally, challenging academically, and successful financially.

ML models can predict AKI up to 24-48 h before changes in serum creatinine levels, and AI has the potential to identify AKI sub-phenotypes with distinct clinical characteristics and outcomes for targeted interventions. LLMs and generative AI offer opportunities for automated clinical note generation and provide valuable patient education materials, empowering patients to understand their condition and treatment options better. To fully capitalize on its potential in critical care nephrology, it is essential to confront the limitations and challenges of AI implementation, including issues of data quality, ethical considerations, and the necessity for rigorous validation. The integration of AI in critical care nephrology has the potential to revolutionize the management of AKI and continuous renal replacement therapy.

37496337,History of Pediatric Nephrology in Türkiye.,"This article analyzes the foundation, institutiona-lization, and development of pediatric nephrology in Türkiye. Erich Frank is the pioneer and inspiration for Turkish nephrologists. He pioneered the training of a new generation of modern physicians, the first generation of Turkish nephrologists, and the establishment of the discipline of nephrology. Turkish pediatricians closely followed these developments and tried to improve their knowledge, making an effort to study abroad. These physicians established pediatric nephrology departments in their universities, trained young pediatric nephrologists, initiated pediatric hemodialysis-peritoneal dialysis units, and realized renal transplantation in children. Another pioneer of pediatric nephrology is Prof. İhsan Doğramacı, who established the first pediatric nephrology department at the Ankara-Hacettepe Medical Center in the 1960s. He directed many physicians to pediatric nephrology and provided them education and research opportunities abroad. Pediatric nephrology became a subspecialty in pediatrics in 1983 in Türkiye. Over the years, the number of Turkish pediatric nephrologists has increased; in 1990, they established the Pediatric Nephrology Association. This gave momentum to the standardization of education, better patient care, and scientific studies. Renal biopsies were initiated in 1964, the first pediatric hemodialysis application was conducted in 1974, the first renal transplantation from the living donor was in 1975, and the first continuous peritoneal dialysis was in 1989. With regard to international collaborations, since 2000, a council member from Türkiye has continuously been elected to the executive board of the European Society for Pediatric Nephrology; currently, the European Society for Pediatric Nephrology is led by President Rezan Topaloğlu. Several Turkish pediatric nephrologists have worked in international associations. Today, Türkiye has 107 pediatric nephrology centers, 265 well-trained specialists, 28 hemodialysis units, 39 peritoneal dialysis units, and 26 pediatric transplant centers.",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,2023-Jun,Gür Güven A,1,2097,nephrology,2025-11-22

This review aims to examine the repercussions of the climate change on nephrology and explore potential strategies to mitigate its impact. This review examines dialysis's environmental impact, resource recycling methods, and plant-based diets for kidney health. Recent research highlights the advantages of plant-based diets in managing and preventing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its complications. Integrating these practices can significantly lessen the environmental impact of nephrology. The aim of this study is to discuss the bidirectional relationship of climate change and kidney disease and the impact of nephrology on climate change and to discuss potential solutions. Each dialysis session consumes significant amounts of resource; reusing them will aid the environment. Plant-based diets slow renal disease and have a lower carbon footprint, making them ecologically friendly. Climate change is a growing threat to population health and healthcare. Rising temperatures raise the risk of kidney problems. Dialysis treatments also impact the environment through its high resource requirements while generating high volumes of waste and greenhouse gases. Opportunities exist to reduce the environmental impact of dialysis treatments.

33316222,Rare diseases of phosphate and calcium metabolism: Crossing glances between nephrology and endocrinology.,"Rare diseases of phosphate/calcium metabolism correspond to a wide and heterogeneous spectrum of diseases. Recent knowledge in physiology and genetics has made it possible to better characterize them and to propose attractive therapeutic approaches based on the underlying pathophysiology. These diseases are often at the interface between nephrology and endocrinology. In this spirit of a multidisciplinary care, each specialty can bring its own critical point of view and its own specificities to improve patient care. The objective of this manuscript is to ""read"" with a nephrologist's point of view the main frameworks of diseases of phosphate/calcium metabolism, to illustrate the three crucial messages of nephro-protection sent to endocrinologists. First, calciuria must be interpreted both in absolute value (concentration hypercalciuria) and in ratio (flow hypercalciuria). Second, renal monitoring of therapies inducing hypercalciuria on kidneys with normal renal function (e.g. active vitamin D analogs or teriparatide) should be systematic. Last, hyperphosphatemia, often latent in hypoparathyroidism and pseudo-hypoparathyroidism, should be detected and at least benefit from dietary measures, in the context of Western diets rich in phosphate hidden in food additives.",Annales d'endocrinologie,2021-Feb,"Mosca M, Bernardor J, Lemoine S, Bertholet-Thomas A, Bacchetta J",5,1282,nephrology,2025-11-22
32049747,Machine learning in nephrology: scratching the surface.,"Machine learning shows enormous potential in facilitating decision-making regarding kidney diseases. With the development of data preservation and processing, as well as the advancement of machine learning algorithms, machine learning is expected to make remarkable breakthroughs in nephrology. Machine learning models have yielded many preliminaries to moderate and several excellent achievements in the fields, including analysis of renal pathological images, diagnosis and prognosis of chronic kidney diseases and acute kidney injury, as well as management of dialysis treatments. However, it is just scratching the surface of the field; at the same time, machine learning and its applications in renal diseases are facing a number of challenges. In this review, we discuss the application status, challenges and future prospects of machine learning in nephrology to help people further understand and improve the capacity for prediction, detection, and care quality in kidney diseases.",Chinese medical journal,2020-Mar,"Li Q, Fan QL, Han QX, Geng WJ, Zhao HH, Ding XN, Yan JY, Zhu HY",8,989,nephrology,2025-11-22
36371111,A Framework for Antiracist Curriculum Changes in Nephrology Education.,"Addressing persistent racial health disparities in cases of kidney disease will first require significant investment in examining how structural racism has influenced our clinical practice and medical education. Improving how we understand and articulate race is critical for achieving this goal. This work begins with ensuring that race's mention within nephrology literature and curricular materials for medical trainees is thoroughly rooted in evidence-based rationale-not to serve as a proxy for polygenic contributions, social determinants of health, or systemic health care barriers. While many institutions are increasingly recognizing the importance of instituting such changes on behalf of the systematically marginalized patient populations who are most affected by these disparities, there is a paucity of guidance on how to critically appraise and revise decades of pathophysiological and epidemiological findings through an antiracist lens. In this article, we propose an inquiry-based framework with case-study examples to help readers recognize improper use of race within nephrology, assess personal and institutional readiness to introduce changes to said content, and generate materials that center evidence-based findings and reject harmful misinterpretations of race.",Advances in chronic kidney disease,2022-Nov,"Scott PO, Catlett JL, Seah C, Leisman S",4,1287,nephrology,2025-11-22
34330368,A Call for an Ethics and Governance Action Plan to Harness the Power of Artificial Intelligence and Digitalization in Nephrology.,"Digitalization in nephrology has progressed in a manner that is disparate and siloed, even though learning (under a broader Learning Health System initiative) has been manifested in all the main areas of clinical application. Most applications based on artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) are still in the initial developmental stages and are yet to be adequately validated and shown to contribute to positive patient outcomes. There is also no consistent or comprehensive digitalization plan, and insufficient data are a limiting factor across all of these areas. In this article, we first consider how digitalization along nephrology care pathways relates to the Learning Health System initiative. We then consider the current state of AI/ML-based software and devices in nephrology and the ethical and regulatory challenges in scaling them up toward broader clinical application. We conclude with our proposal to establish a dedicated ethics and governance framework that is centered around health care providers in nephrology and the AI/ML-based software to which their work relates. This framework should help to integrate ethical and regulatory values and considerations, involve a wide range of stakeholders, and apply across normative domains that are conventionally demarcated as clinical, research, and public health.",Seminars in nephrology,2021-May,"Ho CW, Caals K",2,1340,nephrology,2025-11-22
37496348,Nephrology Before Nephrology in Poland.,"It was in the 1950s that nephrology crystallized as an independent specialty out of internal medicine. However, references to modern nephrology appeared in the works of doctors much earlier. Some researchers consider Hippocrates to be the father of clinical nephrology, while John Merrill is widely regarded as a specialty founder of modern nephrology. The situation is similar in Poland, where early references to urinary tract diseases appeared in medieval works of Polish authors. Poland's first clinic of nephrology, established in Wrocław in 1958, was managed by Zdzisław Wiktor. During the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association and International Association for the History of Nephology congresses, Polish authors presented precursors of nephrology, including Thomas of Wrocław, Simon Sirenius, Samuel Goldflam, Józef Dietl, Jędrzej Śniadecki, Marceli Landsberg, and Witold and Tadeusz Orłowski. This article focuses on late 19th and early 20th century giants who contributed to the development of nephrology in Poland. The period discussed covers memorable milestones in the history of Poland, ranging from the long-term Russian, Prussian, and Austro-Hungarian annexation through World War 1, after which the country regained its independence, to World War 2. These scientists represented clinical medicine and basic sciences, such as pathologic anatomy, physiology, and physiologic chemistry, and came from 3 different regions of Poland. Professor Tadeusz Browicz was associated with the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Professor Anastazy Landau worked in Warsaw, and Stefan Dąbrowski represented the University of Poznań. Although based on the cooperation with European universities, their works were published in Polish, preventing them from gaining wide recognition in the European medical community of the time. Therefore, presenting their achievements to a wider group of historians after such a long time seems justified.",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,2023-Jun,Ostrowski J,1,1972,nephrology,2025-11-22
39217985,Generative AI in Critical Care Nephrology: Applications and Future Prospects.,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming various aspects of healthcare, including critical care nephrology. Large language models (LLMs), a key technology in generative AI, show promise in enhancing patient care, streamlining workflows, and advancing research in this field. This review analyzes the current applications and future prospects of generative AI in critical care nephrology. Recent studies demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs in diagnostic accuracy, clinical reasoning, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) alarm troubleshooting. As we enter an era of multiagent models and automation, the integration of generative AI into critical care nephrology holds promise for improving patient care, optimizing clinical processes, and accelerating research. However, careful consideration of ethical implications and continued refinement of these technologies are essential for their responsible implementation in clinical practice. This review explores the current and potential applications of generative AI in nephrology, focusing on clinical decision support, patient education, research, and medical education. Additionally, we examine the challenges and limitations of AI implementation, such as privacy concerns, potential bias, and the necessity for human oversight. (i) LLMs have shown potential in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, clinical reasoning, and CRRT alarm troubleshooting in critical care nephrology. (ii) Generative AI offers promising applications in patient education, literature review, and academic writing within the field of nephrology. (iii) The integration of AI into electronic health records and clinical workflows presents both opportunities and challenges for improving patient care and research. (iv) Addressing ethical concerns, ensuring data privacy, and maintaining human oversight are crucial for the responsible implementation of AI in critical care nephrology.",Blood purification,2024-,"Cheungpasitporn W, Thongprayoon C, Ronco C, Kashani KB",4,1937,nephrology,2025-11-22
39325593,Onconephrology Fellowship Training: Current Status and Future Outlook.,"Onconephrology, an emerging discipline nestled at the intersection of nephrology and oncology, has experienced remarkable growth over the past 15 years. This evolution has been punctuated by pivotal events, including establishing the American Society of Onconephrology, dedicated forums, and journals, highlighting its increasing significance. The clinical landscape of onconephrology is diverse, encompassing AKI in patients with cancer, toxicity from anticancer treatments, and a spectrum of electrolyte disorders, necessitating close collaboration between nephrologists and oncologists. However, trainees and mentors encounter various challenges surrounding its status as a distinct subspecialty. To overcome these barriers, there is a pressing need for streamlined training pathways, enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration, and targeted research efforts to elucidate the effect of onconephrology on patient outcomes. By addressing these challenges head-on, the field of onconephrology can continue its trajectory of growth and better serve patients with cancer with complex kidney needs.",Kidney360,2024-Sep,"Bonilla M, Geara AS",2,1093,nephrology,2025-11-22

35322794,Provider Perspectives and Clinical Outcomes with Inpatient Telenephrology.,"Despite the dramatic increase in the provision of virtual nephrology care, only anecdotal reports of outcomes without comparators to usual care exist in the literature. This study aimed to provide objective determination of clinical noninferiority of hybrid (telenephrology plus face-to-face) versus standard (face-to-face) inpatient nephrology care. This retrospective study compares objective outcomes in patients who received inpatient hybrid care versus standard nephrology care at two Mayo Clinic Health System community hospitals. Outcomes were then additionally compared with those patients receiving care at another Mayo Clinic Health System site where only standard care is available. Hospitalized adults who had nephrology consults from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021 were considered. Regression was used to assess 30-day mortality, length of hospitalization, readmissions, odds of being prescribed dialysis, and hospital transfers. Sensitivity analysis was performed using patients who had ≥50% of their care encounters <i>via</i> telenephrology. Structured surveys were used to understand the perspectives of non-nephrology hospital providers and telenephrologists. In total, 850 patients were included. Measured outcomes that included the number of hospital transfers (odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.37 to 3.82) and 30-day readmissions (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.84 to 1.06), among others, did not differ significantly between controls and patients in the general cohort. Telenephrologists (<i>n</i>=11) preferred video consults (82%) to phone for communication. More than half (64%) of telenephrologists spent less time on telenephrology compared with standard care. Non-nephrology hospital providers (<i>n</i>=21) were very satisfied (48%) and satisfied (29%) with telenephrology response time and felt telenephrology was as safe as standard care (67%), while providing them enough information to make patient care decisions (76%). Outcomes for in-hospital nephrology consults were not significantly different comparing hybrid care versus standard care. Non-nephrology hospital providers and telenephrologists had favorable opinions of telenephrology and most perceived it is as safe and effective as standard care.

32560780,Use of Semiprivate Smartphone Communication Applications in Nephrology Education.,"Advances in information technology have changed human interactions. These changes have had considerable implications for nonmedical and medical educational practices. The use of semi-private applications such as WhatsApp (Mountain View, CA), Slack (Canada), Viber (Israel), and Google Hangouts (Mountain View, CA) has not been well studied in nephrology education. In this narrative review, we review the literature on the use of these communication applications in medicine and nephrology education. Although many of these applications might be used currently in nephrology, there is little published data regarding the use of WhatsApp in nephrology fellowship. Given the easy accessibility of these communication applications by our learners in medical school, residency, and fellowship, the use of such applications can enhance nephrology education.",Seminars in nephrology,2020-May,"Pandya A, Elrggal ME, Jhaveri KD",3,852,nephrology,2025-11-22
37975548,A decision-making framework for genomic testing in paediatric nephrology.,"Technological advances and increased access have led to genomics expanding beyond the genetics clinic. Consequently, nephrologists can now order genomic testing for their patients. Consistent decision-making around patient and test selection is required to ensure equitable access while maximising the utility of genomic testing. However, there are currently no frameworks to guide decision-making for testing in this context. We aimed to develop an ethical decision-making framework for genomic testing in paediatric nephrology. A three-stage approach was used: (i) review of the literature on decision-making for genomic testing in nephrology and other disciplines; (ii) ethnographic observation of approaches to genomic testing in the general nephrology and renal genetics clinics at an Australian paediatric hospital; (iii) review and revision of the framework with key stakeholders, including clinical geneticists, genetic counsellors, paediatric nephrologists and families from the renal genetics service. The initial framework was modified until consensus from key stakeholders was reached. A decision-making framework was created with questions designed to explore the impact of genomic testing on patient management, clinical validity, patient characteristics, alternatives to genomic testing, genetic counselling, resource availability, implications for family members, psychosocial considerations, patient autonomy, research, support services and insurance. Case studies were developed to demonstrate the framework's application. This framework was designed to guide decisions around patient selection for genomic testing in nephrology in the Australian health-care setting, with potential utility in other institutions and medical disciplines. It may help facilitate consistent approaches to genomic testing, to maximise equity and utility.",Journal of paediatrics and child health,2023-Dec,"Beadell I, Quinlan C",2,1852,nephrology,2025-11-22
33131642,International Medical Graduates in Nephrology: A Guide for Trainees and Programs.,"A significant portion of the nephrology workforce has traditionally consisted of non-United States (US) citizen international medical graduates and international research trainees. Although international medical graduates are offered opportunities for training and professional growth that are beyond those available in their countries of origin, they typically encounter barriers to transition from training to practice and early-stage career development. In this article, we describe the exchange visitor and temporary worker visas granted to foreign trainees in the United States, focusing on the transition from training to nephrology practice and/or research. While we provide general recommendations on how to navigate this tedious and unpredictable process for both programs and trainees, consultation with immigration attorneys is indispensable for a successful outcome. Trainees are therefore encouraged to seek continuous support from their programs/sponsors and assistance from immigration representatives at their training institutions. We provide a positive message to emphasize that there are many pathways to arrive at the desired post-training destination.",Advances in chronic kidney disease,2020-Jul,"Neyra JA, Tio MC, Ferrè S",3,1172,nephrology,2025-11-22

POCUS increases the sensitivity of conventional physical examination by providing the answers to simple clinical questions at the bedside. As such, it can reduce fragmentation of care and expedite management. In addition, using bedside ultrasound as the first-line investigation may eliminate unnecessary radiation and contrast exposure. The advent of highly portable and affordable ultrasound devices has made the use of POCUS more practical and user-friendly, making it the stethoscope of the 21st century. This review will provide an overview of the rationale for integrating POCUS into nephrology practice. We also discuss the current scope of POCUS practice and state of training.",Advances in chronic kidney disease,2021-May,"Koratala A, Kazory A",2,819,nephrology,2025-11-22
33076636,Single-cell transcriptomics: a novel precision medicine technique in nephrology.,"Due to the complex structure and function of the kidneys, the mechanism of kidney disease is unclear. In particular, transcriptomics approaches at the bulk level are unable to differentiate primary autonomous responses, which lead to disease development, from secondary cell non-autonomous responses. Single-cell analysis techniques can overcome the limitations inherent in the measurement of heterogeneous cell populations and clarify the central issues in kidney biology and disease pathogenesis. Single-cell sequencing helps in identifying disease-related biomarkers and pathways, stratifying patients, and deciding on appropriate treatment methods. Here we review a variety of single-cell analysis techniques and single-cell transcriptomics studies performed in the field of nephrology.

32680914,Preprint Servers in Kidney Disease Research: A Rapid Review.,"Preprint servers, such as arXiv and bioRxiv, have disrupted the scientific communication landscape by providing rapid access to research before peer review. medRxiv was launched as a free online repository for preprints in the medical, clinical, and related health sciences in 2019. In this review, we present the uptake of preprint server use in nephrology and discuss specific considerations regarding preprint server use in medicine. Distribution of kidney-related research on preprint servers is rising at an exponential rate. Survey of nephrology journals identified that 15 of 17 (88%) are publishing original research accepted submissions that have been uploaded to preprint servers. After reviewing 52 clinically impactful trials in nephrology discussed in the online Nephrology Journal Club (NephJC), an average lag of 300 days was found between study completion and publication, indicating an opportunity for faster research dissemination. Rapid review of papers discussing benefits and risks of preprint server use from the researcher, publisher, or end user perspective identified 53 papers that met criteria. Potential benefits of biomedical preprint servers included rapid dissemination, improved transparency of the peer review process, greater visibility and recognition, and collaboration. However, these benefits come at the risk of rapid spread of results not yet subjected to the rigors of peer review. Preprint servers shift the burden of critical appraisal to the reader. Media may be especially at risk due to their focus on ""late-breaking"" information. Preprint servers have played an even larger role when late-breaking research results are of special interest, such as during the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 has brought both the benefits and risks of preprint servers to the forefront. Given the prominent online presence of the nephrology community, it is poised to lead the medicine community in appropriate use of preprint servers.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2021-Mar,"Vlasschaert C, Giles C, Hiremath S, Lanktree MB",4,1999,nephrology,2025-11-22

Yet the nursing profession continually faces shortages in all specialties. Several causes and issues of concern related to the nursing shortage in nephrology are discussed, including the prevalence of kidney disease and its increasing number of associated comorbidities, which has also heightened the urgent need for nephrology nurses. Data have shown that the lack of nephrology nurses caring for patients with kidney disease impacts patient outcomes and nephrology nurse burnout. Strategies must be implemented to manage these growing needs that affect both patient outcomes and nurse staffing.

38052181,A Systematic Bibliometric Analysis of High-Impact Articles in Critical Care Nephrology.,"Critical care nephrology is a subspecialty that merges critical care and nephrology in response to shared pathobiology, clinical care, and technological innovations. To date, there has been no description of the highest impact articles. Accordingly, we systematically identified high impact articles in critical care nephrology. This was a bibliometric analysis. The search was developed by a research librarian. Web of Science was searched for articles published between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2020. Articles required a minimum of 30 citations, publication in English language, and reporting of primary (or secondary) original data. Articles were screened by two reviewers for eligibility and further adjudicated by three experts. The ""Top 100"" articles were hierarchically ranked by adjudication, citations in the 2 years following publication and journal impact factor (IF). For each article, we extracted detailed bibliometric data. Risk of bias was assessed for randomized trials by the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Analyses were descriptive. The search yielded 2,805 articles. Following initial screening, 307 articles were selected for full review and adjudication. The Top 100 articles were published across 20 journals (median [IQR] IF 10.6 [8.9-56.3]), 38% were published in the 5 years ending in 2020 and 62% were open access. The agreement between adjudicators was excellent (intraclass correlation, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.84-0.99). Of the Top 100, 44% were randomized trials, 35% were observational, 14% were systematic reviews, 6% were nonrandomized interventional studies and one article was a consensus document. The risk of bias among randomized trials was low. Common subgroup themes were RRT (42%), AKI (30%), fluids/resuscitation (14%), pediatrics (10%), interventions (8%), and perioperative care (6%). The citations for the Top 100 articles were 175 (95-393) and 9 were cited &gt;1,000 times. Critical care nephrology has matured as an important subspecialty of critical care and nephrology. These high impact papers have focused largely on original studies, mostly clinical trials, within a few core themes.

The past several years have seen increased opportunities for subspecialization in areas such as interventional nephrology, onconephrology, and glomerular disease. Notable trends in fellowship curricula include the expansion of education in home dialysis and palliative care, driven by policy changes and focus on patient-centered care. In addition, point-of-care ultrasound has garnered significant interest due to its potential to provide diagnostic information that improves patient care. An important area that remains largely unaddressed appears to be education about the business and administrative aspects of nephrology. Meanwhile, the importance of training in hemodialysis catheter placement and kidney biopsy has come into question due to the small proportion of nephrologists performing these procedures today.

35840858,Onco-nephrology: Physicians' Expectations About a New Subspecialty.,"Renal events are common in cancer patients and malignancy is a prevalent complication in both patients transplanted and under kidney replacement therapy (KRT). In recent years, onco-nephrology has been developed as a subspecialty whose scope has not been well established yet. The aim of our study was to assess resident and senior physicians' knowledge and expectations about onco-nephrology. Two anonymous self-administered online questionnaires were developed by a multidisciplinary team and distributed to French residents and senior physicians. Two hundred twenty-eight physicians answered the survey, including 128 (56%) nephrologists, of which 98 (43%) were senior physicians and 130 (57%) were residents. Nephrologists rated their confidence in their ability to face onco-nephrological situation at 6/10 (interquartile range (IQR) 4.0-7.0) and oncologists at 6.0/10 (5.0-7.0). Managing cancer drugs in patients on KRT or in transplanted patients and discussion about introducing dialysis in cancer patients were designated as the most challenging topics. Asking if they had received appropriate learning, residents' median agreement was ranked at 3.0/10 (2.0-4.0). Forty-six percent of the respondents considered available resources as not appropriate. Specialized onco-nephrology consultations were accessible for 21% of the respondents. Finally, respondents thought there is a strong need for a national working group (8.3/10) with 87% of them expecting new reliable guidelines. The present survey revealed physicians' expectations about onco-nephrology implementation in France. An appropriate answer could be the creation of a national working group.

35372985,POCUS for Nephrologists: Basic Principles and a General Approach.,"Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) has evolved as a valuable adjunct to physical examination in the recent past and various medical specialties have embraced it. However, POCUS training and scope of practice remain relatively undefined in nephrology. The utility of diagnostic POCUS beyond kidney and vascular access is under-recognized. Assessment of fluid status is a frequent dilemma faced by nephrologists in day-to-day practice where multiorgan POCUS can enhance the sensitivity of conventional physical examination. POCUS also reduces fragmentation of care, facilitates timely diagnosis, and expedites management. Although the need for further imaging studies is obviated in selected patients, POCUS is not meant to serve as an alternative to consultative imaging. In addition, the utility of POCUS depends on the skills and experience of the operator, which in turn depend on the quality of training. In this review, we discuss the rationale behind nephrologists performing POCUS, discuss patient examples to illustrate the basic principles of focused ultrasonography, and share our experience-based opinion about developing a POCUS training program at the institutional level.",Kidney360,2021-Oct,"Koratala A, Reisinger N",2,1187,nephrology,2025-11-22

The delivery of transplant care is complex, involves a multidisciplinary transplant team, and care coordination between transplant and community providers. The transplant nephrologist is central to the delivery of this care and assumes a multitude of clinical and nonclinical roles and responsibilities. With a growing population of patients requiring transplant care that spans a continuum from pretransplant referral to long-term posttransplant management, an understanding of the current state of the transplant nephrology workforce in the United States and the future that it faces is important in ensuring that current and future needs of both patients and physicians are met. In this article, we (1) review the scope of practice of the transplant nephrologist, (2) discuss the state of training in the field of transplant nephrology, (3) review the role of the referring primary nephrologist in the care of patients undergoing kidney transplant, and (4) discuss challenges and opportunities facing the transplant nephrology workforce.",Advances in chronic kidney disease,2020-Jul,"Concepcion BP, Alasfar S, Levea SL, Singh P, Wiseman A",5,1124,nephrology,2025-11-22

To address these challenges, the fields of cardio-oncology and onco-nephrology have arisen, focusing on the management of cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity attributable to anti-cancer drugs. Numerous intersections between these disciplines exist, including onco-hypertension (HTN) and cardiorenal toxicities induced by chemotherapeutic agents. Additionally, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may cause myocarditis and nephritis. This paper aimed to explore the intersection between cardio-oncology and onco-nephrology. A detailed review will be undertaken, focusing on onco-HTN and the cardiorenal toxicities of chemotherapeutic agents, with a specific emphasis on the adverse effects associated with ICIs. Multidisciplinary collaboration among oncologists, cardiologists, nephrologists, and other healthcare professionals is crucial for developing tailored approaches to optimize treatment efficacy while minimizing the risk of cardiovascular and renal complications, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes in modern oncology practice.",Cardiorenal medicine,2024-,"Attieh RM, Nunez B, Copeland-Halperin RS, Jhaveri KD",4,1192,nephrology,2025-11-22
36514730,A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial of Integrated Palliative Care and Nephrology Care.,"There has been a call by both patients and health professionals for the integration of palliative care with nephrology care, yet there is little evidence describing the effect of this approach. The objective of this paper is to report the feasibility and acceptability of a pilot randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of integrated palliative and nephrology care. English speaking patients with CKD stage 5 were randomized to monthly palliative care visits for 3 months in addition to their usual care, as compared with usual nephrology care. Feasibility of recruitment, retention, completion of intervention processes, and feedback on participation was measured. Other outcomes included differences in symptom burden change, measured by the Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale-Renal, and change in quality of life, measured by the Kidney Disease Quality of Life questionnaire and completion of advance care planning documents. Of the 67 patients approached, 45 (67%) provided informed consent. Of these, 27 patients completed the study (60%), and 14 (74%) of those in the intervention group completed all visits. We found small improvements in overall symptom burden (-2.92 versus 1.57) and physical symptom burden scores (-1.92 versus 1.79) in the intervention group. We did not see improvements in the quality-of-life scores, with the exception of the physical component score. The intervention group completed more advance care planning documents than controls (five health care proxy forms completed versus one, nine Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment forms versus none). We found that pilot testing through a randomized controlled trial of an ambulatory integrated palliative and nephrology care clinical program was feasible and acceptable to participants. This intervention has the potential to improve the disease experience for those with nondialysis CKD and should be tested in other CKD populations with longer follow-up.

The present study is aimed at exploring the residents' satisfaction with their training programs. Between April 20th and May 19th, 2021, a questionnaire on residency satisfaction consisting of 49 items was sent to 586 residents and 175 recently certified specialists (qualified to practice as nephrologists in 2019 and 2020), with a response rate of 81% and 51%, respectively. The teaching organization was contextualized with a survey involving 13 European nephrology schools. Most residency fellowship programs received a good rating with regard to ""satisfaction"", in particular for the following items: number of hospitalizations followed-up, chronic hemodialysis training, follow-up of transplanted patients, diagnosis and treatment of glomerulonephritis. The teachings that were identified as being of lower quality or insufficient intensity included vascular access management, ultrasound diagnostics and renal nutrition. The need for improvement in formal teaching programs was underlined. Young nephrologists were rather satisfied with their salary and with the quality of the work they were doing, but only few were interested in an academic career since it was generally held that it is ""too difficult"" to obtain a university position. Many young nephrologists who filled in the questionnaire felt that lack of experience in peritoneal dialysis and vascular access management was a barrier to finding an ideal job. Compared to other European training programs, the Italian program differs with regard to longer exposure to nephrology (as compared to internal medicine), and greater flexibility for internships in different settings, including abroad. This first nationwide survey on the satisfaction of residents in nephrology indicates that, despite rather good overall satisfaction, there is room for improvement to make nephrology a more appealing choice and to fulfill the needs of a growing number of renal disease patients.",Journal of nephrology,2024-Apr,"Perrotta AM, Rotondi S, Amicone M, Cirella I, Siligato R, Fontana S, Sivo C, Vestri AR, Gambaro G, Piccoli GB, Mazzaferro S",11,2061,nephrology,2025-11-22

In addition to National Institutes of Health funding, other funding sources are also discussed as they provide much needed bridge funding during key transition periods for young careers. Recent initiatives such as the Advancing American Kidney Health, KidneyX, and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases' Kidney Precision Medicine Project offer new research opportunities for bringing much needed innovation to improve lives of people with kidney diseases.

Engagement at all levels is crucial to fostering interest in the field, and experience for internal medicine residents has been a significant area for growth. In this article, we review the literature on available educational programs at the residency level. These interventions were largely met with high trainee satisfaction and positive feedback, particularly when designed with the goal to create superb internists rather than future nephrologists.

Love and breakup letter methodology (LBM) is a technique that has been used extensively in user experience technology-based research but has not previously been used in evaluating medical education tools. LBM asks participants to creatively write a ""love"" or ""breakup"" letter to a product under study to capture their thoughts and emotions when engaging with it. We conducted qualitative analysis of data from focus groups to explore how attitudes toward a learning platform change at various training stages and to broaden our understanding of how we meet learners' needs through a nephrology FOAMed tool, NephSIM. Three virtual, recorded focus groups were conducted with second-year medical students, internal medicine residents, and nephrology fellows ( N =18). At the start of the focus group, participants composed and read their love and breakup letters. Semistructured discussions were then led by facilitator-driven questions and peer comments. After transcription, inductive data analysis was conducted using Braun and Clarke's six-step thematic analysis. Four main themes were seen across all groups: attitudes toward teaching tool, perception of nephrology, learning needs and approach, and application to practice. Preclinical students positively viewed the opportunity to simulate the clinical setting and unanimously wrote love letters. Reactions from residents and fellows were mixed. Residents were interested in brevity and speed of learning, preferring algorithms and succinct approaches to meet their practice-based learning needs. Fellows' learning needs were driven by a desire to prepare for the nephrology board examination and review cases uncommonly seen in practice. LBM provided a valuable methodology through which to identify trainee reactions to a FOAMed tool and highlighted the challenges of meeting learning needs of a continuum of trainees with a single learning platform.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2023-Sep,"Fattah L, Thomas DC, Sparks MA, Farouk SS",4,2065,nephrology,2025-11-22
37337422,Vascular access hands-on training for young nephrologists: The fellows' experience of the N-PATH project REVAC module.,"Chronic kidney disease is a major public health problem, as population studies record a prevalence of 7.2% in individuals over 30 years and is expected to increase in the future. Many of them will end up undergoing hemodialysis treatment, and vascular access is not only an essential requirement for the technique, but also a determining factor in their prognosis; for all these reasons, every nephrologist should have both theoretical and practical knowledge of vascular access; however, the practical training is generally uneven and dependent on the hospital in which you train. It is within this context that the N-PATH (Nephrology Partnership for Advancing Technology in Healthcare) program was born with the objective of training 40 young European nephrologists in theoretical and practical aspects of Interventional Nephrology. To fulfill its mission, the 2-year program is composed of four modules of 6 months each including theoretical courses and hands-on training: Renal Expert in Molecular Pathology (REMAP), Renal Expert in Vascular Access (REVAC), Renal Expert in Medical Ultrasound (REMUS), and Renal Expert in Peritoneal Dialysis (REPED). By bringing together young nephrologists from all over Europe, the goal is also to create a strong network and promote Nephrology career at the European level.

37706475,Potential utility of renal functional reserve testing in clinical nephrology.,"The aim of this review is to discuss the concept of renal functional reserve (RFR) and its potential relevance in clinical practice. The RFR is a measure of the change in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from baseline to a peak value when the kidney is stimulated to increase its function. This concept has a strong physiologic basis in nephrology and the presence, magnitude or absence of RFR capacity may have prognostic significance in many clinical scenarios where individuals are at risk of hyperfiltration or kidney dysfunction. Unlike in other medical specialties, where organ reserve function is reliably measurable and used routinely, measurement of RFR in nephrology has not been integrated into clinical care. Methodologic challenges including standardization of methods to stimulate GFR and the ability of measures of GFR to discriminate acute dynamic changes in GFR upon kidney stimulation have hampered the robustness and use of RFR measurements in research and clinical care. Given the emergence of many new disease-modifying therapies in nephrology, it is imperative that we move forward and develop more robust tools to further our understanding of kidney physiology and pathophysiology, such as the RFR, which should be integrated into research and clinical care to support optimal personalization of therapeutic kidney care strategies.",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,2024-Jan,"Mueller TF, Luyckx VA",2,1354,nephrology,2025-11-22

However, it is unclear how often plant-based diets are recommended to patients with kidney disease. The objective of this study was to understand nephrology professionals' familiarity, perception, and recommendation of plant-based diets to people with kidney disease. A survey to understand perception of recommendation of plant-based diets for patients with CKD was developed. Nephrology professionals from the National Kidney Foundation's member directory were e-mailed a link to complete the survey online. This directory includes professionals who work in a variety of nephrology settings, including both CKD and end-stage renal disease care. Survey items were evaluated with descriptive statistics. Differences across items were determined using chi-square tests and t-tests. A total of 3,901 professionals were sent the survey, and 644 completed the survey. A majority were dietitians (58%) and worked in dialysis clinics (54%). Most (88%) had heard of using plant-based diets for kidney disease treatment, and a majority (88%) believed it could improve CKD management, cardiovascular disease (90%), hypertension (90%), diabetes (84%), high cholesterol (90%), and obesity (84%). Dietitians were more likely to report plant-based diets as beneficial for each health condition (P < .05). Professionals were most confident that a plant-based diet could help control hypertension (3.75 ± 0.99 on a scale of 1-5), compared with delaying progression of CKD (3.68 ± 1.15) or treating acidosis (3.68 ± 1.13). Dietitians felt more confident in their ability to plan a balanced plant-based diet compared with other specialties (3.49 vs. 2.74, P < .001). Nephrology professionals who work in nondialysis-dependent CKD settings, and those who work with patients on dialysis, are aware of the benefits of plant-based diets in kidney disease. However, plant-based diets are not routinely being offered as a treatment option.

Nephrology fellows are largely unaware of parental leave policies and pregnancy accommodations in their programs. Individual nephrology programs should improve awareness about national and local program policies among trainees. National and international policies on parental leave for physician trainees are inconsistent. Physician trainees, including nephrology fellows, may be at higher risk of pregnancy complications. Physician trainees face barriers in meeting their breastfeeding goals and in finding childcare because of nontraditional work hours with extended or unpredictable shifts. We examine awareness of current policies in US nephrology fellowship programs regarding parental leave, pregnancy/breastfeeding accommodations, and fellows' perspectives on family planning. An anonymous, online survey of US nephrology fellows was undertaken from June 9 to August 24, 2023. One hundred twenty nephrology fellows submitted the survey. Most of the fellow respondents were unaware of parental leave policies of their training programs (63%), the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (75%), and/or the American Board of Medical Specialties (75%). Forty-two percent were unaware of the duration of parental leave at their program. Nearly 45% of all respondents were unsure if their program limited night shifts or shifts >24 hours for pregnant trainees. Forty-three percent reported they were unsure of lactation accommodations, and 40% were unsure of access to subsidized childcare. When fellows received work accommodations for pregnancy or parenthood, their work obligations were largely covered by co-fellows (60%) or attendings (38%). Over 60% of fellows agreed or strongly agreed that they would avoid a pregnancy in fellowship because of concern that they would have to extend their training. Of the 40 fellows who chose to pursue pregnancy or parenthood during medical training, 75% did not change their career plans as a result. Most nephrology fellows were unaware of parental leave policies and pregnancy/lactation accommodations.

The aim of the Nephrology and Public Policy Committee (NPPC) of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association is to promote several key aspects of European nephrology. One of the targets proposed by the NPPC was to advance European nephrology involvement in AKI. We undertook a literature analysis to define the current position of European nephrology in the field of AKI compared with other regions and to determine how different European countries compare with each other. It appeared that vis-à-vis countries with a comparable socio-economic status (the USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada), the European contribution was almost 50% less. Within Europe, Central and Eastern Europe and countries with a lower gross domestic product showed lower scientific output. Nephrologists contributed to less than half of the output. There was no trend of a change over the last decade. There is room to improve the contribution of European nephrology in the field of AKI. We propose a model on how to promote clinical collaboration on AKI across Europe and the creation of a pan-European nephrology network of interested units to improve clinical outcomes, increase nephrologist involvement and awareness outside nephrology and stimulate research on AKI in Europe. Accordingly, we also propose a list of research priorities and stress the need for more European funding of AKI research.","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2022-Mar,"Vanholder R, Rondeau E, Anders HJ, Carlson N, Fliser D, Kanbay M, Lopes JA, Murray PT, Ortiz A, Sanz AB, Selby NM, Wiecek A, Massy ZA",13,1503,nephrology,2025-11-22
33579742,NephroTalk Multimodal Conservative Care Curriculum for Nephrology Fellows.,"Conservative care, a comprehensive treatment path for advanced kidney disease most suitable for individuals unlikely to benefit from dialysis, is underutilized in the United States. One reason is an absence of robust education about this approach and how to discuss it with potential candidates. To address this need, we developed a multimodal conservative care curriculum for nephrology fellows. This curriculum consists of four online modules that address essential concepts and communication skills related to conservative care. It is followed by an in-person, interactive, ""flipped classroom"" session facilitated by designated nephrology educators at participating Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education nephrology training programs. Curriculum effect was assessed using surveys completed by participating fellows immediately before and following the curriculum and for participating nephrology educators following flipped classroom teaching; 148 nephrology trainees from 19 programs participated, with 108 completing both pre- and postcurriculum surveys. Mean self-reported preparedness (measured on a five-point Likert scale) increased significantly for all ten concepts taught in the curriculum. The mean correct score on eight knowledge questions increased from 69% to 82% following the curriculum (<i>P</i><0.001). Fellows rated the curriculum highly and reported that they plan to practice skills learned. For the 19 nephrology program educators, the mean perceived preparedness to teach all curriculum domains increased after, compared with before, facilitating the flipped classroom, reaching significance for seven of the ten concepts measured. Data suggest that fellows' participation in a multimodal curriculum increased knowledge and preparation for fundamental conservative care concepts and communication skills. Fellows rated the curriculum highly. Educator participation appears to have increased preparedness for teaching the curriculum concepts, making it likely that future education in conservative care will become more widespread. Herein, we describe the curriculum content, which we have made publicly available in order to encourage broader implementation, and its effect on participating fellows and the nephrology educators who facilitated it.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2021-Jun,"Cohen RA, Bursic A, Chan E, Norman MK, Arnold RM, Schell JO",6,2287,nephrology,2025-11-22
35289764,Keys to Driving Implementation of the New Kidney Care Models.,"Contemporary nephrology practice is heavily weighted toward in-center hemodialysis, reflective of decisions on infrastructure and personnel in response to decades of policy. The Advancing American Kidney Health initiative seeks to transform care for patients and providers. Under the initiative's framework, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation has launched two new care models that align patient choice with provider incentives. The mandatory ESRD Treatment Choices model requires participation by all nephrology practices in designated Hospital Referral Regions, randomly selecting 30% of all Hospital Referral Regions across the United States for participation, with the remaining Hospital Referral Regions serving as controls. The voluntary Kidney Care Choices model offers alternative payment programs open to nephrology practices throughout the country. To help organize implementation of the models, we developed Driver Diagrams that serve as blueprints to identify structures, processes, and norms and generate intervention concepts. We focused on two goals that are directly applicable to nephrology practices and central to the incentive structure of the ESRD Treatment Choices and Kidney Care Choices: (<i>1</i>) increasing utilization of home dialysis, and (<i>2</i>) increasing the number of kidney transplants. Several recurring themes became apparent with implementation. Multiple stakeholders from assorted backgrounds are needed. Communication with primary care providers will facilitate timely referrals, education, and comanagement. Nephrology providers (nephrologists, nursing, dialysis organizations, others) must lead implementation. Patient engagement at nearly every step will help achieve the aims of the models. Advocacy with federal and state regulatory agencies will be crucial to expanding home dialysis and transplantation access. Although the models hold promise to improve choices and outcomes for many patients, we must be vigilant that they not do reinforce existing disparities in health care or widen known racial, socioeconomic, or geographic gaps. The Advancing American Kidney Health initiative has the potential to usher in a new era of value-based care for nephrology.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2022-Jul,"Kshirsagar AV, Weiner DE, Mendu ML, Liu F, Lew SQ, O'Neil TJ, Bieber SD, White DL, Zimmerman J, Mohan S",10,2220,nephrology,2025-11-22

A retrospective cohort study in three academic NICUs. We compared AKI identification, AKI incidence, nephrology consultation, and nephrology follow-up before and after implantation of local protocols to standardize neonatal AKI identification. Neonatal AKI identification improved in all three NICUs following protocol implementation (26-85%, P < 0.0001). Each center also saw increases in nephrology consultation (15-83%, P < 0.0001) and nephrology follow-up (7-73%, P < 0.0001). AKI incidence decreased significantly (21-12%, P < 0.0001). Multiple strategies can be successfully operationalized to improve neonatal AKI identification. While different in approach, each strategy resulted in increased AKI identification and nephrology involvement. This study emphasizes the importance of local standardized approaches to AKI to improve AKI identification and nephrology involvement in the NICU.",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,2022-Feb,"Starr MC, Chaudhry P, Brock A, Vincent K, Twombley K, Bonachea EM, Mohamed TH",7,1101,nephrology,2025-11-22
36800537,Engagement in Free Open Access Medical Education by US Nephrology Fellows.,"As free open access medical education (FOAMed) use increases, it is important to characterize how and why learners are using this educational material in nephrology. We describe the frequency, purpose, and type of FOAMed usage across US nephrology fellows. In this cross-sectional survey, items were emailed to all US adult and pediatric nephrology fellows via the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) Fellow Survey in May 2022. The eight-item survey, developed to measure FOAMed engagement, had previously undergone instrument validation. The results were analyzed by descriptive statistics. In total, 43% (359/842) adult nephrology fellows and 51% (45/88) pediatric nephrology fellows completed the survey. Seventy-four percent (300/404) of fellows reported using FOAMed, and 72% (215/300) started using FOAMed within the past 2 years. Of FOAMed users, 41% (122/300) reported viewing FOAMed and 33% (99/300) reported applying knowledge gained from these resources daily or weekly. Common purposes for FOAMed engagement included searching Twitter to learn about others' opinions in the field (43%; 130/300), reading blogs to answer clinical questions (35%; 105/300), and listening to podcasts for the most up-to-date information (39%; 116/300). Compared with traditional educational resources, fellows preferred using FOAMed for staying up to date on nephrology topics (75%) and answering clinical questions (37%). Among all fellows, the greatest barriers to FOAMed use were unfamiliarity with FOAMed (27%; 111/404), validity concerns (22%; 90/404), and a lack of a local community of FOAMed users (22%; 87/404). Seventy-four percent of nephrology fellows used FOAMed resources in a variety of ways, and of them, 33% of fellows clinically applied knowledge gained from these resources. Reasons for engaging with FOAMed varied across resources.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2023-May,"Larsen DM, Boscardin CK, Sparks MA",3,1844,nephrology,2025-11-22
38521377,From cardiorenal syndrome to nephrocardiology: The journey of exploring the interconnection between nephrology and cardiovascular medicine.,"The knowledge about the pathophysiology of cardiorenal syndrome has evolved remarkably over the past two decades. However, cardiorenal syndrome is only one subject within a much broader field of nephrocardiology, which encompasses the interconnection between nephrology and cardiovascular medicine from nine different standpoints of pathophysiology, epidemiology, prevention, prognosis, diagnosis, therapy, monitoring, risk factors and systemic diseases. The complexities of these nine elements of the interaction between nephrology and cardiovascular medicine are not adequately addressed in either of those two fields of medicine. Nephrocardiology is an emerging field in medicine aiming at addressing those subtleties to improve prognosis and quality of life of a large and vulnerable patient population with combined cardiovascular and nephrology related conditions.",Trends in cardiovascular medicine,2024-Nov,Hatamizadeh P,1,870,nephrology,2025-11-22

This study addresses the attitudes of medical students towards the subject and explores the causes of this lack of interest amongst potential specialty trainees. Students were asked to complete a survey ranking their attitudes towards nephrology and other specialties. This data was collated and analysed to show trends and allow comparison of the attitudes towards each specialty. Students felt that along with geriatrics, their least favourite subject was nephrology. Students felt unconfident in diagnosing, managing and understanding chronic conditions more so than acute conditions. Nephrology was consistently amongst the least popular subject for all areas of diagnosis, management and pathophysiology. Renal anatomy was the only area of nephrology that students felt confident in. The less popular specialties of nephrology and geriatrics had the greatest room for improvement when directly instructed in specialty medical training. Nephrology remains a problematic and unpopular specialty for medical students, driving their unwillingness to consider it as a future career route. This study identifies areas of misconception amongst medical students toward the specialty and highlights areas for improvement in renal training for students.",BMC medical education,2022-Sep,"Hull W, Jewell E, Shabir S, Borrows R",4,1336,nephrology,2025-11-22
34365919,Emerging Role of Circular RNAs in Kidney Diseases in Nephrology.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified to be involved in a variety of human diseases such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune diseases. In recent years, the role of circRNAs in the development of kidney diseases in nephrology has been gradually recognized. We updated and described the current status of circRNAs in kidney diseases in nephrology. We particularly focused on the roles and mechanisms of circRNAs in systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis. We summarized recent reports published on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Scielo databases using keywords circRNAs, kidney diseases or renal diseases, or systemic lupus erythematosus. Studies of circRNAs in certain kidney diseases, such as acute kidney injury, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, idiopathic membranous nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, hypertensive renal damage, and particular lupus nephritis address the function and pathogenesis of circRNAs. Mechanisms of circRNAs in the above human kidney diseases so far have focused on the role of sponging microRNAs and regulating the expression of target genes. Moreover, circRNAs have been detected in blood, urine, and kidney tissue samples. These results suggest that circRNAs can serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of the progression of kidney diseases. CircRNAs play important roles in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney diseases emphasizing lupus nephritis in nephrology.",Current drug targets,2022-,"Ma C, Luan J, Kopp JB, Zhou H",4,1477,nephrology,2025-11-22
37531201,Palliative Care Training in Pediatric Nephrology Fellowship: A Cross-Sectional Survey.,"Pediatric nephrology fellows have limited primary palliative exposure and opportunities to develop and refine primary palliative care (PC) skills. While experiential practice seems to improve confidence, most fellows have low confidence to provide primary PC. Fellows indicate a need and desire for additional PC training during nephrology fellowship. Children with CKD and their families encounter significant burdens. Integrating primary palliative care (PC), holistic care provided by nephrologists focused on enhancing quality of life through symptom management, stress relief, and high-quality serious illness communication, provides an opportunity to promote flourishing. Incorporation of primary PC education in training is therefore recommended. Yet, adult nephrology fellows report inadequate preparation to deliver primary PC. Similar experience of pediatric nephrology fellows is unknown. We sought to describe pediatric nephrology fellows' experience in providing primary PC and PC exposure during training. We administered a cross-sectional web-based survey to pediatric nephrology fellows associated with the American Society of Pediatric Nephrology listserv in May 2021. The survey was adapted from a previously validated instrument and pretested by stakeholder nephrologists and subspecialty PC physicians; queries included institutional and personal PC experience, training, and confidence in primary PC delivery. Data were summarized descriptively. Response rate was 32% (32/101). Respondents were 81% female and 50% White; 87% practiced in an urban setting. Only one fellow (3%) completed a PC rotation during fellowship, and 15 respondents (48%) completed a rotation in medical school or residency. Fellows reported substantially more practice conducting kidney biopsies than family meetings; 68% of fellows had performed >10 kidney biopsies, and 3% of fellows had led >10 family meetings. Confidence in navigating challenging communication, addressing psychological distress, or managing physical symptoms associated with CKD was generally low. Fellows with greater exposure to family meetings reported more confidence navigating challenging communication. Fellows endorsed a need for additional training; 97% indicated that training should happen during fellowship. Few pediatric nephrology fellows receive PC education or exposure during training, resulting in low rates of knowledge and confidence in primary PC delivery. Fellows indicate a need and desire for improved PC training.",Kidney360,2023-Oct,"House TR, Wightman A, Smith J, Schwarze M, Bradford MC, Rosenberg AR",6,2506,nephrology,2025-11-22

As a result, their emotional and psychological health can be at risk. In addition, there has been unprecedented stress and uncertainty working as nephrology nurses during the pandemic. These stressors can have negative effects on nurses' health, resulting in burnout and/or compassion fatigue, which can lead to nurses leaving nephrology or the nursing profession. Mindfulness has been suggested as a strategy to mitigate work-related stressors and build a more resilient workforce. Our experience suggests that combining self-compassion practices with mindfulness is also effective. Mindfulness may be beneficial for nephrology nurses, but its use does not negate the need for organizations to address the structural system issues that also contribute to burnout.",Nephrology nursing journal : journal of the American Nephrology Nurses' Association,2021-,"Harwood L, Wilson B, Crandall J, Morano C",4,845,nephrology,2025-11-22
37851468,Performance of ChatGPT on Nephrology Test Questions.,"ChatGPT is a novel tool that allows people to engage in conversations with an advanced machine learning model. ChatGPT's performance in the US Medical Licensing Examination is comparable with a successful candidate's performance. However, its performance in the nephrology field remains undetermined. This study assessed ChatGPT's capabilities in answering nephrology test questions. Questions sourced from Nephrology Self-Assessment Program and Kidney Self-Assessment Program were used, each with multiple-choice single-answer questions. Questions containing visual elements were excluded. Each question bank was run twice using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Total accuracy rate, defined as the percentage of correct answers obtained by ChatGPT in either the first or second run, and the total concordance, defined as the percentage of identical answers provided by ChatGPT during both runs, regardless of their correctness, were used to assess its performance. A comprehensive assessment was conducted on a set of 975 questions, comprising 508 questions from Nephrology Self-Assessment Program and 467 from Kidney Self-Assessment Program. GPT-3.5 resulted in a total accuracy rate of 51%. Notably, the employment of Nephrology Self-Assessment Program yielded a higher accuracy rate compared with Kidney Self-Assessment Program (58% versus 44%; P < 0.001). The total concordance rate across all questions was 78%, with correct answers exhibiting a higher concordance rate (84%) compared with incorrect answers (73%) ( P < 0.001). When examining various nephrology subfields, the total accuracy rates were relatively lower in electrolyte and acid-base disorder, glomerular disease, and kidney-related bone and stone disorders. The total accuracy rate of GPT-4's response was 74%, higher than GPT-3.5 ( P < 0.001) but remained below the passing threshold and average scores of nephrology examinees (77%).

32123052,Burnout and Emotional Well-Being among Nephrology Fellows: A National Online Survey.,"Physician burnout and emotional distress are associated with work dissatisfaction and provision of suboptimal patient care. Little is known about burnout among nephrology fellows. Validated items on burnout, depressive symptoms, and well being were included in the American Society of Nephrology annual survey emailed to US nephrology fellows in May to June 2018. Burnout was defined as an affirmative response to two single-item questions of experiencing emotional exhaustion or depersonalization. Responses from 347 of 808 eligible first- and second-year adult nephrology fellows were examined (response rate=42.9%). Most fellows were aged 30-34 years (56.8%), male (62.0%), married or partnered (72.6%), international medical graduates (62.5%), and pursuing a clinical nephrology fellowship (87.0%). Emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were reported by 28.0% and 14.4% of the fellows, respectively, with an overall burnout prevalence of 30.0%. Most fellows indicated having strong program leadership (75.2%), positive work-life balance (69.2%), presence of social support (89.3%), and career satisfaction (73.2%); 44.7% reported a disruptive work environment and 35.4% reported depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression revealed a statistically significant association between female gender (odds ratio [OR], 1.90; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.09 to 3.32), poor work-life balance (OR, 3.97; 95% CI, 2.22 to 7.07), or a disruptive work environment (OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.48 to 4.66) and burnout. About one third of US nephrology fellows surveyed reported experiencing burnout and depressive symptoms.

32184295,Nephrology Fellows' and Program Directors' Perceptions of Hospital Rounds in the United States.,"Hospital rounds are a traditional vehicle for patient-care delivery and experiential learning for trainees. We aimed to characterize practices and perceptions of rounds in United States nephrology training programs. We conducted a national survey of United States nephrology fellows and program directors. Fellows received the survey after completing the 2019 National Board of Medical Examiners Nephrology In-Training Exam. Program directors received the survey at the American Society of Nephrology's 2019 Nephrology Training Program Directors' Retreat. Surveys assessed the structure and perceptions of rounds, focusing on workload, workflow, value for patient care, and fellows' clinical skill-building. Directors were queried about their expectations for fellow prerounds and efficiency of rounds. Responses were quantified by proportions. Fellow and program director response rates were 73% (<i>n</i>=621) and 70% (<i>n</i>=55). Most fellows (74%) report a patient census of >15, arrive at the hospital before 7:00 am (59%), and complete progress notes after 5:00 pm (46%). Among several rounding activities, fellows most valued bedside discussions for building their clinical skills (34%), but only 30% examine all patients with the attending at the bedside. Most directors (71%) expect fellows to both examine patients and collect data before attending-rounds. A majority (78%) of directors commonly complete their documentation after 5:00 pm, and for 36%, after 8:00 pm. Like fellows, directors most value bedside discussion for development of fellows' clinical skills (44%). Lack of preparedness for the rigors of nephrology fellowship was the most-cited barrier to efficient rounds (31%). Hospital rounds in United States nephrology training programs are characterized by high patient volumes, early-morning starts, and late-evening clinical documentation. Fellows use a variety of prerounding styles and examine patients at the beside with their attendings at different frequencies.

36058402,Creating KidneyPal: A Specialty-Aligned Palliative Care Service for People with Kidney Disease.,"Patients with kidney disease have notable unmet palliative care needs and represent an underserved population for specialty palliative care teams. We designed a specialty-aligned interprofessional palliative care service called KidneyPal that is aimed at improving delivery of palliative care to patients with kidney disease through focus groups and iterative improvement cycles. We iteratively measured the development of KidneyPal through clinical process metrics: percent of the inpatient nephrology census followed by KidneyPal, patient demographics, consult origin, clinician feedback, and self-reported team interventions. KidneyPal saw 314 unique patients from January 2019 to January 2021. The majority of consultations came from nephrology services though the source of consultation changed over time. We consulted on an average of 13.5% of the entire inpatient nephrology patient hospital census with highest involvement with patients on the inpatient nephrology hemodialysis service (mean of 29.9%). KidneyPal was rated highly by surveyed nephrology clinicians and provided high rates of psychosocial support and goals of care interventions. The creation of KidneyPal led to us to serve a new cohort of patients with specialty palliative care. We grew over time to serve the full range of patients with kidney disease as defined by our nephrology service lines. We succeeded in doing so by embedding in nephrology and building relationships with those caring for people with kidney disease while tailoring our service and interventions over time.",Journal of pain and symptom management,2022-Dec,"Lakin JR, Sciacca K, Leiter R, Killeen K, Gelfand S, Tulsky JA, Anderson S, Zupanc SN, Williams T, Mandel EI",10,1557,nephrology,2025-11-22

33413803,Teaching nephrology as part of a degree in medicine.,"The teaching of nephrology as part of a degree in medicine is potentially one of the most decisive factors when choosing a speciality. Until now, however, we have not had an overview of the teaching of nephrology in Spain. We have integrated information available in public databases with a survey and personal interviews with those responsible for teaching in Spanish medical faculties. In 2019, there were 44 universities offering a medicine degree in Spain, in 16 Autonomous Communities (34 of which were public and 10 private). For learning purposes, students have a number of hospital beds ranging from 0.2 to 4.7, and there are Autonomous Communities that have a higher proportion of students per inhabitant or per physician, such as Madrid or the Community of Navarra. In 16 universities there are tenured teaching staff (professors and lecturers), in 8 contracted medical lecturers, and in 2 assistant lecturers. In 21 medical faculties, theoretical and practical nephrology is taught by associate lecturers. The subject is taught between the third and fifth years of the degree, the median being the fourth year. It is usually integrated with another subject and only in the University of Navarra is it an independent subject, with 3 credits. The total number of hours devoted to theoretical teaching (both theoretical classes and seminars) is highly variable and ranges from 11 to 35, with a median of 17.5. Variability is observed in both the number of theoretical subjects (range 11 to 31) and seminars (range 0 to 9). Among the faculties that teach seminars, the ratio of theoretical topics to seminars ranges from 1.6 to 18. Most faculties evaluate clinical practices with various modalities and percentage of assessment. Knowledge is mostly assessed by a multiple choice exam. In conclusion, there is a high level of variability in the curriculum for the teaching of nephrology as part of a degree in medicine in Spain. Teaching staff who are tenured or who have a stable affiliation with universities make up just 23% of the total and, in many faculties, teaching depends exclusively on associate professors.",Nefrologia,2021-,"de Arriba G, Ortiz Arduán A, Rodríguez Pérez JC, Tejedor Jorge A, Santamaría Olmo R, Rodríguez Portillo M",6,2124,nephrology,2025-11-22

POCUS has multiple applications in nephrology practice, including evaluation of obstructive uropathy, objective assessment of volume status, arteriovenous access assessment, and procedural guidance. However, unlike specialties such as emergency medicine, POCUS training is not yet integrated into most nephrology fellowship curricula, and the sonographic applications taught vary widely among fellowship programs. In this article, we have used our institutional experience to provide a roadmap or blueprint for nephrology programs looking to create a POCUS program. We provide an overview of the curriculum, including the basic organization, applications taught, online resources, milestone development, and quality assessment. We also discuss the nuances of POCUS workflow and perspectives on billing for these limited studies. In addition, we share the evaluation forms and sample documentation we use in our program.

This population faces specific issues such as fertility concerns, complex contraceptive decisions, and complications related to pregnancy that can exacerbate CKD. Given the increasing prevalence of CKD among young men and women owing to rising rates of hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, there is a need for early and tailored interventions among women of childbearing age. Current Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines suggest nephrology referral primarily for advanced CKD stages or significant proteinuria. However, women at any CKD stage may face complex pregnancy-related decisions and increased risks that are not adequately addressed by these guidelines, warranting early specialty care. This review explores the distinct needs of women of reproductive age with CKD, identifies gaps in the existing management framework, and advocates for earlier and more comprehensive nephrology involvement. By focusing on preconception planning, risk factor management, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and existing disparities in care, this review seeks to improve understanding of the needs of women of reproductive age with CKD and calls for a shift towards more proactive, nephrology-driven care.",BMC nephrology,2024-Dec,"Srialluri N, Thavarajah S",2,1334,nephrology,2025-11-22

The survey has been focused on the integration of nephrologists in COVID-19 teams, nephrology inpatient care activities (elective admissions, kidney biopsies), the performance of elective surgeries such as vascular accesses or implantation of peritoneal catheters, the suspension of kidney transplantation programmes and the transformation of nephrology outpatient clinics. This work details the adaptation and transformation of nephrology services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. During this period, elective admissions to Nephrology Services, elective surgeries and biopsies were suspended, and the kidney transplant programme was scaled back by more than 75%. It is worth noting that outpatient nephrology consultations were carried out largely by telephone. In conclusion, the pandemic has clearly impacted clinical activity in Spanish Nephrology departments, reducing elective activity and kidney transplants, and modifying activity in outpatient clinics. A restructuring and implementation plan in Nephrology focused on telemedicine and/or virtual medicine would seem to be both necessary and very useful in the near future.",Nefrologia,2020-,"Soler MJ, Macia Heras M, Ortiz A, Del Pino Y Pino MD, Salgueira Lazo M",5,1641,nephrology,2025-11-22

In kidney care, nephrology NP can manage patients at various points along the chronic kidney disease (CKD) trajectory. To profile the characteristics, service patterns, and domains of practice of nephrology NP in Australia. A cross-sectional online secure survey. Nephrology NP (NP students) who were members of the Renal Society of Australasia and working in Australia (n = 73). Data collected were demographic and practice characteristics, and domains of practice (using the modified Strong Model of Advanced Practice). The survey also sought qualitative perspectives of the enablers and barriers to sustainability nurse practitioner healthcare delivery services. Nephrology NP (n = 45) primarily worked in adult services, managing those receiving haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or patients with earlier grades of CKD. Providing direct comprehensive care was the dominant domain of advanced practice although administrative activities took up considerable time each week. Support from nurse leaders and medical colleagues was identified as key enablers for sustainability of these services whereas succession planning, and workload were the main barriers. This study found a highly qualified, experienced but older nephrology nurse practitioner workforce who provide an additional model of health service delivery which can meet the growing CKD burden. Internationally, this level of nurse provides an opportunity for a career pathway to maintain nurses in direct clinical roles and to expand the nephrology nursing workforce.",Journal of renal care,2023-Dec,"Bonner A, Douglas B, Brown L, Harvie B, Lucas A, Tomlins M, Gillespie K",7,1628,nephrology,2025-11-22

A position paper from the coordinating committee from the Working Group for Cardiorenal Medicine of the Spanish Society of Nephrology.,"Patients with the dual burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) experience unacceptably high rates of morbidity and mortality, which also entail unfavorable effects on healthcare systems. Currently, concerted efforts to identify, prevent and treat CVD in CKD patients are lacking at the institutional level, with emphasis still being placed on individual specialty views on this topic. The authors of this position paper endorse the need for a dedicated interdisciplinary team of subspecialists in cardio-nephrology that manages appropriate clinical interventions across the inpatient and outpatient settings. There is a critical need for training programs, guidelines and best clinical practice models, and research funding from nephrology, cardiology and other professional societies, to support the development of the subspecialty of cardio-nephrology. This position paper from the coordinating committee from the Working Group for Cardiorenal Medicine of the Spanish Society of Nephrology (S.E.N.) is intended to be the starting point to develop the subspecialty of cardio-nephrology within the S.E.N..

35373132,The Kidney Diet Challenge: An Experiential Educational Experience.,"Health care providers who care for patients with CKD must be able to provide effective counseling about a kidney-friendly diet. Nutrition is underemphasized in medical curricula, and the kidney diet is one of the most challenging diets. We hypothesized that participation in an experiential educational program in kidney diet would result in improved knowledge of the underlying principles behind it and provide concrete examples of how to explain this diet to patients. The first part of this study was a knowledge assessment administered to all US nephrology fellows during the 2020 National Board of Medical Examiners Nephrology In-Training Examination. We later opened the assessment to a broader, global audience <i>via</i> social media. Respondents included trainees, practicing nephrologists, dieticians, and other health professionals. Participants self-identified willingness to participate in the second part of the study, the Kidney Diet Challenge (KDC). The 5-day challenge included daily webinars by experts in nutrition. Daily surveys captured self-reported adherence to the diet. Social media was used to engage with participants. All participants received a follow-up knowledge assessment. Among the nephrology fellows (<i>n</i>=317), the median pretest score was 2 out of 5 (40%) questions correct, and results did not differ by year of training (<i>P</i>=0.31). Of the participants (<i>n</i>=70) who completed the 5-day challenge and responded to the post-challenge survey, the distribution of the number of correct answers improved after the KDC (median [25th, 75th percentile]: 3 [2, 3] versus 3 [2, 4]; <i>P</i><0.001). Statistics from our official hashtag for this study (#kidneydietchallenge) showed that we achieved 406,241 reaches and 1,004,799 impressions, with a total of 974 posts using this hashtag.

Despite all interesting aspects of nephrology, there is a lack of interest by young physicians for the specialty worldwide. Great discoveries have been made throughout the years, leading to great achievements in diagnosis, classification, and treatment of kidney diseases. There is a current interest in the search for novel biomarkers for early detection of kidney dysfunction, and, in the future, there will be novel diagnostic tests for kidney diseases. There have been significant improvements in dialysis and transplant techniques, and novel modalities are being studied, including new renal replacement therapy modalities, such as the wearable artificial kidney. Another trend in the contemporary world, and one that should increase in the future, is the increasing patient connectivity, using novel technologies that will allow access to healthcare and improve outcomes.",Contributions to nephrology,2021-,"Silva Junior G, Gadonski G, Ferreiro Fuentes A, Nangaku M, Remuzzi G, Ronco C",6,1023,nephrology,2025-11-22
37916609,Roadmaps to green nephrology: a mediterranean point of view.,"Green nephrology is a movement whose aim is to find ways to reduce the environmental impact of kidney care. The question is of particular concern in this field since haemodialysis is one of the major contributors to waste generation, energy use and water consumption in healthcare. Although several ways for improving sustainability have been advocated, they are all context sensitive. This review aims to analyse the interventions that have been proposed to improve the ecologic sustainability and reduce the carbon footprint of nephrology care adapting to specific settings, and taking advantage of local expertise. Green hospitals are becoming a reality in several high-income settings, thanks to new building guidelines, with greater awareness of climate change and users' demands. Water saving is feasible, and is increasingly done, in different ways (improving hardware, reducing and adapting dialysate flows). Recycling noncontaminated plastic waste is feasible, but is still rarely performed. However, ecological transition has been slow even in high-income countries, while in low and middle-income countries lack of resources limit the ability to cope with the planet's urgent needs. Conversely, where man-power cost is low, some time-consuming tasks, such as separation of various components for recycling may be affordable. Theoretically, implementation of all clinical tasks aiming to avoid or retard dialysis, should be a priority. There is no single roadmap for achieving green nephrology. Each setting should start from those feasible interventions most in line with its specific needs and priorities.",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,2024-Jan,"Ben Hmida M, Torreggiani M, Berman-Parks N, Salomone M, Piccoli GB",5,1617,nephrology,2025-11-22

Frontline clinicians are in a great position to identify clinical problems and find innovative solutions. The current review describes the method used for quality improvement based on the Model for Improvement, a structural framework to guide improvement work. At its basis are three fundamental questions: What are we trying to accomplish? How will I know that a change will lead to improvement? And what changes could we make that will result in improvement? This preparation phase aims to identify and understand the problem, choose an intervention, and determine reliable measures to gauge improvement. The intervention is then tested using PLAN-DO-STUDY-ACT (PDSA) cycles, an iterative approach to systematically improve processes and outcomes. PLAN focuses on defining the goal of the cycle and describing in details what will be done. DO concentrates on the concrete application of the plan. STUDY focuses on data analyses as ACT identifies lessons learned from the cycle and orientate the goals of the following PDSA cycle. Learning from each cycle, developing an interdisciplinary team and repeated interventions are core principles involved in implementing a sustainable quality improvement program. The Model for Improvement will be illustrated by a common quality problem in pediatric nephrology.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2020-Feb,"Gaudreault-Tremblay MM, McQuillan RF, Parekh RS, Noone D",4,1396,nephrology,2025-11-22
36716222,Determinants of Interest in Nephrology Career Choice among Internal Medicine Junior Residents in Nigeria.,"There has been decreased interest in postgraduate nephrology training over the years. This trend could worsen the shortage of nephrologists and inability to meet the health needs of patients with kidney diseases if not urgently addressed. To determine interest in and determinants of nephrology career choice among junior internal medicine residents in Nigeria. This was a cross-sectional study that enrolled 273 junior residents in internal medicine across Nigeria. A self-administered questionnaire that was adapted from two previous studies was used for data collection. The mean age of the respondents was 33.6±4.4 years with a male: female ratio of 1.8:1. This study showed that 16.8% and 21.6% of junior residents in internal medicine considered nephrology as their first and second choice area to specialize, respectively. Factors that ranked high as determinants of a decision to do nephrology were personal interest (94.3%), opportunities to perform renal procedures (93.3%), and exposure to nephrology training (85.7%). Factors that discouraged a choice of nephrology according to respondents were high mortality of renal patients (67.3%), poor outcomes of renal patients (70.2%), in ability to fund treatment by renal patients (66.1%), unsatisfactory life-work balance among nephrologists (60.7%), and late presentation of renal patients (59.0%). Others were high workload compared to available doctors (59.0%) and poor job satisfaction (55.4%). Factors that could stimulate more interest in nephrology according to respondents included creation of better working environment with adequate equipment for training (96.3%), provision of health insurance with adequate coverage for renal patients (97.4%), and increased government support for renal care services (99.3%). There is a need to promote and sustain interest of residents in nephrology by ensuring improved survival of patients through better access to renal care, ensuring an adequate and well motivated work force, provision of adequate facilities and health insurance services.",West African journal of medicine,2023-Jan,"Adejumo OA, Egbi OG, Okaka E, Ogiator MO, Ademola BL, Ngoka SC, Enikuomehin AC, Abolarin OS, Edeki IR",9,2049,nephrology,2025-11-22

Radical changes have been needed to prevent disruptions in patient care and medical education. A web-based survey was sent to European Society for Pediatric Nephrology (ESPN) members via the ESPN mailing list to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on delivery of pediatric nephrology (PN) care and educational activities. There were ten questions with subheadings. Seventy-six centers from 24 countries completed the survey. The time period was between the beginning of the pandemic and May 30, 2020. The number of patients admitted in PN wards and outpatient clinics were significantly decreased (2.2 and 4.5 times, respectively). Telemedicine tools, electronic prescriptions, online applications for off-label drugs, and remote access to laboratory/imaging results were used in almost half of the centers. Despite staff training and protective measures, 33% of centers reported COVID-19 infected staff, and 29% infected patients. Difficulties in receiving pharmaceuticals were reported in 25% of centers. Sixty percent of centers suspended living-related kidney transplantation, and one-third deceased-donor kidney transplantation. Hands-on education was suspended in 91% of medical schools, and face-to-face teaching was replaced by online systems in 85%. Multidisciplinary training in PN was affected in 54% of the centers. This survey showed a sharp decline in patient admissions and a significant decrease in kidney transplantation. Telemedicine and online teaching became essential tools, requiring integration into the current system. The prolonged and fluctuating course of the pandemic may pose additional challenges necessitating urgent and rational solutions.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2022-Aug,"Yazıcıoğlu B, Bakkaloğlu SA",2,1770,nephrology,2025-11-22
38353783,Performance of ChatGPT and Bard in self-assessment questions for nephrology board renewal.,"Large language models (LLMs) have impacted advances in artificial intelligence. While LLMs have demonstrated high performance in general medical examinations, their performance in specialized areas such as nephrology is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate ChatGPT and Bard in their potential nephrology applications. Ninety-nine questions from the Self-Assessment Questions for Nephrology Board Renewal from 2018 to 2022 were presented to two versions of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and Bard. We calculated the correct answer rates for the five years, each year, and question categories and checked whether they exceeded the pass criterion. The correct answer rates were compared with those of the nephrology residents. The overall correct answer rates for GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard were 31.3% (31/99), 54.5% (54/99), and 32.3% (32/99), respectively, thus GPT-4 significantly outperformed GPT-3.5 (p < 0.01) and Bard (p < 0.01). GPT-4 passed in three years, barely meeting the minimum threshold in two. GPT-4 demonstrated significantly higher performance in problem-solving, clinical, and non-image questions than GPT-3.5 and Bard. GPT-4's performance was between third- and fourth-year nephrology residents. GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 and Bard and met the Nephrology Board renewal standards in specific years, albeit marginally.

36434513,Albuminuria testing and nephrology care among insured US adults with chronic kidney disease: a missed opportunity.,"In chronic kidney disease (CKD), assessment of both estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria are necessary for stratifying risk and determining the need for nephrology referral. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes clinical practice guidelines for CKD recommend nephrology referral for eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> or for urinary albumin/creatinine ratio ≥ 300 mg/g. Using a national claims database of US patients covered by commercial insurance or Medicare Advantage, we identified patients with CKD who were actively followed in primary care. We examined receipt of nephrology care within 1 year among these patients according to their stage of CKD, classified using eGFR and albuminuria categories. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine odds of receiving nephrology care by CKD category, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, diabetes, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. Among 291,155 patients with CKD, 55% who met guideline-recommended referral criteria had seen a nephrologist. Receipt of guideline-recommended nephrology care was higher among those with eGFR < 30 (64%; 11,330/17738) compared with UACR ≥300 mg/g (51%; 8789/17290). 59% did not have albuminuria testing. Those patients without albuminuria testing had substantially lower adjusted odds of recommended nephrology care (aOR 0.47 [0.43, 0.52] for eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>). Similar patterns were observed in analyses stratified by diabetes status. Only half of patients meeting laboratory criteria for nephrology referral were seen by a nephrologist.

38256408,Chain of Thought Utilization in Large Language Models and Application in Nephrology.,"Chain-of-thought prompting enhances the abilities of large language models (LLMs) significantly. It not only makes these models more specific and context-aware but also impacts the wider field of artificial intelligence (AI). This approach broadens the usability of AI, increases its efficiency, and aligns it more closely with human thinking and decision-making processes. As we improve this method, it is set to become a key element in the future of AI, adding more purpose, precision, and ethical consideration to these technologies. In medicine, the chain-of-thought prompting is especially beneficial. Its capacity to handle complex information, its logical and sequential reasoning, and its suitability for ethically and context-sensitive situations make it an invaluable tool for healthcare professionals. Its role in enhancing medical care and research is expected to grow as we further develop and use this technique. Chain-of-thought prompting bridges the gap between AI's traditionally obscure decision-making process and the clear, accountable standards required in healthcare. It does this by emulating a reasoning style familiar to medical professionals, fitting well into their existing practices and ethical codes. While solving AI transparency is a complex challenge, the chain-of-thought approach is a significant step toward making AI more comprehensible and trustworthy in medicine. This review focuses on understanding the workings of LLMs, particularly how chain-of-thought prompting can be adapted for nephrology's unique requirements. It also aims to thoroughly examine the ethical aspects, clarity, and future possibilities, offering an in-depth view of the exciting convergence of these areas.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2024-Jan,"Miao J, Thongprayoon C, Suppadungsuk S, Krisanapan P, Radhakrishnan Y, Cheungpasitporn W",6,1719,nephrology,2025-11-22

39587463,Nephrology providers' perspective and use of mortality prognostic tools in dialysis patients.,"Mortality prognostic tools exist to aid in shared decision making with kidney failure patients but are underutilized. This study aimed to elucidate nephrology providers' practice patterns and understand barriers to prognostic tool use. Nephrology providers (8 physicians and 2 nurse practitioners) at an academic medical center underwent semi-structured interviews regarding their experience and perspective on the utility of mortality prognostic tools. Common themes were identified independently by 2 reviewers using grounded theory. Three six-month mortality prognostic tools were applied to the 279 prevalent dialysis patients that the interviewed providers care for. The C statistic was calculated for each tool via logistic regression and subsequent ROC analysis. Nephrology providers reviewed the performance of the prognostication tools in their own patient population. A post interview reassessed perspectives and any change in attitudes regarding the tools. Nephrology providers did not use these mortality prognostic tools in their practice. Key barriers identified were provider concern that the tools were not generalizable to their patients, providers' trust in their own clinical judgement over that of a prognostic tool, time constraints, and lack of knowledge about the data behind these tools. When re-interviewed with the results of the three prognostic tools in their patients, providers thought the tools performed as expected, but still did not intend to use the tools in their practice. They reported that these tools are good for populations, but not individual patients. The providers preferred to use clinical gestalt for prognostication. Although several well validated prognostic tools are available for predicting mortality, the nephrology providers studied do not use them in routine practice, even after an educational intervention. Other approaches should be explored to help incorporate prognostication in shared-decision-making for patients receiving dialysis.",BMC nephrology,2024-Nov,"Bergeron J, Marchese C, Jensen C, Meagher S, Kennedy AG, Tompkins B, Cheung KL",7,1994,nephrology,2025-11-22
37031361,Nephrology-tailored geriatric assessment as decision-making tool in kidney failure.,"Dialysis might not benefit all older patients with kidney failure, particularly those with multimorbid conditions and frailty. Patients' and healthcare professionals' awareness of the presence of geriatric impairments could improve outcomes by tailoring treatment plans and decisions for individual patients. We aimed to explore the perspectives of patients and healthcare professionals on nephrology-tailored geriatric assessment to fuel decision-making for treatment choices in older patients with kidney failure. In an exploratory qualitative study using focus groups, participants discussed perspectives on the use and value of nephrology-tailored geriatric assessment for the decision-making process to start or forego dialysis. Patients (n = 18) with kidney failure, caregivers (n = 4), and professionals (n = 25) were purposively sampled from 10 hospitals. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and inductively analysed using thematic analysis. Three main themes emerged that supported or impeded decision-making in kidney failure: (1) patient psycho-social situation; (2) patient-related factors on modality choice; (3) organisation of health care. Patients reported feeling vulnerable due to multiple chronic conditions, old age, experienced losses in life and their willingness to trade longevity for quality of life. Professionals recognised the added value of nephrology-tailored geriatric assessment in three major themes: (i) facilitating continual holistic assessment, (ii) filling the knowledge gap, and (iii) uncovering important patient characteristics. nephrology-tailored geriatric assessment was perceived as a valuable tool to identify geriatric impairments in older patients with kidney failure.

Fisher exact, chi-squared, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare the frequencies of responses and the average responses between fellows and training program directors/associate program directors when possible. Fellow and training program directors/associate program directors response rates were 69% and 37%, respectively. Only 38% of fellows (240 respondents) reported receiving POCUS education during their fellowship, and just 33% of those who did receive POCUS training reported feeling competent to use POCUS independently. Similarly, just 23% of training program directors/associate program directors indicated that they had a POCUS curriculum in place, although 74% of training program directors and associate program directors indicated that a program was in development or that there was interest in creating a POCUS curriculum. Most fellow and faculty respondents rated commonly covered POCUS topics-including dialysis access imaging and kidney biopsy-as ""important"" or ""very important,"" with the greatest interest in diagnostic kidney ultrasound. Guided scanning with an instructor was the highest-rated teaching strategy. The most frequently reported barrier to POCUS program development was the lack of available instructors. Despite high trainee and faculty interest in POCUS, the majority of current nephrology fellows are not receiving POCUS training. Hands-on training guided by an instructor is highly valued, yet availability of adequately trained instructors remains a barrier to program development.

31866229,Moral Distress in Nephrology: Perceived Barriers to Ethical Clinical Care.,"Moral distress occurs when individuals are unable to act in accordance with what they believe to be ethically correct or just. It results from a discrepancy between a clinician's perception of ""the right thing to do"" and what is actually happening and is perpetuated by perceived constraints that limit the individual from speaking up or enacting change. Moral distress is reported by many clinicians in caring for patients with serious illness, including chronic kidney disease and kidney failure. If left unidentified, unexpressed, or unaddressed, moral distress may cause burnout, exhaustion, detachment, and ineffectiveness. At an extreme, moral distress may lead to a desire to abandon the speciality entirely. This article offers an international perspective on moral distress in nephrology in diverse contexts and health care systems. We examine and discuss the sociocultural factors that contribute to moral distress in nephrology and offer suggestions for interventions from individual provider, facility, and health care systems perspectives to reduce the impact of moral distress on nephrology providers.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2020-Aug,"Ducharlet K, Philip J, Gock H, Brown M, Gelfand SL, Josland EA, Brennan F",7,1115,nephrology,2025-11-22
37851423,Development and Validation of a Formative Assessment Tool for Nephrology Fellows' Clinical Reasoning.,"Diagnostic errors are commonly driven by failures in clinical reasoning. Deficits in clinical reasoning are common among graduate medical learners, including nephrology fellows. We created and validated an instrument to assess clinical reasoning in a national cohort of nephrology fellows and established performance thresholds for remedial coaching. Experts in nephrology education and clinical reasoning remediation designed an instrument to measure clinical reasoning through a written patient encounter note from a web-based, simulated AKI consult. The instrument measured clinical reasoning in three domains: problem representation, differential diagnosis with justification, and diagnostic plan with justification. Inter-rater reliability was established in a pilot cohort ( n =7 raters) of first-year nephrology fellows using a two-way random effects agreement intraclass correlation coefficient model. The instrument was then administered to a larger cohort of first-year fellows to establish performance standards for coaching using the Hofstee method ( n =6 raters). In the pilot cohort, there were 15 fellows from four training program, and in the study cohort, there were 61 fellows from 20 training programs. The intraclass correlation coefficients for problem representation, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic plan were 0.90, 0.70, and 0.50, respectively. Passing thresholds (% total points) in problem representation, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic plan were 59%, 57%, and 62%, respectively. Fifty-nine percent ( n =36) met the threshold for remedial coaching in at least one domain. We provide validity evidence for a simulated AKI consult for formative assessment of clinical reasoning in nephrology fellows. Most fellows met criteria for coaching in at least one of three reasoning domains, demonstrating a need for learner assessment and instruction in clinical reasoning.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2024-Jan,"Boyle SM, Martindale J, Parsons AS, Sozio SM, Hilburg R, Bahrainwala J, Chan L, Stern LD, Warburton KM",9,1904,nephrology,2025-11-22

For patients whose condition is more compromised, receiving dialysis as a life-sustaining therapy may not improve longevity or quality of life. Palliative care for patients with kidney disease (also termed <i>kidney supportive care</i> [KSC]) is appropriate for this patient population. Nephrology nurses working in dialysis are well positioned to talk with patients about what patients perceive constitutes a meaningful life or death. A literature review was undertaken to find evidence about if and how nephrology nurses engage in KSC with patients receiving dialysis. Based on the 29 articles included in this review, the overarching finding was nephrology nurses working in dialysis <i>are not</i> routinely engaging in KSC.

39603330,Establishing Research Priorities in Geriatric Nephrology: A Delphi Study of Clinicians and Researchers.,"Despite substantial growth of the population of older adults with kidney disease, there remains a lack of evidence to guide clinical care for this group. The Kidney Disease and Aging Research Collaborative conducted a Delphi study to build consensus on research priorities for clinical geriatric nephrology. Asynchronous modified Delphi study. Clinicians and researchers in the United States and Canada with clinical experience and/or research expertise in geriatric nephrology. Research priorities in geriatric nephrology. In the first Delphi round, participants submitted free-text descriptions of research priorities considered important for improving the clinical care of older adults with kidney disease. Delphi moderators used inductive content analysis to group concepts into categories. In the second and third rounds, participants iteratively reviewed topics, selected their top 5 priorities, and offered comments used to revise categories. Among 121 who were invited, 57 participants (47%) completed the first Delphi round and 48 (84% of enrolled participants) completed all rounds. After 3 rounds, the 5 priorities with the highest proportion of agreement were (1) communication and decision-making about treatment options for older adults with kidney failure (69% agreement), (2) quality of life, symptom management, and palliative care (67%), (3) frailty and physical function (54%), (4) tailoring therapies for kidney disease to specific needs of older adults (42%), and (5) caregiver and social support (35%). Health equity and person-centricity were identified as cross-cutting features that informed all topics. Relatively low response rate and limited participation by private practitioners and older clinicians and researchers.

31492489,Nephrology in the Academic Intensive Care Unit: A Qualitative Study of Interdisciplinary Collaboration.,"Collaboration between nephrology consultants and intensive care unit (ICU) teams is important in light of the high incidence of acute kidney injury in today's ICUs. Although there is considerable debate about how nephrology consultants and ICU teams should collaborate, communicative dynamics between the 2 parties remain poorly understood. This article describes interactions between nephrology consultants and ICU teams in the academic medical setting. Focused ethnography using semi-structured interviews and participant observation. Purposive sampling was used to enroll nephrologists, nephrology fellows, and ICU practitioners across several roles collaborating in 3 ICUs (a medical ICU, a surgical ICU, and a cardiothoracic surgical ICU) of a large urban US academic medical center. Participant observation (150 hours) and semi-structured interviews (35) continued until theoretical saturation. Interview and fieldnote transcripts were coded in an iterative team-based process. Explanation was developed using an abductive approach. Nephrology consultants and surgical ICU teams exhibited discordant preferences about the aggressiveness of renal replacement therapy based on different understandings of physiology, goals of care, and acuity. Collaborative difficulties resulting from this discordance led to nephrology consultants often serving as dialysis proceduralists rather than diagnosticians in surgical ICUs and to consultants sometimes choosing not to express disagreements about clinical care because of the belief that doing so would not lead to changes in the course of care. Aspects of this single-site study of an academic medical center may not be generalizable to other clinical settings and samples. Surgical team perspectives would provide further detail about nephrology consultation in surgical ICUs. The effects of findings on patient care were not examined. Differences in approach between internal medicine-trained nephrologists and anesthesia- and surgery-trained intensivists and surgeons led to collaborative difficulties in surgical ICUs. These findings stress the need for medical teamwork research and intervention to address issues stemming from disciplinary siloing rooted in long-term socialization to different disciplinary practices.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2020-Jan,"Clapp JT, Diraviam SP, Lane-Fall MB, Szymczak JE, Muralidharan M, Chung JJ, Gutsche JT, Curley MAQ, Berns JS, Fleisher LA",10,2273,nephrology,2025-11-22

32949335,Clinical characteristics and cost of hospital stay of octogenarians and nonagenarians in intensive care nephrology unit.,"As the population gets older, the elderly and very elderly patients are increasingly been treated in nephrology intensive care units (ICU). In this study we evaluated the characteristics and outcomes of the octogenarians (80-89 years old), nonagenarians (≥ 90 years old) and compared them with elderly (65-79 years old) patients treated in nephrology ICU. Eighteen nonagenarians, 70 octogenarians and 88 elderly patients were included in the study. Indication for hospitalization, presence of comorbid diseases, and requirement for acute dialysis treatment were investigated. Need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, central venous catheterization, urinary catheterization, anticoagulation, and transfusion of blood products were evaluated. Mortality rate and hospital cost were calculated. Data about survival at 1 month after discharge was collected. Causes of hospitalization, need for dialysis treatment, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, central venous catheterization, urinary catheterization, anticoagulation, and transfusion of blood products were not different between age groups. Diabetes mellitus and malignancy were more frequent in elderly, whereas dementia/Alzheimer's disease was more common in nonagenarians. Although, mortality in ICU was increased as the age increased, it was statistically insignificant. However, 1 month mortality rate after discharge from hospital was increased especially in nonagenarians. In nonagenarians infection, whereas in octogenarians need for dialysis treatment, were related with mortality. Length of intensive care stay and hospital cost did not differ between age groups. Length of nephrology intensive care stay, mortality rate and hospital cost did not differ for very elderly age groups, but mortality risk was higher for nonagenarians after discharge from hospital.",International urology and nephrology,2021-Jan,"Bardak S, Demir S, Dolarslan ME, Karadurmus B, Akcali E, Turgutalp K, Tasdelen B, Kiykim A",8,1830,nephrology,2025-11-22
36166245,Teaching nephrology as part of a degree in medicine.,"The teaching of nephrology as part of a degree in medicine is potentially one of the most decisive factors when choosing a speciality. Until now, however, we have not had an overview of the teaching of nephrology in Spain. We have integrated information available in public databases with a survey and personal interviews with those responsible for teaching in Spanish medical faculties. In 2019, there were 44 universities offering a medicine degree in Spain, in 16 Autonomous Communities (34 of which were public and 10 private). For learning purposes, students have a number of hospital beds ranging from 0.2 to 4.7, and there are Autonomous Communities that have a higher proportion of students per inhabitant or per physician, such as Madrid or the Community of Navarra. In 16 universities there are tenured teaching staff (professors and lecturers), in eight contracted medical lecturers, and in two assistant lecturers. In 21 medical faculties, theoretical and practical nephrology is taught by associate lecturers. The subject is taught between the third and fifth years of the degree, the median being the fourth year. It is usually integrated with another subject and only in the University of Navarra is it an independent subject, with three credits. The total number of hours devoted to theoretical teaching (both theoretical classes and seminars) is highly variable and ranges from 11 to 35, with a median of 17.5. Variability is observed in both the number of theoretical topics (range 11-31) and seminars (range 0-9). Among the faculties that teach seminars, the ratio of theoretical topics to seminars ranges from 1.6 to 18. Most faculties evaluate clinical practices with various modalities and percentage of assessment. Knowledge is mostly assessed by a multiple choice exam. In conclusion, there is a high level of variability in the curriculum for the teaching of nephrology as part of a degree in medicine in Spain. Teaching staff who are tenured or who have a stable affiliation with universities make up just 23% of the total and, in many faculties, teaching depends exclusively on associate professors.",Nefrologia,2021-,"de Arriba G, Ortiz Arduán A, Rodríguez Pérez JC, Tejedor Jorge A, Santamaría Olmo R, Rodríguez Portillo M",6,2126,nephrology,2025-11-22

While pediatricians have long approached care delivery with a family-centered lens, PFE may be a less familiar concept to situate among related concepts such as shared decision-making, self-efficacy, patient activation, and family-centered care. Children with CKD and their families indicate a need and desire for enhanced PFE efforts in pediatric nephrology. Improving PFE offers the opportunity to provide our patients and families with skills that will positively impact their health and wellness throughout their lives. In this review, we define PFE, describe the components of and levels at which PFE occurs across the health care system, examine PFE interventions of promise, and finally suggest future directions to support PFE in pediatric nephrology.",Advances in kidney disease and health,2024-Jan,"House TR, Helm K, Wightman A",3,967,nephrology,2025-11-22

Provision of structured teaching is becoming increasingly challenging with shift pattern working and staff shortages. This article describes a simulation course designed to facilitate team learning to improve the care of nephrology patients, and presents outcome data over 2 years. A full-day course, using high fidelity manikins, was designed for nephrology specialty trainees and nurse specialists. Nineteen learners (eleven specialty trainees and eight nurse specialists) and nine multidisciplinary team faculty members attended. Evaluation used pre- and post-course assessments, with a 1-year follow-up questionnaire. Following the course, improved knowledge scores, 56% to 72% (<i>P</i><0.05), and confidence scores, 57% to 71% (<i>P</i><0.005), were demonstrated. Qualitative analysis found 'intra-disciplinary interaction', 'reflection' and 'practical skills' were the greatest enablers of learning. In the 1-year follow-up questionnaire, specialty trainees reported that the course improved clinical practice and helped preparation for consultant roles. This course improved knowledge and confidence in managing nephrology scenarios across the multidisciplinary learning group, and the model could be used in other hospital specialties.","British journal of hospital medicine (London, England : 2005)",2020-Jul,"Watson K, Gosling N, Broom C, Snelgrove H, Popoola J",5,1378,nephrology,2025-11-22
38640993,American Board of Internal Medicine Nephrology Procedure Requirements for Initial Certification: Time for a Change and Pursuing Consensus in the Nephrology Community.,"In 1988, the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) defined essential procedural skills in nephrology, and candidates for ABIM certification were required to present evidence of possessing the skills necessary for placement of temporary dialysis vascular access, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and percutaneous renal biopsy. In 1996, continuous renal replacement therapy was added to the list of nephrology requirements. These procedure requirements have not been modified since 1996 while the practice of nephrology has changed dramatically. In March 2021, the ABIM Nephrology Board embarked on a policy journey to revise the procedure requirements for nephrology certification. With the guidance of nephrology diplomates, training program directors, professional and patient organizations, and other stakeholders, the ABIM Nephrology Board revised the procedure requirements to reflect current practice and national priorities. The approved changes include the Opportunity to Train standard for placement of temporary dialysis catheters, percutaneous kidney biopsies, and home hemodialysis, which better reflects the current state of training in most training programs, and the new requirements for home dialysis therapies training will align with the national priority to address the underuse of home dialysis therapies.

A national survey of internal medicine residents.","Interest in nephrology has been declining among internal medicine residents but the reasons behind this observation are not well characterized. Our objective was to evaluate factors influencing residents' choice of subspecialty. This is a mixed-method QUAL-QUAN design study that used the results of our previously published qualitative analysis on residents' perception of nephrology to create and pilot a questionnaire of 60 questions. The final questionnaire was distributed to 26 programs across the United States and a total of 1992 residents. We calculated response rates and tabulated participant characteristics and percentage of participant responses. We categorized choice of fellowship into 2 medical categories (Highly Sought After vs. Less Sought After) and fitted a logistic regression model of choosing a highly vs. less sought after fellowship. Four hundred fifteen out of 1992 (21%) US residents responded to the survey. Of the 268 residents planning to pursue fellowship training, 67 (25%) selected a less sought after fellowship. Female sex was associated with significantly higher odds of selecting a less sought after fellowship (OR = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.47, 4.74). Major factors deterring residents from pursuing nephrology were perception of inadequate financial compensation, broad scope of clinical practice and complexity of patient population. We observed a decline in exposure to nephrology during the clinical years of medical school with only 35.4% of respondents rotating in nephrology versus 76.8% in residency. The quality of nephrology education was rated less positively during clinical medical school years (median of 50 on a 0-100 point scale) compared to the pre-clinical years (median 60) and residency (median 75).

36176658,Are Undergraduates Familiar with Nephrology as a Medical Specialty? A Single Site Survey of Undergraduate Students.,"Over the past decade, nephrology has experienced a 43% decline in the number of fellowship applicants. Previous studies examining why residents choose a fellowship program cite lack of exposure as a main factor having an effect against a career in nephrology; however, no studies have surveyed the undergraduate population to inquire whether they recognize nephrology as a medical specialty compared with other medical specialties. We conducted a survey at a primarily undergraduate institution in the Southeast United States to test whether undergraduate students identified the word ""nephrology."" A total of 274 undergraduates responded to a survey that requested them to select every medical specialty that they recognized by name (15 real specialties and one fictitious specialty). Demographics regarding sex, race, collegiate level, high school location, premedical track, and household income were collected. Correlations between survey findings and rates of application and average salary per specialty were assessed. Out of 15 medical specialties, nephrology (29%) and pulmonology (40%) were the least recognized. Pediatrics (97%) and surgery (97%) ranked highest. Sex, race, collegiate level, and household income were not different between those students who recognized ""nephrology"" and those who did not. Premedical students were about twice as likely to have recognized nephrology versus nonpremedical students (49% versus 22%, respectively; <i>P</i><0.001). STEM majors were about twice as likely to identify nephrology versus non-STEM majors (40% versus 20%, respectively; <i>P</i><0.001). The proportion of undergraduate students who recognized a specific medical specialty significantly correlated only with the number of US applicants per fellowship position across different medical specialties in 2020 (<i>P</i><0.05). On the basis of word association alone, nephrology is the one of the least recognized specialties by undergraduates.

There is a need to establish a structured pediatric nephrology POCUS program for clinicians and fellows. This study suggests a blueprint of POCUS curriculum which can serve as a foundation for POCUS education in pediatric nephrology centers worldwide. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is commonly used in adult specialties, pediatric emergency medicine, and neonatal and pediatric critical care. Specifically, in the field of pediatric nephrology, POCUS plays a valuable role in the critical inpatient and outpatient settings. However, the lack of guidelines and a standardized curriculum for POCUS in pediatric nephrology has led to substantial discrepancies in both clinical practice and training. A multinational, multicenter survey regarding POCUS usefulness and training was sent to 225 pediatric nephrology residents, fellows, and physicians with expertise in pediatric nephrology. On the basis of the results, an ideal pediatric nephrology POCUS curriculum was formulated with a panel of experts from across the world. Eighteen experts were included, with each expert having >10 years of experience in using POCUS in adult and pediatric nephrology. A Delphi method was used to further solidify guidelines regarding the content, curriculum, and vital skills of using POCUS in pediatric nephrology. A total of 134 pediatric nephrology trainees, specialists, and faculty responded to the survey (59.6% completion rate). A total of 87.4% of respondents believe that formal POCUS training is either highly desirable or should be mandatory in pediatric nephrology fellowship programs. Identified barriers to receiving training included lack of an organized curriculum, lack of POCUS experts and pediatric intensivists, lack of ultrasound equipment, lack of financial support, and lack of dedicated time during training. An expert panel was convened, and a Delphi survey was conducted to formulate guidelines to overcome the barriers to pediatric nephrology POCUS and standardize the training process. After collaborating with prominent pediatric nephrologists, global POCUS experts proposed a comprehensive POCUS training curriculum tailored specifically for pediatric nephrology trainees, with an appeal for all pediatric nephrology education programs to integrate POCUS instruction into their curricula.",Kidney360,2024-May,"Sethi SK, Mahan J, Hu J, Koratala A, Soni K, Singh Y, Abitbol C, DeFreitas M, Reisinger N, Argaiz ER, Yap HK, Badeli H, Kalra M, VanGeest J, Nair N, Raynor J, Alhasan KA, McCulloch M, Bunchman T, Sharma V, Raina R",21,2471,nephrology,2025-11-22

A significant proportion of chronic kidney disease patients may therefore need Medically Assisted Reproduction. The paucity of information about medically assisted reproduction for chronic kidney disease patients complicates counselling for both nephrologists and gynaecologists, specifically for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and those on dialysis or with a transplanted kidney. It is in this context that the Project Group on Kidney and Pregnancy of the Italian Society of Nephrology has drawn up these best practice guidelines, merging a literature review, nephrology expertise and the experience of obstetricians and gynaecologists involved in medically assisted reproduction. Although all medically assisted reproduction techniques can be used for chronic kidney disease patients, caution is warranted. Inducing a twin pregnancy should be avoided; the risk of bleeding, thrombosis and infection should be considered, especially in some categories of patients. In most cases, controlled ovarian stimulation is needed to obtain an adequate number of oocytes for medically assisted reproduction. Women with chronic kidney disease are at high risk of kidney damage in case of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and great caution should be exercised so that it is avoided. The higher risks associated with the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and the consequent risk of chronic kidney disease progression, should likewise be considered if egg donation is chosen. Oocyte cryopreservation should be considered for patients with autoimmune diseases who need cytotoxic treatment. In summary, medically assisted reproduction is an option for chronic kidney disease patients, but the study group strongly advises extensive personalised counselling with a multidisciplinary healthcare team and close monitoring during the chosen medically assisted reproduction procedure and throughout the subsequent pregnancy.",Journal of nephrology,2023-Jun,"Attini R, Cabiddu G, Ciabatti F, Montersino B, Carosso AR, Gernone G, Gammaro L, Moroni G, Torreggiani M, Masturzo B, Santoro D, Revelli A, Piccoli GB",13,2053,nephrology,2025-11-22

However, home HD programs have not been well-established in Saudi Arabia. We aimed to explore the perspectives of adult nephrology consultants in Saudi Arabia about the potential utilization of home HD via a survey-based cross-sectional study. The survey was distributed via email to all adult nephrology consultants practicing in Saudi Arabia and registered in the Saudi Society of Nephrology and Transplantation. Out of 236 invited consultants, 151 (64%) participated in the study. Half of the participants defined home HD as a trained patient who can independently perform his/her HD sessions at home. Eighty-one (54%) consultants have never managed a patient on home HD during their nephrology training period. More than 70% of participants believed that home HD provides advantages over in-center HD, and that its utilization in Saudi Arabia would be feasible. Although 40% of participants worked in centers with no accredited nephrology training program, most of the remaining participants believed that the local training program did not provide enough teaching about home HD to trainees. Patients' refusal, the nephrologists' lack of motivation and experience, a lack of administrative support, and the lack of infrastructure and nursing support were identified by most participants as the major barriers to the utilization of home HD in Saudi Arabia. Addressing these barriers would be the first step to facilitate initiatives aiming to establish home HD programs in this country.","Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",2022-Nov,"Al Sahlawi MA, Dahlan RA",2,1643,nephrology,2025-11-22

Hence, the World Health Organization recommend tests - PCR and serological tests - for detecting infected people on a large scale. The most common symptoms are fever, fatigue, dry cough, anorexia, myalgia, and dyspnea, with tomographic pulmonary findings being frequent even in asymptomatic cases. The Brazilian Society of Nephrology has published guidelines for the management of hypertensive, diabetic, dialysis, and transplant patients. In its alerts, care and precautions in dialysis units are also being detailed, both for the health team and for the patients. Although important renal manifestations are not yet evident in the admission of positive cases, recent studies with renal patients and performed in nephrology services are listed here. This pandemic lead us to learn from its progress in order to face new challenges in dialysis clinics, transplant services, and intensive care services.",Jornal brasileiro de nefrologia,2020-,Tzanno-Martins C,1,1235,nephrology,2025-11-22
39515646,Unlocking the potential of extracellular vesicles in nephrology: what does MISEV2023 add?,"Extracellular vesicles, small membrane-bound packages secreted by virtually all cells of the body, have become a focus of interest in nephrology over the recent years. After the first characterization of their proteomic and transcriptomic content, scientific attention shifted toward their potential as biomarkers for kidney diseases both as diagnostic and monitoring tools. More recently, researchers have begun exploring whether extracellular vesicles mediate intercellular signaling inside the nephron and between the kidney and other organs throughout the body. Nevertheless, the field of extracellular vesicle research has struggled to translate major findings to the clinical context due to numerous methods to separate extracellular vesicles, yielding fractions of different sizes and varying purity, unclear terminology, and, hence, limitations concerning reproducibility. The International Society of Extracellular Vesicles, therefore, has striven to reduce these barriers by an ongoing initiative to increase rigor and standardization of extracellular vesicle research. The ""Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles"" guideline is the result of this initiative and, in its now third iteration, provides the most concise suggestions for investigating extracellular vesicles to date. This mini review illustrates the advances made in extracellular vesicle research in nephrology so far using informative examples, outlines the advances made by the former Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles guidelines, and shows what potential using the latest iteration holds.",Kidney international,2025-Jan,"Ng MSY, Burger D, Svenningsen P, Martens E, Erdbrügger U, Braun F",6,1607,nephrology,2025-11-22
32576553,The Electronic Medical Record and Nephrology Fellowship Education in the United States: An Opinion Survey.,"An unintended consequence of electronic medical record use in the United States is the potential effect on graduate physician training. We assessed educational burdens and benefits of electronic medical record use on United States nephrology fellows by means of a survey. We used an anonymous online opinion survey of all United States nephrology program directors (<i>n</i>=148), their faculty, and fellows. Program directors forwarded survey links to fellows and clinical faculty, indicating to how many they forwarded the link. The three surveys had parallel questions to permit comparisons. Twenty-two percent of program directors (<i>n</i>=33) forwarded surveys to faculty (<i>n</i>=387) and fellows (<i>n</i>=216; 26% of United States nephrology fellows). Faculty and fellow response rates were 25% and 33%, respectively; 51% of fellows agreed/strongly agreed that the electronic medical record contributed positively to their education. Perceived positive effects included access flexibility and ease of obtaining laboratory/radiology results. Negative effects included copy-forward errors and excessive, irrelevant documentation. Electronic medical record function was reported to be slow, disrupted, or completely lost monthly or more by >40%, and these were significantly less likely to agree that the electronic medical record contributed positively to their education. Electronic medical record completion time demands contributed to fellow reluctance to do procedures (52%), participate in conferences (57%), prolong patient interactions (74%), and do patient-directed reading (55%). Sixty-five percent of fellows reported often/sometimes exceeding work-hours limits due to documentation time demands; 85% of faculty reported often/sometimes observing copy-forward errors. Limitations include potential nonresponse and social desirability bias. Respondents reported that the electronic medical record enhances fellow education with efficient and geographically flexible patient data access, but the time demands of data and order entry reduce engagement in educational activities, contribute to work-hours violations, and diminish direct patient interactions.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2020-Jul,"Yuan CM, Little DJ, Marks ES, Watson MA, Raghavan R, Nee R",6,2172,nephrology,2025-11-22
33632608,Impact of Chronic Kidney Disease Under Nephrology Care on Outcomes of Carotid Endarterectomy.,"This study aimed to investigate the impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the delivery of nephrology care on outcomes of carotid endarterectomy (CEA). This was a single centre, retrospective observational study. Between January 2007 and December 2014, 675 CEAs performed on 613 patients were stratified by pre-operative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values (CKD [eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>] and non-CKD [eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>] groups) for retrospective analysis. The study outcomes included the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), defined as fatal or non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, or all cause mortality, during the peri-operative period and within four years after CEA. The CKD group consisted of 112 CEAs (16.6%), and the non-CKD group consisted of 563 CEAs (83.4%). The MACE incidence was higher among patients with CKD compared with non-CKD patients during the peri-operative period (4.5% vs. 1.8%; p = .086) and within four years after CEA (17.9% vs. 11.5%; p = .066), with a non-statistically significant trend. In a subgroup analysis of patients with CKD under nephrology care (63/112, 56.3%; with better controlled risk factors and tighter medical surveillance by a nephrologist), patients with CKD without nephrology care (49/112, 43.8%), and non-CKD patients, the risk of both peri-operative (4.1% vs. 0.4%; p = .037) and four year post-operative (20.4% vs. 7.3%; p = .004) all cause mortality was statistically significantly higher among patients with CKD without nephrology care compared with non-CKD patients. However, there were no statistically significant differences between patients with CKD who received nephrology care and non-CKD patients in peri-operative and four year post-operative MACE occurrence, both in terms of the composite MACE outcome and the individual MACE components. Despite the higher risk of peri-operative and four year MACE after CEA among patients with CKD, and the statistically significantly higher peri-operative and four year post-operative all cause mortality rates among patients with CKD without nephrology care, patients with CKD under nephrology care had similar outcomes to non-CKD patients.",European journal of vascular and endovascular surgery : the official journal of the European Society for Vascular Surgery,2021-May,"Jeong MJ, Byun E, Chang JW, Kwon SU, Kim N, Choi E, Han Y, Kwon TW, Cho YP",9,2217,nephrology,2025-11-22
37496346,Publications With Nephrological Themes Appearing Diachronically in the PubMed Bibliographical Database.,"Nephrology in the last 50 years has undergone important scientific developments, which have formally revolutionized clinical practice, including renal biopsy, renal replacement therapy, and transplantation. The understanding of the pathogenesis and the clinical course of renal disease has also steadily improved, resulting in renewal of definitions, classifications, and therapeutics in nephrology. In this context, publications with nephrological content are also expanding. The aim of this bibliographic study was to analyze publications related to nephrology-specific key words in the PubMed database. We included the key words ""nephrology,"" ""acute renal failure,"" ""renal biopsy,"" ""hemodialysis,"" ""peritoneal dialysis,"" and ""renal transplantation"" as search terms in PubMed in May 2022. We also used the term ""kidney"" as an alternative to ""renal."" ""Nephrology"" appeared 185 545 times in searches, with its appearance expanding in the past 3 decades since 1948. The term ""acute renal failure"" was found in 1932 in 1 publication and in a total number of 92 278 publications. Renal biopsy appeared since 1943 in 18 048 publications. ""Hemodialysis"" appeared in 182 730 citations, with the first in 1915. ""Peritoneal dialysis"" appeared in 32 266 citations for the first time in 1901 and in 1946 in human application. One publication on ""renal transplantation"" appeared in 1946, with 106 075 total publications related to renal transplantation. We viewed a clear expansion of nephro-logical publications in the past decades. Hemodialysis remains the most frequently used term in nephrology-related publications.

31899827,Conflicts of interest in dialysis: A barrier to policy reforms.,"Conflicts of interest involving physicians are commonplace in the US, occurring across many different specialties and subspecialties in a variety of clinical settings. In nephrology, two important scenarios in which conflicts of interest arise are dialysis facility joint venture (JV) arrangements and financial participation in End-stage Kidney Disease Seamless Care Organizations (ESCOs). Whether conflicts of interest occurring in either of these settings influence decision-making or patient care outcomes is not known due to a lack of transparent, publicly available information, and opportunities to conduct independent study. We discuss possible benefits and risks of nephrologist's financial participation in JVs and ESCOs and possible mechanisms for disclosure and reporting of such arrangements as well as risk mitigation.",Seminars in dialysis,2020-Jan,"Glickman A, Lin E, Berns JS",3,832,nephrology,2025-11-22
38541171,Integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Large Language Models in Nephrology: Advancing Practical Applications.,"The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare, particularly in nephrology, represents a significant advancement in applying advanced technology to patient care, medical research, and education. These advanced models have progressed from simple text processors to tools capable of deep language understanding, offering innovative ways to handle health-related data, thus improving medical practice efficiency and effectiveness. A significant challenge in medical applications of LLMs is their imperfect accuracy and/or tendency to produce hallucinations-outputs that are factually incorrect or irrelevant. This issue is particularly critical in healthcare, where precision is essential, as inaccuracies can undermine the reliability of these models in crucial decision-making processes. To overcome these challenges, various strategies have been developed. One such strategy is prompt engineering, like the chain-of-thought approach, which directs LLMs towards more accurate responses by breaking down the problem into intermediate steps or reasoning sequences. Another one is the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy, which helps address hallucinations by integrating external data, enhancing output accuracy and relevance. Hence, RAG is favored for tasks requiring up-to-date, comprehensive information, such as in clinical decision making or educational applications. In this article, we showcase the creation of a specialized ChatGPT model integrated with a RAG system, tailored to align with the KDIGO 2023 guidelines for chronic kidney disease. This example demonstrates its potential in providing specialized, accurate medical advice, marking a step towards more reliable and efficient nephrology practices.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2024-Mar,"Miao J, Thongprayoon C, Suppadungsuk S, Garcia Valencia OA, Cheungpasitporn W",5,1740,nephrology,2025-11-22
36292804,Theory Designed Strategies to Support Implementation of Genomics in Nephrology.,"(1) Background: Genomic testing is increasingly utilized as a clinical tool; however, its integration into nephrology remains limited. The purpose of this study was to identify barriers and prioritize interventions for the widespread implementation of genomics in nephrology. (2) Methods: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 Australian adult nephrologists to determine their perspectives on interventions and models of care to support implementation of genomics in nephrology. Interviews were guided by a validated theoretical framework for the implementation of genomic medicine-the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research (CFIR). (3) Results: Nephrologists were from 18 hospitals, with 7 having a dedicated multidisciplinary kidney genetics service. Most practiced in the public healthcare system (n = 24), a large number were early-career (n = 13), and few had genomics experience (n = 4). The top three preferred interventions were increased funding, access to genomics champions, and education and training. Where interventions to barriers were not reported, we used the CFIR/Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change matching tool to generate theory-informed approaches. The preferred model of service delivery was a multidisciplinary kidney genetics clinic. (4) Conclusions: This study identified surmountable barriers and practical interventions for the implementation of genomics in nephrology, with multidisciplinary kidney genetics clinics identified as the preferred model of care. The integration of genomics education into nephrology training, secure funding for testing, and counselling along with the identification of genomics champions should be pursued by health services more broadly.",Genes,2022-Oct,"Kansal A, Quinlan C, Stark Z, Kerr PG, Mallett AJ, Lakshmanan C, Best S, Jayasinghe K",8,1746,nephrology,2025-11-22
36331017,Home call during nephrology fellowship: Burden or benefit?,"Home call is one of the factors that can influence physician wellness. Nephrology fellows at the University of Wisconsin tracked home call activities in an attempt to quantify the impact of sleep to identify areas for improvement. Each of the 6 nephrology fellows filled out a daily survey between November 9, 2020, and January 31, 2021, to address total hours, quality of sleep, and if the fellows reported to the hospital. The average amount of sleep per night was 5.3 hours. When necessary to report to the hospital (50%), the average hours of sleep dropped to 4.3 hours. However, if not called in, sleep increased to 5.8 hours per night. Sleep quality during night call was described as restful for 55% of nights. Obtaining an understanding of how a call can impact a learner is essential to making decisions about programmatic structural changes. Programs might use this data to compare their programs when making decisions about call structure. Hospital culture or overnight management changes can be made to impact the number of phone calls or needs to report to the hospital.",Clinical nephrology,2022-Dec,"Cho M, Alstott J, Fernandes Almeida R, Singh T, Maursetter L",5,1083,nephrology,2025-11-22

The reasons physicians choose (and do not choose) a career in the field must be identified in order to boost recruitment of new nephrologists. In this article, a multilevel strategy is proposed to deal with the declining interest in the specialty: (1) increasing contact and providing early exposure to nephrology; (2) promoting mentoring and role models in medical schools; (3) improving the experience of trainees and medical students; (4) incorporating procedural skills and combined fellowship training with critical care in nephrology; (5) facilitating exchanges between trainees and young and senior nephrologists; (6) adopting an active approach to identify reasons for dissatisfaction, reduce burnout, and encourage a suitable work-life balance among nephrologists; (7) increasing remuneration; and (8) incentivizing advances in the field.

38837001,A cross-sectional analysis of reporting guideline and clinical trial registration policies in nephrology journals.,"To determine the extent to which nephrology journals recommend and require reporting guideline adherence and clinical trial registration. Despite a rising disease burden, research published on chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the field of nephrology has failed to keep pace and is limited. To improve the quality of research in the field of nephrology, reporting guidelines have been developed to minimize such deficits in research quality. However, the extent to which nephrology journals require and use reporting guidelines in addition to clinical trial registration is unknown. Sixty-two Nephrology journals were selected through the 2021 Scopus CiteScore tool. Each journal's Instructions for Authors was assessed to determine endorsement of study design-specific reporting guidelines or clinical trial registration. Researchers used R (version 4.2.1) and RStudio to create data summaries of descriptive statistics for nephrology journal reporting guidelines. Clinical trial registration was required by 52% (32/62) of nephrology journals within our sample. The reporting guideline for clinical trials, CONSORT, was required by 17.74% (11/62) of journals. The EQUATOR Network was mentioned by 46.77% (29/62) of journals, while 9.67% (6/62) failed to mention the ICMJE. The reporting guideline for systematic review, PRISMA, was only required by 12.90% (8/62) of journals. When contacting journal editors, 9.67% (6/62) responded and 4.83% (3/62) provided clarifying information. Reporting guidelines and clinical trial registration are suboptimally required and recommended by nephrology journals. Their adoption may decrease bias and increase research quality. Thus, nephrology journals should consider a more complete endorsement of these safeguards.",Journal of nephrology,2024-Nov,"Crotty P, Wright CL, Howard H, Smith CA, Nees D, Hughes G, Vassar M",7,1756,nephrology,2025-11-22
37159451,Psychosocial supports within pediatric nephrology practices: A pediatric nephrology research consortium survey.,"The landscape of available psychosocial services within pediatric nephrology care is poorly characterized. However, the effects of kidney disease on emotional health and health-related quality of life are well documented, as is the impact of social determinants of health on kidney disease outcomes. The objectives of this study were to assess pediatric nephrologists' perceptions of available psychosocial services and to elucidate inequities in access to psychosocial care. A web-based survey was distributed to members of the Pediatric Nephrology Research Consortium (PNRC). Quantitative analyses were performed. We received responses from 49 of the 90 PNRC centers. With regards to dedicated services, social work was most commonly available (45.5-100%), followed by pediatric psychology (0-57.1%) and neuropsychology (0-14.3%), with no centers having embedded psychiatry. Availability of psychosocial providers was positively associated with nephrology division size, such that as center size increased, access to various psychosocial providers increased. Notably, the majority of respondents indicated that perceived need for psychosocial support exceeds that which is currently available, even at centers with higher levels of current support. Within the US, there is wide variability in the availability of psychosocial services within pediatric nephrology centers despite a well-documented necessity for the provision of holistic care. Much work remains to better understand the variation in funding for psychosocial services and in utilization of psychosocial professionals in the pediatric nephrology clinic, and to inform key best practices for addressing the psychosocial needs of patients with kidney disease.",PloS one,2023-,"Dawson AE, Wilson CS, Smoyer WE, Pottanat N, Wilson AC, Mahan JD, LaMotte JE",7,1723,nephrology,2025-11-22
36881606,Admission of kidney patients to a closed staff nephrology department results in a better short-term survival.,"The outcome of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI) is often dismal and measures to ameliorate their course are scarce. When admitted to the hospital, kidney patients are often hospitalized in general Medicine wards rather than in a specialized Nephrology department. In the current study, we compared the outcome of two cohorts of kidney patients (CKD and AKI) admitted either to general open-staff (with rotating physicians) Medicine wards or to a closed-staff (non-rotating Nephrologists) Nephrology ward. In this population-based retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 352 CKD patients and 382 AKI patients admitted to either Nephrology or General Medicine wards. Short-term (< = 90 days) and long-term (>90 days) outcomes were recorded for survival, renal outcomes, cardiovascular outcomes, and dialysis complications. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression and negative binomial regression adjusting to potential sociodemographic confounders as well as to a propensity score based on the association of all medical background variables to the admitted ward, to mitigate the potential admittance bias to each ward. One hundred and seventy-one CKD patients (48.6%) were admitted to the Nephrology ward and 181 (51.4%) were admitted to general Medicine wards. For AKI, 180 (47.1%) and 202 (52.9%) were admitted to Nephrology and general Medicine wards, respectively. Baseline age, comorbidities and the degree of renal dysfunction differed between the groups. Using propensity score analysis, a significantly reduced mortality rate was observed for kidney patients admitted to the Nephrology ward vs. general Medicine in short term mortality (but not long-term mortality) among both CKD patients admitted (OR = 0.28, CI = 0.14-0.58, p = 0.001), and AKI patients (or = 0.25, CI = 0.12-0.48, p< 0.001). Nephrology ward admission resulted in higher rates of renal replacement therapy (RRT), both during the first hospitalization and thereafter. Thus, a simple measure of admission to a specialized Nephrology department may improve kidney patient outcome, thereby potentially affecting future health care planning.",PloS one,2023-,"Schwartz L, Rosenshtok O, Shalev L, Schneider E, Basok A, Vorobiov M, Romanjuk E, Rogachev B, El-Sayed I, Schwartz L, Menashe I, Regev O, Haviv YS",13,2174,nephrology,2025-11-22
33211302,Nephrology consultation and kidney failure in people with stage 4 chronic kidney disease: a population-based cohort study.,"Guidelines recommend referral for nephrology consultation for people with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) to improve care and renal outcomes, yet the advocated benefits of nephrology referral on CKD progression in this patient population are unclear. We linked laboratory and administrative data in Alberta, Canada to identify adults with stage 4 CKD between 2002 and 2014 (follow-up end on March 31, 2017). We studied the association between time-varying receipt of outpatient nephrology consultation and kidney failure (the earlier of renal replacement initiation or eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> for more than 3 months), accounting for the competing risk of death. Of the 14,382 participants, 41% were ≥ 85 years old, 33% saw a nephrologist as an outpatient, 9% developed kidney failure, and 53% died over a median of 2.6 years. Compared with people who did not see a nephrologist before or at 7 months (median time to consultation), those who did were more likely to develop kidney failure [5-year risk (95% CI) 0.23 (0.21-0.24) vs 0.07 (0.065-0.075)]. With increasing age or higher eGFR, the 5-year risk of kidney failure became progressively smaller, from 0.24 (0.18-0.29) at age < 65 to 0.01 (0.006-0.015) at age ≥ 85 years and from 0.21 (0.18-0.23) at eGFR 15-19 to 0.066 (0.060-0.072) at eGFR 25-29 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>; yet, the hazard ratio of kidney failure (1.6-4.3) increased following nephrology consultation in people who were older or had higher eGFR. Adults with stage 4 CKD who see a nephrologist are more likely to develop kidney failure than those who don't, especially within lower absolute risk categories. Although selective referral may explain these findings, there is no evidence of an association between nephrology care and reduced risk of kidney failure in people with severe CKD. Studies are needed to assess the benefits of nephrology consultation in people with moderate CKD.",Journal of nephrology,2021-Aug,"Liu P, Quinn RR, Cortese G, Mahsin M, James MT, Ronksley PE, Quan H, Manns B, Hemmelgarn BR, Tonelli M, Ravani P",11,1923,nephrology,2025-11-22
38519598,Utilizing electronic medical records alert to improve documentation of neonatal acute kidney injury.,"Neonatal acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common yet underdiagnosed condition in neonates with significant implications for long-term kidney health. Lack of timely recognition and documentation of AKI contributes to missed opportunities for nephrology consultation and follow-up, potentially leading to adverse outcomes. We conducted a quality improvement (QI) project to address this by incorporating an automated real-time electronic medical record (EMR)-AKI alert system in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital. Our primary objective was to improve documentation of neonatal AKI (defined as serum creatinine (SCr) > 1.5 mg/dL) by 25% compared to baseline levels. The secondary goal was to increase nephrology consultations and referrals to the neonatal nephrology clinic. We designed an EMR-AKI alert system to trigger for neonates with SCr > 1.5 mg/dL, automatically adding AKI diagnosis to the problem list. This prompted physicians to consult nephrology, refer neonates to the nephrology clinic, and consider medication adjustments. Our results demonstrated a significant improvement in AKI documentation after implementing the EMR-AKI alert, reaching 100% compared with 7% at baseline (p < 0.001) for neonates with SCr > 1.5 mg/dL. Although the increase in nephrology consultations was not statistically significant (p = 0.5), there was a significant increase in referrals to neonatal nephrology clinics (p = 0.005). Integration of an EMR alert system with automated documentation offers an efficient and economical solution for improving neonatal AKI diagnosis and documentation. This approach enhances healthcare provider engagement, streamlines workflows, and supports QI. Widespread adoption of similar approaches can lead to improved patient outcomes and documentation accuracy in neonatal AKI care.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2024-Aug,"Nada A, Bagwell A",2,1846,nephrology,2025-11-22

To review the perceived adequacy and temporal trends of advanced training in nephrology in Australia and New Zealand by evaluating training experiences, personal views on important aspects of training and nephrology, career paths and early employment outcomes. An online survey was distributed to members of the Australian and New Zealand Society of Nephrology through email in December 2020. Responses were sought from current trainees and from nephrologists qualifying since 2014. Likert scale proportions were calculated and group comparisons made using the Chi-squared test. A total of 88 participants returned the survey yielding a response rate of 32%, with a representative sample of trainees and consultants from across Australia and New Zealand. Training was reported as adequate in most aspects of clinical nephrology, although 88% of respondents felt poorly prepared for entering private practice and 61% reported inadequate training in kidney histopathology. Exposure to clinical procedures was variable, with adequate training in percutaneous kidney biopsy, but mostly inadequate training in dialysis access insertion. Sixty-nine percent of nephrologists completed their advanced training entirely in large urban centres and 85% worked in an urban area after training. Only 23% of consultants were engaged in full-time clinical employment in their first-year post-training and 78% were undertaking at least one of dual specialty training or a higher degree by research.

35144840,KDOQI US Commentary on the KDIGO 2020 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in CKD.,"In October 2020, KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) published its first clinical practice guideline directed specifically to the care of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). This commentary presents the views of the KDOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) work group for diabetes in CKD, convened by the National Kidney Foundation to provide an independent expert perspective on the new guideline. The KDOQI work group believes that the KDIGO guideline takes a major step forward in clarifying glycemic targets and use of specific antihyperglycemic agents in diabetes and CKD. The purpose of this commentary is to carry forward the conversation regarding optimization of care for patients with diabetes and CKD. Recent developments for prevention of CKD progression and cardiovascular events in people with diabetes and CKD, particularly related to sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, have filled a longstanding gap in nephrology's approach to the care of persons with diabetes and CKD. The multifaceted benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors have facilitated interactions between nephrology, cardiology, endocrinology, and primary care, underscoring the need for innovative approaches to multidisciplinary care in these patients. We now have more interventions to slow kidney disease progression and prevent or delay kidney failure in patients with diabetes and kidney disease, but methods to streamline their implementation and overcome barriers in access to care, particularly cost, are essential to ensuring all patients may benefit.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2022-Apr,"Mottl AK, Alicic R, Argyropoulos C, Brosius FC, Mauer M, Molitch M, Nelson RG, Perreault L, Nicholas SB",9,1588,nephrology,2025-11-22

For this trial, the ISKDC developed the criteria, such as those for response and relapse, used today to describe the clinical course of the nephrotic syndrome, and the trial generated the nephropathologic terminology and criteria which largely remain the current standards. Over an approximately 20-year span, the ISKDC followed the natural history and evaluated the therapeutic effectiveness of therapies in over 500 children with the nephrotic syndrome from three continents. It published 14 peer-reviewed studies and several reports and commentaries, many of which helped create current standards of practice for therapy of childhood nephrotic syndrome and consequently remain highly cited today.

Formative evaluations are ""just in time"" evaluations focused on informing the learning process, whereas summative evaluations compare fellows to a preset standard to determine their readiness for unsupervised practice. In the nephrology fellowship programs, evaluations assess competence in the framework of ACGME Milestones 2.0. A variety of learning venues, evaluators, and tools should be incorporated into the measurement process. It is important to determine which milestones can be best assessed in each education venue to decrease the burden of assessment fatigue. Additionally, programs can diversify the evaluators to include nurses, medical students, peers, and program coordinators in addition to faculty to provide a well-rounded assessment of the fellows and share the assessment burden. Lastly, the evaluation data should be presented to fellows in a format where it can inform goal setting. The evaluation system needs to evolve along with the changes being made in curriculum design. This will help to make fellowship learning effective and efficient.",Advances in chronic kidney disease,2022-Nov,"Waheed S, Maursetter L",2,1197,nephrology,2025-11-22
33476037,A hemodialysis curriculum for nephrology fellows using a blended learning approach: best of both worlds?,"A comprehensive, hands-on hemodialysis curriculum during nephrology training is necessary for effective learning and optimal patient care. Traditional instructive approaches are unable to fully meet the needs of the digitally inclined learner and are limited by time constraints and increasing clinical workload. Internet based learning (E-learning) is becoming increasingly popular in medical education and nephrology and gaining even greater relevance in the COVID era. However, it presents technical challenges and may create an environment of social isolation. A 'blended learning approach' combines E-learning with traditional methods of teaching and offers advantages over either approach alone. We have designed and implemented a formalized hemodialysis curriculum at our institution that is based on blended learning, utilizing faculty-created E-learning tools combined with traditional pedagogical methods (bed-side and classroom). The web-based tools discuss hemodialysis adequacy, principles of urea transport, hemodialysis access examination and access complications. These tools are open access and structured around the science of cognitive learning using animation, interactivity, self-assessment and immediate feedback features. They have been viewed by a wide audience of nephrologists, dialysis nurses as well as medicine house-staff and have received strong validation in a post-test survey. The online tools have supported a 'flipped classroom' instructive model and our blended curriculum has been successfully used for nephrology fellow training at our institution. Incorporating faculty designed/approved E-learning tools to create a 'blended' nephrology curriculum for trainees at various levels of medical education, can help streamline active and time-efficient learning, with the goal of improving learner engagement, knowledge acquisition and academic curiosity in the field.",Journal of nephrology,2021-Oct,Krishnan N,1,1903,nephrology,2025-11-22

RSC practice varies across services; therefore, understanding clinicians' perspectives is important to the evolution and definition of RSC. To understand renal clinicians' views and experiences of RSC, palliative care and end-of-life care. A cross-sectional online survey was undertaken across Australia and New Zealand between February and May 2018. Participants were asked about end-of-life care, RSC, palliative care and an ideal model of RSC. Estimated response rate 13% included 382 clinicians; doctors (32%), nurses (68%); of whom 84% access specialist palliative care and 59% RSC. A lack of agreed treatment goals (86%) and late or rushed treatment decision making (85%) was associated with challenging end-of-life experiences. Variable concepts of RSC were described, with RSC being considered the same as: usual care for all CKD patients (40%), conservative (30%) or palliative care (22%). The term RSC was generally distinct from (77%) and more acceptable than palliative care (80%) with preferential RSC referral for symptoms (86% vs 69%, P < .01) and complex treatment decision making (82% vs 58%, P < .01). Aspirations for RSC included improving symptoms and quality of life (89%), with an ideal model comprising: symptom management (98%), improved nephrology and community service integration (96%) and clinician education (94%). This study revealed challenges for renal clinicians in providing end-of-life care and variation of views and experiences of RSC.

39329220,ChatGPT Solving Complex Kidney Transplant Cases: A Comparative Study With Human Respondents.,"ChatGPT has shown the ability to answer clinical questions in general medicine but may be constrained by the specialized nature of kidney transplantation. Thus, it is important to explore how ChatGPT can be used in kidney transplantation and how its knowledge compares to human respondents. We prompted ChatGPT versions 3.5, 4, and 4 Visual (4 V) with 12 multiple-choice questions related to six kidney transplant cases from 2013 to 2015 American Society of Nephrology (ASN) fellowship program quizzes. We compared the performance of ChatGPT with US nephrology fellowship program directors, nephrology fellows, and the audience of the ASN's annual Kidney Week meeting. Overall, ChatGPT 4 V correctly answered 10 out of 12 questions, showing a performance level comparable to nephrology fellows (group majority correctly answered 9 of 12 questions) and training program directors (11 of 12). This surpassed ChatGPT 4 (7 of 12 correct) and 3.5 (5 of 12). All three ChatGPT versions failed to correctly answer questions where the consensus among human respondents was low. Each iterative version of ChatGPT performed better than the prior version, with version 4 V achieving performance on par with nephrology fellows and training program directors.

38652562,American Society of Nephrology Kidney Tutored Research and Education for Kidney Scholars (TREKS) Program: A 10-Year Interim Analysis.,"In response to decreasing numbers of individuals entering into nephrology fellowships, the American Society of Nephrology launched Kidney Tutored Research and Education for Kidney Scholars (TREKS) to stimulate interest in nephrology among medical students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. The program combines a 1-week intensive exposure to kidney physiology with a longitudinal mentorship program at the participants' home institutions. Ten years in, an analysis was conducted to assess its effectiveness. We surveyed participants to assess their opinions regarding nephrology before and after the course and followed them longitudinally to determine their career choices. TREKS applicants who were not selected to participate were used as a comparison group. Three hundred eighty-one people participated in the program, and 242 completed the survey. After TREKS, both medical students and graduate students showed increased interest in nephrology, with rank scores of 5.6±0.2 before to 7.5±0.1 after the course for medical students (mean±SD, n =189, P = 0.001) and 7.3±0.3 to 8.7±0.3 ( n =53, P = 0.001) for graduate students. In long-term follow-up, TREKS medical students chose a nephrology pipeline residency at a higher rate than medical students overall (57% versus 31%, P = 0.01) and TREKS applicants who did not participate (47% versus 31%, P = 0.04). Nephrology fellowship rates for these groups exceeded the general population but did not significantly differ between TREKS participants and applicants. Doctor of Philosophy students and postdoctoral TREKS participants had a higher rate of participation in nephrology research compared with TREKS applicants (66% versus 30%, P = 0.01). In summary, the American Society of Nephrology Kidney TREKS program has demonstrated that it can increase interest in nephrology in the short term and increase the number of individuals going into nephrology careers. This long-term effect is most evident in Doctor of Philosophy students and postdoctoral participants.

32045328,Barriers and Facilitators to Discussing Goals of Care among Nephrology Trainees: A Qualitative Analysis and Novel Educational Intervention.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Goals of care (GOC) conversations are critical to advance care planning but occur infrequently in nephrology. National workshops have improved trainee comfort with initiating GOC conversations but lack interface with palliative subspecialists and can incur travel-related costs. We developed an educational intervention focused on GOC conversations for nephrology trainees that incorporated into routine schedules and offered feedback from palliative subspecialists. <b><i>Objective:</i></b> To explore barriers and facilitators to discussing GOC and uncover perceptions of GOC-related behavior change post-intervention. <b><i>Design:</i></b> Qualitative study. <b><i>Setting/Subjects:</i></b> Sixteen nephrology trainees at an academic medical center. <b><i>Measurements:</i></b> Analyses of semistructured interviews occurred in phases: (1) isolation of quotes; (2) development of a coding system; and (3) creation of a framework of interrelationships between quotes using an inductive/deductive approach. <b><i>Results:</i></b> We captured the following themes: (1) prior knowledge (ability to define GOC, knowledge of communication frameworks and prognostic data, exposure to outpatient GOC conversations; (2) attitudes related to GOC conversations (responsibility, comfort, therapeutic alliance, patient preparedness, partnership with care teams); and (3) potential change in behaviors (increased likelihood to initiate GOC conversations early, more accurate identification of patients appropriate for a GOC conversation). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Prior knowledge of, exposure to, and attitudes toward advance care planning were key determinants of a nephrology trainees' ability to initiate timely GOC conversations. After our intervention, trainees reported increased comfort with and likelihood to initiate GOC conversations and an improved ability to identify appropriate candidates.

Currently, there is limited knowledge about how practicing nephrologists are using POCUS. This study aimed to characterize current POCUS use, training needs, and barriers to use among nephrology groups. A prospective observational study of all Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers was conducted between August 2019 and March 2020 using a web-based survey sent to all chiefs of staff and nephrology specialty chiefs. Chiefs of staff (n = 130) and nephrology chiefs (n = 79) completed surveys on facility- and service-level POCUS use (response rates of 100% and 77%, respectively). Current diagnostic or procedural POCUS use was reported by 41% of nephrology groups, and the most common POCUS applications were central line insertion (28%) and assessment of urinary retention (23%), hydronephrosis (18%), volume status (15%), and bladder (14%). Lack of training was the most common barrier (72%), and most nephrology groups (65%) desired POCUS training. Limited access to ultrasound equipment and POCUS training were barriers reported by 54% and 18% of groups, respectively. A minority of nephrology groups currently use common POCUS applications including evaluation of urinary retention, hydronephrosis, and volume status. The most common barriers to POCUS use in nephrology were lack of trained providers and ultrasound equipment.

To explore the intention to sign an advance directive and its related factors among nephrology medical staff. A cross-sectional and correlational design was used. This study recruited 160 nephrology medical staff. Data were analysed by using the Statistical Package for Social Science 21.0 for Windows. The results found that the longer someone has worked as part of the nephology medical staff, the more knowledgeable they were about an advance directive. This led to them being more likely to want to sign an advance directive for themselves.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI), like ChatGPT, offers potential solutions to enhance nephrology education through dynamic, adaptive, and personalized learning experiences. We discuss integrating generative AI into nephrology education at our institution, highlighting its importance and potential applications. It explores how AI can complement traditional teaching methods by addressing challenges like information overload, diverse learning needs, and continuous learning. Generative AI models should be actively utilized under human supervision to ensure accuracy when summarizing key teaching points, creating discussion topics for journal clubs, and aiding in curriculum development for our Nephrology fellowship. Potential future applications include simulation-based learning, interactive learning modules, personalized learning plans, and enhanced research capabilities. AI can also facilitate mentorship, improve assessment, and support administrative tasks. The integration of AI addresses challenges such as keeping pace with knowledge expansion, providing personalized learning experiences, and improving access to expertise. In summary, the integration of generative AI into nephrology education represents a paradigm shift in preparing future kidney specialists. While AI offers numerous benefits, challenges such as data privacy and maintaining the human element in patient care must be addressed.

37553692,Nephrology workforce in China: describing current status and evaluating the optimal capacity based on real-world data.,"This study aims to characterize the current status of the nephrology workforce in China and evaluate its optimal capacity based on real-world patient mobility data. Data on nephrologists in China were collected from two prominent online healthcare platforms using web crawlers and natural language processing techniques. Hospitalization records of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from January 2014 to December 2018 were extracted from a national administrative database in China. City-level paths of patient mobility were identified. Effects of nephrology workforce on patient mobility were analyzed using multivariate Poisson regression models. Altogether 9.13 nephrologists per million population (pmp) were in practice, with substantial city-level variations ranging from 0.16 to 88.79. The ratio of nephrologists to the estimated CKD population was 84.57 pmp. Among 6 415 559 hospitalizations of patients with CKD, 21.3% were cross-city hospitalizations and 7441 city-level paths of patient mobility with more than five hospitalizations were identified. After making adjustment for healthcare capacity, healthcare insurance, economic status, and travel characteristics, the Poisson regression models revealed that the number of nephrologists in both the source city (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.99, per 1 pmp increase) and destination city (IRR 1.07, per 1 pmp increase) were independently associated with patient mobility. An IRR plateau was observed when the number of nephrologists exceeded 12 pmp in the source city, while a rapidly increasing IRR was observed beyond 20 pmp in the destination city. The nephrology workforce in China exhibits significant geographic variations. Based on local healthcare needs, an optimal range of 12-20 nephrologists pmp is suggested.",Human resources for health,2023-Aug,"Wu J, Li Q, Bao C, Yang C, Li P, Zhang L",6,1788,nephrology,2025-11-22
34153971,Frequency and Severity of Moral Distress in Nephrology Fellows: A National Survey.,"Moral distress is a negative affective response to a situation in which one is compelled to act in a way that conflicts with one's values. Little is known about the workplace scenarios that elicit moral distress in nephrology fellows. We sent a moral distress survey to 148 nephrology fellowship directors with a request to forward it to their fellows. Using a 5-point (0-4) scale, fellows rated both the frequency (never to very frequently) and severity (not at all disturbing to very disturbing) of commonly encountered workplace scenarios. Ratings of ≥3 were used to define ""frequent"" and ""moderate-to-severe"" moral distress. The survey was forwarded by 64 fellowship directors to 386 fellows, 142 of whom (37%) responded. Their mean age was 33 ± 3.6 years and 43% were female. The scenarios that most commonly elicited moderate to severe moral distress were initiating dialysis in situations that the fellow considered futile (77%), continuing dialysis in a hopelessly ill patient (81%) and carrying a high patient census (75%), and observing other providers giving overly optimistic descriptions of the benefits of dialysis (64%). Approximately 27% had considered quitting fellowship during training, including 9% at the time of survey completion. A substantial majority of nephrology trainees experienced moral distress of moderate to severe intensity, mainly related to the futile treatment of hopelessly ill patients.

39388702,Navigating Nephrology's Decline Through a GPT-4 Analysis of Internal Medicine Specialties in the United States: Qualitative Study.,"The 2024 Nephrology fellowship match data show the declining interest in nephrology in the United States, with an 11% drop in candidates and a mere 66% (321/488) of positions filled. The study aims to discern the factors influencing this trend using ChatGPT, a leading chatbot model, for insights into the comparative appeal of nephrology versus other internal medicine specialties. Using the GPT-4 model, the study compared nephrology with 13 other internal medicine specialties, evaluating each on 7 criteria including intellectual complexity, work-life balance, procedural involvement, research opportunities, patient relationships, career demand, and financial compensation. Each criterion was assigned scores from 1 to 10, with the cumulative score determining the ranking. The approach included counteracting potential bias by instructing GPT-4 to favor other specialties over nephrology in reverse scenarios. GPT-4 ranked nephrology only above sleep medicine. While nephrology scored higher than hospice and palliative medicine, it fell short in key criteria such as work-life balance, patient relationships, and career demand. When examining the percentage of filled positions in the 2024 appointment year match, nephrology's filled rate was 66%, only higher than the 45% (155/348) filled rate of geriatric medicine. Nephrology's score decreased by 4%-14% in 5 criteria including intellectual challenge and complexity, procedural involvement, career opportunity and demand, research and academic opportunities, and financial compensation. ChatGPT does not favor nephrology over most internal medicine specialties, highlighting its diminishing appeal as a career choice.

36951457,A Primer in Precision Nephrology: Optimizing Outcomes in Kidney Health and Disease through Data-Driven Medicine.,"This year marks the 63rd anniversary of the International Society of Nephrology, which signaled nephrology's emergence as a modern medical discipline. In this article, we briefly trace the course of nephrology's history to show a clear arc in its evolution-of increasing resolution in nephrological data-an arc that is converging with computational capabilities to enable precision nephrology. In general, precision medicine refers to tailoring treatment to the individual characteristics of patients. For an operational definition, this tailoring takes the form of an optimization, in which treatments are selected to maximize a patient's expected health with respect to all available data. Because modern health data are large and high resolution, this optimization process requires computational intervention, and it must be tuned to the contours of specific medical disciplines. An advantage of this operational definition for precision medicine is that it allows us to better understand what precision medicine means in the context of a specific medical discipline. The goal of this article was to demonstrate how to instantiate this definition of precision medicine for the field of nephrology. Correspondingly, the goal of precision nephrology was to answer two related questions: ( 1 ) How do we optimize kidney health with respect to all available data? and ( 2 ) How do we optimize general health with respect to kidney data?",Kidney360,2023-Apr,"Jayaraman P, Crouse A, Nadkarni G, Might M",4,1435,nephrology,2025-11-22

We recruited current adult and pediatric fellows and 2020 graduates of nephrology training programs in the United States to participate in a survey measuring COVID-19's effects on their training experiences and wellbeing. Of 1005 nephrology fellows-in-training and recent graduates, 425 participated (response rate 42%). Telehealth was widely adopted (90% for some or all outpatient nephrology consults), as was remote learning (76% of conferences were exclusively online). Most respondents (64%) did not have in-person consults on COVID-19 inpatients; these patients were managed by telehealth visits (27%), by in-person visits with the attending faculty without fellows (29%), or by another approach (9%). A majority of fellows (84%) and graduates (82%) said their training programs successfully sustained their education during the pandemic, and most fellows (86%) and graduates (90%) perceived themselves as prepared for unsupervised practice. Although 42% indicated the pandemic had negatively affected their overall quality of life and 33% reported a poorer work-life balance, only 15% of 412 respondents who completed the Resident Well-Being Index met its distress threshold. Risk for distress was increased among respondents who perceived the pandemic had impaired their knowledge base (odds ratio [OR], 3.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.00 to 4.77) or negatively affected their quality of life (OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 2.29 to 5.46) or work-life balance (OR, 3.16; 95% CI, 2.18 to 4.71).

Kidney studies in Italy were part of this general trend. In this contribution, all the papers relating to kidney physiology, pathology and therapeutics produced by Italian scientists in the years between the two World Wars are retrieved and examined. The authors who produced strictly nephrological articles are also singled out and their activity described. This research retrieved 638 articles dealing with kidneys and published by Italian scientists over the period described. The topics covered were up-to-date, and the level was consistent with that of foreign contemporaries. Among the authors, a group of young scientists particularly dedicated to the study of the kidney emerges.

34313370,Peritoneal dialysis: Status report in South and South East Asia.,"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) as a modality of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) is largely underutilized globally. We analyzed PD utilization, impact of economic status, projected growth and impact of state policy(s) on PD growth in South Asia and Southeast Asia (SA&SEA) region. The National Nephrology Societies of the region responded to a questionnaire on KRT practices. The responses were based on the latest registry data, acceptable community-based studies and societal perceptions. The representative countries were divided into high income and higher-middle income (HI & HMI) and low income and lower-middle income (LI & LMI) groups. Data provided by 15 countries showed almost similar percentage of GDP as health expenditure (4%-7%). But there was a significant difference in per capita income (HI & HMI -US$ 28 129 vs. LI & LMI - US$ 1710.2) between the groups. Even after having no significant difference in monthly cost of haemodialysis (HD) and PD in LI & LMI countries, they have poorer PD utilization as compared to HI & HMI countries (3.4% vs. 10.1%); the reason being lack of formal training/incentives and time constraints for the nephrologist while lack of reimbursement and poor general awareness of modalities has been a snag for the patients. The region expects ≥10% PD growth in the near future. Hong Kong and Thailand with 'PD first' policy have the highest PD utilization. Important deterrents to PD underutilization were lack of PD centric policies, lackadaisical patient/physician's attitude, lack of structured patient awareness programs, formal training programs and affordability.","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2021-Nov,"Bhargava V, Jasuja S, Tang SC, Bhalla AK, Sagar G, Jha V, Ramachandran R, Sahay M, Alexander S, Vachharajani T, Lydia A, Mostafi M, Pisharam JK, Jacob C, Gunawan A, Leong GB, Thwin KT, Agrawal RK, Vareesangthip K, Tanchanco R, Choong L, Herath C, Lin CC, Akhtar SF, Alsahow A, Rana DS, Rajapurkar MM, Kher V, Verma S, Krishnaswamy S, Gupta A, Bahl A, Gupta A, Khanna UB, Varughese S, Gallieni M",36,1606,nephrology,2025-11-22

38692707,"Nephrology referral slows the progression of chronic kidney disease, especially among patients with anaemia, diabetes mellitus, or hypoalbuminemia: A single-centre, retrospective cohort study.","The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines recommend nephrology referral for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 4 to 5, significant proteinuria and persistent microscopic haematuria. However, the recommendations are opinion-based and which patients with CKD benefit more from nephrology referral has not been elucidated. In this retrospective cohort study, patients referred to our nephrology outpatient clinic from April 2017 to March 2019 were included. We excluded patients considered to have an acute decline in kidney function (annual decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] >10 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). The slopes of eGFR before and after nephrology referral were estimated and compared by linear mixed effects models. Interaction between time and referral status (before or after referral) was assessed and effect modifications by the presence of diabetes, proteinuria (defined by urine dipstick protein 2+ or more), urine occult blood, hypoalbuminemia (defined by albumin levels less than 3.5 g/dL) and anaemia (defined by haemoglobin levels less than 11.0 g/dL) were evaluated. The eGFR slope significantly improved from -2.05 (-2.39 to -1.72) to -0.96 (-1.36 to -0.56) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>/year after nephrology referral (p < .001). The improvement in eGFR slope was more prominent among those with diabetes mellitus, anaemia, and hypoalbuminemia (all p-values for three-way interaction <.001 after adjustment for covariates). Further adjustments for time-dependent haemoglobin levels, the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, iron supplementation, anti-hypertensives and anti-diabetic medications did not change the significance of the interactions. Nephrology referral slows CKD progression, especially among those with hypoalbuminemia, diabetes or anaemia. Patients with hypoalbuminemia, diabetes or anaemia might benefit more from specialized care and lifestyle modifications by nephrologists. The inclusion of anaemia and hypoalbuminemia in nephrology referral criteria should be considered.","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2024-Aug,"Ide A, Ota K, Murashima M, Suzuki K, Kasugai T, Miyaguchi Y, Tomonari T, Ono M, Mizuno M, Hiratsuka M, Kawai T, Suzuki T, Murakami K, Hamano T",14,2062,nephrology,2025-11-22
38679417,Environmentally sustainable design guide for haemodialysis facilities: An Australian and New Zealand society of Nephrology initiative.,"Haemodialysis facilities have a large environmental impact due to high energy, water and consumable usage by haemodialysis equipment. As climate change and natural resource scarcity escalate, all the while the number of people requiring dialysis increases, there is an urgent need for dialysis facilities that meet care needs while minimising environmental impact. To address this, the Australian and New Zealand Society of Nephrology engaged an environmental sustainability consulting practise to develop a best practise guide for the environmentally sustainable design and operation of haemodialysis facilities. Four opportunity areas were considered, namely energy, water, waste and resource recovery, and additional sustainability. A total of 28 environmental improvement initiatives were identified. The majority (n = 23) were general measures that could be applied across all healthcare settings, while five were specific to haemodialysis facilities. Recommendations were made regarding specific measures that should be undertaken and/or standards that must be met to achieve the intent of each initiative. These were stratified to enable their application to both existing dialysis facilities and new builds. The lifecycle stage of a haemodialysis facility to which each initiative applied was highlighted, as was its potential impact. This guide provides a tailored and comprehensive resource for the kidney care community to enable the integration of best practise sustainability considerations into both existing and new facilities. If broadly implemented, it has the potential to markedly improve the environmental impact of haemodialysis provision.","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2024-Jul,"Barraclough KA, Ashley G, Krishnan A, Sypek M, White A, Ford S, Wei J, Johnson DW",8,1660,nephrology,2025-11-22
38113869,Rituximab use in paediatric nephrology practice in Türkiye: TRTX.,"Rituximab (RTX) is a genetically engineered chimeric monoclonal antibody which binds directly to CD20 antigen and mediates inhibition of B cell development. Although RTX has been widely used in paediatric nephrology, there is no routine protocol for its use. In this study, paediatric nephrologists in Türkiye were asked to fill out a questionnaire to understand their practice in using RTX. This study aimed to determine common practices and clarify the uncertainties regarding the use of RTX in paediatric nephrology. This was a nationwide, multicenter, retrospective cohort study based on data evaluating the use of RTX in paediatric nephrology practice. An online questionnaire was sent to all paediatric nephrology centers in Türkiye. The questionnaire forms included information about how many patients in total applied RTX treatment, for which indications they use RTX, and whether they made any preparations before using RTX. According to this survey on RTX use in Türkiye, paediatric nephrologists use it most commonly in SSNS and followed by SRNS, ABMR, SLE and AAV, respectively. Dosing was highly standard but there is significant heterogeneity in pre-exposure tests and patient monitoring in the clinical practice of RTX. Also, the rate of encountering RTX-related allergic and infectious side effects at least once during the professional experience of our physicians can be quite high. There is an increasing need for the preparation of a guideline on the indications for RTX use for each diagnosis, posology, and the practices to be performed before and after infusion.","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2024-May,"Ünal A, Leventoğlu E, Bakkaloğlu SA",3,1585,nephrology,2025-11-22

A survey of hospitalized patients from January 2020 to December 2020 showed that there are six types of bacteria that can cause infections. The age of the patient, the risk of invasive surgery, the low use of antibiotics, and age are all independent factors that affect the risk of nosocomial infections in the patient. The more antibiotics used, the better the infection prevention effect. Among the many risk factors for patient infection, bacterial infection is the main risk factor. <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> infection rate was the highest, 33.98%; <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> infection rate was the lowest, 6.80%. Therefore, the nephrology department should focus on strengthening the prevention of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> infection, and implement early prevention and management interventions for various risk factors.",Journal of healthcare engineering,2022-,"Zheng J, Fei J, Li H, Xu Y",4,963,nephrology,2025-11-22

So far, there has been no information on the use of high-fidelity simulation in undergraduate clinical nephrology teaching. Aim of this study was to analyze students' opinions and reactions to the simulation module in nephrology. The survey consisting of the Satisfaction with Simulation Experience Scale (SSES) and open-ended question concerning the overall impression of classes was conducted among 103 5<sup>th</sup> year medical students, who took part in the simulation training in nephrology. SSES consisted of three parts (debriefing, reasoning, education). Statements from the open-ended question were interpreted by means of the Atlas.ti software for qualitative data analysis. The overall score for simulation classes was 4.39 ± 0.69 points. Students rated debriefing, reasoning and education at 4.43 ± 0.78, 4.32 ± 0.7 and 4.39 ± 0.73 points, respectively. 87.4% and 84.5% of participants agreed that simulation developed their 'clinical reasoning' and 'decision-making' skills in nephrology, respectively. Thematic analysis revealed that students evaluated the module as 'interesting', 'useful' and 'informative', but they found number of classes significantly insufficient. Students pointed out that due to the small emphasis placed on practical aspects in the existing curriculum e.g. routes of drug administration and conversion of doses, they could not fully benefit from simulation.

However, there are few reports detailing the differences in prescription rates of these therapies among clinical departments. A total of 39,585 patients with renal impairment were enrolled from a database of 914,280 patients. Patients were selected based on an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. There were eight clinical departments from internal medicine, including nephrology. We defined a hemoglobin level less than 11.0 g/dL as anemia and set 20% of transferrin saturation and 100 ng/mL of serum ferritin as cutoff points. We compared the prescription rates of ESAs and iron supplementation based on the hemoglobin level and iron status among the patients seen across the eight clinical departments. The lower the eGFR, the more the number of patients seen under nephrology care.

Electronic health record review at an integrated health care network. Factors associated with referral status were identified using Fisher's exact tests, t tests, and multivariable logistic regression. Of 133,913 patients regularly seeing PCPs between October 2017 and September 2019, 1119 had a final eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and were not on renal replacement therapy. Care was provided by 185 PCPs (61 practices). Analyses were restricted to the 97.1% (n = 1087) of patients who were African American or European American. Of these, 54.6% had not been referred to nephrology. Nonreferred patients had higher numbers of PCP visits (P = .004). In contrast, referred patients were younger, were more often African American, and had PCPs at the academic medical center (all P < .0001). Referred patients had more complex medical histories with higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, more hospitalizations, and greater numbers of inpatient days (all P < .0001). Analyses restricted to patients with serum creatinine concentration of at least 2 mg/dL yielded similar results. Age, number of hospitalizations, ancestry, academic physician, diabetic end-organ damage, peripheral vascular disease, and tumor status were independent predictors of nephrology referral.

32810859,Precision Nephrology Is a Non-Negligible State of Mind in Clinical Research: Remember the Past to Face the Future.,"CKD is a major public health problem. It is characterized by a multitude of risk factors that, when aggregated, can strongly modify outcome. While major risk factors, namely, albuminuria and low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) have been well analyzed, a large variability in disease progression still remains. This happens because (1) the weight of each risk factor varies between populations (general population or CKD cohort), countries, and single individuals and (2) response to nephroprotective drugs is so heterogeneous that a non-negligible part of patients maintains a high cardiorenal risk despite optimal treatment. Precision nephrology aims at individualizing cardiorenal prognosis and therapy. The purpose of this review is to focus on the risk stratification in different areas, such as clinical practice, population research, and interventional trials, and to describe the strategies used in observational or experimental studies to afford individual-level evidence. The future of precision nephrology is also addressed.

This cross-sectional study evaluated gender disparities among EiC of transplantation and nephrology medical journals. The study population was drawn from journals in two subject categories (1) 'Transplantation' and (2) 'Urology and Nephrology' in the 2023 Journal Citation Reports. Binary gender classification (woman/man) was determined by the names/pronouns used to describe the EiC on the journal or institutional webpage. The primary outcome was the proportion of women EiC. Secondary outcome was the proportion of women EiC based on journal topic, location and metrics. Descriptive statistics were used. Gender differences were compared using students t-test or Fisher's exact test. A total of 79 EiC were identified of which 16 (20%) were women and 63 (80%) were men (p < .001). Transplantation and nephrology journals had 21% and 20% women EiC, respectively. The proportion of women to men EiC was not impacted by journal category (p = .93), journal location (p = .61), journal impact factor (p = .71) or quartile (p = .59). There was a disparity in gender representation in EiC in nephrology and transplantation journals, with men holding 80% of all positions. These findings, among growing evidence of gender disparity, highlight a need for targeted efforts to promote gender equity in academic medicine.","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2024-Dec,"Scarlato RM, Wyburn K, Wyld ML",3,1649,nephrology,2025-11-22

31838480,Research Themes and Trends in Ten Top-Ranked Nephrology Journals: A Text Mining Analysis.,"Nephrology research is expanding, and harnessing the much-needed information and data for the practice of evidence-based medicine is becoming more challenging. In this study, we used the natural language processing and text mining approach to mitigate some of these challenges. We analyzed 17,412 abstracts from the top-10 nephrology journals over 10 years (2007-2017) by using latent semantic analysis and topic analysis. The analyses revealed 10 distinct topics (T) for nephrology research ranging from basic science studies, using animal modeling (T-1), to dialysis vascular access-related issues -(T-10). The trend analyses indicated that while the majority of topics stayed relatively stable, some of the research topics experienced increasing popularity over time such as studies focusing on mortality and survival (T-4) and Patient-related Outcomes and Perspectives of Clinicians (T-5). However, some research topics such as studies focusing on animal modeling (T-1), predictors of acute kidney injury, and dialysis access (T-10) exhibited a downward trend. Stakeholders of nephrology research may use these trends further to develop priorities and enrich the research agenda for the future.",American journal of nephrology,2020-,"Zengul FD, Lee T, Delen D, Almehmi A, Ivankova NV, Mehta T, Topuz K",7,1198,nephrology,2025-11-22
36288933,Nephrology Program Director Protected Time for Program Administration in the United States.,"The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) required that program directors receive 10-20 h/wk of protected time for program administration (including didactic teaching). In July 2022, this was reduced for all internal medicine subspecialties on the basis of program size, with 8 h/wk required for programs with fewer than seven fellows, the majority of nephrology programs. We surveyed all 151 US adult nephrology program directors (ACGME Public List of Programs 2021-2022) to determine how much protected time they receive, how much they think is necessary, and the division of their professional time. The anonymous 20-question online survey was administered from March 31 to April 30, 2022. The analysis was descriptive. Response rate was 66% (99 of 151). Geographic distribution and approved fellow positions were similar to programs nationally; 59% had fewer than seven approved positions. Median protected time was 10 h/wk (interquartile range, 5-10), with 8 h/wk (interquartile range, 5-10) for those with fewer than seven positions. Program directors estimated needing 12 h/wk (interquartile range, 10-16) to effectively administer programs, including those with fewer than seven positions, a median 5 h/wk (interquartile range, 0-7) more than received. Of program directors reporting <10 h/wk for program administration, 62% provided >20 hours of direct patient care. Thirty-nine percent had no protected time for core faculty. Fellow recruitment (68%) was the most time-consuming task, and didactic teaching (80%) was the most professionally rewarding. Approximately half of the nephrology programs surveyed were not in compliance with the ACGME-stipulated 10-h/wk minimum protected time for the 2021-2022 training year. Program directors estimated a median of 12 h/wk are needed to effectively manage programs.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2022-Dec,"Yuan CM, Young BY, Watson MA, Sussman AN",4,1843,nephrology,2025-11-22
37166551,Telehealth services in an outpatient nephrology clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic: a patient perspective.,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, new policy waivers permitted reimbursement of telehealth services in urban settings. The aim of this study was to assess patient satisfaction with telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic in an outpatient urban nephrology practice. Patients who had virtual encounters were asked to complete an online survey regarding their experiences with telehealth services. Twenty-one percent of eligible patients completed the survey. Patients (83.6%) reported overall positive experiences with telehealth and want to see a hybrid healthcare model in the future (80.1%). Additionally, most patients found telehealth appointments convenient to make and telehealth encounters convenient to conduct. Ethnicity, age, gender, and insurance type did not have a statistically significant impact on satisfaction ratings. Technical issues were not encountered by 79.5% of patients and patients were willing to use the video feature. However, if they had technical issues, patient satisfaction ratings were negatively impacted. Telehealth services are beneficial to patients with regards to convenience, decreased transportation costs and time, increased accessibility to healthcare, and decreased overall opportunity costs. However, challenges still remain with the deployment of telehealth and will be dependent on patients' digital health literacy, access to broadband internet and devices, and legislation and/or regulations. Limitations of the study, including small sample size and surveying patients from a nephrology practice, may prevent it from being generalizable. Additional studies with a larger sample size and multiple specialties may be needed to generalize patients' satisfaction with telehealth services.",International urology and nephrology,2023-Dec,"Vemu PL, Zurlo J, Lew SQ",3,1747,nephrology,2025-11-22
37128404,Gaps in Nephrology Referral Care Utilization in Patients at High-Risk of Progression to Kidney Failure.,"Early nephrology specialty care slows progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, identifying which patients are expected to progress to end-stage disease has been historically challenging to predict. With a limited supply of nephrologists, optimizing nephrology referral is essential for improving patient outcomes. The Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) provides an accurate metric to identify patients who are at high risk of progression to kidney failure. In this study, we utilize the KFRE to perform a retrospective analysis in a local health network to identify rates of nephrology referral for CKD patients stratified by risk of kidney failure progression. We found a nephrology referral gap in CKD patients at higher risk of progression and an underutilization of albuminuria testing in CKD, suggesting opportunities to improve outcomes by 1) proactively targeting high-risk patients using EHR-based informatics strategies and 2) increasing albuminuria testing as a screening tool.",AMIA ...

32053647,Human resources for nephrology in South Africa: A mixed-methods study.,"The global nephrology workforce is shrinking and, in many countries, is unable to meet healthcare needs. Accurate data pertaining to human resources in nephrology in South Africa is lacking. This data is critical for the planning and delivery of renal services and the training of nephrologists in South Africa to meet the challenge of the growing burden of chronic kidney disease. A cross-sectional study of adult and paediatric nephrologists currently delivering nephrology services in South Africa was conducted. Participants were identified using various data sources, including the register of the Health Professions Council of South Africa. This cohort of doctors was described in terms of their demographics and distribution. A survey was then conducted among these nephrologists to collect additional information on their training, scope of practice, job satisfaction, challenges and future plans. Finally, two focus group interviews were conducted to probe themes identified from the survey data. A total of 120 adult nephrologists and 22 paediatric nephrologists were identified (an overall density of 2.5 per million population). There is a male predominance (66%) and the median age is 45 years. The bulk of the workforce (128 nephrologists, 92%) is distributed in three of the nine South African provinces, and two provinces have no nephrologist at all. The survey was completed by 57% of the nephrologists. Most reported positive attitudes to their chosen profession; however, 35 nephrologists (43%) reported an excessive workload, 9 (11%) were planning emigration and 15 (19%) were planning early retirement. A higher frequency of dissatisfaction regarding remuneration (39% vs. 15%) and unsatisfactory work conditions (35% vs. 13%) was observed amongst nephrologists working in the public sector compared to the private sector. A total of 13 nephrologists participated in the focus group interviews. The themes which were identified included that of a rewarding profession, an overall shortage of nephrologists, poor career planning, a need for changes to nephrologists' training, excessive workloads with inadequate remuneration, and challenging work environments. There are insufficient numbers of nephrologists in South Africa, with a markedly uneven distribution amongst the provinces and healthcare sectors. Qualitative data indicate that South African nephrologists are faced with the challenges of a high workload, obstructive policies and unsatisfactory remuneration. In the public sector, a chronic lack of nephrologist posts and other resources are additional challenges. A substantial proportion of the workforce is contemplating emigration.",PloS one,2020-,"Hassen M, Archer E, Pellizzon A, Chikte UME, Davids MR",5,2668,nephrology,2025-11-22
36645357,Nephrology Nurses' Perspectives for the Designs of Mobile Hemodialysis Devices: A Human Factors Engineering Approach.,"The goal of this study was to guide the early conceptual designs of two devices intended to improve the quality of life for patients on hemodialysis: a portable hemodialysis device and a wearable hemodialysis device. Thirty-two nephrology nurses were interviewed using a mixed approach of open-ended, rating, and rank-order questions. Results show most nurses try to persuade patients to try a modality of treatment that offers them the best clinical outcome and highest quality of life. Many nurses, however, indicate that patients are often not given the opportunity to choose their preferred modality of treatment, and that current hemodialysis treatments are one-size-fits-all and should be more individualized. Nurses also believe high-frequency home-based, portable, or wearable hemodialysis treatments are better for patients than in-center treatments, and patients can learn to safely connect and disconnect a hemodialysis device to their catheter. Using content analysis, we identified six categories of potential benefits a patient may experience using either a portable or a wearable hemodialysis device. We also identified six categories of potential barriers that may hinder nephrology nurses in recommending either a portable or a wearable hemodialysis device to their patients and seven categories of ideal features for the designs of the devices. Statistical analysis of rank-order questions shows nephrology nurses prefer a wearable hemodialysis device in the form of a belt compared to other designs (p < 0.05). Findings from this study provide valuable information guiding the design process of mobile hemodialysis devices that nephrology nurses will feel comfortable recommending to their patients.",Nephrology nursing journal : journal of the American Nephrology Nurses' Association,2022-,"Jónsdóttir AA, Lazo GR, Kessler LG, Smith NC, Kim JE",5,1718,nephrology,2025-11-22

39172907,Nephrology Provider Engagement in Comprehensive Shared Decision-Making Discussions With Older Adults: Results of a Cross-Sectional Survey.,"<b>Background:</b> The largest patient group initiating dialysis for end-stage renal disease is persons over 75 years. Evidence indicates pre-dialysis shared decision-making discussions between nephrology providers and older adults are infrequent and often do not include an option for conservative management of symptoms without dialysis. <b>Aims</b>: To assess and compare behavioral determinants of nephrology providers' use of comprehensive pre-dialysis shared decision-making discussions with older adults. A secondary aim was to prepare the bases for tailored behavioral intervention(s) for nephrology providers by identifying the determinant(s) that should be targeted to elicit change in comprehensive shared decision-making intentions and the resulting behavior. <b>Methods</b>: A cross-sectional survey based on the Theory of Planned Behavior was completed by nephrologists from a state organization and nephrology advance practitioners from a national organization, either in person or online via Qualtrics. <b>Results:</b> Survey respondents included nephrologists (n=29), and nurse practitioners (n=37) and physician assistants (n=7), combined, were predominantly female (83%) and White American (67%). Spearman rho correlation results showed attitude, social norm, and perceived behavioral control were correlated with shared decision-making behavior for one or both groups. Significant differences were present between the two groups for determinants and behaviors. <b>Conclusion:</b> Based on the determinants predominantly influencing SDM behavior of nephrology advance practitioners, behavioral interventions targeting the determinants of <i>Social Norm</i> and <i>Perceived Behavioral Control</i> are warranted. All determinants can be utilized in behavioral interventions for nephrologists.Opportunity exists for collaboration between providers to develop consistent and effective methods of SDM discussion that fit into a typical workday.",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,2025-May,"Montoya V, Conner N",2,1959,nephrology,2025-11-22
34706969,Analysis of Performance Trends from 2010-2019 on the American Board of Internal Medicine Nephrology Certifying Exam.,"The pass rate on the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) nephrology certifying exam has declined and is among the lowest of all internal medicine (IM) subspecialties. In recent years, there have also been fewer applicants for the nephrology fellowship match. This retrospective observational study assessed how changes between 2010 and 2019 in characteristics of 4094 graduates of US ACGME-accredited nephrology fellowship programs taking the ABIM nephrology certifying exam for the first time, and how characteristics of their fellowship programs were associated with exam performance. The primary outcome measure was performance on the nephrology certifying exam. Fellowship program pass rates over the decade were also studied. Lower IM certifying exam score, older age, female sex, international medical graduate (IMG) status, and having trained at a smaller nephrology fellowship program were associated with poorer nephrology certifying exam performance. The mean IM certifying exam percentile score among those who subsequently took the nephrology certifying exam decreased from 56.7 (SD, 27.9) to 46.1 (SD, 28.7) from 2010 to 2019. When examining individuals with comparable IM certifying exam performance, IMGs performed less well than United States medical graduates (USMGs) on the nephrology certifying exam. In 2019, only 57% of nephrology fellowship programs had aggregate 3-year certifying exam pass rates ≥80% among their graduates. Changes in IM certifying exam performance, certain trainee demographics, and poorer performance among those from smaller fellowship programs explain much of the decline in nephrology certifying exam performance.

38976042,Responding to the workforce crisis: consensus recommendations from the Second Workforce Summit of the American Society of Pediatric Nephrology.,"Pediatric patients with complex medical problems benefit from pediatric sub-specialty care; however, a significant proportion of children live greater than 80 mi. away from pediatric sub-specialty care. To identify current knowledge gaps and outline concrete next steps to make progress on issues that have persistently challenged the pediatric nephrology workforce. Workforce Summit 2.0 employed the round table format and methodology for consensus building using adapted Delphi principles. Content domains were identified via input from the ASPN Workforce Committee, the ASPN's 2023 Strategic Plan survey, the ASPN's Pediatric Nephrology Division Directors survey, and ongoing feedback from ASPN members. Working groups met prior to the Summit to conduct an organized literature review and establish key questions to be addressed. The Summit was held in-person in November 2023. During the Summit, work groups presented their preliminary findings, and the at-large group developed the key action statements and future directions. A holistic appraisal of the effort required to cover inpatient and outpatient sub-specialty care will help define faculty effort and time distribution. Most pediatric nephrologists practice in academic settings, so work beyond clinical care including education, research, advocacy, and administrative/service tasks may form a substantial amount of a faculty member's time and effort. An academic relative value unit (RVU) may assist in creating a more inclusive assessment of their contributions to their academic practice. Pediatric sub-specialties, such as nephrology, contribute to the clinical mission and care of their institutions beyond their direct billable RVUs. Advocacy throughout the field of pediatrics is necessary in order for reimbursement of pediatric sub-specialist care to accurately reflect the time and effort required to address complex care needs. Flexible, individualized training pathways may improve recruitment into sub-specialty fields such as nephrology. The workforce crisis facing the pediatric nephrology field is echoed throughout many pediatric sub-specialties.

35524893,Regional variations in nephrology trainee confidence with clinical skills may relate to the availability of local training opportunities in the UK: results from a national survey.,"The United Kingdom offers a standardised training program for nephrology fellows. However, local training opportunities vary resulting in mismatches between trainee interests and accessible opportunities. This may impact trainee confidence, satisfaction, and future service provision. A survey assessing confidence with key procedures and sub-specialities was disseminated. Associations with region of training were probed using Chi square tests, with significance set at p < 0.0008 following a Bonferroni correction. Results were compared to trainee views on available opportunities for development. 139 responses were received (32% response rate, demographics representative of the UK nephrology trainee cohort). Procedural independence varied from 98% for temporary femoral vascular catheters to 5% for peritoneal dialysis catheters (PDIs). Independence with inserting tunnelled vascular catheters varied with region (p < 0.0001). Trainees expressed a desire for formal training in kidney ultrasound scanning and PDIs, corresponding with procedures they had least opportunity to become independent with. Trainees felt least confident managing kidney disease in pregnancy. Suggestions for improving training included protected time for garnering sub-speciality knowledge, developing procedural skills and for experiencing practice in other nephrology units. A mismatch between trainee interests and professional development opportunities exists, which may threaten trainee autonomy and impact patient care particularly with regards to peritoneal dialysis. Provisions to facilitate trainee directed development need to be made while balancing the rigors of service provision. Such measures could prove critical to promoting trainee well-being and preventing attrition within the nephrology workforce.",Clinical and experimental nephrology,2022-Sep,"Selvaskandan H, Baharani J, Hamer R",3,1801,nephrology,2025-11-22

This study investigated the facility-level nephrology practices adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic and their associated challenges. Additionally, the treatment patterns and outcomes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with COVID-19 were reviewed. We conducted a nationwide questionnaire survey of 704 educational facilities that were certified by the Japanese Society of Nephrology (JSN) from October 20, 2020 to November 16, 2020. The questionnaire reviewed the facility characteristics, infection prevention measures taken during routine nephrology practice, impact of COVID-19 on nephrology practice, experiences in managing CKD patients with COVID-19, and nosocomial transmission in the nephrology unit. Of the 347 facilities that responded, 95.1% checked outpatients' body temperatures and COVID-19 symptoms at their visits. To reduce face-to-face contact, 80% and 70% of the facilities lengthened the intervals between outpatient visits and introduced online/telephonic consultations, respectively. As a result, more than half of the hospitals experienced a decrease in the numbers of outpatients and inpatients (64% and 50%, respectively). During the study period, 347 facilities managed 479 CKD patients with COVID-19. Oxygen administration and mechanical ventilation were performed for 47.8% and 16.5% of the patients, respectively, with a 9.2% total mortality rate.

30325464,Predicting kidney failure risk after acute kidney injury among people receiving nephrology clinic care.,"Outcomes after acute kidney injury (AKI) are well described, but not for those already under nephrology clinic care. This is where discussions about kidney failure risk are commonplace. We evaluated whether the established kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) should account for previous AKI episodes when used in this setting. This observational cohort study included 7491 people referred for nephrology clinic care in British Columbia in 2003-09 followed to 2016. Predictors were previous Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes-based AKI, age, sex, proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and renal diagnosis. Outcomes were 5-year kidney failure and death. We developed cause-specific Cox models (AKI versus no AKI) for kidney failure and death, stratified by eGFR (</≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2). We also compared prediction models comparing the 5-year KFRE with two refitted models, one with and one without AKI as a predictor. AKI was associated with increased kidney failure (33.1% versus 26.3%) and death (23.8% versus 16.8%) (P  < 0.001). In Cox models, AKI was independently associated with increased kidney failure in those with an eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 {hazard ratio [HR] 1.35 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.70]}, no increase in those with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 ([HR 1.05 95% CI 0.91-1.21)] and increased mortality in both subgroups [respective HRs 1.89 (95% CI 1.56-2.30) and 1.43 (1.16-1.75)]. Incorporating AKI into a refitted kidney failure prediction model did not improve predictions on comparison of receiver operating characteristics (P = 0.16) or decision curve analysis. The original KFRE calibrated poorly in this setting, underpredicting risk. AKI carries a poorer long-term prognosis among those already under nephrology care.

38319649,Should Transplant Nephrology Pursue Recognition from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)?,"Kidney transplant is not only the best treatment for patients with advanced kidney disease but it also reduces health care expenditure. The management of transplant patients is complex as they require special care by transplant nephrologists who have expertise in assessing transplant candidates, understand immunology and organ rejection, have familiarity with perioperative complications, and have the ability to manage the long-term effects of chronic immunosuppression. This skill set at the intersection of multiple disciplines necessitates additional training in Transplant Nephrology. Currently, there are more than 250,000 patients with a functioning kidney allograft and over 100,000 waitlisted patients awaiting kidney transplant, with a burgeoning number added to the kidney transplant wait list every year. In 2022, more than 40,000 patients were added to the kidney wait list and more than 25,000 received a kidney transplant. The Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative, passed in 2019, is aiming to double the number of kidney transplants by 2030 creating a need for additional transplant nephrologists to help care for them. Over the past decade, there has been a decline in the Nephrology-as well Transplant Nephrology-workforce due to a multitude of reasons. The American Society of Transplantation Kidney Pancreas Community of Practice created a workgroup to discuss the Transplant Nephrology workforce shortage.

Therefore, ESPN aimed at harmonizing renal care in all European countries in the following 20 years. In 2017, we conducted a survey to evaluate the current status of renal health policies for children in Europe. A 33-question web-based survey was designed and sent to presidents or representatives of national societies of pediatric nephrology in 44 European countries. Data was reported from 42 (95.5%) countries. The number of pediatric nephrologists per million child population increased from 1998 to 2017 in 70% of countries. Pediatric dialysis facilities for acute kidney injury and end-stage kidney disease were available in 95% of countries. The availability of pediatric kidney transplantation increased from 55 to 93% of countries. Considerable variation was found in the current availability of allied health professionals, including psychosocial and nutritional support, high-tech diagnostic methods, and treatment with expensive drugs for children with kidney diseases between different European countries. The 20-year follow-up analysis of pediatric renal care services in European countries revealed that pediatric nephrology has become a well-established subspecialty in pediatrics and nephrology in 2017. The ESPN will continue its efforts to further improve pediatric renal care for European children by harmonizing remaining disparities of renal care services.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2020-Jan,"Prikhodina L, Ehrich J, Shroff R, Topaloglu R, Levtchenko E",5,1537,nephrology,2025-11-22

Even though pediatric nephrologists have been increasingly involved in the care of children with different forms of malignancy, there has not been an emphasis on developing special expertise in this area. The fast pace of discovery in this field, including the development of new therapy protocols with their own kidney side effects and the introduction of the CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy, has introduced new challenges for general pediatric nephrologists because of the unique effects of these treatments on the kidney. Moreover, with the improved outcomes in children receiving cancer therapy come an increased number of survivors at risk for chronic kidney disease related to both their cancer diagnosis and therapy.

The present study aims to investigate the efficacy of FC in teaching nephrology via comparing with the traditional lecture-based teaching (LBT). Sixty-two medical clerkship students at Zhejiang University School of Medicine were equally allocated into either LBT or FC group demographically matched. The glomerular diseases module was chosen for the teaching content. Students from the FC group were required to study the pre-class materials in annotated PPT format in advance. In the class, case-based learning (CBL) was employed, students encountered the related clinical cases and participated in the face-to -face discussion. Students from the LBT group attended a didactic lecture during the class. Quiz and questionnaires were performed to assess the efficacy of FC versus LBT. Participants from the FC group performed better in the quiz than those from the LBT group with higher total scores (78.06 ± 2.515 vs. 65.16 ± 3.209, mean ± SEM), particularly the scores of the case analysis-related questions (35.81 ± 1.657 vs. 27.42 ± 1.910, mean ± SEM). In the survey, more students considered FC beneficial to comprehension, critical thinking, patient management and team work as compared with LBT.

With agreement, the item was left for the next round. This round was repeated. An initial list of 11 items was developed; after three Delphi rounds and revisions, eight items remained that were then established as the final EPAs. These items can serve as a list of goals to be reached by residents who rotate to the department of nephrology. The results indicated that most of the experts believed residents should be able to perform tasks deemed necessary or urgent for all physicians, such as those that deal with hyperkalaemia and heart failure.

Do the guidelines point to the end of nephrology follow-up of advanced CKD or are they the starting point for a new approach?,"The editorial comments on a recently published study in which 242 patients, with ""stable"" chronic kidney disease, recruited during a hospital stay, were randomised either to receiving support from nephrologists (co-management by primary care physicians and nephrologists), or to be managed by primary care physicians with written instructions and nephrology consultations on demand. After a mean follow-up of 4 years, the results in terms of dialysis start, hospitalisation and death were similar for both groups.This study gave the possibility to discuss about the options of follow-up of CKD patients, including on one side the advantage of a greater involvement of primary care physicians, who could oversee care by applying a common set of simplified guidelines, and on the other one the importance of a direct and deep involvement of the specialists that seems necessary in particular if personalised approaches have to be pursuit. The data of the present study are somehow in disagreement with the literature, usually suggesting better outcomes in intensive treatment, in which specialists are directly involved. The literature is heterogeneous, the goals vary and the populations are differently selected. The compliance issue is probably one of the missing pieces of the puzzle, and specific interventions should also be tailored to ""reluctant"" patients. Guidelines should probably be staring points for improvement, and not the standard of care; the study herein discussed may suggest that primary care physicians may be of great help in granting a good standard of care, hopefully as a baseline for further improvement, and personalised care.",BMC nephrology,2020-Jul,Piccoli GB,1,1652,nephrology,2025-11-22

A bibliographic research relating to this period was undertaken with the aim of investigating the number and the quality of the studies on kidneys published by Italian scientists. A total of 176 publications of Italian scientists dealing with kidney diseases or physiology was retrieved, 10.8% of which was published on foreign journals. The analysis of the topics treated shows that they were up to date and comparable with the contemporary studies across Europe. Moreover, the issues raised remained of interest throughout the following decades up to our day. Top Italian researchers were fairly cited, especially if they published on international journals. While at the time the state of other organs was mainly assessed by examining physical signs and symptoms, kidney studies required laboratory facilities. This limitation meant that kidney scholars usually belonged to well established medical faculties. From these schools, a few figures stood out among the others for the importance of their studies, both physiological and clinical in nature. The same figures also gave birth to the major Italian schools of internal medicine from which, half a century later, originated the Italian Society of Nephrology.

He died in Struga on September 22, 1986, and was buried in Skopje. He completed primary and secondary education in Bitola. He graduated from the Medical Faculty in Belgrade in 1951 as one of the best students of his generation (average grade of 9.75). In 1953 he was employed at the Internal Clinic of the Medical Faculty in Skopje, where in 1955 he passed the specialist exam in internal medicine. He successfully defended his habilitation ""Polyarthritis chronica evolutiva"" and his doctoral dissertation ""Clinical features of Vitina nephropathy"". The doctoral dissertation indicates that Vitina nephropathy is a new site of the Balkan Endemic Nephropathy entity and that more genetic testing of patients were needed. Based on numerous clinical and scientific researches published in over 200 papers, he was elected a Full Professor of internal medicine at the Medical Faculty of the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje in 1971. In 1970, he formed the nephrology section of the Macedonian Medical Association (MMA), which grew into the nephrology Association of MMA. Through the Association, the education of the medical staff from the field of nephrology was performed. He also set up a bio-cybernetics association. He achieved his vision and desire to transfer and apply the achievements of modern nephrology in the diagnosis and treatment of kidney patients in Macedonia at the Clinic of Nephrology of the Medical Faculty in Skopje, which was the first specialized institution established for examination and treatment of kidney patients in the former Yugoslavia and the Balkans. The Clinic educated nephrological staff and examined and treated kidney patients with new methods and drugs that positively affected the development of nephrology as a subspecialty of the internal medicine. D. Hrisoho was actively involved in the introduction of new methods for examination of kidney patients, as well as in the treatment of patients with acute and chronic renal insufficiency with dialysis since 1965. He also participated in the first two kidney transplantations from living donors performed in 1977. He wrote a chapter on ""kidney examination"", printed in the book of Prof. A. J. Ignjatovski ""Fundamentals of Internal Propedeutics"" Part III, published by ""Prosvetno delo"", 1963, in Skopje. This is the first text to investigate a patient with kidney disease published in a textbook in R. Macedonia. In 1984 he published the textbook ""Clinical Nephrology"" printed by the University of the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje. Prof. D. Hrisoho organized the First Scientific Meeting of Yugoslav Nephrologists with international participation, from 26 to 28 September 1977, in Struga, R. Macedonia. The meeting was attended by prominent nephrologists from the former Yugoslavia, the Balkans, Europe and the United States, among them: J.S. Cameron from UK, J.L. Funck-Brentano from France, M. Burg and P. Ivanovich from the USA, R. Kluthe from Germany and A. Puchlev from Bulgaria. The scientific meeting was the largest nephrology event until then organized in the former Yugoslavia. The meeting provided an exchange of experiences with world-renowned nephrologists. D. Hrisoho presented the paper Artificial intelligence in nephrology. The author tried to apply bio-cybernetics in nephrology. Prof. D. Hrisoho was Vice Dean of the Medical Faculty in Skopje in the period 1963-1965 and Vice Rector of the University of the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje in the period 1974-1975. Prof. Hrisoho was also active in socio-political organizations.

31909866,Cost-analysis of persistent hyperkalaemia in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients under nephrology care in Italy.,"In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyperkalaemia (HK) (potassium level ≥ 5.0 mEq/L) is associated with poor clinical outcomes. This study provides novel insights by comparing management costs of CKD patients with normokalaemia vs those with persistent HK regularly followed in renal clinics in Italy. To this aim, a Markov model over life-time horizon was developed. Time to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and time to death in CKD patients were derived from an observational multi-centre database including 1665 patients with non-dialysis CKD stage 1-5 under nephrology care in Italy (15 years follow-up). Resource use for CKD and HK management was obtained from the observational database, KDIGO international guidelines, and clinical expert opinion. Results showed that patients with normokalaemia vs persistent HK brought an average per patient lifetime cost-saving of €16 059 besides delayed onset of ESRD by 2.29 years and increased survival by 1.79 years with increment in total survival and dialysis-free survival in normokalaemia that decreased from early to advanced disease. Cost-saving related to normokalaemia increased at more advanced CKD; however, it was already evident at early stage (3388.97€ at stage 1-3a). OWSA confirmed cost-saving associated with normokalaemia across all parameter variations. This model is the first to simulate the impact of HK in non-dialysis CKD patients on economic and clinical outcomes using real-world data from nephrology clinics. In these patients, persistent HK results into higher lifetime costs, besides poorer clinical outcomes, that are evident since the early stages of CKD. Maintaining normokalaemia should therefore be of main concern in CKD treatment planning to improve long-term economic and clinical outcomes.",International journal of clinical practice,2020-May,"Provenzano M, De Francesco M, Iannazzo S, Garofalo C, Andreucci M, Genualdo R, Borrelli S, Minutolo R, Conte G, De Nicola L",10,1783,nephrology,2025-11-22
37889579,Gender Disparities in Nephrology Trials: A Meta-Analysis of Enrollment Trends between 2000 and 2021.,"Women are under-represented in high-impact nephrology trials. Trends remain consistent over the past 20 years and on the basis of target condition. Addressing the imbalanced enrollment of women in trials could improve disparities in care and outcomes of kidney disease. Gender disparities in the incidence and complications of kidney diseases are well described. However, analysis to elucidate gender disparities in enrollment in nephrology randomized clinical trials (RCTs) has not been performed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of high-impact nephrology RCTs published between 2000 and 2021. We included RCTs enrolling participants aged 18 years and older in the following categories: (<i>1</i>) CKD, (<i>2</i>) AKI, (<i>3</i>) GN, (<i>4</i>) maintenance dialysis, and (<i>5</i>) kidney transplantation. We summarized trial characteristics according to reporting and enrollment of participants, enrollment site, publication year, trial category, and intervention type. Outcomes of interest include the proportion of enrolled male and female participants overall and according to trial category. In addition, we compared enrollment trends in the United States and globally to estimates of kidney disease prevalence. Most qualifying trials (373/380, 98%) reported the distribution of male and female participants. Enrollment was imbalanced overall with male participants accounting for 62% (<i>n</i>=215,850) of the enrolled participants and female participants for just 38% (<i>n</i>=133,082). Male participants formed most of trial cohorts in AKI (65%), CKD (62%), dialysis (55%), and transplant trials (65%), whereas women were majority enrollees in GN trials (61%). CKD trials under-represented women in both US trials and worldwide. Women are under-represented in high-impact nephrology trials with the exception of GN trials. This imbalance may contribute to disparities in outcomes and gaps in the care of women with kidney disease.",Kidney360,2023-Nov,"Soomro QH, McCarthy A, Charytan AM, Keane C, Varela D, Ways J, Ramos G, Nicholson J, Charytan DM",9,1959,nephrology,2025-11-22
34330365,Moral Distress and Moral Injury in Nephrology During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Across the world, challenges for clinicians providing health care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are highly prevalent and have been widely reported. Perspectives of provider groups have conveyed wide-ranging experiences of adversity, distress, and resilience. In understanding and responding to the emotional and psychological implications of the pandemic for renal clinicians, it is vital to recognize that many experiences also have been ethically challenging. The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted rapid and extensive transformation of health care systems and widely impacted care provision, heightening the risk of barriers to fulfillment of ethical duties. Given this, it is likely that some clinicians also have experienced moral distress, which can occur if an individual is unable to act in accordance with their moral judgment owing to external barriers. This review presents a global perspective of potential experiences of moral distress in kidney care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using nephrology cases, we discuss why moral distress may be experienced by health professionals when withholding or withdrawing potentially beneficial treatments owing to resource constraints, when providing care that is inconsistent with local prepandemic best practice standards, and when managing dual professional and personal roles with conflicting responsibilities. We argue that in addition to responsive and appropriate health system supports, resources, and education, it is imperative for health care providers to recognize and prevent moral distress to foster the psychological well-being and moral resilience of clinicians during extended periods of crisis within health systems.",Seminars in nephrology,2021-May,"Ducharlet K, Trivedi M, Gelfand SL, Liew H, McMahon LP, Ashuntantang G, Brennan F, Brown M, Martin DE",9,1708,nephrology,2025-11-22
38867096,A nephrology trainee can define the fluid status through lung ultrasonography and inferior vena cava measurements in hemodialysis patients: an observational study in a single center.,"The determination of ideal weight in hemodialysis patients remains a common problem. The use of Lung Ultrasound (LUS) is an emerging method of assessing the hydric status of hemodialysis patients. LUS combined with Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) ultrasonography can define the fluid status in hemodialysis patients. This study included 68 hemodialysis patients from the Dialysis Unit of Papageorgiou General Hospital in Thessaloniki. The patients underwent lung and IVC ultrasound 30 min before and after the end of the dialysis session by a nephrology trainee. Patients' ideal weight was modified based on daily clinical practice rather than ultrasound findings. The presence of B lines and ultrasound findings of the IVC were evaluated. The average B line score was 11.53 ± 5.02 before dialysis and became 5.57 ± 3.14 after the session. The average diameter of the IVC was 14.266 ± 0.846 mm before dialysis and 12.328 ± 0.879 mm after the session. The patients were categorized based on the magnitude of overhydration and the findings were evaluated. In addition, findings after the session showed a statistically significant correlation between the b line score and the diameter of the IVC adjusted for the body surface area. (p = 0.009 < 0.05). A high rate of hyperhydration was detected before the dialysis session (25%). While it is the first study conducted by a nephrology trainee highlighting that it is a feasible technique.

Although the capability to identify and rigorously assess genetic variants and their relationship to disease has advanced considerably in the past decade, the curation of clinically relevant relationships between genes and specific phenotypes has received less attention, despite it underpinning accurate interpretation of genomic tests. Here, we discuss the need to accurately define gene-disease relationships in nephrology and provide a framework for appraising genetic and experimental evidence critically. We describe existing international programmes that provide expert curation of gene-disease relationships and discuss sources of discrepancy as well as efforts at harmonization. Further, we highlight the need for alignment of disease and phenotype terminology to ensure robust and reproducible curation of knowledge. These collective efforts to support evidence-based translation of genomic sequencing into practice across clinical, diagnostic and research settings are crucial for delivering the promise of precision medicine in nephrology, providing more patients with timely diagnoses, accurate prognostic information and access to targeted treatments.",Nature reviews.

Qualitative study with content analysis of the chapters and articles of the SBN Code of Conduct, from the perspective of principlism bioethics. The four moral principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy and justice were found asymmetrically throughout the document, with beneficence predominating over the others. The SBN Code of Conduct predominantly expresses the ethical duties that an associate must comply with, but also restrictions on malfeasance, autonomy and justice, anchoring decision-making by managers and including the distribution of possible punishments. It is an unfinished document; therefore, it must be periodically revised, as expected, due to the rapid technological changes, as well as the need for constructive moderation in the relations of nephrologists with each other and, between them, with the Industry, as well as all the ethical consequences arising from these factors.",Jornal brasileiro de nefrologia,2022-,"Ferraz FHRP, Rodrigues CIS",2,1362,nephrology,2025-11-22
32034297,Green nephrology.,"Clear evidence indicates that the health of the natural world is declining globally at rates that are unprecedented in human history. This decline represents a major threat to the health and wellbeing of human populations worldwide. Environmental change, particularly climate change, is already having and will increasingly have an impact on the incidence and distribution of kidney diseases. Increases in extreme weather events owing to climate change are likely to have a destabilizing effect on the provision of care to patients with kidney disease. Ironically, health care is part of the problem, contributing substantially to resource depletion and greenhouse gas emissions. Among medical therapies, the environmental impact of dialysis seems to be particularly high, suggesting that the nephrology community has an important role to play in exploring environmentally responsible health-care practices. There is a need for increased monitoring of resource usage and waste generation by kidney care facilities. Opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of haemodialysis include capturing and reusing reverse osmosis reject water, utilizing renewable energy, improving waste management and potentially reducing dialysate flow rates. In peritoneal dialysis, consideration should be given to improving packaging materials and point-of-care dialysate generation.",Nature reviews.

33094515,ATTENTION: Workforce shortages as a barrier to optimal dialysis.,"Providing optimal end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) management requires an adequately trained and sufficiently staffed workforce, including doctors, nurses, and patient care technicians (PCTs). The growing need for ESKD services for a surging population of dialysis-dependent patients has made obvious a workforce crisis affecting nephrology. For a multitude of reasons, the physician workforce supply available to provide dialysis care has failed to expand commensurate with patients need in recent years. Of most importance, fewer US trainees are choosing to enter nephrology, and fewer international medical graduates are available to fill training program rosters. Equally important but less frequently cited are occupational shortages of trained dialysis nurses and PCTs.

We developed a 14-item electronic survey, which consisted of multiple-choice questions covering exercise training programs, physical assessment, barriers to exercise practice and to exercise programs, exercise and physical activity counselling practices, perceived exercise benefits, literature evidence, and research priorities. Data on the characteristics of the centres were also collected. Sixty-two responses from Italian nephrology centres were collected. Ninety-three percent of the respondents were aware of the scientific evidence supporting the benefits of regular exercise programs for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Additionally, in 75% of centres the nephrologists believed that physical activity counselling should be performed by the nephrologists. However, only 26% of centres provided exercise programs, mainly for dialysis patients, and 63% never or infrequently assessed physical activity in the context of patient management. Eighty-nine percent of centres reported barriers to implementing exercise programs, including lack of funding, institutional disinterest, patient refusal, and negative attitudes of the healthcare personnel. Forty-six research priorities related to exercise in CKD patients were suggested, with the majority focusing on impact of exercise programs and physical activity on cardiovascular, nutritional, and psychosocial outcomes.

A shortage of specialist nephrology services plus no consistent criteria for referral and reporting leads to referral pattern variability in the management of individuals with chronic kidney disease. The objective of this review was to explore the referral patterns of individuals with chronic kidney disease from primary care to specialist nephrology services. It focused on the primary-specialist care interface, optimal timing of referral to nephrology services, adequacy of preparation for kidney replacement therapy, and the role of clinical criteria vs. risk-based prediction tools in guiding the referral process. A narrative review was utilised to summarise the literature, with the intent of providing a broad-based understanding of the referral patterns for patients with chronic kidney disease in order to guide clinical practice decisions. The review identified original English language qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods publications as well as systematic reviews and meta-analyses available in PubMed and Google Scholar from their inception to 24 March 2023. Thirteen papers met the criteria for detailed review. We grouped the findings into three main themes: (1) Outcomes of the timing of referral to nephrology services, (2) Adequacy of preparation for kidney replacement therapy, and (3) Comparison of clinical criteria vs. risk-based prediction tools. The review demonstrated that regardless of the time frame used to define early vs. late referral in relation to the start of kidney replacement therapy, better outcomes are evidenced in patients referred early. This review informs the patterns and timing of referral for pre-dialysis specialist care to mitigate adverse outcomes for individuals with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis. Enhancing current risk prediction equations will enable primary care clinicians to accurately predict the risk of clinically important outcomes and provide much-needed guidance on the timing of referral between primary care and specialist nephrology services.",BMC nephrology,2024-Apr,"Mutatiri C, Ratsch A, McGrail M, Venuthurupalli SK, Chennakesavan SK",5,2272,nephrology,2025-11-22

37178207,The impact of rural status on pediatric chronic kidney disease.,"Children and adolescents in rural areas with chronic kidney disease (CKD) face unique challenges related to accessing pediatric nephrology care. Challenges to obtaining care begin with living increased distances from pediatric health care centers. Recent trends of increasing centralization of pediatric care mean fewer locations have pediatric nephrology, inpatient, and intensive care services. In addition, access to care for rural populations expands beyond distance and encompasses domains of approachability, acceptability, availability and accommodation, affordability, and appropriateness. Furthermore, the current literature identifies additional barriers to care for rural patients that include limited resources, including finances, education, and community/neighborhood social resources. Rural pediatric kidney failure patients have barriers to kidney replacement therapy options that may be even more limited for rural pediatric kidney failure patients when compared to rural adults with kidney failure. This educational review identifies possible strategies to improve health systems for rural CKD patients and their families: (1) increasing rural patient and hospital/clinic representation and focus in research, (2) understanding and mediating gaps in the geographic distribution of the pediatric nephrology workforce, (3) introducing regionalization models for delivering pediatric nephrology care to geographic areas, and (4) employing telehealth to expand the geographic reach of services and reduce family time and travel burden.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2024-Feb,"Swanson MB, Weidemann DK, Harshman LA",3,1549,nephrology,2025-11-22
33475249,Novel genetic testing model: A collaboration between genetic counselors and nephrology.,"Many barriers to genetic testing currently exist which delay or prevent diagnosis. These barriers include wait times, staffing, education, and cost. Specialists are able to identify patients with disease that may need genetic testing, but lack the genetics support to facilitate that testing in the most cost, time, and medically effective manner. The Nephrology Division and the Genetic Testing Stewardship Program at Nemours A.I. duPont Hospital for Children created a novel service delivery model in which nephrologists and genetic counselors collaborate in order to highlight their complementary strengths (clinical expertise of nephrologists and genetics and counseling skills of genetic counselors). This collaboration has reduced many barriers to care for our patients. This workflow facilitated the offering of genetic testing to 76 patients, with 86 tests completed over a 20-month period. Thirty-two tests were deferred. Twenty-seven patients received a diagnosis, which lead to a change in their medical management, three of whom were diagnosed by cascade family testing. Forty-two patients had a negative result and 16 patients had one or more variants of uncertain significance on testing. The inclusion of genetic counselors in the workflow is integral toward choosing the most cost and time effective genetic testing strategy, as well as providing psychosocial support to families. The genetic counselors obtain informed consent, and review genetic test results and recommendations with the patient and their family. The availability of this program to our patients increased access to genetic testing and helps to provide diagnoses and supportive care.",American journal of medical genetics.

36161695,Incorporating genetics services into adult kidney disease care.,"Studies have shown that as many as 1 in 10 adults with chronic kidney disease has a monogenic form of disease. However, genetic services in adult nephrology are limited. An adult Kidney Genetics Clinic was established within the nephrology division at a large urban academic medical center to increase access to genetic services and testing in adults with kidney disease. Between June 2019 and December 2021, a total of 363 patients were referred to the adult Kidney Genetics Clinic. Of those who completed genetic testing, a positive diagnostic finding was identified in 27.1%, a candidate diagnostic finding was identified in 6.7% of patients, and a nondiagnostic positive finding was identified in an additional 8.6% of patients, resulting in an overall yield of 42.4% for clinically relevant genetic findings in tested patients. A genetic diagnosis had implications for medical management, family member testing, and eligibility for clinical trials. With the utilization of telemedicine, genetic services reached a diverse geographic and patient population. Genetic education efforts were integral to the clinic's success, as they increased visibility and helped providers identify appropriate referrals. Ongoing access to genomic services will remain a fundamental component of patient care in adults with kidney disease.","American journal of medical genetics.

SRs that were published in the top ten ""urology and nephrology"" journals with the highest impact factor according to the 2020 Journal Citation Reports (covering 2016-2020) were systematically searched and evaluated using the GRADE approach. A total of 445 SRs were researched. Sixty SRs of randomized control trials (RCTs) and/or non-randomized studies (NRSs) were evaluated using the GRADE approach. Forty-nine SRs (11%) rated the outcome-specific certainty of evidence (n = 29 in 2019-2020). We identified 811 certainty of evidence outcome ratings (n = 544 RCT ratings) as follows: very low (33.0%); low (32.1%); moderate (24.5%); and high (10.4%). Very low and high certainty of evidence ratings accounted for 55.0% and 0.4% of ratings in SRs of NRSs compared to 23.0% and 15.3% in SRs of RCTs. The certainty of evidence for RCTs and NRSs was downgraded most often for risk of bias and imprecision.

There is currently limited literature on how confident paediatric nephrology teams feel to identify and manage oral health concerns for their patients. An exploratory mixed-method survey was distributed across all 13 UK specialist paediatric nephrology centres with responses received from consultants, registrars, specialist nurses and special interest (SPIN) paediatricians. Responses received from 109 multidisciplinary team members of 13/13 (100%) UK tertiary units. Ninety-two percent (n = 100) of respondents reported they had never received any training in oral health and 87% (n = 95) felt that further training would be beneficial to optimise care for patients and improve communication between medical and dental teams. Most respondents reported that they did not regularly examine, or enquire about, their patients' oral health. Only 16% (n = 17) reported that all their paediatric kidney transplant recipients underwent routine dental assessment prior to transplant listing. Severe adverse oral health outcomes were rarely reported and only 11% (n = 12) of respondents recalled having a patient who had a kidney transplant delayed or refused due to concerns about oral infection. Seventy-eight percent (n = 85) felt that joint working with a dental team would benefit patients at their unit; however, 17% (n = 18) felt that current infrastructure does not currently support effective joint working. Across the UK, paediatric kidney health professionals report lack of confidence and training in oral health. Upskilling subspecialty teams and creating dental referral pathways are recommended to maximise oral health outcomes for CYP with kidney diseases.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2024-Jul,"Wallace CK, Vernazza CR, Emmet V, Singhal N, Sathyanarayana V, Tse Y, Taylor GD",7,1758,nephrology,2025-11-22

Eighty-one CFS assessments were completed by nephrologists, nephrology advanced trainees and clinical nurse specialists. CFS completion rates were 79% from the multidisciplinary Low Clearance Clinic and 41% from nurse-led Pre-dialysis Education Clinic. Planned modality of ESKD management varied with degree of frailty (P < 0.001). 21% of patients who had CFS completed were planned for Conservative Management of ESKD, in contrast to only 5% of those who did not have CFS assessment completed (P < 0.001). Frailty assessment via CFS was feasible in outpatient practice when integrated into routine clinical assessment in a dedicated clinic. Planned ESKD management varied with the degree of frailty. Completion of frailty assessment, when compared with non-completion, appears to be associated with increased planned conservative management of ESKD.",Internal medicine journal,2021-Aug,"Kumarasinghe AP, Chakera A, Chan K, Dogra S, Broers S, Maher S, Inderjeeth C, Jacques A",8,1715,nephrology,2025-11-22
32060821,Time to referral to a nephrology clinic for pediatric hypertension.,"Rates of pediatric hypertension have increased, but adherence to the current diagnostic criteria for hypertension (HTN) in pediatrics is not well known. We investigated the timeline and predictors of time to referral for those referred to nephrology for elevated blood pressure (EBP). A retrospective study was conducted on patients, aged 3-18 years, referred to a nephrology clinic for EBP over a 3-year period. Patients were excluded if they were referred previously, were referred for other conditions, or did not have ≥ 1 prior visit with EBP. Analyses were performed to determine whether sex, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and obesity predicted number of prior visits with EBP and time to referral. There were 120 patients (64% male; 53% obese) included and 82 (68%) had ≥ 3 prior visits with EBP ≥ 95%. Medians were as follows: 15.08 years of age at referral; 5 visits with EBP and 3.45 years from first EBP ≥ 90%; 4 visits with EBP and 1.42 years from third EBP ≥ 95%. No variables significantly predicted number of prior visits with EBP or time to referral from the first EBP. Starting with the third EBP ≥ 95%, only obesity significantly predicted number of prior visits and time to referral: Obese patients had more visits (p = 0.01), and took longer to be referred (p = 0.03) than healthy patients. Patients with EBP were generally not referred to nephrology promptly, which was especially true for obese patients. Further research is needed to identify interventions to improve time to referral for EBP.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2020-May,"Hamby T, Pueringer MR, Noorani S, Khanna A, Barrow J, Razzouk R",6,1523,nephrology,2025-11-22

For patients with MM initially diagnosed in the nephrology or orthopedic departments, age- and sex-matched patients without MM were randomly selected in a 1:1 ratio. Conditional logistic regression models were used to assess the risk of MM in hospitalized patients in the nephrology and orthopedic departments. This study included 200 patients, with a median age of 65 years. There were differences among patients in the three departments with respect to fracture, degree of anemia, proteinuria levels, red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin levels, total protein (TP) levels, albumin levels, and laboratory indicators of renal function.

39232944,Evaluating Medical Devices in Nephrology Using Patient-Reported Outcome and Experience Measures.,"Incorporating the patient's perspective into the entire product life cycle of medical device development is paramount for ensuring patient-centric evaluation. By prioritizing patient-centric evaluation, medical device developers can better address patient needs and enhance the quality and effectiveness of health care solutions. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), patient preference information (PPI), and qualitative inquiry are methodologies to incorporate and amplify the patient's voice. In nephrology, unlike in other clinical domains, the utilization of PROs, PPI, and qualitative inquiry in medical device development has been notably sparse. Consequently, a glaring absence of patient involvement in the development of devices leaves the impact of these devices on patient well-being and functionality largely unexplored. Many forward-thinking programs as well as Food and Drug Administration guidance on the use of PROs and PPI are effectively bringing PROs into nephrology device development. Many resources exist to help researchers select high-quality PROs. There are unique considerations for using PROs and PPI to support regulatory decision-making, including fit-for-purpose, concepts of interest, context of use, and least burdensome selection. The rapid evolution of patient-centric initiatives in nephrology will serve to ensure that medical devices meet the needs of people with kidney disease and improve the quality of care.",Seminars in nephrology,2024-,"Grandinetti A, Richardson MM",2,1445,nephrology,2025-11-22

We conducted systematic reviews of all comparative observational studies in nephrology from 2006 to 2016 to assess the trends in the past decade. We then focused on the meta-analyses combining observational studies and RCTs to evaluate the systematic differences in effect estimates between study designs using two statistical methods: by estimating the ratio of odds ratios (ROR) of the pooled OR obtained from observational studies versus those from RCTs and by examining the discrepancies in their statistical significance. The number of systematic reviews of observational studies in nephrology had grown by 11.7-fold in the past decade. Among 56 records combining observational studies and RCTs, ROR suggested that the estimates between study designs agreed well (ROR 1.05, 95% confidence interval 0.90-1.23). However, almost half of the reviews led to discrepant interpretations in terms of statistical significance. In conclusion, the findings based on ROR might encourage researchers to justify the inclusion of observational studies in meta-analyses.

However, there are scarce data regarding best practices for return of results and clinical application of actionable genetic findings for kidney patients. We developed a return of results workflow in collaborations with clinicians for the retrospective recontact of adult nephrology patients who had been recruited into a biobank research study for exome sequencing and were identified to have medically actionable genetic findings. Using this workflow, we attempted to recontact a diverse pilot cohort of 104 nephrology research participants with actionable genetic findings, encompassing 34 different monogenic etiologies of nephropathy and five single-gene disorders recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics for return as medically actionable secondary findings. We successfully recontacted 64 (62%) participants and returned results to 41 (39%) individuals. In each case, the genetic diagnosis had meaningful implications for the patients' nephrology care. Through implementation efforts and qualitative interviews with providers, we identified over 20 key challenges associated with returning results to study participants, and found that physician knowledge gaps in genomics was a recurrent theme. We iteratively addressed these challenges to yield an optimized workflow, which included standardized consultation notes with tailored management recommendations, monthly educational conferences on core topics in genomics, and a curated list of expert clinicians for patients requiring extranephrologic referrals.

To examine whether patients with CKD at various levels of kidney failure risk receive nephrology care within 1 year of established risk. This population-based, retrospective cohort study collected nationwide administrative health claims data from 156 733 adult patients who met the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes initiative CKD diagnostic criteria between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2019, and had an available urine albumin to creatinine ratio within 90 days of a serum creatinine laboratory test. Patients with a history of dialysis or kidney transplant, a prior visit with a nephrologist in the past year, or palliative care billing codes or those who died or disenrolled within 1 year of the albumin to creatinine ratio measurement were excluded. Data analysis was performed from September 10, 2022, to February 14, 2022. Kidney failure risk computed with the 5-year Kidney Failure Risk Equation. The main outcome was nephrology care rates across tiers of kidney failure risk, estimated as the proportion of individuals having a nephrologist visit within 1 year after index time. The study population consisted of 156 733 patients with CKD (mean [SD] age, 74.6 [8.4] years; 91 906 [58.6%] female; 86 457 [55.2%] White). A total of 106 004 patients (67.6%) had a low (≤1%) 5-year risk of kidney failure. Nephrology visit rates increased with higher kidney failure risk. Among the 137 highest-risk patients, 79 (57.7%; 95% CI, 48.4%-64.7%) had a nephrology visit. Among 7730 patients with risk above a 10% threshold, 3208 (41.5%; 95% CI, 40.3%-42.4%) had a nephrology visit. This study's findings suggest that nearly half of patients with CKD at high risk of progressing to kidney failure do not have a nephrologist visit within 1 year of established risk.

The fraction of glomeruli with cellular or fibrocellular crescents based on the new system was reevaluated. The association between crescents fractions and the outcomes were further analyzed.<b>Results:</b> The median follow-up period was 76.5 months. Cellular or fibrocellular crescents were present in 146 (50.7%) of the total individuals. The percentage of crescents were significantly associated with severe clinical renal injury indices and other renal pathological parameter. According to the survival receiver operating characteristic (survival ROC) curve, the optimal cutoff level of cellular or fibrocellular crescents for predicting the composite events was 7.39%. By multivariable Cox hazard analysis, the presence of crescents was predictive of survival from the composite events with a hazard ratio [HR] of 2.5 (95% CI 1.190-5.431; <i>p</i> = .02). Furthermore, when we used absent, present in less than 7.39% of glomeruli, and present in greater than or equal to 7.39% of glomeruli as cutoffs in all the patients, a gradation appeared, with adjusted HRs of 2.9 (95% CI 1.326-6.313; <i>p</i> = .008) for crescents in greater than or equal to 7.39% of glomeruli, in reference to no crescents.<b>Conclusion:</b> We proposed that the crescents were not uncommon and had important clinical significance in lupus nephritis.

31673162,Kidney disease trials for the 21st century: innovations in design and conduct.,"Compared to other specialties, nephrology has reported relatively few clinical trials, and most of these are too small to detect moderate treatment effects. Consequently, interventions that are commonly used by nephrologists have not been adequately tested and some may be ineffective or harmful. More randomized trials are urgently needed to address important clinical questions in patients with kidney disease. The use of robust surrogate markers may accelerate early-phase drug development. However, scientific innovations in trial conduct developed by other specialties should also be adopted to improve trial quality and enable more, larger trials in kidney disease to be completed in the current era of burdensome regulation and escalating research costs. Examples of such innovations include utilizing routinely collected health-care data and disease-specific registries to identify and invite potential trial participants, and for long-term follow-up; use of prescreening to facilitate rapid recruitment of participants; use of pre-randomization run-in periods to improve participant adherence and assess responses to study interventions prior to randomization; and appropriate use of statistics to monitor studies and analyse their results. Nephrology is well positioned to harness such innovations due to its advanced use of electronic health-care records and the development of disease-specific registries. Adopting a population approach and efficient trial conduct along with challenging unscientific regulation may increase the number of definitive clinical trials in nephrology and improve the care of current and future patients.",Nature reviews.

38890135,"Best practice for the selection, design and implementation of UK Kidney Association guidelines: a modified Delphi consensus approach.","Despite research into how to effectively implement evidence-based recommendations into clinical practice, a lack of standardisation in the commissioning and development of clinical practice guidelines can lead to inconsistencies and gaps in implementation. This research aimed to ascertain how topics in kidney care worthy of guideline development within the UK should be chosen, prioritised, designed and implemented. Following a modified Delphi methodology, a multi-disciplinary panel of experts in kidney healthcare from across the UK developed 35 statements on the issues surrounding the selection, development and implementation of nephrology guidelines. Consensus with these statements was determined by agreement using an online survey; the consensus threshold was defined as 75% agreement. 419 responses were received. Of the 364 healthcare practitioners (HCPs), the majority had over 20 years of experience in their role (n=123) and most respondents were nephrologists (n=95). Of the 55 non-clinical respondents, the majority were people with kidney disease (n=41) and the rest were their carers or family. Participants were from across England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Consensus between HCPs was achieved in 32/35 statements, with 28 statements reaching ≥90% agreement. Consensus between patients and patient representatives was achieved across all 20 statements, with 13/20 reaching ≥90% agreement. The current results have provided the basis for six recommendations to improve the selection, design and implementation of guidelines. Actioning these recommendations will help improve the accessibility of, and engagement with, clinical guidelines, contributing to the continuing development of best practice in UK kidney care.",BMJ open,2024-Jun,"Burton JO, Chilcot J, Fielding K, Frankel AH, Lakhani N, Nye P, Parker K, Priestman W, Willingham F",9,1751,nephrology,2025-11-22
36789889,The effect of genetic education on the referral of patients to genetic evaluation: Findings from a national survey of nephrologists.,"The success of genomic medicine hinges on the implementation of genetic knowledge in clinical settings. In novel subspecialties, it requires that clinicians refer patients to genetic evaluation or testing, however referral is likely to be affected by genetic knowledge. An online survey was administered to self-identified nephrologists working in the United States. Nephrologists' demographic characteristics, genetic education, confidence in clinical genetics, genetic knowledge, and referral rates of patients to genetic evaluation were collected. In total, 201 nephrologists completed the survey. All reported treating patients with genetic forms of kidney disease, and 37% had referred <5 patients to genetic evaluation. A third had limited basic genetic knowledge. Most nephrologists (85%) reported concerns regarding future health insurance eligibility as a barrier to referral to genetic testing. Most adult nephrologists reported insufficient genetic education during residency (65%) and fellowship training (52%). Lower rating of genetic education and lower knowledge in recognizing signs of genetic kidney diseases were significantly associated with lower number of patients referred to the genetic evaluation (P < .001). Most nephrologists reported that improving their genetic knowledge is important for them (>55%). There is a need to enhance nephrologists' genetic education to increase genetic testing use in nephrology.",Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,2023-May,"Rasouly HM, Balderes O, Marasa M, Fernandez H, Lipton M, Lin F, Gharavi AG, Sabatello M",8,1436,nephrology,2025-11-22
32560782,Training the Public Physician: The Nephrology Social Media Collective Internship.,"The significant growth of social media use by the medical community, including nephrology, has led to a need to equip health care professionals with the mentorship, knowledge, and tools to use these platforms both effectively and professionally. Social media is free and accessible to almost anyone with a computer or mobile device, which not only has revolutionized the dissemination of information, but also has created a venue for unprofessionalism and missteps. This article describes the Nephrology Social Media Collective internship, a 12-month, mentored training program during which selected interns participate in a curriculum of lectures, activities, and projects that aim to increase their knowledge, proficiency, and confidence in the use of social media. The goal of the internship is to train participants to acquire modern communication skills that are not taught in traditional medical training, and leverage these to become leaders in medicine.

34792220,Acute kidney injury referred to the nephrologist: A single centre experience in a tertiary care hospital.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) shows an increasing incidence, accounting for a remarkable proportion of nephrology team in-hospital activity. The aim was to describe main features and outcomes of AKI observed in patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital. We conducted a retrospective analysis in all consecutive AKI patients referred for nephrology consultation (November 2018-February 2020) focusing on the factors associated with in-hospital mortality within 90 days and kidney function recovery (KFR) upon discharge. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data, as well as main features of AKI episodes, were collected from medical records of the entire hospital stay. AKI was defined according to KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline. Among 1145 patients referred for nephrology consultation, 559 were evaluated for AKI (598 episodes). Pre-existing CKD was present in 54.7% of patients. In 69.2% of cases AKI was evaluated within 48 h from its onset. Most of the episodes (66.6%) were classified as KDIGO Stage 3. In-hospital mortality within 90 days since admission was 43.3%. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed a higher mortality risk for advancing age (HR 1.02/unit, 95% CI 1.01-1.03) and oliguria (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.45-2.52), while a higher eGFR (HR 0.72/unit, 95% CI 0.54-0.95) and KFR within 7 days (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.94) were associated to a lower mortality. KFR was observed in 96.4% of survivors. In patients with partial KFR, the loss of eGFR was -29.2 ± 17.9 ml/min. KFR incidence rate was 6.79 per 100-person days (95% CI 6.72-6.87) in survivors and 2.30 (95% CI 2.25-2.35) in non-survivors. AKI-related nephrology activity accounts for most of the nephrologist workload as consultant. Referred AKI episodes are frequently severe and superimposed on CKD, carrying a relatively high mortality in a patient population developing AKI outside ICU. Early KFR appears strongly associated with a favourable impact upon in-hospital survival.","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2022-Feb,"Pistolesi V, Artegiani F, Di Napoli A, Zeppilli L, Santoboni F, Somma S, Di Mario F, Regolisti G, Fiaccadori E, Morabito S",10,1957,nephrology,2025-11-22
35384220,Equity and diversity in the nephrology workforce in Australia and New Zealand.,"Despite diversity initiatives, inequities persist in medicine with negative implications for the workforce and patients. Little is known about workplace inequity in nephrology. To describe perceptions and experiences of bias by health professionals in the Australian and New Zealand Society of Nephrology (ANZSN), focussing on gender and race. A web-based survey of ANZSN members recorded degree of perceived inequity on a Likert scale, ranging from 1 (none) to 5 (complete). Groups were compared using Mann-Whitney U-test and logistic regression. Comments were synthesised using qualitative methods to explore themes of inequity and pathways to an inclusive future. Of the 620 members of the ANZSN, there were 134 (22%) respondents, of whom 57% were women and 67% were White. The majority (88%) perceived inequities in the workforce. Perceived drivers of inequity were gender (84/113; 75%), carer responsibilities (74/113; 65%) and race (64/113; 56%). Half (74/131) had personally experienced inequity, based on gender in 70% (52/74) and race in 39% (29/75) with perceived discrimination coming from doctors, patients, academics and health administrators. White males were least likely (odds ratio 0.39; 95% confidence interval 0.18-0.90) to experience inequity. Dominant themes from qualitative analysis indicated that the major impacts of inequity were limited opportunities for advancement and lack of formal assistance for those experiencing inequities. Proposed solutions to reduce inequity included normalising the discourse on inequity at an organisational level, with policy changes to ensure diverse representation on committees and in executive leadership positions. Inequity, particularly driven by gender and race, is common for nephrology health professionals in Australia and New Zealand and impacts career progression.",Internal medicine journal,2022-Nov,"Francis A, O'Sullivan KM, Patel P, Viecelli AK, Hedley JA, Swaminathan R, Crosthwaite A, Haloob I, Kennard A, Rowlandson M, Boudville N, Webster AC, Wyburn K",13,1834,nephrology,2025-11-22
35146540,Impact of nephrology care trajectories pre-CKD stage 5 on initiation of kidney replacement therapy in children.,"To improve pre-emptive kidney transplantation (PKT) in children and limit starting dialysis in an emergency, we aimed to describe nephrology care trajectories pre-CKD stage 5. We included all children in France who, between 2010 and 2016, started kidney replacement therapy (KRT): standard dialysis (reference group) and emergency dialysis or PKT. We identified four pre-CKD stage 5 nephrology care trajectories before KRT that were extracted from the national exhaustive medical-administrative database and used logistic regression to explore associations between patient characteristics, care trajectories, and KRT initiation. Six hundred forty-three pediatric patients started KRT in France; 406 started dialysis and 30.5% emergency dialysis. The ""optimal"" care trajectory encompassed 179 patients, 82.7% with at least 18 months nephrology follow-up. Conversely, the ""no care"" trajectory encompassed 118 patients with no nephrology follow-up before KRT. The ""severe"" trajectory encompassed 128 patients; 93% hospitalized more than once a year and 18% in an intensive care unit. Finally, the ""irregular"" trajectory encompassed 127 patients, 77% and 46% with irregular laboratory monitoring and CKD drug delivery, respectively. With the ""optimal"" trajectory as the reference, probability of emergency dialysis was higher with the ""irregular"" and ""no care"" trajectories (odds ratio 3.02 [95% confidence interval 1.18-7.66] and 26.5 [10.8-64.8], respectively), and PKT was reduced with the ""severe"" trajectory (0.43 [0.23-0.82]). We identified a group of patients with irregular follow-up who may benefit the most from interventions aiming at improving adherence to treatment and earlier diagnosis of their CKD to improve access to PKT.

33414153,Mass Disasters and Burnout in Nephrology Personnel: From Earthquakes and Hurricanes to COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Mass disasters result in extensive health problems and make health care delivery problematic, as has been the case during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although COVID-19 was initially considered a pulmonary problem, it soon became clear that various other organs were involved. Thus, many care providers, including kidney health personnel, were overwhelmed or developed burnout. This review aims to describe the spectrum of burnout in mass disasters and suggests solutions specifically for nephrology personnel by extending previous experience to the COVID-19 pandemic. Burnout (a psychologic response to work-related stress) is already a frequent part of routine nephrology practice and, not surprisingly, is even more common during mass disasters due to increased workload and specific conditions, in addition to individual factors. Avoiding burnout is essential to prevent psychologic and somatic health problems in personnel as well as malpractice, understaffing, and inadequate health care delivery, all of which increase the health care burden of disasters. Burnout may be prevented by predisaster organizational measures, which include developing an overarching plan and optimizing health care infrastructure, and <i>ad hoc</i> disaster-specific measures that encompass both organizational and individual measures. Organizational measures include increasing safety, decreasing workload and fear of malpractice, optimizing medical staffing and material supplies, motivating personnel, providing mental health support, and enabling flexibility in working circumstances. Individual measures include training on coping with stress and problematic conditions, minimizing the stigma of emotional distress, and maintaining physical health. If these measures fall short, asking for external help is mandatory to avoid an inefficient disaster health care response. Minimizing burnout by applying these measures will improve health care provision, thus saving as many lives as possible.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2021-May,"Sever MS, Ortiz A, Maggiore U, Bac-García E, Vanholder R",5,1976,nephrology,2025-11-22

We evaluated pediatric nephrology approaches to prenatal CAKUT counseling and neonatal dialysis initiation. A 35-question Qualtrics survey was distributed via the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies email list between January and March 2021. Thirty-nine pediatric nephrology centers completed the survey. All but one responding center (<i>n</i> = 38) provide prenatal CAKUT consultations and neonatal dialysis, with wide variability in reported multispecialty involvement. Nearly half (47%) of centers utilize written/unwritten criteria for offering neonatal dialysis. The most common contraindications to neonatal dialysis were parental refusal (61%), contraindication to access placement by surgeons (55%), and birth weight (BW) contraindication (55%, with < 1,500 g being the most common BW contraindication). Overall, 79% of centers reported caring for < 5 neonates with ESKD in the past year, 61% use hemodialysis therapies prior to peritoneal dialysis in neonates requiring dialysis, and 100% transition to peritoneal dialysis by hospital discharge. Many pediatric nephrology programs provide prenatal CAKUT consultations and neonatal dialysis, but with variability in practice approach.

33774630,The Global Kidney Health Atlas: Burden and Opportunities to Improve Kidney Health Worldwide.,"CKD is a growing public health problem. The Global Kidney Health Atlas (GKHA) is an important initiative of the International Society of Nephrology. The GKHA aims to improve the understanding of inter- and intranational variability across the globe, focusing on capacity for kidney care delivery. The GKHA survey was launched in 2017 and then again in 2019, using the same core data, supplemented by information about dialysis access and conservative care. Based on a WHO framework of the 6 building blocks essential for health care, the GKHA assesses capacity in 6 domains: information systems, services delivery, workforce, financing, access to essential medicines, and leadership/governance. In addition, the GKHA assesses the capacity for research in all regions of the world, across all domains (basic, translational, clinical, and health system research). The results of the GKHA have informed policy and been used to enhance advocacy strategies in different regions. In addition, through documentation of the disparities within and between countries and regions, initiatives have been launched to foster change. Since the first survey, there has been an increase in the number of countries which have registries to document the burden of CKD or dialysis. For many, information about the burden of disease is the first step toward addressing care delivery issues, including prevention, delay of progression, and access to services. Worldwide collaboration in the documentation of kidney health and disease is an important step toward the goal of ensuring equitable access to kidney health worldwide.",Annals of nutrition & metabolism,2020-,"Bharati J, Jha V, Levin A",3,1605,nephrology,2025-11-22

Due to the state of emergency, regulatory waivers in the United States have made it possible for providers to deliver and bill for services across state lines for new and established patients through Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)- and non-HIPAA-compliant platforms with home as the originating site and without geographic restrictions. Platforms have been developed or purchased to perform videoconferencing, and interdisciplinary dialysis teams have adapted to perform virtual visits. Telehealth experiences and challenges encountered by dialysis providers, clinicians, nurses, and patients have exposed health care disparities in areas such as access to care, bandwidth connectivity, availability of devices to perform telehealth, and socioeconomic and language barriers. Future directions in telehealth use, quality measures, and research in telehealth use need to be explored.

36385300,Preparing European Nephrology for the next pandemic: lessons from the ERACODA collaboration.,"Owing to the vulnerability of patients with chronic kidney disease to infectious diseases, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been particularly devastating for the nephrology community. Unfortunately, the possibility of future COVID-19 waves or outbreaks of other infectious diseases with pandemic potential cannot be ruled out. The nephrology community made tremendous efforts to contain the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted several shortcomings in our response to the pandemic and has taught us important lessons that can be utilized to improve our preparedness for any future health crises of a similar nature. In this article we draw lessons from the European Renal Association COVID-19 Database (ERACODA) project, a pan-European collaboration initiated in March 2020 to understand the prognosis of COVID-19 in patients on kidney function replacement therapy. We discuss the challenges faced in generating timely and robust evidence for informed management of patients with kidney disease and give recommendations for our preparedness for the next pandemic in Europe. Limited collaboration, the absence of common data architecture and the sub-optimal quality of available data posed challenges in our response to COVID-19. Aligning different research initiatives, strengthening electronic health records, and involving experts in study design and data analysis will be important in our response to the next pandemic. The European Renal Association may take a leading role in aligning research initiatives via its engagement with other scientific societies, national registries, administrators and researchers.","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2023-Feb,"Vart P, Duivenvoorden R, Franssen CFM, Hemmelder MH, Jager KJ, Hilbrands LB, Noordzij M, Abramowicz D, Basile C, Covic A, Crespo M, Massy ZA, Ortiz A, Emilio Sanchez J, Petridou E, White C, Gansevoort RT",17,1689,nephrology,2025-11-22

We reviewed our experience with graded surgical responsibility and structured didactic training, creating arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) for Guatemalan children. Pediatric vascular access missions were completed from 2015 to 2023 and analyzed retrospectively. Follow-up was completed by the Guatemalan pediatric surgeons, nephrologists, and nursing staff. AVF patency and patient survival were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis with univariate and multivariable association between patient demographic variables by Cox proportional hazards models. Among a total of 153 vascular access operations, there were 139 new patient procedures, forming the study group for this review. The mean age was 13.6 years, 42.6% were female, and the mean BMI was 17.3. Radial or ulnar artery-based direct AVFs were established in 100 patients (71.9%) and ten of the 25 transposition procedures. Brachial artery inflow was required in 29 direct AVFs (20.9%). Two patients underwent femoral vein transpositions. Access-related distal ischemia was not encountered. Seven of the AVF patients later required access banding for arm edema; all had previous dialysis catheters (mean = 9, range 4-12). Primary and cumulative patency rates were 84% and 86% at 12 months and 64% and 81% at 24 months, respectively. The median follow-up was 12 months. Overall patient survival was 84% and 67% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. There were no deaths related to AVF access. Safe and functional AVFs were established in a teaching environment within a Guatemalan comprehensive pediatric nephrology center.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2025-Jan,"Jennings WC, Galvez AL, Mushtaq N, Tejada RES, Mallios A, Lucas JF, Randel M, Lou-Meda R",8,1759,nephrology,2025-11-22

However, they present a high incidence of venous stenosis leading to thrombosis. Although training in interventional nephrology may improve accessibility for treatment of venous stenosis, there is limited data on the safety and efficacy of this approach performed by trained nephrologists in low-income and developing countries. This study presents the retrospective results of AVF angioplasties performed by trained nephrologists in a Brazilian outpatient interventional nephrology center. The primary outcome was technical success rate (completion of the procedure with angioplasty of all stenoses) and secondary outcomes were complication rates and overall AVF patency. Two hundred fifty-six angioplasties were performed in 160 AVF. The technical success rate was 88.77% and the main cause of technical failure was venous occlusion (10%). The incidence of complications was 13.67%, with only one patient needing hospitalization and four accesses lost due to the presence of hematomas and/or thrombosis. Grade 1 hematomas were the most frequent complication (8.2%). The overall patency found was 88.2 and 80.9% at 180 and 360 days after the procedure, respectively. Our findings suggest that AVF angioplasty performed by trained nephrologists has acceptable success rates and patency, with a low incidence of major complications as well as a low need for hospitalization.",Jornal brasileiro de nefrologia,2022-,"Franco RP, Riella MC, Chula DC, Alcântara MT, Nascimento MMD",5,1457,nephrology,2025-11-22

This study aimed to identify the access to these resources on a global scale using data from the multinational survey conducted by the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) (Global Kidney Health Atlas (GKHA) project), with emphasis on developing nations. For data analysis, the 125 participating countries were sorted into the 4 World Bank income groups: low income (LIC), lower-middle income (LMIC), upper-middle income (UMIC), and high income (HIC). A severe shortage of nephrologists was observed in LIC and LMIC with < 5 nephrologists per million population. Many LIC were unable to access estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria (proteinuria) tests in primary-care levels. Acute and chronic hemodialysis was available in most countries, although acute and chronic peritoneal dialysis access was severely limited in LIC (24% and 35%, respectively). Most countries had kidney transplantation access, except for LIC (12%). HIC and UMIC funded their renal replacement therapy (RRT) and renal medications primarily through public means, whereas LMIC and LIC required private and out-of-pocket contributions.

This viewpoint paper advocates for a multi-omics approach, integrating clinical symptom patterns, non-invasive biomarkers, imaging and invasive diagnostics to enhance diagnosis and treatment. Early detection of molecular changes, particularly in collagen turnover, is crucial for preventing disease progression. For instance, urinary proteomics can detect early molecular changes in diabetic kidney disease (DKD), heart failure (HF) and coronary artery disease (CAD), enabling proactive interventions and reducing the need for invasive procedures like renal biopsies. For example, urinary proteomic patterns can differentiate between glomerular and extraglomerular pathologies, aiding in the diagnosis of specific kidney diseases. Additionally, urinary peptides can predict CKD progression and HF development, offering a non-invasive alternative to traditional biomarkers like eGFR and NT-proBNP. The integration of multi-omics data with artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise for personalised treatment strategies, optimizing patient outcomes. This approach can also reduce healthcare costs by minimizing unnecessary invasive procedures and hospitalizations. In conclusion, the adoption of multi-omics and non-invasive biomarkers in nephrology and cardiology can revolutionize disease management, enabling early detection, personalised treatment and improved patient outcomes.",Proteomics,2025-Jun,"Beige J, Masanneck M",2,1498,nephrology,2025-11-22
36093902,Which patients with CKD will benefit from genomic sequencing? Synthesizing progress to illuminate the future.,"This review will summarize and synthesize recent findings in regard to monogenic kidney disorders, including how that evidence is being translated into practice. It will add to existing key knowledge to provide context for clinicians in consolidating existing practice and approaches. Whilst there are long established factors, which indicate increased likelihood of identifying a monogenic cause for kidney disease, these can now be framed in terms of the identification of new genes, new indications for genomic testing and new evidence for clinical utility of genomic testing in nephrology. Further, inherent in the use of genomics in nephrology are key concepts including robust informed consent, variant interpretation and return of results. Recent findings of variants in genes related to complex or broader kidney phenotypes are emerging in addition to understanding of de novo variants. Phenocopy phenomena are indicating a more pragmatic use of broader gene panels whilst evidence is emerging of a role in unexplained kidney disease. Clinical utility is evolving but is being successfully demonstrated across multiple domains of outcome and practice. We provide an updated framework of evidence to guide application of genomic testing in chronic kidney disease (CKD), building upon existing principles and knowledge to indicate how the practice and implementation of this can be applied today. There are clearly established roles for genomic testing for some patients with CKD, largely those with suspected heritable forms, with these continuing to expand as new evidence emerges.",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,2022-Nov,Mallett AJ,1,1589,nephrology,2025-11-22

We sought to evaluate whether nephrology referral patterns reflect current clinical practice guidelines and to estimate the change in referral volume if they were based on the estimated risk of kidney failure. Observational cohort. Retrospective study of 399,644 veterans with chronic kidney disease (October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016). Laboratory referral criteria based on Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense guidelines, categories of predicted risk for kidney failure using the Kidney Failure Risk Equation, and the combination of laboratory referral criteria and predicted risk. Number of patients identified for referral. We evaluated the number of patients who were referred and their predicted 2-year risk for kidney failure. For each exposure, we estimated the number of patients who would be identified for referral. There were 66,276 patients who met laboratory indications for referral. Among these patients, 11,752 (17.7%) were referred to nephrology in the following year. The median 2-year predicted risk of kidney failure was 1.5% (interquartile range, 0.3%-4.7%) among all patients meeting the laboratory referral criteria. If referrals were restricted to patients with a predicted risk of ≥1% in addition to laboratory indications, the potential referral volume would be reduced from 66,276 to 38,229 patients. If referrals were based on predicted risk alone, a 2-year risk threshold of 1% or higher would identify a similar number of patients (72,948) as laboratory-based criteria with median predicted risk of 2.3% (interquartile range, 1.4%-4.6%). Missing proteinuria measurements. The current laboratory-based guidelines for nephrology referral identify patients who are, on average, at low risk for progression, most of whom are not referred.

He contributed to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying renovascular hypertension by explaining the crucial relationship between the decrease in renal blood flow and the increase in blood pressure. He also introduced a precise classification of the different types of hypertension and the associated renal involvement. In collaboration with Karl Theodor Fahr (1877-1945), he developed a new classification of Bright's disease (nephritis), which was published in the book Die Brightsche Nierenkrankheit. Klinik, Pathologie und Atlas, and revolutionized the concepts behind the mechanisms of glomerulonephritis.

We looked over 2 distinct categories of mathematical models that are widely used in biological research and pointed out some of their strengths and weaknesses when applied to health care, especially in the context of nephrology. A mechanistic dynamical system allows the representation of causal relations among the system variables but with a more complex and longer development/implementation phase. Artificial intelligence/machine learning provides predictive tools that allow identifying correlative patterns in large data sets, but they are usually harder-to-interpret black boxes. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), a major worldwide health problem, generates copious quantities of data that can be leveraged by choice of the appropriate model; also, there is a large number of dialysis parameters that need to be determined at every treatment session that can benefit from predictive mechanistic models. Following important steps in the use of mathematical methods in medical science might be in the intersection of seemingly antagonistic frameworks, by leveraging the strength of each to provide better care.",Advances in chronic kidney disease,2022-Sep,"Galuzio PP, Cherif A",2,1204,nephrology,2025-11-22

These innovations, including kidney replacement therapies, have been effective in providing additional options to patients facing serious illness, but they have also introduced a new level of complexity in the provider assessment of treatment for these patients. Health care providers are being tasked to decide if medical care is appropriate for an aging and medically complex population, a decision complicated by a variety of factors.

34934060,Red blood cell distribution width as a predictor of mortality among patients regularly visiting the nephrology outpatient clinic.,"The association between increased red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and mortality among patients treated on an outpatient basis in the nephrology outpatient clinic is unclear. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the association between baseline and time-averaged RDW and mortality risk in patients treated in our nephrology outpatient clinic. Our multi-center retrospective analysis was based on data of 16,417 outpatient nephrology patients with available baseline renal function and RWD values. The median baseline RDW was 13.0% (range, 10.0-32.1%). The high-RDW group was defined as the top quartile (≥ 13.8%, n = 4302). The crude mortality rate was 15.0% (n = 1806) at a median follow-up of 127.5 months. From the results of the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model adjusted for covariates, including eGFR, hemoglobin, and factors of anemia treatment, patients with a high time-averaged RDW had increased mortality risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.505; 95% confidence interval, 1.326-1.708; P < 0.001), irrespective of sex, presence of anemia, and chronic kidney disease, except in individuals aged < 45 years. Thus, increased baseline and time-averaged RDW were significantly associated with increased mortality in patients aged > 45 years treated on an outpatient basis in the nephrology clinic.",Scientific reports,2021-Dec,"Yoo KD, Oh HJ, Park S, Kang MW, Kim YC, Park JY, Lee J, Lee JS, Kim DK, Lim CS, Kim YS, Lee JP",12,1329,nephrology,2025-11-22
32853404,Onconephrology: The intersections between the kidney and cancer.,"Onconephrology is a new subspecialty of nephrology that recognizes the important intersections of kidney disease with cancer. This intersection takes many forms and includes drug-induced nephrotoxicity, electrolyte disorders, paraneoplastic glomerulonephritis, and the interactions of chronic kidney disease with cancer. Data clearly demonstrate that, when patients with cancer develop acute or chronic kidney disease, outcomes are inferior, and the promise of curative therapeutic regimens is lessened. This highlights the imperative for collaborative care between oncologists and nephrologists in recognizing and treating kidney disease in patients with cancer. In response to this need, specific training programs in onconephrology as well as dedicated onconephrology clinics have appeared. This comprehensive review covers many of the critical topics in onconephrology, with a focus on acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, drug-induced nephrotoxicity, kidney disease in stem cell transplantation, and electrolyte disorders in patients with cancer.",CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,2021-Jan,"Rosner MH, Jhaveri KD, McMahon BA, Perazella MA",4,1059,nephrology,2025-11-22

The investigated period is between the beginning of the 20th century and the entry of Italy into the Second World War, 1940. 34 papers dealing with the relationship between the kidney and the cardiovascular system were retrieved. All but two articles were published in Italian medical periodicals. The topics covered are varied and range from cardiotoxicity of substances in uremia to the role of renal disease in vascular damage. Some articles are forerunners of later pathophysiological concepts and research technologies. These concern early atherosclerotic vascular damage and the presence of dialyzable cardiotoxic substances in renal insufficiency. Unfortunately, these highly innovative researches have had little diffusion and have fallen into oblivion in Italy and abroad. In conclusion, our research shows that in the first half of the 20th century in Italy there was a lively interest in cardio-renal diseases and that some researchers had produced precursor results of what was confirmed many years later.",Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia,2022-Oct,Losito A,1,1115,nephrology,2025-11-22

39078507,TikTok and pediatric nephrology: content quality assessment of videos related to pediatric kidney disease and kidney transplant.,"Social media platforms such as TikTok™ are key sources of health information for young patients and caregivers. Misinformation is prevalent on TikTok™ across healthcare fields, which can perpetuate false beliefs about medical care. Limited data exists on the reliability of pediatric nephrology TikTok™ content. This study aimed to describe the quality of medical content of TikTok™ Videos (TTVs), related to pediatric kidney disease and transplant. TTVs were selected using specific search terms and categorized into pediatric kidney disease and kidney transplant, excluding duplicate and adult-related content. The top 100 TTVs in each category, based on views, were analyzed. TTV characteristics were stratified by account type (physician, non-physician healthcare professional (HCP), non-HCP) and video aim (personal story, education, entertainment). DISCERN scoring, a validated questionnaire evaluating health information reliability, was conducted by 4 independent raters. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using a 2-way random effects model, and differences between content creator types were evaluated using one-way ANOVA and post-Hoc Tukey test. TTVs had a total of 12.5 million likes and 113.1 million views. Over 70% of videos were created by non-HCPs (n = 147/200). DISCERN scoring revealed low reliability of medical information across content creator types. TTVs created by physicians and non-physician HCPs about kidney disease had significantly higher mean DISCERN scores compared to those created by non-HCPs (2.85, p < 0.001 and 2.48, p = 0.005, respectively). Educators within the pediatric nephrology community must keep in mind the lack of reliability of medical information available on TikTok™ and coordinate collective efforts to consider utilizing TikTok™ for patient education.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2024-Dec,"Sturm H, Abdullah M, Anand A, Sethna J, Frank R, Castellanos L, Singer P, Basalely A",8,1807,nephrology,2025-11-22

There is a call to action in the United States to significantly increase access and uptake of home dialysis as the preferred dialysis treatment option. Although most do not object to patient choice in modality selection, the reality is that there are multilevel barriers both obvious and subtle that interfere with expanding home dialysis access. Financial barriers and how payment is structured continue to be key drivers, although new models of care are emerging that include for the first time incentives rather than penalties regarding home dialysis. Resources to support implementation include expert personnel requiring educational training. Policies requiring training curriculum content that is not only specified within nephrology but also for these multidisciplinary providers requisite for successful home dialysis to ensure professional expertise is ready and available, and also to cultivate champions of home modality within the broader nephrology community. Perhaps most importantly, innovation through expanded investment in research is necessary to advance practices, elevate quality, and improve outcomes.

32818942,Area Deprivation and Risk of Death and CKD Progression: Long-Term Cohort Study in Patients under Unrestricted Nephrology Care.,"Area deprivation index (ADI) associates with prognosis in non-dialysis CKD. However, no study has evaluated this association in CKD patients under unrestricted nephrology care. We performed a long-term prospective study to assess the role of deprivation in CKD progression and mortality in stage 1-4 CKD patients under regular nephrology care, living in Naples (Italy). We used ADI calculated at census block levels, standardized to mean values of whole population in Naples, and linked to patients by georeference method. After 12 months of ""goal-oriented"" nephrology treatment, we compared the risk of death or composite renal outcomes (end-stage kidney disease or doubling of serum creatinine) in the tertiles of standardized ADI. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline was evaluated by mixed effects model for repeated eGFR measurements. We enrolled 715 consecutive patients (age: 64 ± 15 years; 59.1% males; eGFR: 49 ± 22 mL/min/1.73 m2). Most (75.2%) were at the lowest national ADI quintile. At referral, demographic, clinical, and therapeutic features were similar across ADI tertiles; after 12 months, treatment intensification allowed better control of hypertension, proteinuria, hypercholesterolaemia, and anaemia with no difference across ADI tertiles. During the subsequent long-term follow-up (10.5 years [interquartile range 8.2-12.6]), 166 renal events and 249 deaths were registered. ADI independently associated with all-cause death (p for trend = 0.020) and non-cardiovascular (CV) mortality (p for trend = 0.045), while CV mortality did not differ (p for trend = 0.252). Risk of composite renal outcomes was similar across ADI tertiles (p for trend = 0.467). The same held true for eGFR decline (p for trend = 0.675). In CKD patients under regular nephrology care, ADI is not associated with CKD progression, while it is associated with all-cause death due to an excess of non-CV mortality.",Nephron,2020-,"Borrelli S, Chiodini P, Caranci N, Provenzano M, Andreucci M, Simeon V, Panico S, De Stefano T, De Nicola L, Minutolo R, Conte G, Garofalo C",12,1923,nephrology,2025-11-22

34490519,Pediatric Onco-Nephrology: Time to Spread the Word-Part II: Long-Term Kidney Outcomes in Survivors of Childhood Malignancy and Malignancy after Kidney Transplant.,"Onco-nephrology is a recent and evolving medical subspecialty devoted to the care of patients with kidney disease and unique kidney-related complications in the context of cancer and its treatments, recognizing that management of kidney disease as well as the cancer itself will improve survival and quality of life. While this area has received much attention in the adult medicine sphere, similar emphasis in the pediatric realm has not yet been realized. As in adults, kidney involvement in children with cancer extends beyond the time of initial diagnosis and treatment. Many interventions, such as chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, radiation, and nephrectomy, have long-term kidney effects, including the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with subsequent need for dialysis and/or kidney transplant. Thus, with the improved survival of children with malignancy comes the need for ongoing monitoring of kidney function and early mitigation of kidney-related comorbidities. In addition, children with kidney transplant are at higher risk of developing malignancies than their age-matched peers. Pediatric nephrologists thus need to be aware of issues related to cancer and its treatments as they impact their own patients. These facts emphasize the necessity of pediatric nephrologists and oncologists working closely together in managing these children and highlight the importance of bringing the onco-nephrology field to our growing list of pediatric nephrology subspecialties.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2022-Jun,"Nada A, Jetton JG",2,1494,nephrology,2025-11-22
36780887,Point of Care Ultrasound Training in Nephrology: Twitter Poll as a Modern Tool for Development of an Effective Curriculum.,"Point of care ultrasonography (POCUS) is being increasingly recognized as an adjunct to physical examination in the field of nephrology. However, paucity of trained faculty and standardized curricula remain key barriers to widespread adoption of this skill as well as development of reliable quality assessment programs at the institutional level. Herein, we sought to explore the utility of Twitter polls to gain insights into knowledge deficits of the learners for making curricular improvements while simultaneously disseminating POCUS pearls and pitfalls. A series of 57 single-question polls were tweeted over a 12-month period, each containing an ultrasound image or a video asking for correct interpretation. These were sent out from the Twitter handle of NephroPOCUS.com (@NephroP), an online POCUS education tool. The answer and a brief explanation were shared in a subsequent tweet at the end of the voting period. Information on the percentage of correct answers, Tweet impressions, and engagements was collected and analyzed by the pre-determined difficulty level (I-III) and the organ/learning objective being tested. The number of responses per poll was 228 ± 94.6 (mean ± SD), and the percentage of correct responses was 57.9 ± 17.5 (mean ± SD). 16 (of 57) polls received less than 50% correct responses, of which 8 belonged to level III difficulty. The learning objectives that received the least number of correct responses in the kidney, cardiac, lung, vascular, and other categories were identification of end-stage kidney (16.2% correct answers), right pleural effusion on the parasternal short axis view of the heart (29%), right pleural effusion from the subxiphoid window (39%), grading of systemic venous congestion (27.3%), and identification of ascites on the right lateral chest window (15%), respectively. The overall engagement rate was 6.96%, which was above the median for health and higher education-related tweets on Twitter. Targeted didactic material was developed based on these results, published on various open-access nephrology education platforms. Twitter polls aid in identifying the knowledge gaps among POCUS learners. Information obtained from the polls can be used to improve POCUS-related curricula and develop targeted educational material to facilitate remote learning.",Blood purification,2023-,"Vasudev K, Kazory A, Ronco C, Bhattacharya D, Koratala A",5,2318,nephrology,2025-11-22

We describe clinical characteristics, details of eculizumab use, and outcomes of patients with complement gene-variant mediated TMA (cTMA), secondary TMA (sTMA) and C3 glomerulopathy (C3G). As of December 2019, 23 patients received complement blockade at the Division of Nephrology and Dialysis: 15 patients were diagnosed with cTMA, 6 patients with sTMA and 2 patients with C3G. Causes of sTMA were bone marrow transplantation (n = 2), malignant hypertension, malignant tumor, systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome and lung transplantation (each n = 1). Across all indications, patients had a median age of 31 and were predominantly female (78%) and the median duration of treatment was 227 days. Hematological recovery was seen in most patients, while renal response was best in patients with cTMA. Adverse events were recorded in 26%.

38403394,Shared Decision-Making and Patient Communication in Nephrology Practice.,"Shared decision-making (SDM) is the standard of care for patient or surrogates and their clinicians to arrive at a medical decision. Evidence suggests that SDM increases patients' understanding of their illness and satisfaction with their decision-making process. Dialysis patients often report the perception that they were passive participants in the decision to start dialysis, suggesting further opportunities for enhancing the application of SDM in decision-making with patients with kidney disease. The hallmark feature of SDM is sensitive, culturally- and equity-informed communication and effective partnership between patient or surrogate and clinician. In the process, the patient's personal expertise in the realm of their values and priorities is elicited, and the clinician's medical expertise is shared. The integration of this shared expertise then leads to an informed treatment decision. Frameworks such as the Serious Illness Conversation Guide and REMAP are guides for the SDM process, and communication tools and mnemonics can help facilitate SDM conversations. This paper will address SDM in nephrology practice, reviewing underlying supportive evidence, context, and timing for employing SDM in the trajectory of chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury, special considerations in vulnerable populations to promote health equity, and communication tools and frameworks to facilitate the SDM process. By learning and applying these frameworks and tools, nephrology providers will be able to employ SDM in the management of kidney disease.",Advances in kidney disease and health,2024-Jan,"Mandel EI, Fox M, Schell JO, Cohen RA",4,1565,nephrology,2025-11-22
38300004,Child Health Needs and the Pediatric Nephrology Subspecialty Workforce: 2020-2040.,"Pediatric nephrology is dedicated to caring for children with kidney disease, a unique blend of acute care and chronic longitudinal patient relationships. Though historically a small field, trainee interest has declined over the past 2 decades. This has led to growing alarm about the health of the pediatric nephrology workforce, although concerns have been hampered by a lack of available data to enable feasible projections. This article is part of a supplement that anticipates the future pediatric subspecialty workforce supply. It draws on existing literature, data from the American Board of Pediatrics, and findings from a model that estimates the future supply of pediatric subspecialists developed by the Carolina Health Workforce Research Center at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill's Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research and Strategic Modeling Analytics & Planning Ltd. The workforce projections from 2020 to 2040 incorporate population growth, clinical effort, and geographic trends and model alternate scenarios adjusting for changes in trainee interest, clinical efforts, and workforce attrition. The baseline model predicts growth of clinical work equivalents by 26% by 2040, but further widening geographic disparities worsen the existing mismatch between supply, clinical need, and market demand. The worst-case scenario projects 13% growth by 2040 which, at best, maintains the status quo of an already strained workforce. The models do not account for many factors expected to heighten demand over the coming decades. Urgent reforms are necessary now.

The most common indication of renal biopsy was nephrotic syndrome (NS) (71 patients, 45.5%), followed by nephritic syndrome (63 patients, 40.3%). Renal biopsy was done in 15 patients (9.6%) who had hypertension (HTN) with renal impairment and normal size kidneys, in five diabetic patients (3.2%) when there was suspicion of nondiabetic kidney disease and in one patient (0.6%) with unexplained acute renal failure. The most common histological finding in NS was primary membranous nephropathy (MN), 23 (32.3%) followed by primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 17 (23.9%). Lupus nephritis (LN) contributed to 50.7% (32 patients) of total nephritic syndrome and Class IV LN was the most common (34.3%) pathological class. Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (10 patients, 66.6%) was the most common cause of HTN with renal impairment with normal size kidneys. Among five diabetic patients, one case each of kappa chain restricted cast nephropathy and primary MN was identified. A heterogeneous pattern of renal diseases identified in our study should provide an impetus to the nephrology community of Nepal to start a national renal biopsy registry.","Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",2021-,"Shrestha S, Karki T",2,1575,nephrology,2025-11-22
36399151,Importance and implications of exosomes in nephrology and urology.,"Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that are formed by two invaginations of the plasma membrane and can be released by all eukaryotic cells. Because of their bioactive contents, including nucleic acids and proteins, exosomes can activate a variety of functions in their recipient cells. Due to the plethora of physiological and pathophysiological functions, exosomes have received a lot of attention from researchers over the past few years. However, there is still no consensus regarding isolation and characterization protocols of exosomes and their subtypes. This heterogeneity poses a lot of methodical challenges but also offers new clinical opportunities simultaneously. So far, exosome-based research is still mostly limited to preclinical experiments and early-stage clinical trials since the translation of experimental findings remains difficult. Exosomes could potentially play an important role as future diagnostic and prognostic agents and might also be part of the development of new treatment strategies. Therefore, they have previously been investigated in a variety of nephrological and urological conditions such as acute kidney injury or prostate cancer.",Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,2023-Feb,"Mahl L, Ollig J, Schweihofer V, Wiegand L, Torkler P, Haerteis S, Aung T",7,1174,nephrology,2025-11-22

A cross-sectional and correlational study using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist guidelines. A total of 202 participants were collected from November 2019 to September 2020 from the outpatient department of nephrology of a regional teaching hospital in Taiwan using a convenience sampling method. The research tools included the World Health Organization-5 Well-Being Index, the Chronic Kidney Disease Self-Efficacy Instrument and the Medical Outcome Study Short Form-12. The mediating effect was statistically analysed by linear regression models and verified by Sobel testing. Mental health and self-efficacy were positively correlated with the overall quality of life. The results showed that the total explanatory variation of mental health and self-efficacy on the overall quality of life was 37.1%. Mental health was the most important explanatory factor, which could explain 27.1% of the variations in the overall quality of life alone. Moreover, self-efficacy was a partial mediator in the relationship between mental health and the quality of life among patients with hypertensive nephrology, with a total effect of 34.8%. The quality of life of this population can be improved by enhancing mental health, leading to an improvement in self-efficacy. Consequently, improved mental health and self-efficacy will improve the overall quality of life. Medical staff should be able to assess patients' mental health in providing referrals and assistance in a timely manner. If intervention programmes can be developed to improve patients' self-efficacy, their quality of life can also be improved.",Journal of advanced nursing,2022-Sep,"Lee MC, Chen YY, Tai CY, Wu SV",4,1858,nephrology,2025-11-22

This study specifically analyzed AI and ML research publications related to kidney care to identify leading authors, institutions, and countries in this area. It aimed to examine publication trends and patterns, and to explore the impact of collaborative efforts on citation metrics. The study used the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) of Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection to search for AI and machine learning publications related to nephrology from 1992 to 2021. The authors used quotation marks and Boolean operator ""or"" to search for keywords in the title, abstract, author keywords, and Keywords Plus. In addition, the 'front page' filter was applied. A total of 5425 documents were identified and analyzed. The results showed that articles represent 75% of the analyzed documents, with an average author to publications ratio of 7.4 and an average number of citations per publication in 2021 of 18. English articles had a higher citation rate than non-English articles. The USA dominated in all publication indicators, followed by China. Notably, the research also showed that collaborative efforts tend to result in higher citation rates. A significant portion of the publications were found in urology journals, emphasizing the broader scope of kidney care beyond traditional nephrology.

An online 41-item survey was developed and distributed via professional listservs to self-identified U.S. licensed pediatric nephrologists from January 22 to May 4, 2021. Pediatric nephrologists had a high referral rate to genetic counseling and agreed on the significant impact of genetic testing on diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, counseling, and kidney transplant planning. Challenges for the utilization of genetic testing among pediatric nephrologists include the need to (1) learn how to counsel patients on the risks and benefits of genetic testing, (2) choose appropriate testing, (3) interpret genetic results, and (4) return those results to patients and families. There exists an opportunity to expand genetic testing education for pediatric nephrologists to assist incorporation of genetic testing into clinical practice.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2025-Mar,"Fernandez HE, Lipton M, Balderes O, Lin F, Marasa M, Milo Rasouly H, Sabatello M",7,1011,nephrology,2025-11-22
38771519,How to improve ChatGPT performance for nephrologists: a technique guide.,"The integration of ChatGPT into nephrology presents opportunities for enhanced decision-making and patient care. However, refining its performance to meet the specific needs of nephrologists remains a challenge. This guide offers a strategic roadmap for advancing ChatGPT's effectiveness in nephrological applications. Utilizing the advanced capabilities of GPT-4, we customized user profiles to optimize the model's response quality for nephrological inquiries. We assessed the efficacy of chain-of-thought prompting versus standard prompting in delineating the diagnostic pathway for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus-associated hypernatremia and polyuria. Additionally, we explored the influence of integrating retrieval-augmented generation on the model's proficiency in detailing pharmacological interventions to decelerate the progression from chronic kidney disease (CKD) G3 to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), comparing it to responses without retrieval-augmented generation. In contrast to the standard prompting, the chain-of-thought method offers a step-by-step diagnostic process that mirrors the intricate thought processes needed for diagnosing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus-related hypernatremia and polyuria. This begins with an initial assessment, notably including a water deprivation test. After evaluating the outcomes of this test, the approach continues by identifying potential causes. Furthermore, if a patient's history suggests lithium usage, the chain-of-thought model adjusts by proposing a more customized course of action. In response to ""List medication treatment to help slow progression of CKD G3 to ESKD?"", GPT-4 only provides a general summary of medication options. Nevertheless, a specialized GPT-4 model equipped with a retrieval-augmented generation system delivers more precise responses, including renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. This aligns well with the 2024 KDIGO guidelines. GPT-4, when integrated with chain-of-thought prompting and retrieval-augmented generation techniques, demonstrates enhanced performance in the nephrology domain. This guide underscores the transformative potential of chain-of-thought and retrieval-augmented generation techniques in optimizing ChatGPT for nephrology, and highlights the ongoing need for innovative, tailored AI solutions in specialized medical fields.",Journal of nephrology,2024-Jun,"Miao J, Thongprayoon C, Craici IM, Cheungpasitporn W",4,2428,nephrology,2025-11-22
35623883,Evaluation of Conflicts of Interest among Participants of the Japanese Nephrology Clinical Practice Guideline.,"Rigorous and transparent management strategies for conflicts of interest and clinical practice guidelines with the best available evidence are necessary for the development of nephrology guidelines. However, there was no study assessing financial and nonfinancial conflicts of interest, quality of evidence underlying the Japanese guidelines for CKD, and conflict of interest policies for guideline development. This cross-sectional study examined financial and nonfinancial conflicts of interest among all 142 authors of CKD guidelines issued by the Japanese Society of Nephrology using a personal payment database from all 92 major Japanese pharmaceutical companies between 2016 and 2019 and self-citations by guideline authors. Also, the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations underlying the guidelines and conflicts of interest policies of Japanese, US, and European nephrology societies were evaluated. Among 142 authors, 125 authors (88%) received $6,742,889 in personal payments from 56 pharmaceutical companies between 2016 and 2019. Four-year combined median payment per author was $8258 (interquartile range, $2230‒$51,617). The amounts of payments and proportion of guideline authors with payments remained stable during and after guideline development. The chairperson, vice chairperson, and group leaders received higher personal payments than other guideline authors. Of 861 references in the guidelines, 69 (8%) references were self-cited by the guideline authors, and 76% of the recommendations were on the basis of low or very low quality of evidence. There were no fully rigorous and transparent conflicts of interest policies for nephrology guideline authors in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Most of the Japanese CKD guideline recommendations were on the basis of low quality of evidence by the guideline authors tied with pharmaceutical companies, suggesting the need for better financial conflicts of interest management.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2022-Jun,"Murayama A, Yamada K, Yoshida M, Kaneda Y, Saito H, Sawano T, Shrestha S, Shrestha R, Tanimoto T, Ozaki A",10,1963,nephrology,2025-11-22

However, studies to date have described experience from established genetic testing centers or from externally funded research programs. We established a <i>de novo</i> kidney genetics clinic within an academic adult general nephrology practice. Key features of this effort included a pipeline for internal referrals, flexible scheduling, close coordination between the nephrologist and a genetic counselor, and utilization of commercial panel-based testing. Over the first year, we examined the outcomes of genetic testing, the time to return of genetic testing, and out-of-pocket cost to patients. Thirty patients were referred and 23 were evaluated over the course of five clinic sessions. Nineteen patients underwent genetic testing with new diagnoses in nine patients (47%), inconclusive results in three patients (16%), and clearance for kidney donation in two patients (11%). On average, return of genetic results occurred 55 days (range 9-174 days) from the day of sample submission and the average out-of-pocket cost to patients was $155 (range $0-$1623). We established a kidney genetics clinic, without a pre-existing genetics infrastructure or dedicated research funding, that identified a new diagnosis in approximately 50% of patients tested. This study provides a clinical practice model for successfully incorporating genetic testing into ambulatory nephrology care with minimal capital investment and limited financial effect on patients.",Kidney360,2020-Oct,"Lundquist AL, Pelletier RC, Leonard CE, Williams WW, Armstrong KA, Rehm HL, Rhee EP",7,1593,nephrology,2025-11-22
34027630,Perspectives in systems nephrology.,"Chronic kidney diseases (CKD) are a major health problem affecting approximately 10% of the world's population and posing increasing challenges to the healthcare system. While CKD encompasses a broad spectrum of pathological processes and diverse etiologies, the classification of kidney disease is currently based on clinical findings or histopathological categorizations. This descriptive classification is agnostic towards the underlying disease mechanisms and has limited progress towards the ability to predict disease prognosis and treatment responses. To gain better insight into the complex and heterogeneous disease pathophysiology of CKD, a systems biology approach can be transformative. Rather than examining one factor or pathway at a time, as in the reductionist approach, with this strategy a broad spectrum of information is integrated, including comprehensive multi-omics data, clinical phenotypic information, and clinicopathological parameters. In recent years, rapid advances in mathematical, statistical, computational, and artificial intelligence methods enable the mapping of diverse big data sets. This holistic approach aims to identify the molecular basis of CKD subtypes as well as individual determinants of disease manifestation in a given patient. The emerging mechanism-based patient stratification and disease classification will lead to improved prognostic and predictive diagnostics and the discovery of novel molecular disease-specific therapies.",Cell and tissue research,2021-Aug,"Lindenmeyer MT, Alakwaa F, Rose M, Kretzler M",4,1481,nephrology,2025-11-22

Paediatric nephrology (PN) in these countries is not a priority for allocation of limited health resources. This article explores advancements made and persisting limitations in providing optimal PN services to children in such under-resourced areas (URA). Medline, PubMed and Google Scholar online databases were searched for articles pertaining to PN disease epidemiology, outcome, availability of services and infrastructure in URA. The ISN and IPNA offices were contacted for data, and two online questionnaire surveys of IPNA membership performed. Regional IPNA members were contacted for further detailed information. There is a scarcity of published data from URA; where available, prevalence of PN diseases, managements and outcomes are often reported to be different from high income regions. Deficiencies in human resources, fluoroscopy, nuclear imaging, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy and genetic studies were identified. Several drugs and maintenance kidney replacement therapy are inaccessible to the majority of patients. Despite these issues, regional efforts with support from international bodies have led to significant advances in PN services and infrastructure in many URA. Equitable distribution and affordability of PN services remain major challenges in URA. The drive towards acquisition of regional data, advocacy to local government and non-government agencies and partnership with international support bodies needs to be continued. The aim is to optimise and achieve global parity in PN training, investigations and treatments, initially focusing on preventable and reversible conditions.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2022-May,"Banerjee S, Kamath N, Antwi S, Bonilla-Felix M",4,1746,nephrology,2025-11-22

So far, in nephrology, this method has been applied to clinical outcomes like mortality and complications. However, patient-reported outcomes (PROs; eg, health-related quality of life [HRQOL]) are becoming increasingly important and should be incorporated into this quality assessment. Using funnel plots has several advantages, including clearly visualized precision, detection of volume-effects, discouragement of ranking hospitals and easy interpretation of results. However, without sufficient knowledge of underlying methods, it is easy to stumble into pitfalls, such as overinterpretation of standardized scores, incorrect direct comparisons of hospitals and assuming a hospital to be in-control (ie, to perform as expected) based on underpowered comparisons. Furthermore, application of funnel plots to PROs is accompanied by additional challenges related to the multidimensional nature of PROs and difficulties with measuring PROs. Before using funnel plots for PROs, high and consistent response rates, adequate case mix correction and high-quality PRO measures are required. In this article, we aim to provide insight into the use and interpretation of funnel plots by presenting an overview of the basic principles, pitfalls and considerations when applied to PROs, using examples from Dutch routine dialysis care.","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2021-Feb,"van der Willik EM, van Zwet EW, Hoekstra T, van Ittersum FJ, Hemmelder MH, Zoccali C, Jager KJ, Dekker FW, Meuleman Y",9,1449,nephrology,2025-11-22

The rate of signing advance directives in Taiwan is lower than in Western countries, and most of the barriers that have been identified relate to initiating advance care planning (ACP). This study was designed to explore the barriers to discussing ACP with patients with chronic kidney disease faced by nephrology nurses. A descriptive qualitative study design was adopted. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research was used to report the findings of this study. Data were collected using purposive sampling. A total of 34 nephrology nurses were recruited from hospitals in northern (2 groups, 10 participants), central (1 group, 4 participants), and southern (5 groups, 20 participants) Taiwan. A qualitative content analysis was conducted to analyze the transcripts of the eight focus groups. Five themes were identified, including (a) lacking the confidence to discuss ACP, (b) difficulty in finding an appropriate opportunity to initiate ACP discussion, (c) personally lacking the characteristics to discuss ACP, (d) conflicting perspectives between doctors and nurses over ACP, and (e) culture and belief-based barriers to discussing ACP. The findings obtained from the interviews revealed that nurses must enhance their ACP-related knowledge and communication skills and foster personal confidence in initiating ACP discussions. Furthermore, nurses must be empowered to work with other healthcare professionals. To implement the initial process of discussing ACP in clinical settings, clinical guidelines should be developed for healthcare professionals on initiating ACP.

It was first successfully employed in the 1960s for diseases like Waldenström's disease and myeloma. Since then, TPE techniques using apheresis membranes have been introduced. Apheresis therapies separate plasma components from blood using membrane screening or centrifugation methods. TPE aims to remove substances involved in the pathophysiology of diseases. It selectively removes high-molecular-weight molecules, substances with prolonged half-life, and those associated with disease pathogenesis. TPE can be performed using membranes or centrifugation, with replacement of extracted plasma volume using albumin or fresh frozen plasma. TPE requires specific competencies in nephrology and can be prescribed and monitored by nephrologists and performed by dialysis nursing staff. TPE can be combined with adsorption-based therapies to enhance its effect, and this approach is called plasma filtration adsorption. Another variation is double plasma filtration, which selectively removes substances based on molecular size. TPE can also be combined with lipoprotein removal strategies for managing familial hypercholesterolemia.

Moreover, because it is safe and relatively easy to perform, it can be performed in a repeated manner as often as necessary so that the physician can reassess the patient's hemodynamics and volume status and adjust their therapy accordingly, permitting a more personalized approach to patient care (rather than blindly following protocols), especially to patients in acute care nephrology. Despite these advantages, nephrologists have been slow to adopt this diagnostic modality, perhaps because of lack of expertise. This review will provide an overview of the most commonly used POCUS examinations performed by nephrologists in the acute care setting. Its aim is to spark interest in in POCUS and to lay the foundation for readers to pursue more advanced training so that POCUS becomes a readily available tool in your diagnostic arsenal.",Advances in chronic kidney disease,2021-Jan,"Karakala N, Córdoba D, Chandrashekar K, Lopez-Ruiz A, Juncos LA",5,1316,nephrology,2025-11-22
37675684,Disparities in ethnicity and metabolic disease burden in referrals to nephrology.,"The profile of patients referred from primary to tertiary nephrology care is unclear. Ethnic Malay patients have the highest incidence and prevalence of kidney failure in Singapore. We hypothesised that there is a Malay predominance among patients referred to nephrology due to a higher burden of metabolic disease in this ethnic group. This is a retrospective observational cohort study. From 2014 to 2018, a coordinator and physician triaged patients referred from primary care, and determined co-management and assignment to nephrology clinics. Key disease parameters were collated on triage and analysed. A total of 6,017 patients were studied. The mean age of patients was 64 ± 16 years. They comprised 57% men; 67% were Chinese and 22% were Malay. The proportion of Malay patients is higher than the proportion of Malays in the general population (13.4%) and they were more likely than other ethnicities to have ≥3 comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, coronary artery disease and stroke (70% vs. 57%, P < 0.001). Malay and Indian patients had poorer control of diabetes mellitus compared to other ethnicities (glycated haemoglobin 7.8% vs. 7.4%, P < 0.001). Higher proportion of Malay patients compared to other ethnicities had worse kidney function with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 on presentation (28% vs. 24%, P = 0.003). More ethnic Malay, Indian and younger patients missed appointments. A disproportionately large number of Malay patients are referred for kidney disease. These patients have higher metabolic disease burden, tend to miss appointments and are referred at lower eGFR. Reasons underpinning these associations should be identified to facilitate efforts for targeting this at-risk population, ensuring kidney health for all.",Singapore medical journal,2025-Jun,"Chua YT, Leo CH, Chua HR, Wong WK, Chan GC, Vathsala A, Gan YLM, Teo BW",8,1822,nephrology,2025-11-22
33713085,"Hypercalcemia in the nephrology department patients - incidence, etiology and impact on renal function.","Hypercalcemia (HCM) is predominantly caused by primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) or malignancy. It's incidence varies from 0.17% to 4.74%. Its numerous manifestations include renal symptoms. The aim of the study was to assess the incidence and etiology of hypercalcemia in patients hospitalized at the Department of Nephrology of the Warsaw Military Institute, as well as to evaluate its impact on renal function. In this cross-sectional study patients admitted to the Nephrology Department of the Warsaw Military Institute between January 2017 and December 2018 were retrospectively screened for presence of HCM, defined as total calcium level or corrected calcium level in case of hypoalbuminemia >10.2 mg/dl, measured at least twice. Each patient's medical history as well as other laboratory findings were subsequently analyzed in order to establish the etiology of hypercalcemia. Among 3062 hospitalisations (1993 patients) at The Department, 96 patients had elevated calcium level of which 36 were identified as hypercalcemic (1,81%). Median calcium level was 11.9 mg/dl (IQR: 11.25-13.46) with 22.24 mg/dl being the maximum observed value. Malignancy and drugs having hypercalcemizing effect were the most common etiologies identified, both being found in 9 cases (25%). Other causes of HCM included sarcoidosis, multiple myeloma (analyzed separately from other malignancies), PHPT and hypercalcemic hypocalciuria. In 7 cases HCM etiology could not be established, it therefore remained idiopathic. Acute kidney injury (AKI) developed in 20 patients (56%), in this group serum calcium levels were significantly higher than in non-AKI patients (median: 12.85 mg/dl (IQR:11.82-14.65) vs 11.25 mg/dl (IQR:10.75-11.93); p=0.0039). Additionally, chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients presented significantly lower calcium values than non-CKD patients (median: 11.47 mg/dl (IQR: 10.8-12.6) vs 13.01 mg/dl (IQR:11.9-16.08; p=0.0131). Hypercalcemia is a rare disorder among Nephrology Department patients, which primary etiology is malignancy and medications having hypercalcemizing effect.

This article examines the intersection of loneliness and burnout among nephrology nurses, and its impact on their well-being and job performance. Loneliness, defined as inadequate social connections, is identified as a significant contributor to burnout and suboptimal well-being among nurses. Findings emphasize the importance of addressing loneliness and promoting social connectedness within the nursing profession. Strategies, such as fostering supportive relationships, creating support groups, and implementing policies to reduce emotional burdens and workload pressures, are recommended. We emphasize the need to prioritize nurse well-being for a resilient health care workforce and improved patient outcomes, and discuss its implications for nursing practice, education, and policy.",Nephrology nursing journal : journal of the American Nephrology Nurses' Association,2023-,"Wood RE, Paulus AB",2,915,nephrology,2025-11-22

39059606,Utility of fractional excretion of magnesium in diagnosing renal magnesium wasting in pediatric nephrology practice.,"Fractional excretion of magnesium (FE<sub>Mg</sub>) is commonly used to diagnose of renal magnesium (Mg) wasting, but it can be affected by serum Mg (SMg) and serum creatinine concentration (SCr). We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of FE<sub>Mg</sub> to diagnose Mg wasting in subgroups with different SMg and eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) in pediatric nephrology practice. One hundred and nineteen patients (59 males and 60 females, median 15 years) seen in our pediatric clinic were investigated for FE<sub>Mg</sub>, SMg, eGFR, and urine Mg-to-creatinine ratio (Mg/Cr). Normal eGFR was defined as ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or for infants SCr < chronic kidney disease stage 2. Urine Mg/Cr was compared with age-specific reference values. Sixteen of all patients (13 %) had hypomagnesemia. All had FE<sub>Mg</sub> greater than the cut-off value of 2 %. Only 4 patients had elevated urine Mg/Cr. Of 65 patients with normal SMg and eGFR, 19 had FE<sub>Mg</sub> above the cut-off value of 4 %. Of these, 13 patients had elevated urine Mg/Cr i.e. Mg wasting (sensitivity and specificity of FE<sub>Mg</sub>, 93 % and 88 %, respectively). Among 38 patients with normal SMg and low eGFR, 30 had FE<sub>Mg</sub> > 4 %, but only 6 had elevated urine Mg/Cr (sensitivity 100 % and specificity 25 %). Overall, hypomagnesemic patients and normomagnesemic patients with elevated urine Mg/Cr were diagnosed with Mg wasting (36/119, 30 %). FE<sub>Mg</sub> has variable sensitivity and specificity depending on SMg and eGFR in the diagnosis of Mg wasting.

37479978,Use of frailty assessment instruments in nephrology populations: a scoping review.,"Frailty is a clinical syndrome of accelerated aging associated with adverse outcomes. Frailty is prevalent among patients with chronic kidney disease but is infrequently assessed in clinical settings, due to lack of consensus regarding frailty definitions and diagnostic tools. This study aimed to review the practice of frailty assessment in nephrology populations and evaluate the context and timing of frailty assessment. The search included published reports of frailty assessment in patients with chronic kidney disease, undergoing dialysis or in receipt of a kidney transplant, published between January 2000 and November 2021. Medline, CINAHL, Embase, PsychINFO, PubMed and Cochrane Library databases were examined. A total of 164 articles were included for review. We found that studies were most frequently set within developed nations. Overall, 161 studies were frailty assessments conducted as part of an observational study design, and 3 within an interventional study. Studies favoured assessment of participants with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and transplant candidates. A total of 40 different frailty metrics were used. The most frequently utilised tool was the Fried frailty phenotype. Frailty prevalence varied across populations and research settings from 2.8% among participants with CKD to 82% among patients undergoing haemodialysis. Studies of frailty in conservatively managed populations were infrequent (N = 4). We verified that frailty predicts higher rates of adverse patient outcomes. There is sufficient literature to justify future meta-analyses. There is increasing recognition of frailty in nephrology populations and the value of assessment in informing prognostication and decision-making during transitions in care. The Fried frailty phenotype is the most frequently utilised assessment, reflecting the feasibility of incorporating objective measures of frailty and vulnerability into nephrology clinical assessment. Further research examining frailty in low and middle income countries as well as first nations people is required. Future work should focus on interventional strategies exploring frailty rehabilitation.",BMC geriatrics,2023-Jul,"Kennard AL, Rainsford S, Glasgow NJ, Talaulikar GS",4,2157,nephrology,2025-11-22

38156781,Variation in performing kidney biopsy amongst nephrologists in the Asia-Pacific region: A multinational survey.,"Kidney biopsy (KB) is the gold standard procedure for diagnosing kidney diseases. Globally, nephrologists are trained to perform KB. However, the past few decades have witnessed a transition where interventional radiologists (IRs) are now preferentially performing the procedure. Our survey-based cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the current trends of KB operators in the Asia-Pacific region (APR) in practicing interventional nephrologists. The Association of Vascular Access and intervenTionAl Renal Physicians (AVATAR) Foundation from India conducted a multinational online survey among interventional nephrologists from the APR to investigate who does KB, if the nephrology training curriculum includes KB, and whether nephrologists have access to ultrasound. Out of 21 countries from the APR that participated in our survey, 10 countries (47.4%) reported that more than 70% of their nephrologists performed KB, whereas in 11 countries (57.6%), KB was most likely done by an IR. The frequency of nephrologists performing KB ranged from 0% in Afghanistan to 100% in countries such as Pakistan, Singapore, and Thailand. Formal training for KB and access to ultrasound was available to nephrologists in 80% of the responding countries. Our study shows that despite the availability of training and access to USG, a significant number of nephrologists are not performing KB in the APR. Similar to the trends observed in Western countries, the observed pattern in the APR could be due to lack of time, less incentive, hospital policy, or interest of nephrologists in other aspects of intervention nephrology.",Clinical nephrology,2024-Mar,"Jasuja S, Jha V, Gallieni M, Rana DS, Vachharajani T, Sagar G, Bahl A, Tawakley S, Gaur M",9,1617,nephrology,2025-11-22

The present study was conducted to analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on nephrology and transplant services and clinical training at our center. This observational study was conducted at the Institute of Kidney Disease and Research Centre (Ahmedabad, India). Our institute is one of the largest tertiary care centers of its kind in India with around 400 total inpatient beds for nephrology, urology, and transplant patients. In 2019, our center had annual outpatient and inpatient numbers of 132 181 and 7471, respectively, and conducted 412 renal transplant procedures. For this study, monthly data on number of outpatients, inpatients, and patients undergoing renal transplant, as well as various nonelective procedures, conducted in 2019 and 2020 were collected and analyzed. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various non-COVID-19-related health care facilities and on clinical training and research activities at our institute. During the 2020 COVID-19 period, the number of outpatients and inpatients was greatly reduced compared with data from 2019. A similar decrease was seen in patients undergoing hemodialysis, renal transplant, and nonelective procedures at our center. The COVID-19 period also greatly affected clinical training of residents enrolled at our institute and research activities, as a result of focus on COVID-19 as a priority. The effects of reduced numbers of outpatients and inpatients on workflow, as well as reduced numbers of renal transplants and nonelective procedures on the health of our patients, are unknown.

However, whether these disparities are present in nephrology randomized clinical trials has not been previously reported. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 380 randomized clinical trials involving different aspects of kidney disease published between 2000 and 2021. Our results indicate that worldwide reporting of race and ethnicity is poor and that White individuals account for most of the randomized participants with decreased enrollment of Black participants in more recent trials. However, trials conducted in the United States have representation of Black and Hispanic participants consistent with the population prevalence of disease and under-representation of Asian participants. Under-representation of racial and ethnic minorities in clinical trials could worsen disparities, but reporting and enrollment practices in nephrology randomized clinical trials have not been described. PubMed was searched to capture randomized clinical trials for five kidney disease-related conditions published between 2000 and 2021 in ten high-impact journals. We excluded trials with <50 participants and pilot trials. Outcomes of interest were the proportion of trials reporting race and ethnicity and the proportions of enrolled participants in each race and ethnicity category. Among 380 trials worldwide, race was reported in just over half and ethnicity in 12%. Most enrolled participants were White, and Black individuals accounted for ≤10% of participants except in dialysis trials where they accounted for 26% of participants. However, Black participants were enrolled at high proportions relative to disease and population prevalence in US CKD, dialysis, and transplant trials representing 19% of participants in AKI, 26% in CKD, 44% in GN, 40% in dialysis, and 26% in transplant trials. Enrollment of Asian participants was low worldwide except in GN trials with marked under-representation in US CKD, dialysis, and transplant trials. Hispanic individuals represented only 13% of participants in US dialysis trials compared with 29% of US dialysis population.

Despite the lack of evidence-based recommendations, antithrombotic prophylaxis (aP) is used to prevent RGT. An online survey supported by the European Society for Pediatric Nephrology was developed to investigate the current practice of aP in pediatric KTx recipients <18 years. A total of 80 pediatric KTx centers from 37 countries participated in the survey. Antithrombotic prophylaxis was performed in 96% of the pediatric renal transplant centers (all/selected patients: 54%/42%). The main overall used drugs were as follows: low-molecular-weight heparin (89%), unfractionated heparin (UFH) (69%), and acetylsalicylic acid (ASS) (55%). Ten different aP management strategies were identified as follows: 51% used a single drug and 48% combined two drugs sequentially. The corresponding centers started aP predominantly within 24 hours after pediatric KTx; 51% preferred UFH for starting aP. In centers switching to a second drug (51%), this change was performed after 10 ± 6 days; of these 57% preferred ASS for maintenance aP. Reported median aP duration was 51 days (range 1-360). Despite the use of aP in almost all responding pediatric KTx centers, there is no uniform management strategy. Notwithstanding, UFH seems to be the preferred drug for the early post-operative period of pediatric KTx, and ASS for maintenance prophylaxis following pediatric KTx. Prospective studies are needed to further evaluate the benefits and risks of aP, preferably resulting in guidelines for the management in pediatric KTx.",Pediatric transplantation,2020-Nov,"Buder K, Zirngibl M, Bapistella S, Nadalin S, Tönshoff B, Weitz M",6,1635,nephrology,2025-11-22
37783446,Mendelian randomization for nephrologists.,"Confounding is a major limitation of observational studies. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a powerful study design that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to enable examination of the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome in observational data. With the emergence of large-scale genome-wide association studies in nephrology over the past decade, MR has become a popular method to establish causal inferences. However, MR is a complex and challenging methodology that requires careful consideration to ensure robust results. This review article aims to summarize the basic concepts of MR, its application and relevance in nephrology, and the methodological challenges and limitations as well as discuss the current guidelines for design and reporting. With reference to a clinically relevant example of examining the causal relationship between the estimated glomerular filtration rate and cancer, this review outlines the key steps to conducting an MR study, including the key considerations and potential pitfalls at each step. These include defining the clinical question, selecting the data sources, identifying and refining appropriate genetic variants by considering linkage disequilibrium and associations with potential confounders, harmonization of variants across data sets, validation of the genetic instrument by assessing its strength, estimation of the causal effects, confirming the validity of the findings, and interpreting and reporting results.",Kidney international,2023-Dec,"Dobrijevic E, van Zwieten A, Kiryluk K, Grant AJ, Wong G, Teixeira-Pinto A",6,1482,nephrology,2025-11-22

We evaluate responses to Hurricane Katrina which caused unprecedented damage to health and property in the Gulf Coast. As a result of the multitude of identified problems with the national, local, and kidney-specific responses to Katrina, new systems were created that mitigated loss after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The improved disaster response system was no match for the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic; real-time changes worsened the effect on highly vulnerable populations, including patients with ESKD. Similarly, preparation can only mitigate the difficulties faced by patients with ESKD living in a war zone. Government agencies need to provide tools and dialysis centers need to educate patients. Beginning with steps implemented in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and augmented after Hurricane Sandy, every patient with ESKD and those who care for them must begin emergency preparations before the need arises.

33942997,Podocentric view of glomerular proteinuria: Focused on cytoskeletal changes and toward promising targeted therapies and challenges.,"Among renal cells, podocytes (glomerular epithelial cells) are the most critical to prevent plasma proteins from excessive loss by forming their sophisticated foot processes (FP) and slit diaphragms (SD). A general finding in the glomeruli of patients with nephrotic syndrome is the foot processes ""effacement"" resulted from dysregulated actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Ultrastructural analysis in patients with nephrotic syndrome has demonstrated that such changes tend to be dynamic and can sometimes be reversible. In a more molecular sense, injured podocytes can no longer maintain their tight regulation and ""retract"" their FP, but not ""efface"" them. Past studies have revealed multiple exquisite mechanisms and arrays of proteins participating in the regulation of cytoskeletal rearrangement, and these mechanisms serve as potential targets to treat. A major challenge to develop specific therapies is the targeted mechanism has to be crucial and specific enough for podocyte-oriented kidney diseases, and it would be even better to manifest in most of the glomerulonephritis. Studies have shown many approaches targeting different mechanisms, but none of them has been proved to be effective in clinical medicine. Up to the present, Abatacept (Orencia) is the first (and the only) clinical targeted therapy demonstrating limited success.

33909936,Kidney support therapy in the pediatric patient: Unique considerations for a unique population.,"The use of kidney support therapy (KST) for use in managing patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) has expanded greatly in the last several decades. The growing use of KST modalities in children, and now in neonates, has been associated with opportunities for education, clinical research, clinical practice improvements, and outcomes research. A multitude of controversies exist in the field of pediatric KST-many of which are shared by adult critical care nephrology practice. Simultaneously, pediatric KST has led the way to a burgeoning exploration of the importance of fluid overload as it relates to KST initiation and management and also with quality improvement. In this review, we will explore and describe the paradigms contained with pediatric KST used to support children with AKI. In addition to the governing principles related to the mechanics of KST, we will describe the novel aspects of newer support machines and ethical considerations of KST provision. Anticoagulation, dose, and modality will be discussed as well as priming procedures for special considerations. The utilization of KST across pediatric populations represents the next frontier of critical care nephrology.",Seminars in dialysis,2021-Nov,"Askenazi D, Basu RK",2,1195,nephrology,2025-11-22
38697934,Kidney Doppler ultrasonography in critical care nephrology.,"Color pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasound (CPWD-US) emerges as a pivotal tool in intensive care units (ICUs) for diagnosing acute kidney injury (AKI) swiftly and non-invasively. Its bedside accessibility allows for rapid assessments, making it a primary imaging modality for AKI characterization. Furthermore, CPWD-US serves as a guiding instrument for key diagnostic-interventional procedures such as renal needle biopsy and percutaneous nephrostomy, while also facilitating therapy response monitoring and AKI progression tracking. This review shifts focus towards the integration of renal ultrasound into ICU workflows, offering contemporary insights into its utilization through a diagnostic standard-oriented approach. By presenting a flow chart, this review aims to provide practical guidance on the appropriate use of point-of-care ultrasound in critical care scenarios, enhancing diagnostic precision, patient management and safety, albeit amidst a backdrop of limited evidence regarding long-term outcomes.","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2024-Aug,"Corradi F, Bell M, De Rosa S",3,1010,nephrology,2025-11-22

In the past decade, particularly the past 5 years, there has been a proliferation of online journal clubs on Twitter (Twitter Inc, San Francisco, CA). These Twitter-based journal clubs have used the conversational nature of the medium and the focus allowed by specifying a hashtag to bring critical appraisal to the wider community. Currently, there are 27 active Twitter-based journal clubs. NephJC is one such online, Twitter-based, nephrology-focused journal club. NephJC has been active since April 2014. We describe elements of NephJC and the participation over the past 135 sessions. Apart from critical appraisal, these journal clubs allow for archived and searchable postpublication peer-review, and are a crucial element of building an online community.

37697492,Practice of dialysis access interventional nephrology procedures in the Asia-Pacific region: Getting lay of the land.,"This cross-sectional survey aimed to determine the prevalence of Interventional Nephrology (IN) practice amongst nephrologists in the Asia-Pacific Region (APR), specifically related to dialysis access (DA). The Association of VA and intervenTionAl Renal physicians (AVATAR) Foundation from India conducted a multinational online survey amongst nephrologists from the Asia-Pacific to determine the practice of IN in the planning, creation, and management of dialysis access. The treatment modalities, manpower and equipment availability, monthly cost of treatment, specifics of dialysis access interventions, and challenges in the training and practice of IN by nephrologists were included in the survey. Twenty-one countries from the APR participated in the survey. Nephrologists from 18 (85.7%) countries reported performing at least one of the basic dialysis access-related IN procedures, primarily the placement of non-tunnelled central catheters (n-TCC; 71.5%). Only 10 countries (47.6%) reported having an average of <4% of nephrologists performing any of the advanced IN access procedures, the most common being the placement of a peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter (20%). Lack of formal training (57.14%), time (42.8%), incentive (38%), institutional support (38%), medico-legal protection (28.6%), and prohibitive cost (23.8%) were the main challenges to practice IN. The primary obstacles to implementing the IN training were a lack of funding and skilled personnel. The practice of dialysis access-related IN in APR is inadequate, mostly due to a lack of training, backup support, and economic constraints, whereas training in access-related IN is constrained by a lack of a skilled workforce and finances.","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2023-Dec,"Jasuja S, Gallieni M, Jha V, Vachharajani T, Bhalla AK, Tan J, Tan CS, Basnet NB, Herath N, Hai An HP, Kim YS, Kim Y, SampathKumar K, Sahay M, Ramachandran R, Alexander S, Bhargava V, Balasubramaniam J, Voss D, Ogbac FE, Gunawan A, Goh BL, Lin CC, Khan J, Shiham I, Ayub H, Hein MA, Iqbal S, Srisawat N, Gao B, Sajiv C, Wilkinson C, Pichthida T, Rana DS, Sagar G, Bahl A, Tawakley S, Gaur M",38,1715,nephrology,2025-11-22
39235198,A global assessment of kidney care workforce.,"An adequate workforce is needed to guarantee optimal kidney care. We used the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas (ISN-GKHA) to provide an assessment of the global kidney care workforce. We conducted a multinational cross-sectional survey to evaluate the global capacity of kidney care and assessed data on the number of adult and paediatric nephrologists, the number of trainees in nephrology and shortages of various cadres of the workforce for kidney care. Data are presented according to the ISN region and World Bank income categories. Overall, stakeholders from 167 countries responded to the survey. The median global prevalence of nephrologists was 11.75 per million population (pmp) (interquartile range [IQR] 1.78-24.76). Four regions had median nephrologist prevalences below the global median: Africa (1.12 pmp), South Asia (1.81 pmp), Oceania and Southeast Asia (3.18 pmp) and newly independent states and Russia (9.78 pmp). The overall prevalence of paediatric nephrologists was 0.69 pmp (IQR 0.03-1.78), while overall nephrology trainee prevalence was 1.15 pmp (IQR 0.18-3.81), with significant variations across both regions and World Bank income groups. More than half of the countries reported shortages of transplant surgeons (65%), nephrologists (64%), vascular access coordinators (59%), dialysis nurses (58%) and interventional radiologists (54%), with severe shortages reported in low- and lower-middle-income countries. There are significant limitations in the available kidney care workforce in large parts of the world. To ensure the delivery of optimal kidney care worldwide, it is essential to develop national and international strategies and training capacity to address workforce shortages.","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2024-Sep,"Okpechi IG, Tummalapalli SL, Chothia MY, Sozio SM, Tungsanga S, Caskey FJ, Riaz P, Ameh OI, Arruebo S, Damster S, Donner JA, Jha V, Levin A, Nangaku M, Saad S, Tonelli M, Ye F, Bello AK, Johnson DW",19,1748,nephrology,2025-11-22

However, his early experimental proof of glomerular proteinuria is hardly known, even among experts. The same applies to his political role in the Third Reich and his denazification in the post-war period. Against this background, this study deals with the life and career of Randerath. It focuses on (1) Randerath's political stance and professional progress between 1933 and 1945, (2) his life and his position in German pathology after 1945, and (3) the (inter)national reception of Randerath's work. The paper is based on mostly unevaluated sources of various archives and on the analysis of the relevant research literature. It demonstrates that Edmund Randerath willingly served the Nazi regime. In return, he succeeded in expanding his career in the Third Reich. However, after 1945 he moved up to even higher positions: He was successively appointed full professor (1947), dean (1950) and rector (1956) of Heidelberg University. Moreover, he played a decisive role in the reconstitution of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Pathologie (German Society for Pathology) (1948) and was later elected president (1960). But despite his pioneering achievements in (nephro)pathology, he found only limited access to the international scientific community.","Pathology, research and practice",2020-Apr,"Kaiser S, Gross D",2,1322,nephrology,2025-11-22

38497946,Genomics in nephrology: identifying informatics opportunities to improve diagnosis of genetic kidney disorders using a human-centered design approach.,"Genomic kidney conditions often have a long lag between onset of symptoms and diagnosis. To design a real time genetic diagnosis process that meets the needs of nephrologists, we need to understand the current state, barriers, and facilitators nephrologists and other clinicians who treat kidney conditions experience, and identify areas of opportunity for improvement and innovation. Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with nephrologists and internists from 7 health systems. Rapid analysis identified themes in the interviews. These were used to develop service blueprints and process maps depicting the current state of genetic diagnosis of kidney disease. Themes from the interviews included the importance of trustworthy resources, guidance on how to order tests, and clarity on what to do with results. Barriers included lack of knowledge, lack of access, and complexity surrounding the case and disease. Facilitators included good user experience, straightforward diagnoses, and support from colleagues. The current state of diagnosis of kidney diseases with genetic etiology is suboptimal, with information gaps, complexity of genetic testing processes, and heterogeneity of disease impeding efficiency and leading to poor outcomes. This study highlights opportunities for improvement and innovation to address these barriers and empower nephrologists and other clinicians who treat kidney conditions to access and use real time genetic information.",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2024-May,"Romagnoli KM, Salvati ZM, Johnson DK, Ramey HM, Chang AR, Williams MS",6,1469,nephrology,2025-11-22

He was born in Viterbo between 1504 and 1518 and died in Venice in 1566. Very little is known about Ruscelli's life, but based on his extensive literary output we can assume that he was endowed with remarkable intellectual abilities and a propensity for varied interests. At a young age, he developed a strong interest in classical studies and attended the court of Cardinal Marini Grimani in Utini. After completing his studies at the University of Padua, he participated in the founding of a humanist academy, the Accademia degli Sdegnati (the Scornful Academy). After his fruitful experience in Rome, he moved to the Neapolitan residence of Marquis Alfonso D'Avalos. Here, Ruscelli founded an ""Academy of Secrets"", composed of a group of humanists and nobles who had an extensive culture and had different experiences but similar interests. During these productive years, under the pseudonym Alexius Pedemontanus, he wrote one of his masterpieces, The Secreti, an important historical documentary manual of great value. In this book, the author proposes therapies for a wide variety of diseases, claiming in most cases that they have been experimentally and successfully tested in the presence of witnesses in at least 3 clinical cases. Ruscelli composed an extensive version of The Secreti, the Secreti Novi. In this book he reported more than a thousand recipes, the substances used were of a great variety and sometimes curious. According to Ruscelli, the recipes in this updated version of the book were ""easy for anyone to make, of little effort, and useful for all kinds of people.""

We aimed to construct a 6-month machine learning (ML) predictive model for the risk of rapidly progressive kidney disease and the need for nephrology referral in adult patients with T2DM and an initial estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. We extracted patients and medical features from the electronic medical records (EMR), and the cohort was divided into a training/validation and testing data set to develop and validate the models on the basis of three algorithms: logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). We also applied an ensemble approach using soft voting classifier to classify the referral group. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), precision, recall, and accuracy as the metrics to evaluate the performance. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values were used to evaluate the feature importance. The XGB model had higher accuracy and relatively higher precision in the referral group as compared with the LR and RF models, but LR and RF models had higher recall in the referral group. In general, the ensemble voting classifier had relatively higher accuracy, higher AUROC, and higher recall in the referral group as compared with the other three models. In addition, we found a more specific definition of the target improved the model performance in our study. In conclusion, we built a 6-month ML predictive model for the risk of rapidly progressive kidney disease.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors may cause volume, blood pressure, and electrolyte disturbances; consequently, frequent monitoring and adjustments to other diabetes, blood pressure, and/or diuretic medications may be necessary. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of an interprofessional clinic model partnering nephrologists and pharmacists for the initiation and monitoring of SGLT2 inhibitors. A clinical pharmacist was embedded within the nephrology clinic to provide patient education, telephone follow-up, and to work collaboratively with the nephrologists. Diabetes, hypertension, and diuretic regimens were adjusted as needed after empagliflozin initiation. Diabetes regimens were adjusted to adhere to the 2019 ADA guidelines that promote agents with CKD and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease benefit. Fourteen patients were initiated on empagliflozin during the study period. Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) improved (mean % change -12% ± 61%); the mean percentage change was greater in patients with a higher baseline UACR. The mean change in hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> was 0.3% ± 0.6%. Common adverse reactions were observed and improved over time; no serious adverse drug reactions occurred. Finally, empagliflozin initiation necessitated adjustments to diabetes, hypertension, and diuretic regimens in almost all patients (n = 13, 93%). The implementation of an innovative, interprofessional care model within a nephrology clinic for the initiation and monitoring of empagliflozin in patients with DKD demonstrated clinical benefit with minimal safety concerns.",Journal of pharmacy practice,2021-Jun,"Triantafylidis LK, Hawley CE, Fagbote C, Li J, Genovese N, Paik JM",6,1803,nephrology,2025-11-22
33593328,Impact of pre-dialysis nephrology care engagement and decision-making on provider and patient action toward permanent vascular access.,"While catheters are often thought the result of emergency hemodialysis (HD) initiation among patients with little or no pre-dialysis nephrology care, the role of patient level of engagement in care and modality decision-making have not been fully explored. This is a retrospective medical record review of adults (age 18-89 years) who received care in academically affiliated private practice, public hospital, or Veterans Administration settings prior to initiating HD with a catheter between 10/1/2011 and 9/30/2012. Primary predictors were level of patient engagement in nephrology care within 6 months of HD initiation and timing of modality decision-making. Primary outcomes were provider action (referral) and any patient action (evaluation by a vascular surgeon, vein mapping or vascular surgery) toward [arteriovenous fistula or graft, (AVF/AVG)] creation. Among 92 incident HD patients, 66% (n = 61) initiated HD via catheter, of whom 34% (n = 21) had ideal engagement in care but 42% (n = 25) had no documented decision. Providers referred 48% (n = 29) of patients for AVF/AVG, of whom 72% (n = 21) took any action. Ideal engagement in care predicted provider action (adjusted OR 13.7 [95% CI 1.08, 175.1], p = 0.04), but no level of engagement in care predicted patient action (p > 0.3). Compared to patients with no documented decision, those with documented decisions within 3, 3-12, or more than 12 months before initiating dialysis were more likely to have provider action toward AVF/AVG (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 9.0 [1.4,55.6], p = 0.2, 37.6 [3.3423.4] p = 0.003, and 4.8 [0.8, 30.6], p = 0.1, respectively); and patient action (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 18.7 [2.3, 149.0], p = 0.006, 20.4 [2.6, 160.0], p = 0.004, and 6.2 [0.9, 44.0], p = 0.07, respectively).

32434512,Implementation of a quality improvement strategy to increase outpatient kidney transplant referrals.,"Kidney transplantation remains the optimal therapy for patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD), though a small fraction of patients on dialysis are on organ waitlists. An important barrier to both preemptive kidney transplantation and successful waitlisting is timely referral to a kidney transplant center. We implemented a quality improvement strategy to improve outpatient kidney transplant referrals in a single center academic outpatient nephrology clinic. Over a 3 month period (July 1-September 30, 2016), we assessed the baseline kidney transplantation referral rate at our outpatient nephrology clinic for patients 18-75 years old with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 20 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> (2 values over 90 days apart). Charts were manually reviewed by two reviewers to look for kidney transplant referrals and documentation of discussions about kidney transplantation. We then performed a root cause analysis to explore potential barriers to kidney transplantation. Our intervention began on July 1, 2017 and included the implementation of a column in the electronic medical record (EMR) which displayed the patient's last eGFR as part of the clinic schedule. In addition, physicians were given a document listing their patients to be seen that day with an eGFR of < 20 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>. Annual education sessions were also held to discuss the importance of timely kidney transplant referral. At baseline, 54 unique patients with eGFR ≤20 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> were identified who were seen in the Clinic between July 1, 2016 and September 30, 2016. 29.6% (16) eligible patients were referred for kidney transplantation evaluation. 69.5% (37) of these patients were not referred for kidney transplant evaluation. 46.3% (25) did not have documentation regarding kidney transplant in the EMR. nephrologist's most recent note. Following the intervention, 66 unique patients met criteria for eligibility for kidney transplant evaluation. Kidney transplant referrals increased to 60.6% (p <  0.001). Our pilot implementation study of a strategy to improve outpatient kidney transplant referrals showed that a free, simple, scalable intervention can significantly improve kidney transplant referrals in the outpatient setting. This intervention targeted the nephrologist's role in the transplant referral, and facilitated the process of patient recognition and performing the referral itself without significantly interrupting the workflow. Next steps include further investigation to study the impact of early referral to kidney transplant centers on preemptive and living donor kidney transplantation as well as successful waitlisting.",BMC nephrology,2020-May,"Farouk SS, Atallah S, Campbell KN, Vassalotti JA, Uribarri J",5,2694,nephrology,2025-11-22

35864466,Practices and perspectives of patients and healthcare professionals on shared decision-making in nephrology.,"Given the complexity and variety in treatment options for advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), shared decision-making (SDM) can be a challenge. SDM is needed for making decisions that best suit patients' needs and their medical and living situations. SDM might be experienced differently by different stakeholders. This study aimed to explore clinical practice and perspectives on SDM in nephrology from three angles: observers, patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs). An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was used. First, in the quantitative part of the study, outpatient consultations with patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 20 ml/min) were video recorded and SDM was assessed using the OPTION<sup>5</sup> instrument. Subsequently, in the qualitative part, patients and HCPs reflected on their own SDM behaviour during individual stimulated recall interviews which were analysed using deductive thematic content analysis. Twenty nine consultations were recorded and observed in seven hospitals. The mean SDM score was 51 (range 25-80), indicating that SDM was applied to a moderate extent. The stimulated recall interviews with patients showed that they rely on the information provision and opinion of HCPs, expect consistency and support, and desire a proactive role. They also expect to be questioned by the HCP about their SDM preferences. HCPs said they were willing to incorporate patients' preferences in SDM, as long as there are no medical contraindications. They also prefer patients to take a prominent role in SDM. HCPs ascribe various roles to themselves in supporting patients' decision-making. Although SDM was applied by HCPs to a moderate extent, improvement is needed, especially in helping patients get the information they need and in making sure that every patient is involved in SDM. This is even more important given the complex nature of the disease and the relatively high prevalence of limited health literacy among patients with chronic kidney disease.",BMC nephrology,2022-Jul,"van Dulmen S, Roodbeen R, Schulze L, Prantl K, Rookmaaker M, van Jaarsveld B, Noordman J, Abrahams A",8,2018,nephrology,2025-11-22
37534846,Global perspective of kidney diseases: Challenges and changes.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health issue worldwide. Although strategies for prevention, early detection and treatment to reduce the progression of CKD should remain continuous endeavours, public funding for kidney replacement therapy is urgently needed in low-income countries (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). A multisectoral approach is needed to tackle the global burden of kidney disease. Getting a new drug, from first testing to final approval by a regulatory agency and ultimately to market, is a long, costly and risky process. While clinical trials and research have delivered new therapies and devices to patients with kidney disease during the last decade, there remains a significant residual risk for patients with CKD. Therefore, developing new drugs for better treatment and patient care is essential. For this purpose, the ISN held a consensus meeting entitled 'TRANSFORM; TRAnslational Nephrology Science FOR new Medications', which connected experts in the global kidney community and provided guidance on optimal management of translational animal studies for the development of new drugs to treat kidney diseases.","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2023-Aug,Nangaku M,1,1168,nephrology,2025-11-22

38547852,Introducing Exome Sequencing as Part of the Diagnostic Algorithm for Pediatric Nephrology Patients in Bulgaria: A Single-Center Experience.,"In pediatric kidney patients, where clinical presentation is often not fully developed, and renal biopsy is too risky or inconclusive, it may be difficult to establish the underlying pathology. In cases such as these, genetic diagnosis may be used to guide treatment, prognosis, and counseling. Given the large number of genes involved in kidney disease, introducing next-generation sequencing with extended gene panels as part of the diagnostic algorithm presents a viable solution. A cohort of 87 consecutive independent cases (83 children and 4 terminated pregnancies) with renal disease was recruited. Exome sequencing with MiSeq or NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) platforms and analysis of extended gene panels were used for genetic testing. Depending on the presenting pathology, the cases were grouped as patients with glomerular disease, ciliopathies, congenital anomalies, renal electrolyte imbalances, and chronic/acute kidney disease. The overall diagnostic yield was approximately 42% (37 out of 87), with most disease-causing mutations found in COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5, and PKHD1 genes. A change or clarification of preliminary diagnosis or adjustment of initial treatment plan based on the results of the genetic testing was made for approximately one-third of the children with meaningful genetic findings (11 out of 37). Our results prove the value of targeted exome sequencing as a non-invasive, versatile, and reliable diagnostic tool for pediatric renal disease patients. Providing genetic diagnosis will help for a better understanding of disease etiology and will give the basis for optimal clinical management and insightful genetic counseling.",Nephron,2024-,"Beltcheva O, Kamenarova K, Zlatanova G, Mihova K, Roussinov D, Kachakova D, Georgiev M, Nikolova E, Gaydarova M, Mitev V, Kaneva R",11,1657,nephrology,2025-11-22
33021008,"Defining the roles and responsibilities of the kidney transplant medical director: A necessary step for future training, mentoring, and professional development.","The management of a kidney transplant program has evolved significantly in the last decades to become a highly specialized, multidisciplinary standard of care for end-stage kidney disease. Transplant center job descriptions have similarly morphed with increasing responsibilities to address a more complex patient mix, increasing medical and surgical therapeutic options, and increasing regulatory burden in the face of an ever-increasing organ shortage. Within this evolution, the role of the Kidney Transplant Medical Director (KTMD) has expanded beyond the basic requirements described in the United Network for Organ Sharing bylaws. Without a clear job description, transplant nephrology trainees may be inadequately trained and practicing transplant nephrologists may face opaque expectations for the roles and responsibilities of Medical Director. To address this gap and clarify the key areas in which the KTMD interfaces with the kidney transplant program, American Society of Transplantation (AST) formed a Task Force of 14 AST KTMDs to review and define the role of the KTMD in key aspects of administrative, regulatory, budgetary, and educational oversight of a kidney transplant program.",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,2021-Apr,"C Wiseman A, Akalin E, M Dadhania D, DeMattos A, Doshi M, Friedewald J, Klein C, Leca N, Nicoll K, Pesavento T, Preczewski L, Samaniego M, Singh N, Bloom R",14,1199,nephrology,2025-11-22

39242286,Patient-Reported Experience Measures to Evaluate and Improve the Quality of Care in Nephrology.,"Patient experience is considered a pillar of high-quality care, integral to patient-centered care, but despite significant policy focus on patient-reported experience measures (PREMs), little is published regarding their development, use, or impact on clinical practice. In nephrology, PREMs are increasingly used in research to capture and quantify patients' perceptions of their experiences with health care services. It has been shown that a negative patient experience impacts patients' physical and psychological health, and a small but significant proportion of patients across a selection of settings report their experiences of health care as poor or suboptimal. Evidence of whether PREMs improve quality of care or support person-centered care in the clinical setting remains largely theoretical. Extensive effort has been invested to develop various PREMs for kidney services. Although little evidence linking PREM collection to meaningful change in delivery of care currently exists, work is underway. Early indications are that with the right facilitators, implementing PREMs in routine practice can help providers recognize where change is needed and galvanize transformation. The journey toward understanding the connection between PREM data and modifiable provider characteristics to target and enable change has started, but further evidence is needed. This article outlines the history of PREMs in nephrology and details their current use alongside implementation challenges. The use and benefits of PREMs are discussed before considering the evidence base for their impact on renal health care. Possible next steps for PREMs are suggested and best practices highlighted.",Seminars in nephrology,2024-,"Wild HM, Busby A, Mackintosh L, Wellsted D",4,1688,nephrology,2025-11-22

A survey carried out among the members of the Brazilian Society of Nephrology, through institutional e-mail, using the SurveyMonkey platform. We included 12 self-administered questions, which answers were given anonymously. It was evident that the majority (64%) of the participants did not have the opportunity to practice US during their nephrological training in their residency, specialization, or even in internships; those with experience with US use the method mainly for implanting central vascular accesses (68%), performing a renal biopsy (58%) and evaluating renal morphology (50%); and the main barriers for nephrologists who do not yet use US are the high price of US machines (26%) and the lack of time to learn about US (23%). Also, POCUS use for examinations of other organs, such as the lung (31%) and heart (18%), which are fundamental in the cardiovascular and volume assessment of patients with kidney diseases, is even more limited. However, 95% of the participants expressed an interest in learning POCUS for use in their medical practice.

34010487,A working partnership: A review of shared decision-making in nephrology.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease are required to make difficult decisions, negotiating between the risks, burdens and benefits for any proposed course. This process can be extremely challenging, since these decisions involve inherent risks, which can impact on survival and quality of life. Shared decision-making offers a patient-centred approach in partnering with patients to make decisions about their treatment, which reflect their values and preferences. Shared decision-making can improve patient preparedness, motivation, satisfaction, and adherence to the treatment or decision agreed upon. In this review article, we outline the key principles of shared decision-making, and provide a framework with communication strategies to facilitate shared decision-making. We highlight the broad range and context of decisions faced by patients in several areas of nephrology care and discuss patient-important outcomes, priorities and motivations that underpin their decision-making. Preserving patient autonomy through shared decision-making ensures close consideration of patient preferences to enhance satisfaction with the decision reached and optimize outcomes important to patients.","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2021-Nov,"Amir N, McCarthy HJ, Tong A",3,1193,nephrology,2025-11-22
39547777,Remote patient monitoring and management in nephrology: A systematic review.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem, with adverse outcomes of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and premature death. According to European Kidney Health Alliance (EKHA) currently, 1 in 10 Europeans has chronic kidney disease (CKD) and it is predicted to be the fifth leading cause of death worldwide by 2040. The COVID-19, pandemic has further worsened the situation, with CKD being the number one risk factor for CKD mortality, ahead of lung and heart disease. In addition to rising mortality figures, treatments for kidney disease have not improved substantially over the past 50 years, leaving too many kidney patients with a poor quality of life and reduced life expectancy. This situation is associated with staggering aggregate annual costs amounting to €140 billion per year in Europe, more than the annual healthcare costs of cancer or diabetes. Many studies confirm that Information and Communication Technology intervention (ICT) in nephrology can be way to tackles this issue. The increased daily use of information and communication technologies (ICT) may lead to the need for healthcare professionals to monitoring patient remotely. Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) have the potential to improve care for patients with kidney disease. RPM may provide a means to overcome some of the aforementioned barriers. RPM is a framework for monitoring patients at home by digital, wireless technology and extends the interactive contact of conventional clinical settings to include the patient's home. The hope is that these technologies would improve clinical outcomes through earlier recognition and correction of problems. Although few studies on telehealth in the dialysis population exist, studies do support its technical feasibility, which patient acceptance of this technology is very high, and that RPM may be able to improve outcomes in other co-morbid states shared by the ESKD population. According to Pan American Health Organization, CKD, also called kidney failure, describes the gradual loss of kidney function and is a worldwide public health problem, with adverse outcomes of kidney failure, CVD, and premature death. This study collects the papers concerning RPM and renal patient management using ICT intervention to analyze the results from considering the bioengineer's point of view. Our focus was on technology contribution. The aim of this study was to review and synthesize the available literature on the role of RPM in healthcare in nephrology. This systematic review was conducted to examine the content and results of publications on using RPM to improve the health care of patients with kidney disease, available to health care professionals (HCPs) and/or patients. The literature and our results confirm that in this field, RPM can allow cost reduction, improve the efficiency of healthcare resources, reduce human error, and overall improve the quality of life of kidney patients.",Nefrologia,2024-,"Mata-Lima A, Paquete AR, Serrano-Olmedo JJ",3,2954,nephrology,2025-11-22
32507291,Telenephrology: An Emerging Platform for Delivering Renal Health Care.,"Electronic-based health care delivery systems are gaining popularity among patients and clinicians because of convenience. Importantly, telemedicine, the delivery of health care and/or health information using electronic systems, can deliver primary and specialized health care to geographically isolated patients, who account for nearly 20% of the US population. In nephrology, where a growing discrepancy exists between the geographic location of nephrologists and patients with kidney disease, telenephrology can bridge distance and deliver renal care and education to the isolated. Large nationalized health care systems, for which incentives are aligned to innovate and implement new platforms to deliver cost-effective care, have been at the forefront of telenephrology. These systems include synchronous direct physician-patient care through clinical videoconferencing, and asynchronous modalities such as electronic consultation and video telehealth to educate internists about specialized clinical topics. Large health care organizations are adopting these platforms as standalone services; however, expansion into the private health care system has been limited by reimbursement, regulations, and other issues. Though telenephrology is patient centered, studies are needed to rigorously test its clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, growing patient demand for patient-centric health care will continue to expand the telenephrology space.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2020-Sep,"Koraishy FM, Rohatgi R",2,1465,nephrology,2025-11-22
35609528,Improvement in Kidney Function after Discontinuation of Fenofibrate in Outpatient Nephrology Consultation for Chronic Kidney Disease.,"It has been noted in observational and interventional studies that individuals exposed to fenofibrate can exhibit a rise in serum creatinine (sCr) concentration. However, it is not known to what extent this phenomenon impacts kidney function in patients who are referred to a nephrology clinic for consultation for chronic kidney disease (CKD). We conducted a prospective observational study of patients referred to our nephrology clinic for a new evaluation of a rise in sCr or worsening CKD and who were on fenofibrate therapy. We examined the effect of discontinuation of fenofibrate on kidney function, change in sCr, and estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) at 3, 6, and 12 months. A total of 22 patients (59% women, 86% White, 59% with type 2 diabetes, and 18% with peripheral arterial disease) were captured over 2.5 years. Median sCr at the time of fenofibrate discontinuation was 1.9 (1.1-3.3) mg/dL and eGFR, 32 (17-57) mL/min; proteinuria was absent in 17 (77%). Upon discontinuation of fenofibrate, median sCr decreased to 1.5 (0.9-2.4), 1.4 (1.0-2.5), and 1.4 (1.0-2.3) mg/dL at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively (p < 0.05); whereas median eGFR increased to 44 (27-71), 45 (23-71), and 42 (21-71) mL/min, respectively (p < 0.05). A ≥30% rise in eGFR was observed in 59% of the patients at 3 months, and it persisted in 45% and 50% of patients at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Discontinuation of fenofibrate in patients referred for CKD evaluation can result in sustained reduction in sCr in about half of the patients and for up to 1 year. There is a need to raise awareness among primary practitioners about this phenomenon. Recognition of fenofibrate as a cause of rise in sCr could reduce unnecessary nephrology consultation and resource utilization.",Kidney & blood pressure research,2022-,"Hernandez-Arroyo CF, Kanduri SR, Justiniano R, Martinez-Pitre PJ, Velez JCQ",5,1769,nephrology,2025-11-22

In this study we aimed to describe the prevalence, severity, risk factors, and treatment of anemia in different nephrology centers, among chronic kidney disease patients who were not given renal replacement therapy. We performed a multicenter cross-sectional study in three different nephrology clinics. Adult (>18 years of age) chronic kidney disease patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60 ml/min, and who were not started dialysis were recruited. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data regarding anemia and its management were collected using a standard data form. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level below 12g/dL and severe anemia as a hemoglobin level below 10g/dl. A total of 1066 patients were enrolled in the study. Anemia and severe anemia were present in 55.9% and 14.9% of the patients, respectively. The mean hemoglobin level for the whole cohort was 11.8±1.8 g/dL. Univariate analyses revealed that the mean hemoglobin level was significantly different among the centers. Moreover, the frequency of the presence of anemia stratified by severity was also significantly different among the centers. According to binary logistic regression analysis, gender, levels of eGFR and iron, ferritin ≥ 100 ng/mL, and the nephrology center were independent determinants of severe anemia. We found a high prevalence of anemia among chronic kidney disease patients who were not on renal replacement therapy.

The current standard-of-care treatment for renal anaemia in CKD patients involves ensuring adequate iron stores and administration of erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA). Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is a key transcription factor primarily involved in the cellular regulation and efficiency of oxygen delivery. Manipulation of the HIF pathway by the use of HIF-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHI) has emerged as a novel approach for renal anaemia management. Despite it being approved for clinical use in various Asia-Pacific countries, its novelty mandates the need for nephrologists and clinicians generally in the region to well understand potential benefits and harms when prescribing this class of drug. The Asian Pacific society of nephrology HIF-PHI Recommendation Committee, formed by a panel of 11 nephrologists from the Asia-Pacific region who have clinical experience or have been investigators in HIF-PHI studies, reviewed and deliberated on the clinical and preclinical data concerning HIF-PHI.

Estimates of the necessary sample size to achieve a given treatment effect size can be performed pre-trial based on available literature.Sample size calculations take into account the chosen effect size i.e. the minimal effect of the treatment which would be considered clinically relevant. Smaller effect sizes require a sufficiently large sample size or higher event rate to detect differences between groups. Larger effect sizes are sometimes chosen for study in order to justify the risks of adverse events and expense of certain treatments.Lower than expected event rates, mediated by censoring and competing risks, period effects, and inclusion of patients at lower risk of the outcome, can impact the power of the study.Time-to-event study designs adjust for censoring and competing risks.If a lower than expected event rate is highlighted during an interim analysis, strategies include increasing the sample size, either by changing the inclusion or exclusion criteria, increasing the number of study centers or increasing the study duration.",Kidney360,2022-Aug,"Sandys V, Sexton DJ",2,1116,nephrology,2025-11-22

35417752,Clinicians' Perceptions of Collaborative Palliative Care Delivery in Chronic Kidney Disease.,"Guidelines recommend palliative care for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), who experience a high pain and symptom burden, and receive intensive treatments that often do not align with their values. A lack of scalable specialty palliative care services has prompted calls for attention to primary palliative care, delivered in primary care and nephrology settings. The objectives of this study were to 1) describe expectations for care to meet the palliative care needs of people living with CKD, and limitations to meeting those expectations in the current model, and 2) identify potential interventions to meet patients' palliative care needs. We conducted semi-structured interviews with clinicians from primary care, nephrology, and palliative care to assess 1) reasonable expectations for meeting palliative needs, 2) barriers to integrating primary palliative care, and 3) potential intervention points. Clinicians discussed their expectations for high-quality communication (e.g., discussing disease understanding, assessing goals of care) and better integration of palliative care services. Clinicians expressed barriers to delivering that care, including poor inter-clinician communication. To address barriers, clinicians outlined potential intervention points, such as building collaborative models of care, and structural triggers to identify patients who may be appropriate for palliative care. Interventions to address gaps in palliative care delivery for people living with CKD should incorporate systematic identification of patients with palliative care needs and structural mechanisms to meeting those needs via specialty and primary palliative care.",Journal of pain and symptom management,2022-Aug,"Ernecoff NC, Bell LF, Arnold RM, Shea CM, Switzer GE, Jhamb M, Schell JO, Kavalieratos D",8,1677,nephrology,2025-11-22

Health-related quality of life, a patient-reported outcome, can provide data that inform economic evaluations of treatments for patients with CKD. PROMs help determine the value of different therapies by assessing their impact on patients' daily lives beyond clinical outcomes and can help policymakers make decisions about funding and reimbursement that consider the priorities and preferences of patients. Economic evaluations often employ cost-utility analyses, which use quality-adjusted life years as a key metric. Quality-adjusted life years combine both the quality and quantity of life lived, allowing for comparison of the effectiveness of different interventions in a standardized manner. By integrating utilities derived from PROMs, these analyses quantify the benefits of CKD treatments in terms of how patients feel and function. Furthermore, PROMs contribute to quality improvement initiatives by identifying areas where patient care can be enhanced, guiding the implementation of programs that improve health-related quality of life while maintaining cost-effectiveness. In value-based financing environments, the integration of PROMs ensures that patient-centered outcomes are prioritized, leading to more effective and equitable health care delivery. In this article, we discuss the role of PROMs in economic evaluations in CKD and provide an overview of approaches for using PROMs in economic evaluations to inform decision-making in nephrology.",Seminars in nephrology,2024-,"Guha C, O'Reilly C, Silva JR, Howell M",4,1927,nephrology,2025-11-22
39269600,Physical activity and exercise in chronic kidney disease: consensus statements from the Physical Exercise Working Group of the Italian Society of Nephrology.,"The Italian Society of Nephrology has tasked its Working Group on Physical Exercise with developing a consensus statement document on physical activity and exercise in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This paper consists of 16 points that were discussed, and approved using the mini-Delphi method by 15 members of the working group. Each statement is based on a comprehensive review of the literature, clinical experience, and expert opinions. Overall, the statements affirm that regular physical activity and exercise training offer numerous benefits to CKD patients, including improved physical function, enhanced cardiometabolic and neuromuscular function, cognitive benefits, and an overall improvement in quality of life. Furthermore, exercise may provide nephroprotection and reduce mortality. These advantages are observed across all CKD stages, whether on conservative therapy or kidney replacement therapy (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis), and in kidney transplant recipients. Moreover, when physical activity and exercise training are implemented with appropriate precautions, they are safe in CKD patients. Gradual physical activity and customized exercise programs should be tailored to the patient's exercise tolerance, potentially enhancing compliance. Clinicians are encouraged to use a series of questionnaires and tests to assess the patient's level of physical activity and performance. However, exercise and physical activity are poorly implemented in clinical practice due to many barriers related to patients and healthcare staff. Overcoming these barriers requires the proactive role of the nephrologists, who should actively incorporate exercise training and promote physical activity within routine care plans. Adopting a multidisciplinary team approach, which includes nephrologists, nurses, exercise professionals, and dietitians, is crucial for providing comprehensive rehabilitation for CKD patients. Integrating new technologies and remote check ups could further enhance the effectiveness of these interventions.",Journal of nephrology,2024-Sep,"Battaglia Y, Baciga F, Bulighin F, Amicone M, Mosconi G, Storari A, Brugnano R, Pozzato M, Motta D, D'alessandro C, Torino C, Mallamaci F, Cupisti A, Aucella F, Capitanini A",15,2058,nephrology,2025-11-22

36705099,Acute Kidney Injury among Patients Visiting the Nephrology Unit in a Tertiary Care Centre: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study.,"Acute kidney injury is an abrupt decline in renal function often associated with a decrease in urine output. It is the leading cause of in-hospital mortality worldwide with prolonged hospital stays, the requirement of mechanical ventilation and short-term dialysis. The aim of the study was to find out the prevalence of acute kidney injury among patients visiting the Nephrology unit in a tertiary care centre. This descriptive cross-sectional study was done among patients presented to the Nephrology Unit of the Department of Internal Medicine in a tertiary centre from 9 February 2022 to 21 October 2022. Ethical approval was taken from Institutional Review Committee (Reference number: UCMS/IRC/047/22). Data was collected from hospital records and the outcome was recorded in terms of in-hospital mortality and the requirement for renal replacement therapy. Convenience sampling was done. Point estimate and 95% Confidence Interval were calculated. Among 1848 patients, 113 (6.12%) (5.03-7.21, 95% Confidence Interval) had acute kidney injury. About 38 (32.75%) required inotropes whereas 10 (8.85%) required mechanical ventilation. In-hospital all-cause mortality was seen in 14 (12.39%) of the study population and 20 (17.70%) of the study population required renal replacement therapy. The most common cause of acute kidney injury was infection pneumonia followed by acute gastrointestinal infections were the most common infective aetiology. The prevalence of acute kidney injury was found to be lower than the studies done in similar settings. It is common in patients admitted with infection.

36254018,"Research features between Urology and Nephrology authors in articles regarding UTI related to CKD, HD, PD, and renal transplantation.","A urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common types of infections affecting the urinary tract. When bacteria enter the bladder or kidney and multiply in the urine, a URI can occur. The urethra is shorter in women than in men, which makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder or kidneys and cause infection. A comparison of the research differences between Urology and Nephrology (UN) authors regarding UTI pertaining to the 4 areas (i.e., Chronic Kidney Disease, Hemodialysis, Peritoneal Dialysis, and Renal Transplantation [CHPR]) is thus necessary. We propose and verify 2 hypotheses: CHPR-related articles on UTI have equal journal impact factors (JIFs) in research achievements (RAs) and UN authors have similar research features (RFs). Based on keywords associated with UTI and CHPR in titles, subject areas, and abstracts since 2013, we obtained 1284 abstracts and their associated metadata (e.g., citations, authors, research institutes, departments, countries of origin) from the Web of Science core collection. There were 1030 corresponding and first (co-first) authors with hT-JIF-indices (i.e., JIF was computed using hT-index rather than citations as usual). The following 5 visualizations were used to present the author's RA: radar, Sankey, time-to-event, impact beam plot, and choropleth map. The forest plot was used to distinguish RFs by observing the proportional counts of keyword plus in Web of Science core collection between UN authors. It was observed that CHPR-related articles had unequal JIFs (χ2 = 13.08, P = .004, df = 3, n = 1030) and UN departments had different RFs (Q = 53.24, df = 29, P = .004). In terms of countries, institutes, departments, and authors, the United States (hT-JIF = 38.30), Mayo Clinic (12.9), Nephrology (19.14), and Diana Karpman (10.34) from Sweden had the highest hT-JIF index. With the aid of visualizations, the hT-JIF-index and keyword plus were demonstrated to assess RAs and distinguish RFs between UN authors. A replication of this study under other topics and in other disciplines is recommended in the future, rather than limiting it to UN authors only, as we did in this study.",Medicine,2022-Oct,"Tan KK, Chien TW, Kan WC, Wang CY, Chou W, Wang HY",6,2161,nephrology,2025-11-22
35669971,Patient-Reported Outcomes as Endpoints in Clinical Trials of Kidney Transplantation Interventions.,"Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) that assess individuals' perceptions of life participation, medication adherence, disease symptoms, and therapy side effects are extremely relevant in the context of kidney transplantation. All PROs are potentially suitable as primary or secondary endpoints in interventional trials that aim to improve outcomes for transplant recipients. Using PRO measures (PROMs) in clinical trials facilitates assessment of the patient's perspective of their health, but few measures have been developed and evaluated in kidney transplant recipients; robust methodologies, which use validated instruments and established frameworks for reporting, are essential. Establishing a core PROM for life participation in kidney transplant recipients is a critically important need, which is being developed and validated by the Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology (SONG)-Tx Initiative. Measures involving electronic medication packaging and smart technologies are gaining traction for monitoring adherence, and could provide more robust information than questionnaires, interviews, and scales. This article summarizes information on PROs and PROMs that was included in a Broad Scientific Advice request on clinical trial design and endpoints in kidney transplantation.

34740465,Immune-Related Gene Polymorphisms and Pharmacogenetic Studies in Nephrology.,"A large subgroup of patients with chronic kidney disease still encounter serious adverse effects and lack of responsiveness to medications, possibly because of the interindividual genetic variability in genes involved in the metabolism and transport of the treatments used. As a consequence, several pharmacogenetic studies have been conducted in nephrology patients that examine the effect of genetic variants in response to treatment in kidney diseases. The present commentary focuses on immune-related genes (TNF [tumor necrosis factor], MIF [macrophage migration inhibitory factor], and IL-10 [interleukin 10]) or those genes that may regulate the response to immunosuppressive medications (ABCB1 [ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1] and ITPA [inosine triphosphatase]) used in kidney diseases. These genes were selected from those showing significant results in a recent meta-analysis of pharmacogenetic studies of patients with chronic kidney disease. This commentary highlights that certain polymorphisms should be investigated in patients with kidney diseases, especially if they are to be administered immunosuppressive agents.

32940241,Nephrologist Follow-Up Care of Patients With Acute Kidney Disease Improves Outcomes: Taiwan Experience.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) and acute kidney disease (AKD) are a continuum on a disease spectrum and frequently progress to chronic kidney disease. Benefits of nephrologist subspecialty care during the AKD period after AKI are uncertain. Patients with AKI requiring dialysis who subsequently became dialysis independent and survived for at least 90 days, defined as the AKD period, were identified from the Taiwanese population's health insurance database. Cox proportional hazard models using death as the competing risk before and after propensity-score matching were applied to evaluate various endpoints. Among a total of 20 260 patients with AKI requiring dialysis who became dialysis independent, only 7550 (37.3%) patients were followed up with by a nephrologist (F/U<sub>nephrol</sub> group) during the AKD period. During a mean 4.04 ± 3.56 years of follow-up, the patients in the F/U<sub>nephrol</sub> group were more often administered statin, antihypertensives, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), diuretics, antiplatelet agents, and antidiabetic agents. The patients in the F/U<sub>nephrol</sub> group had a lower mortality rate (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.87, P < .001) and were less likely to have major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (subdistribution HR [sHR] = 0.85, P < .001), congestive heart failure (CHF) (sHR = 0.81, P < .001), and severe sepsis (sHR = 0.88, P = .008) according to the Cox proportional model after adjusting for mortality as a competing risk. During the AKD period, an increase in the frequency of nephrology visits was associated with improved outcomes. In this population-based cohort, even after weaning off acute dialysis, only a minority of patients visited a nephrologist during the AKD period. We showed that nephrology follow-up is associated with a decrease in MACE, CHF exacerbations, and sepsis, as well as lower mortality; thus it may improve outcomes in patients with AKD.",Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,2020-Sep,"Wu VC, Chueh JS, Chen L, Huang TM, Lai TS, Wang CY, Chen YM, Chu TS, Chawla LS",9,1974,nephrology,2025-11-22
36635661,UK prescribing practice of anticoagulants in patients with chronic kidney disease: a nephrology and haematology-based survey.,"A survey to gain insight into anticoagulant prescribing practice in the setting of chronic kidney disease (CKD) across the UK was disseminated via renal and haematology networks. Areas of anticoagulant use included patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE), requiring thromboprophylaxis for VTE, Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and nephrotic syndrome.An online-survey was disseminated via British Haematology Society, UK Kidney Association, and Renal Pharmacy Group over a five month period. All responses were voluntary and anonymous.Among 117 responses there were 49 nephrology doctors, 47 renal pharmacists and 20 haematology clinicians. A specialist multidisciplinary team to discuss the specific anticoagulant management of these patients was only available to 3% (4/117) respondents. Renal function estimate used for anticoagulant dosing was mainly Cockcroft-Gault for pharmacists and haematology but lab-based estimates were used by nephrology doctors. Therapeutic dose of Low Molecular Weight Heparin was mostly likely to be reduced by one-third when used for VTE treatment, with the majority of units undertaking anti-Xa monitoring in CKD stage 5 and dialysis. Direct-acting Oral Anticoagulants are being used in patients with nephrotic syndrome, those with CKD stage 5 and on dialysis for VTE and AF in the absence of license in these indications.This survey highlighted the significant differences between anticoagulant prescribing in CKD between two professional specialties and marked variation between centres in anticoagulant management strategies employed for these patients. With gaps still existing in the evidence base and answers to these not expected within the next few years, development of a best-practice guideline would be warranted to support clinicians in this field.",BMC nephrology,2023-Jan,"Parker K, Choudhuri S, Lewis P, Thachil J, Mitra S",5,1789,nephrology,2025-11-22

We audited the reporting of body-mass index in nephrology outpatient clinics to establish the characteristics of individuals with obesity in nephrology practice. Body-mass index, clinical information and biochemical measures were recorded for patients attending clinics between 3<sup>rd</sup> August, 2018 and 18<sup>th</sup> January, 2019. Inferential statistics and Pearson correlations were used to investigate relationships between body-mass index, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and proteinuria. Mean ± SD BMI was 28.6 ± 5.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (n = 374). Overweight and obesity class 1 were more common in males (P = .02). Amongst n = 123 individuals with obesity and chronic kidney disease, mean ± SD age, n (%) female and median[IQR] eGFR were 64.1 ± 14.2 years, 52 (42.3%) and 29.0[20.5] mL/min/BSA, respectively. A positive correlation between increasing body-mass index and proteinuria was observed in such patients (r = 0.21, P = .03), which was stronger in males and those with CKD stages 4 and 5. Mean body-mass index was 2.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup> higher in those treated with 4-5 versus 0-1 antihypertensives (P = .03). Amongst n = 59 patients with obesity, chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, 2 (3.5%) and 0 (0%) were prescribed a GLP-1 receptor analogue and SGLT2-inhibitor, respectively.

The importance of this event on the further development of nephrology, cardiology, and endocrinology left us compelled to reminisce about it and its main author, Robert Tigerstedt (1853-1923), who was one of Scandinavia's most famous scientists. He studied medicine at the University of Helsinki, Finland. His doctoral dissertation On the Mechanical Stimulation of the Nervous System and 10 other original publications made him famous among the neurophysiological community. From 1881, he worked in the Physiology Department at Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, where he created a modern laboratory and became a professor at age 33 years. After meeting Carl Ludwig in Leipzig, he became interested in central blood circulation. In 1886, with Per Bergman, he started a series meticulously performed experiments with extracts of the rabbit kidney cortex, which, when injected into other rabbits, increased their blood pressure. The hypothetical responsible substance was called renin. The results were presented at the International Congress of Medicine in Moscow in 1887. Forty years later, Harry Goldblatt confirmed Tigerstedt's theory that ""the substance which comes from kidneys increases the blood pressure."" After he returned to Finland in 1901, Tigerstedt headed the Physiology Institute in Helsinki. His further activities included scientific work, teaching, and socially oriented issues like healthy nutrition and conditions in prison camps. He was also interested in the history of medicine and was a member of the Nobel Committee. His Textbook of Human Physiology was published in numerous editions in many languages. He also authored the renowned Textbook of Physiological Methodology and Physiology of Circulation. Tigerstedt published over 200 scientific papers and was an honorary doctor at many universities.

Maternal characteristics were as follows: The mean age was 29.3±5.6 years; 14% had advanced maternal age; 10% had a family history of CAKUT or ESKD; 5% had diabetes mellitus; and 5% of pregnancies were <i>in vitro</i> fertilization-assisted. Fetal characteristics were as follows: 62.7% of fetuses were male and 16% had CAKUT associated with multiple congenital anomalies. The most common prenatal diagnoses were lower urinary tract obstruction in 71 (32.7%), unilateral renal agenesis or multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) in 52 (24.9%), bilateral agenesis or MCDK in 22 (10.1%), and bilateral cystic kidney disease in 19 (8.8%). Seventy-six percent of patients received genetic counseling. One hundred forty-one (64.9%) patients had some form of prenatal genetic testing with a positivity rate of 5.7%. Postnatal characteristics were as follows: 61 (28.1%) patients were seen in prenatal consultation only and no follow-up was available. Of the remaining 156 pregnancies, 136 (86.3%) were viable and delivered at a mean gestational age of 35.2±3.8 weeks. Of these, 100 (64%) survived to discharge. Additional postnatal genetic testing was obtained in 27 infants with a positivity rate of 59%. Overall perinatal mortality for this cohort as a whole was high (35.8%). While prenatal genetic testing had a limited diagnostic utility, targeted postnatal genetic testing had a much higher diagnostic yield.",Kidney360,2023-Mar,"Plaud Gonzalez AM, Joseph C, Stover SR, Nassr A, Koh CJ, Angelo JR, Braun MC",7,2513,nephrology,2025-11-22
38834994,Primary care clinician perspectives on automated nephrology e-consults for diabetic kidney disease: a pre-implementation qualitative study.,"Many patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) do not receive evidence-based, guideline-recommended treatment shown to reduce DKD progression and complications. Proactive electronic consultations (e-consults) are an emerging intervention strategy that could potentially allow nephrologists to provide timely and evidence-based guidance to primary care providers (PCPs) engaged in early DKD care. The objective of this study was to explore perspectives about potential barriers and facilitators associated with a proactive e-consult program to improve DKD care delivery. We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with PCPs across three different health systems. Interview transcripts were reviewed in a rapid qualitative analysis approach to iteratively identify, refine, and achieve consensus on a final list of themes and subthemes. A total of 18 interviews were conducted. PCPs across all sites identified similar challenges to delivering guideline-recommended DKD care. PCPs were supportive of the proactive e-consult concept. Three major themes emerged surrounding (1) perceived potential benefits of proactive e-consults, including educational value and improved specialist access; (2) concerns about the proactive nature of e-consults, including the potential to increase PCP workload and the possibility that e-consults could be seen as documenting substandard care; and (3) leveraging of care teams to facilitate recommended DKD care, such as engaging clinic-based pharmacists to implement specialist recommendations from e-consults. In this pre-implementation qualitative study, PCPs noted potential benefits and identified concerns and implementation barriers for proactive e-consults for DKD care. Strategies that emerged for promoting successful implementation included involving clinic support staff to enact e-consult recommendations and framing e-consults as a system improvement effort to avoid judgmental associations.",BMC primary care,2024-Jun,"Chu CD, Dohan D, Estrella MM, Shlipak MG, Tuot DS",5,1947,nephrology,2025-11-22
38190147,Protected Time for Program Administration among Nephrology Program Leadership in the United States.,"In 2022, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education reduced minimum program director protected time for program administration from 10 to 8 h/wk, with no core faculty requirement. We surveyed program leaders regarding the effect of these changes. This is an anonymous, online survey of all US adult nephrology program directors (March 2023), who forwarded core faculty/associate program director (APD) surveys. The questions included protected time in 2022-2023 and 2021-2022, whether it was sufficient, estimated time needed, and two validated single-item burnout measures (emotional exhaustion and depersonalization). The analysis was descriptive. Program directors: Their response was 62% (92/149), with geographic distribution/approved fellow positions similar to those nationally. Overall, protected time slightly increased from 2021 to 2022, largely in >6-fellow programs, but 42% (13/31) of these were still not meeting minimum requirements. Only 37% (30/81) agreed that they had sufficient protected time. Those with ≤6 fellows estimated needing 11±4 h/wk (15±4 h/wk with >6 fellows). Twenty-five percent (20/81) reported high levels of emotional exhaustion. Core faculty: 57 of 149 program directors (38%) forwarded the link to 454 faculty. Ninety-four percent of APDs (49/52) responded, reported 3±3 h/wk protected time (42% had none), and estimated needing 6±3 h/wk, regardless of program size. Sixty-seven of 402 core faculty (17%) responded, reported 2±3 h/wk (50% had none), and estimated needing 5±3 h/wk, regardless of program size. ≥85% of APDs and core faculty precepted clinical rotations, gave lectures, evaluated fellows, mentored scholarly work, and participated in recruitment. The majority assisted in fellow remediation. Thirty-four percent (15/44) of APDs and 21% (13/61) of core faculty reported high levels of emotional exhaustion. Program leaders estimated minimum necessary program administration times (on the basis of program size) that exceeded the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements. APDs/core faculty contributed substantially to nonclinical training. Thirty-four percent of APDs and 25% of program directors had a high likelihood of burnout.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2024-May,"Yuan CM, Young BY, Watson MA, Sussman AN",4,2222,nephrology,2025-11-22
34128096,Omentectomy reduces the need for peritoneal dialysis catheter revision in children: a study from the Pediatric Nephrology Research Consortium.,"There are no multi-center studies examining omentectomy and peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter revision in the pediatric dialysis population. We performed a retrospective study at eight centers within the Pediatric Nephrology Research Consortium (PNRC). Data review included all incident tunneled PD catheters placed between 1/1/2011 and 12/31/2016 in pediatric stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD 5) patients. The primary outcome was the need for catheter revision and/or replacement. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate predictors for catheter revision/replacement. Data from 184 children (62.5% male; median age 7.4 years) were analyzed. Omentectomy was completed in 63.6% (n = 117). Revision/replacement occurred in 34.2% (n = 63); median time to revision/replacement was 38.5 days after insertion. PD catheter revision/replacement catheter occurred in 23.9% who underwent omentectomy versus 52.2% without omentectomy (p = 0.0005). Children ≥ 6 years at the time of catheter insertion experienced fewer revisions/replacements (18.2% age ≥ 6 vs. 56.5% age < 6 years, p <0.001). After adjusting for covariates, omentectomy reduced the need for revision by 63%; revision was 3.66 times more likely in those < 6 years of age. This multi-center study demonstrates that omentectomy at the time of PD catheter insertion in pediatric patients is strongly associated with reduced likelihood of PD catheter revision. Omentectomy should be considered at the time of PD catheter insertion, especially in young children who are at high risk for PD catheter malfunction.

37968178,Tubular Diseases and Stones Seen From Pediatric and Adult Nephrology Perspectives.,"The tubular system of the kidneys is a complex series of morphologic and functional units orchestrating the content of tubular fluid as it flows along the nephron and collecting ducts. Renal tubules maintain body water, regulate electrolytes and acid-base balance, reabsorb precious organic solutes, and eliminate specific metabolites, toxins, and drugs. In addition, decisive mechanisms to adjust blood pressure are governed by the renal tubules. Genetic as well as acquired disorders of these tubular functions may cause serious diseases that manifest both in childhood and adulthood. This article addresses a selection of tubulopathies and the underlying pathomechanisms, while highlighting the important differences in pediatric and adult nephrology care. These range from rare monogenic conditions such as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, cystinosis, and Bartter syndrome that present in childhood, to the genetic and acquired tubular pathologies causing hypertension or nephrolithiasis that are more prevalent in adults. Both pediatric and adult nephrologists must be aware of these conditions and the age-dependent manifestations that warrant close interaction between the two subspecialties.",Seminars in nephrology,2023-Jul,"Münch J, Goodyer PR, Wagner CA",3,1198,nephrology,2025-11-22
39311980,Renal sympathetic denervation 2024 in Austria: recommendations from the Austrian Society of Hypertension : Endorsed by the Austrian Society of Nephrology and the Working Group of Interventional Cardiology of the Austrian Society of Cardiology.,"Renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) is an interventional supplement to medical treatment in patients with arterial hypertension. While the first sham-controlled trial, SYMPLICITY HTN‑3 was neutral, with improved procedural details, patient selection and follow-up, recent randomized sham-controlled trials of second-generation devices show a consistent blood pressure lowering effect of RDN, as compared to sham controls. These new data and the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) premarket approval of two RDN devices are the basis for the present recommendations update.This joint position paper from the Austrian Society of Hypertension, together with the Austrian Society of Nephrology and the Working Group of Interventional Cardiology from the Austrian Society of Cardiology includes an overview about the available evidence on RDN and gives specific recommendations for the work-up, patient selection, pretreatment, procedural management and follow-up in patients undergoing RDN in Austria. Specifically, RDN may be used in clinical routine care, together with lifestyle measures and antihypertensive drugs, in patients with resistant hypertension (i.e. uncontrolled blood pressure on 3 antihypertensive drugs) and in those with uncontrolled hypertension, after adequate work-up, if institutional, patient-related and procedural conditions are fulfilled.",Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,2024-Sep,"Zweiker D, Koppelstätter C, Hohenstein K, Lang I, Perl S, Bugger H, Brandt MC, Horn S, Binder RK, Watschinger B, Frick M, Niessner A, Weber T",13,1372,nephrology,2025-11-22
37696257,A Systems Nephrology Approach to Diabetic Kidney Disease Research and Practice.,"Diagnosis and staging of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) via the serial assessment of routine laboratory indices lacks the granularity required to resolve the heterogeneous disease mechanisms driving progression in the individual patient. A systems nephrology approach may help resolve mechanisms underlying this clinically apparent heterogeneity, paving a way for targeted treatment of DKD. Given the limited access to kidney tissue in routine clinical care of patients with DKD, data derived from renal tissue in preclinical model systems, including animal and in vitro models, can play a central role in the development of a targeted systems-based approach to DKD. Multi-centre prospective cohort studies, including the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) and the European Nephrectomy Biobank (ENBiBA) project, will improve access to human diabetic kidney tissue for research purposes. Integration of diverse data domains from such initiatives including clinical phenotypic data, renal and retinal imaging biomarkers, histopathological and ultrastructural data, and an array of molecular omics (transcriptomics, proteomics, etc.) alongside multi-dimensional data from preclinical modelling offers exciting opportunities to unravel individual-level mechanisms underlying progressive DKD. The application of machine and deep learning approaches may particularly enhance insights derived from imaging and histopathological/ultrastructural data domains. Integration of data from multiple model systems (in vitro, animal models, and patients) and from diverse domains (clinical phenotypic, imaging, histopathological/ultrastructural, and molecular omics) offers potential to create a precision medicine approach to DKD care wherein the right treatments are offered to the right patients at the right time.",Nephron,2024-,"Martin WP, Docherty NG",2,1806,nephrology,2025-11-22

Retrospective, observational and multicentric study that included patients initiating treatment with evolocumab (from February 2016 to August 2018), in 15 Nephrology Units in Spain. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients, the lipid lowering treatment and the evolution of the lipid profiles between 24 weeks pre-initiation and 12±4 weeks post-initiation of evolocumab were reviewed. 60 patients were enrolled: 53.3% women; mean (SD) age, 56.9 (12.8) years, 45.0% with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) (5.0% homozygous and 40.0% heterozygous) and 65.0% with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The mean (SD) eGFR was 62.6 (30.0) ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> (51.7% of patients had eGFR <60ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> [CKD stage>2]), 50.0% had proteinuria (>300mg/g) and 10.0% had nephrotic syndrome. Other CV risk factors were hypertension (75.0%), diabetes (25.0%), and smoking (21.7%). A 40.0% of patients were statin intolerant. At evolocumab initiation, 41.7% of patients were on a high intensity statin, 18.3% on moderate intensity statin and 50.0% were receiving ezetimibe. Mean (SD) LDL-c at evolocumab initiation was 179.7 (62.9) mg/dL (53.4% of patients with LDL-c ≥160mg/dL and 29.3% ≥190mg/dL). After 12 weeks, evolocumab resulted in LDL-c reductions of 60.1%. At week 12, 90.0% of patients reached LDL-c levels <100mg/dL, 70.0% <70mg/dL, and 55.0% <55mg/dL, while mean eGFR levels and statin use remained stable. In Nephrology Units of Spain, evolocumab was predominantly prescribed in patients with FH, chronic renal disease (CRD>2) and secondary prevention, with LDL-c levels above those recommended by the guidelines.

36250456,Enabling flourishing: novel approaches in palliative medicine for children with advanced kidney disease.,"Paediatric kidney disease results in considerable burden on children and their families. Paediatric palliative care is a holistic, family-centred care approach intended to enable flourishing and address the many impediments to life participation which advanced kidney disease can impose. To date, palliative care resources have been underutilized in paediatric nephrology. This review will highlight recent literature targeting the engagement and life participation of children with advanced kidney disease through implementation of novel palliative care approaches and propose directions for future research. Children with advanced kidney disease and their families highly value incorporation of their perspectives, particularly on life participation, within care plan development; but what it means to participate in life can be variable, and clinicians need improved tools to ascertain and incorporate these perspectives. Novel palliative care interventions developed for application in comparable disease states offer potential opportunities for paediatric nephrologists to support this goal. Children with advanced kidney disease and their families will benefit from incorporation of their perspectives and values, facilitated by palliative interventions.",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,2023-Jan,"House TR, Wightman A",2,1260,nephrology,2025-11-22

To determine the characteristics, primary care monitoring and renal outcomes of patients discharged from renal clinic. A retrospective study of 2236 adults discharged from a tertiary renal clinic between 2013-2018. Patient demographics, primary renal disease, laboratory results and timeline dates were collected from the renal IT system. Timing of blood tests, renal progression, needing dialysis and patient survival were analysed. Reasons for discharge and cause of disease progression were reviewed in patients developing new estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 ml/min/1.73 m2. Patients were older (median age 75; interquartile range 63-84) with non-progressive, seemingly non-proteinuric renal disease. Median time to repeat blood test post-discharge was 75 days with 90% tested within 12 months. Sixty-six percent saw an improvement in kidney function post-discharge and only 13% had a decline of >10 ml/min/1.73 m2. Only 132 patients (6%) developed new advanced chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 20 ml/min/1.73 m2) of whom 40% were palliative, 36% had developed acute kidney injury and 23% discharged for failing to attend clinic. One hundred and thirty-four patients (6%) were referred back to nephrology and eight started dialysis of whom six were discharged for failure to attend clinic. Most discharged patients are low risk of progressive renal disease and need infrequent monitoring.

33871790,Design of a consensus-based geriatric assessment tailored for older chronic kidney disease patients: results of a pragmatic approach.,"Unidentified cognitive decline and other geriatric impairments are prevalent in older patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Despite guideline recommendation of geriatric evaluation, routine geriatric assessment is not common in these patients. While high burden of vascular disease and existing pre-dialysis care pathways mandate a tailored geriatric assessment, no consensus exists on which instruments are most suitable in this population to identify geriatric impairments. Therefore, the aim of this study was to propose a geriatric assessment, based on multidisciplinary consensus, to routinely identify major geriatric impairments in older people with advanced CKD. A pragmatic approach was chosen, which included focus groups, literature review, inventory of current practices, an expert consensus meeting, and pilot testing. In preparation of the consensus meeting, we composed a project team and an expert panel (n = 33), drafted selection criteria for the selection of instruments, and assessed potential instruments for the geriatric assessment. Selection criteria related to general geriatric domains, clinical relevance, feasibility, and duration of the assessment. The consensus-assessment contains instruments in functional, cognitive, psychological, somatic, patient preferences, nutritional status, and social domains. Administration of (seven) patient questionnaires and (ten) professional-administered instruments, by nurse (practitioners), takes estimated 20 and 40 min, respectively. Results are discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting including at least nephrology and geriatric expertise, informing nephrology treatment decisions, and follow-up interventions among which comprehensive geriatric assessment.

35369364,Clinical Response and Pattern of B cell Suppression with Single Low Dose Rituximab in Nephrology.,"There is no consensus regarding dose and frequency of rituximab in nephrology with extrapolation of doses used in treating lymphoproliferative disorders. There are no guidelines on targeting initial and subsequent doses on the basis of CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells. Initially, 100 mg rituximab was given to 42 adults with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS) and frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS), idiopathic membranous nephropathy (MN), and high-immunologic-risk kidney transplantation. Absolute and percentage levels of CD19 B cells and clinical status were assessed at baseline, days 30, 90, and 180, and at 1 year. Subsequent doses of rituximab were on the basis of CD19 B cell reconstitution and clinical response. CD19 B cell percentage decreased from 16.3 ± 7.6 to 0.3 ± 0.3 (<i>P</i>≤0.001), 1.9 ± 1.7 (<i>P</i>≤0.001), and 4.0 ± 4.5 (<i>P</i>=0.005) by 30, 90, and 180 days, respectively. Suppression of CD19 B cell count below 1% at days 30, 90, and 180 was seen in 40 of 42 (95.2%), 18 of 42 (42.9%), and 7 of 42 (16.7%) patients, respectively. Of 30 with SDNS and FRNS followed up for 1 year, 29 (96.7%) went into remission at day 30. Remission was sustained in 23 (76.6%) at day 180 and 21 (70%) at 1 year. There was a significant decrease (<i>P</i><0.001) in the dose of steroids needed to maintain remission at 180 days after rituximab (0.27 ± 0.02 mg/kg to 0.02 ± 0.00 mg/kg). CD19 B cell percentage at 90 days correlated with relapse (<i>P</i>=0.001; odds ratio 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 2.57). Eighteen (60%) required an additional dose. Of five with MN, four achieved remission by 6 months, which was sustained in three by 1 year. Of the seven kidney transplant recipients, two had antibody-mediated rejections, although CD19 B cells were suppressed even at 1 year. Low-dose rituximab induces sustained depletion of CD19 B cells for up to 90 days. Its role in preventing relapses in SDNS, FRNS, MN, and rejection needs further study.",Kidney360,2020-May,"George J, Alex S, Thomas ETA, Gracious N, Vineetha NS, Kumar S",6,1981,nephrology,2025-11-22

An anonymous survey was conducted to a total of 150 nephrologists. Demographic data, perceptions, PD indications, contraindications, and possible reasons for low preference of PD were questioned. In decision making, 93.4% of all stated that patients prioritized the doctor's opinion and 80.7% considered PD is the best initial dialysis option. The presence of many HD facilities (70.7%), inadequate knowledge, and education of patients (70%), physicians' reluctance to practice PD (70%), unwillingness of patients (68.7%), negative effect of other patients (67.3%), inadequate experience of PD staff (58.7%), and nonencouragement of PD by the state (58.7%) were the leading reasons of low prevalence. Implementation of comprehensive predialysis education programs for patients, informing government and hospital officials about PD advantages, and reinforcing PD principles to the nephrologists could improve the low prevalence of PD in Turkey.","Therapeutic apheresis and dialysis : official peer-reviewed journal of the International Society for Apheresis, the Japanese Society for Apheresis, the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy",2023-Feb,"Dogan I, Ucar E, Oruc A, Ates K",4,1039,nephrology,2025-11-22

Thus, this study investigated HDL levels and mortality in elderly Korean patients undergoing hemodialysis. We recruited 1860 incident hemodialysis patients aged greater than 70 years from a retrospective cohort of the Korean Society of Geriatric Nephrology. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. The mean age of the cohort was 77.8 years, and 1049 (56.4%) were men. When we grouped the patients into HDL cholesterol tertiles, the T1 group (HDL level <30 mg/dL in men and <33 mg/dL in women) had a higher proportion of patients with end-stage kidney disease due to diabetic nephropathy. During the median follow-up period of 3.1 years, 1109 (59.7%) deaths occurred. In a multivariable Cox regression model, the T1 group had a significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.50; P = .002) compared to the T3 group. A nonlinear analysis using a restrictive spline curve showed that low HDL cholesterol levels were associated with increased HR when HDL cholesterol levels were <40 mg/dL; however, there was no association between HDL cholesterol and mortality when HDL cholesterol levels were >40 mg/dL. Triglyceride/HDL ratio was not significantly associated with the risk of mortality (HR per 1 log increase, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.99-1.18; P = .069). Low HDL cholesterol levels are associated with an increased risk of mortality in elderly patients undergoing hemodialysis. However, there was no significant relationship between HDL cholesterol levels and mortality when levels were below 40 mg/dL. Therefore, low HDL cholesterol levels may be a useful risk factor for predicting mortality in elderly patients undergoing hemodialysis.",Journal of renal nutrition : the official journal of the Council on Renal Nutrition of the National Kidney Foundation,2025-Jan,"Chu SH, Park EH, Lee H, Hong YA, Park WY, Cho JH, Sun IO, Hwang WM, Kwon SH, Jeon JS, Noh H, Yoo KD, Kim H",13,1864,nephrology,2025-11-22
38851444,Enhancing Clinical Decision Support in Nephrology: Addressing Algorithmic Bias Through Artificial Intelligence Governance.,"There has been a steady rise in the use of clinical decision support (CDS) tools to guide nephrology as well as general clinical care. Through guidance set by federal agencies and concerns raised by clinical investigators, there has been an equal rise in understanding whether such tools exhibit algorithmic bias leading to unfairness. This has spurred the more fundamental question of whether sensitive variables such as race should be included in CDS tools. In order to properly answer this question, it is necessary to understand how algorithmic bias arises. We break down 3 sources of bias encountered when using electronic health record data to develop CDS tools: (1) use of proxy variables, (2) observability concerns and (3) underlying heterogeneity. We discuss how answering the question of whether to include sensitive variables like race often hinges more on qualitative considerations than on quantitative analysis, dependent on the function that the sensitive variable serves. Based on our experience with our own institution's CDS governance group, we show how health system-based governance committees play a central role in guiding these difficult and important considerations. Ultimately, our goal is to foster a community practice of model development and governance teams that emphasizes consciousness about sensitive variables and prioritizes equity.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2024-Dec,"Goldstein BA, Mohottige D, Bessias S, Cary MP",4,1369,nephrology,2025-11-22

A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out on the patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease at a tertiary care hospital from 15 May 2022 to 10 October 2022 after getting ethical approval from the Institutional Review Committee (Reference number: 621/2022). Pre-designed proforma was used to collect demographic data like age, sex, height and weight. Blood samples of the patients were analysed for thyroid function tests (triiodothyronine, thyroxine and thyroid stimulating hormone levels) by chemiluminescence immunoassay. Convenience sampling was used. Point estimate and 95% Confidence Interval were calculated. Out of 156 study participants with chronic kidney disease, subclinical hypothyroidism was present in 34 (21.79%) (15.31-28.27, 95% Confidence Interval) patients. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism amongst chronic kidney disease patients was found to be lower than in other similar studies conducted in similar settings. chronic kidney disease; thyroid stimulating hormone; thyroxine; triiodothyronine.",JNMA; journal of the Nepal Medical Association,2023-Apr,"Shreewastav RK, Ghosh AK, Yadav R, Katuwal A, Shrestha S",5,1353,nephrology,2025-11-22
36367662,Utility and patient acceptance of telemedicine in nephrology.,"There is an increasing burden of kidney diseases worldwide and access to specialist care is limited. Telemedicine, has been relatively less used in developing countries like India. The current study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptance of telenephrology services at our institute, a public hospital. A total of 150 patients were selected by stratified random sampling from the list of attendees who had undergone both in-person outpatient consultation and telenephrology consultation. Patient's attitude towards, and knowledge and acceptance of telenephrology services were evaluated. The average age of the study cohort was 42.52 ± 15.1 years. More than one-third (39.3%) of our patients belonged to the lower middle socioeconomic class. The median distance traveled to reach our outpatient clinic was 113.5 km (3-2249 km). Patients reported lost workdays in 54.7% cases. The majority (95%) of patients managed to consult through teleservices successfully. Ninety percent of the patients gave a satisfaction score of 4 (out of 5) or above for their tele-consultation experience. The most important perceived benefit of teleconsultation was the reduced risk of infection (40.6%) followed by economic benefits (32%). The major disadvantage (36%) was the absence of physical examination. A combination of physical and telenephrology services was the option preferred by 84% of the patients. In developing countries like India, with the majority of the population residing outside major cities and with limited medical access, telenephrology has a huge potential to provide quality nephrology care to the remotest parts of the country.",Journal of nephrology,2022-Dec,"George K, Subbiah A, Yadav RK, Bagchi S, Mahajan S, Bhowmik D, Agarwal SK",7,1641,nephrology,2025-11-22
30449243,Telehealth model of care for routine follow up of renal transplant recipients in a tertiary centre: A case study.,"Royal Melbourne Hospital (RMH) performs over 140 kidney transplant operations annually. Kidney transplant recipients require regular medical review, which results in loss of time and costs from travel, particularly for regional patients, and places high demand on the hospital outpatient service. The RMH renal transplant unit initiated a telehealth service in 2016 to provide cost effective, patient-centred clinical care for regional patients. To date, 263 clinical reviews have been conducted via telehealth, potentially saving 203,202 kilometres in travel distance; 2771 hours in car travel time; an estimated AUD $31,048 in petrol savings and 51 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents of greenhouse gas emissions. Lessons learnt have included the importance of using technology that allows patients to access telehealth from their place of choice. The option of a joint consultation with local healthcare providers has facilitated the development of extended care networks for our patients. Incorporation of telehealth into our outpatient system has been achieved with the existing nephrology workforce, making it a sustainable long-term review option. Our renal transplant telehealth outpatient clinic has been a successful change in the way we provide care to regional patients.

36319069,"Climate and the Nephrologist: The Intersection of Climate Change, Kidney Disease, and Clinical Care.","Climate change is upon us, and it will have a major effect on both kidney disease and the nephrology practice. But the converse is also true: our treatment of kidney disease has an effect on the climate. Much attention has focused on how rising temperatures can lead to acute and CKD and health exacerbations in patients with established kidney disease. Climate change is also associated with rising air pollution from wildfires and industrial wastes and infectious diseases associated with flooding and changing habitats, all of which heighten the risk of acute and CKD. Less well recognized or understood are the ways nephrology practices, in turn, contribute to still more climate change. Hemodialysis, although lifesaving, can be associated with marked water usage (up to 600 L per dialysis session), energy usage (with one 4-hour session averaging as much as one fifth of the total energy consumed by a household per day), and large clinical wastes (with hemodialysis accounting for one third of total clinical medicine-associated waste). Of note, >90% of dialysis occurs in highly affluent countries, whereas dialysis is much less available in the poorer countries where climate change is having the highest effect on kidney disease. We conclude that not only do nephrologists need to prepare for the rise in climate-associated kidney disease, they must also urgently develop more climate-friendly methods of managing patients with kidney disease.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2023-Mar,"Young SE, Khoshnaw LJ, Johnson RJ",3,1453,nephrology,2025-11-22

Among other reasons, this is due to a lack of validation studies. In this paper, we present and discuss the validation results of a machine learning model for the prediction of acute kidney injury in cardiac surgery patients initially developed on the MIMIC-III dataset when applied to an external cohort of an American research hospital. To help account for the performance differences observed, we utilized interpretability methods based on feature importance, which allowed experts to scrutinize model behavior both at the global and local level, making it possible to gain further insights into why it did not behave as expected on the validation cohort. The knowledge gleaned upon derivation can be potentially useful to assist model update during validation for more generalizable and simpler models. We argue that interpretability methods should be considered by practitioners as a further tool to help explain performance differences and inform model update in validation studies.",Artificial intelligence in medicine,2021-Jan,"da Cruz HF, Pfahringer B, Martensen T, Schneider F, Meyer A, Böttinger E, Schapranow MP",7,1127,nephrology,2025-11-22
34584272,Evolutionary genetics and acclimatization in nephrology.,"Evolutionary processes, including mutation, migration and natural selection, have influenced the prevalence and distribution of various disorders in humans. However, despite a few well-known examples, such as the APOL1 variants - which have undergone positive genetic selection for their ability to confer resistance to Trypanosoma brucei infection but confer a higher risk of chronic kidney disease - little is known about the effects of evolutionary processes that have shaped genetic variation on kidney disease. An understanding of basic concepts in evolutionary genetics provides an opportunity to consider how findings from ancient and archaic genomes could inform our knowledge of evolution and provide insights into how population migration and genetic admixture have shaped the current distribution and landscape of human kidney-associated diseases. Differences in exposures to infectious agents, environmental toxins, dietary components and climate also have the potential to influence the evolutionary genetics of kidneys. Of note, selective pressure on loci associated with kidney disease is often from non-kidney diseases, and thus it is important to understand how the link between genome-wide selected loci and kidney disease occurs in relation to secondary nephropathies.",Nature reviews.

A pediatric nephrology research consortium study.","Probiotics are living microorganisms that may confer health benefits to their host if administered in sufficient quantities. However, data on the use of probiotics in transplant recipients are scarce. This multi-center survey of pediatric nephrologists aimed to examine variations in practice regarding the use of probiotics in pediatric kidney transplant recipients. The survey was conducted via a 10-item questionnaire (developed in Survey Monkey) administered to pediatric nephrologists participating in the Pediatric Nephrology Research Consortium meeting in April 2023. Sixty-four pediatric nephrologists completed the survey. Twenty-seven (42.2%) respondents reported having prescribed probiotics to pediatric kidney transplant recipients. The primary reason for probiotic use was the treatment of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (n = 20), with other reasons including recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (n = 15), general gut health promotion (n = 12), recurrent urinary tract infections (n = 8), and parental request (n = 1). Of those who prescribed probiotics, 48.1% held them during periods of neutropenia and 14.8% during central venous line use. Of the 64 respondents, 20 reported the lack of safety data as a concern for using probiotics in kidney transplant recipients.

34136109,Big Data-Enabled Analysis of Factors Affecting Patient Waiting Time in the Nephrology Department of a Large Tertiary Hospital.,"The length of waiting time has become an important indicator of the efficiency of medical services and the quality of medical care. Lengthy waiting times for patients will inevitably affect their mood and reduce satisfaction. For patients who are in urgent need of hospitalization, delayed admission often leads to exacerbation of the patient's condition and may threaten the patient's life. We gathered patients' information about outpatient visits and hospital admissions in the Nephrology Department of a large tertiary hospital in western China from January 1st, 2014, to December 31st, 2016, and we used big data-enabled analysis methods, including univariate analysis and multivariate linear regression models, to explore the factors affecting waiting time. We found that gender (<i>P</i>=0.048), the day of issuing the admission card (Saturday, <i>P</i>=0.028), the applied period for admission (<i>P</i> < 0.001), and the registration interval (<i>P</i> < 0.001) were positive influencing factors of patients' waiting time. Disease type (after kidney transplantation, <i>P</i> < 0.001), number of diagnoses (<i>P</i>=0.037), and the day of issuing the admission card (Sunday, <i>P</i>=0.001) were negative factors. A linear regression model built using these data performed well in the identification of factors affecting the waiting time of patients in the Nephrology Department. These results can be extended to other departments and could be valuable for improving patient satisfaction and hospital service quality by identifying the factors affecting waiting time.",Journal of healthcare engineering,2021-,"Li J, Zhu G, Luo L, Shen W",4,1576,nephrology,2025-11-22
32317329,"<i>AKI!Now</i> Initiative: Recommendations for Awareness, Recognition, and Management of AKI.","The American Society of Nephrology has established a new initiative, <i>AKI!Now</i>, with the goal of promoting excellence in the prevention and treatment of AKI by building a foundational program that transforms education and delivery of AKI care, aiming to reduce morbidity and associated mortality and to improve long-term outcomes. In this article, we describe our current efforts to improve early recognition and management involving inclusive interdisciplinary collaboration between providers, patients, and their families; discuss the ongoing need to change some of our current AKI paradigms and diagnostic methods; and provide specific recommendations to improve AKI recognition and care. In the hospital and the community, AKI is a common and increasingly frequent condition that generates risks of adverse events and high costs. Unfortunately, patients with AKI may frequently have received less than optimal quality of care. New classifications have facilitated understanding of AKI incidence and its impact on outcomes, but they are not always well aligned with AKI pathophysiology. Despite ongoing research efforts, treatments to promote or hasten kidney recovery remain ineffective. To avoid progression, the current approach to AKI emphasizes the promotion of early recognition and timely response. However, a lack of awareness of the importance of early recognition and treatment among health care team members and the heterogeneity of approaches within the health care teams assessing the patient remains a major challenge. Early identification is further complicated by differences in settings where AKI occurs (the community or the hospital), and by differences in patient populations and cultures between the intensive care unit and ward environments. To address these obstacles, we discuss the need to improve education at all levels of care and to generate specific guidance on AKI evaluation and management, including the development of a widely applicable education and an AKI management toolkit, engaging hospital administrators to incorporate AKI as a quality initiative, and raising awareness of AKI as a complication of other disease processes.",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2020-Dec,"Liu KD, Goldstein SL, Vijayan A, Parikh CR, Kashani K, Okusa MD, Agarwal A, Cerdá J",8,2172,nephrology,2025-11-22
39258991,Social and humanitarian issues in nephrology and hypertension.,"Chronic kidney disease and hypertension, two widely prevalent conditions worldwide, present an urgent and pressing need for immediate action. The review describes how social conditions and humanitarian issues can influence hypertension and kidney disease. Undoubtedly, social determinants of health (SDoH) are key influencers in the development of many noncommunicable diseases, including hypertension and kidney disease. Healthcare professionals, including public health workers, play a crucial role in addressing these issues. Poverty, low education level, poor nutrition, housing, exposure to environmental hazards, and stress-related disorders are all factors that can be addressed, either directly or indirectly, through improved awareness and access to proper healthcare services. Besides personal factors, national, regional, or global factors cause serious apprehension. Disasters, whether natural or man-made, can lead to significant aftermaths on the healthy person and certainly on kidney disease and hypertensive patients. A Global Overview Report, 2023 turned out to be one of the most violent years since the end of the Cold War. In 2023, 59 state-based conflicts were recorded in 34 countries, the highest number registered since 1946. The wars in Ukraine and Gaza were the primary contributors with a significant impact on the kidney population, especially people living on dialysis and transplantation patients. They also yielded many refugees or displaced persons with ongoing suffering. It is crucial to recognize that social and humanitarian conditions can quickly exacerbate the health of vulnerable populations, particularly those with noncommunicable diseases like hypertension and chronic kidney disease. These patients, who often require continuous follow-up, especially those on dialysis, are particularly vulnerable during difficult times. Their lives depend on uninterrupted access to dialysis or transplantation medications, making the need for special attention and care more pressing. Further research and advocacy are needed to address these issues and ensure the health and well being of these populations.",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,2024-Nov,Abdellatif DA,1,2139,nephrology,2025-11-22

Adherence to the renal diet is known to be suboptimal and patient feedback about the renal diet suggests that patients leave nephrology clinics feeling confused. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of a health literacy sensitive model of care (MOC) in outpatient nephrology dietetic clinics. This quasi-experimental non-randomised pre-post study recruited adults attending three renal dietitian clinics. The revised MOC consisted of a renal diet question prompt sheet, teachback, and plain language materials and instructions. Outcomes assessed included clinical, dietary, patient-reported satisfaction and quality of life. Differences between and within groups were analysed using paired t-tests, independent sample t-tests (or non-parametric equivalent), chi-squared and McNemar's tests. Linear mixed models evaluated change in total diet quality score, fruit, vegetable, protein and dairy intake with time as a fixed effect and a random subject specific effect. Fail to attend rates at the initial appointments were lower in the revised MOC (21.5% vs. 9.1%). The revised MOC was associated with significantly improved fruit (p = 0.03) and vegetable (p = 0.003) intake and an improved proportion with adequate diet quality (p = 0.03). These impacts were of moderate effect size (d = 0.5, 95% confidence interval = 0.0-1.0). The revised MOC was also associated with greater satisfaction at baseline (p = 0.04) and higher acceptability scores for all questions at the review appointments. Quality of life improved clinically but not significantly in the revised MOC (p = 0.92). This low-cost health literacy sensitive intervention is a promising strategy to improve fruit and vegetable intake in adults attending renal dietitian clinics. Further research to determine fidelity of teachback use and cost utility analysis would be beneficial.

This study explores the preferences, attitudes and perceived barriers of nephrology healthcare providers toward ACP for patients with ESKD in a tertiary care center in India. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among nephrology healthcare providers at a tertiary care center in India. The survey, developed from literature reviews and pretested, covered demographics, ACP knowledge and attitudes, current practices, and perceived barriers and facilitators. Data collection occurred from September 2022 to March 2023. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively, and qualitative data through thematic analysis. A total of 50 healthcare providers participated. While 36% acknowledged the importance of ACP, only 8% routinely engaged in ACP discussions. Major barriers included inadequate training (22%), lack of awareness about the importance of discussing ACP among stakeholders (20%), cultural barriers (18%), lack of time (14%), and the absence of institutional protocols for discussion on ACP (14%). Additional barriers included instances where families withhold health information from patients due to fear of losing hope (16%) and patient/family discomfort in discussing ACP (12%). Providers expressed a need for structured ACP protocols and educational programs. Despite recognizing its importance, ACP is underutilized in the care of patients with ESKD in India.

Around 850 million people have chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide and by 2030, 6 million will need kidney replacement therapy, mainly haemodialysis. As the world population gets older, projections for the end of the century worsen. From a sustainability perspective, healthcare systems contribute around 5-11% of total carbon emissions. Kidney care is one of the most resource-intensive specialties. In addition to energy, haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis require transportation of patients and personnel to and from facilities, use large volumes of water and generate significant plastic waste. Overall, current dialysis is not sustainable in the medium term. Primary prevention, early diagnosis and treatment of CKD and transplantation will decrease the need for dialysis, but this will take time and will not prevent the need for dialysis in millions of persons. There is a need to improve knowledge around the environmental and financial cost of kidney care and social and health outcomes of each patient pathway including using holistic tools such as life cycle assessment. This knowledge will allow workflow optimisations, organisational transformations and technological innovations across Europe, learning from different clinical sites. KitNewCare will build a European-wide knowledge base for sustainability in kidney care, develop and introduce a novel 4-factor database for comprehensive impact analysis, implement optimised processes and organisational transformations in four European clinical sites.

The aim of this paper is to describe topics learned from the manual revision, supported by noticed response changes in surveys from 2009 to 2019. Quantitative nursing research, using similar surveys to compare training and education over the last decade. Additionally, a brief search for literature was performed. Dutch dialysis nurses. In 2009, nurses were approached through an online survey sent to all dialysis centres in the Netherlands. In 2019, a similar survey was distributed during our annual Dutch nephrology days. Both surveys were compared and conclusions were drawn. Retrieved information was divided into basic topics and compared. More important, our findings show that even after a decade, there is still no special education for the nurses and patient training is given based on experience alone. Furthermore, multiple nurses are involved in patient training, with varying materials. There are more home visits with training at home and retraining is more suitable. A growth in assisted PD implies more involvement by community nurses. Also, more acute PD is seen, with a different structure of training. The manual was revised with input from our nurses and new guidelines, so we can uplift the education of peritoneal dialysis for the benefit of our patients, caretakers, and community nurses.

37202281,Recommendations of the Spanish Society of Nephrology for the management of mineral and bone metabolism disorders in patients with chronic kidney disease: 2021 (SEN-MM).,"As in 2011, when the Spanish Society of Nephrology (SEN) published the Spanish adaptation to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) universal Guideline on Chronic Kidney Disease-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD), this document contains an update and an adaptation of the 2017 KDIGO guidelines to our setting. In this field, as in many other areas of nephrology, it has been impossible to irrefutably answer many questions, which remain pending. However, there is no doubt that the close relationship between the CKD-MBD/cardiovascular disease/morbidity and mortality complex and new randomised clinical trials in some areas and the development of new drugs have yielded significant advances in this field and created the need for this update. We would therefore highlight the slight divergences that we propose in the ideal objectives for biochemical abnormalities in the CKD-MBD complex compared to the KDIGO suggestions (for example, in relation to parathyroid hormone or phosphate), the role of native vitamin D and analogues in the control of secondary hyperparathyroidism and the contribution of new phosphate binders and calcimimetics. Attention should also be drawn to the adoption of important new developments in the diagnosis of bone abnormalities in patients with kidney disease and to the need to be more proactive in treating them. In any event, the current speed at which innovations are taking place, while perhaps slower than we might like, globally drives the need for more frequent updates (for example, through Nefrología al día).",Nefrologia,2023-Jun,"Torregrosa JV, Bover J, Rodríguez Portillo M, González Parra E, Dolores Arenas M, Caravaca F, González Casaus ML, Martín-Malo A, Navarro-González JF, Lorenzo V, Molina P, Rodríguez M, Cannata Andia J",13,1566,nephrology,2025-11-22

Comparison of 2019 and 2023 data for availability of kidney replacement treatment services, access, health financing, workforce, registries, and policies for kidney care. Data for countries that participated in both surveys (2019 and 2023) were included in our analysis. Country data were aggregated by International Society of Nephrology regions and World Bank income levels. Proportionate changes in the status of these measures across both periods were reported. Data for 148 countries that participated in both surveys were available for analysis. The proportions of countries that provided public funding (free at point of delivery) increased from 27% in 2019 to 28% in 2023 for haemodialysis, 23% to 28% for peritoneal dialysis, and 31% to 36% for kidney transplantation services.

Failure to adequately prepare adolescents for transfer to adult care can lead to a decline in attendance to the adult clinic and an increase in the rate of non-adherence to medical treatment. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze studies exploring the experiences of adolescents, parents, and health professionals regarding the transition process of adolescents with CKD. Six databases were searched from inception to October 2018 for primary research articles. Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria, with only one exploring the parents' experiences. The results indicated that up to 50% of adolescents did not feel prepared to transfer to adult care at the time of transfer, and the timing was not ideal for some adolescents. Health professionals acknowledged that adolescents and parents felt emotional attachment to the pediatric unit, which led to anxiety about transferring. Once in adult care, adolescents felt out of place among the older patients, overwhelmed by the environment and the lack of attention from health professionals. Initiatives that could support transfer include allowing adolescents to attend pediatric consultation independently and meeting with adult health professionals prior to transfer. This review found that the transition process must be more responsive to adolescents by tailoring the timing of transfer according to their ability to assume self-care responsibility. In addition, there is a need to focus on the parents and their role in the transition process.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2020-Apr,"Crawford K, Wilson C, Low JK, Manias E, Williams A",5,1646,nephrology,2025-11-22
33972146,Urinary Diversion: Core Curriculum 2021.,"Urinary diversion after cystectomy has been a historical standard for the treatment of numerous benign and malignant diseases of the bladder. Since the first published description in the early 1900s, improvements in surgical technique and a better understanding of the metabolic sequelae postoperatively have greatly enhanced patient outcomes. Both continent and incontinent diversions are available to patients after cystectomy. In appropriately selected patients, orthotopic neobladder reconstruction can offer preservation of body image and continence, and continent cutaneous diversions represent a reasonable alternative. Conduit diversion, which remains the most commonly performed diversion technique, is ideal for patients who would benefit from a less morbid surgical procedure that negates the need for self-catheterization. This installment of the Core Curriculum in Nephrology outlines numerous aspects of urinary diversion, in which a multidisciplinary approach to postoperative management at the intersection of nephrology and urology is required to effectively optimize patient outcomes. This article includes a discussion of the various reconstructive options after cystectomy as well as a comprehensive review of frequently encountered short-term and long-term metabolic abnormalities associated with altered electrolyte and acid-base homeostasis.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2021-Aug,"Sperling CD, Lee DJ, Aggarwal S",3,1364,nephrology,2025-11-22
39671313,Dallas Nephrology Associates' journey to value-based care.,"In 2016, Dallas Nephrology Associates recognized that the economic, humanistic, and societal burden of end-stage kidney disease was unsustainable and the fee-for-service model of reimbursement did not support a value-based care approach. We decided to be proactive by creating new workflows, education, and disease management so that patients could make well-informed choices, ultimately resulting in better outcomes. Our shift toward value-based care focused on patient engagement, education, integrated infrastructure, collaboration, and monitoring of metrics associated with improved outcomes. Our practice invested millions of dollars in a population health division, which includes nurse navigators and data analysts focused on managing chronic kidney disease (CKD), delaying progression, and promoting transplantation and home-based dialysis. This retrospective review demonstrates improved outcomes, lower costs, and increased quality of care. Performance metrics have consistently met or exceeded targets. Seventy-three percent of patients now experience an optimal planned start to dialysis. Preemptive transplantation referrals have increased from 7% in 2017 to 61% through June 2023. Referral of patients with stage 4 CKD to educational workshops increased from 38% to 68%, and medical nutrition therapy referrals increased from 23% to 67%. Although reimbursement challenges persist, our commitment to improving care and slowing CKD progression remains steadfast. We emphasize teamwork, robust analytics, and continuous improvement. Future initiatives include encouraging patients receiving in-center hemodialysis to convert to home-based dialysis, addressing behavioral health, and focusing on preventable complications in high-risk patients. By embracing value-based models, we have demonstrated that a patient-centered approach can lead to improved outcomes and value for payers.",The American journal of managed care,2024-Dec,"Tommey B, Skluzacek P, Echols M, Phelps L, Shew M, Liang A",6,1893,nephrology,2025-11-22

The incidence of nephrolithiasis has been increasing, and the demographics have been evolving. Once viewed as a limited disease with intermittent exacerbations that are simply managed by urologists, nephrolithiasis is now recognized as a complex condition requiring thorough evaluation and multifaceted care. Kidney stones are frequently manifestations of underlying systemic medical conditions such as the metabolic syndrome, genetic disorders, or endocrinopathies. Analysis of urine chemistries and stone composition provide a window into pathogenesis and direct ancillary studies to uncover underlying diseases. These studies allow providers to devise individualized strategies to limit future stone events. Given its complexity, kidney stone disease is best addressed by a team led by nephrologists and urologists with input from multiple other health professionals including dietitians, endocrinologists, interventional radiologists, and endocrine surgeons. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we provide a case-based overview of nephrolithiasis, divided by the individual stone types.

It is cause and consequence of various comorbidities, including cardiovascular diseases. In parallel, common pathological conditions closely related to ageing and unhealthy dietary habits increase the risk of CKD development and progression, including type 2 diabetes and obesity. Among these, obesity is either independent risk factor for new onset kidney disease or accelerates the rate of decline of kidney function by multiple mechanisms. Therefore, the role of diets aimed at attaining weight loss in patients with obesity is clearly essential to prevent CKD as to slow disease progression. Various dietary approaches have been licensed for the medical dietary therapy in CKD, including low-protein diet and Mediterranean diet. Interestingly, emerging evidence also support the use of low-carbohydrate/ketogenic diet (LCD/KD) in these patients. More specifically, LCD/KDs may efficiently promote weight loss, improve metabolic parameters, and reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, resulting in a dietary strategy that act globally in managing collateral conditions that are directly and indirectly related to the kidney function.

We used the third iteration of the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas (ISN-GKHA) to highlight differences in funding and availability of hemodialysis accesses used for initiating HD across world regions. Survey questions were directed at understanding the funding modules for obtaining vascular access and types of accesses used to initiate dialysis.

Kidney disease is a non-communicable disease (NCD) and currently affects around 850 million people worldwide. One in ten adults has chronic kidney disease (CKD). The global burden of CKD is increasing, and is projected to become the 5th most common cause of years of life lost globally by 2040. CKD is a major cause of catastrophic health expenditure. The costs of dialysis and transplantation consume 2-3% of the annual healthcare budget in high-income countries. Crucially, kidney disease can be prevented and progression to end-stage kidney disease can be delayed with appropriate access to basic diagnostics and early treatment. This year World Kidney Day continues to raise awareness of the increasing burden of kidney diseases worldwide and to strive for kidney health for everyone, everywhere. During the pandemic with COVID 19 patients kidneys are also damaged, apart from the respiratory tract and other organs. It can lead to an increase in acute renal failure and consequent chronic kidney insufficiency, as well as number of deaths. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the renal function in each patient with COVID 19 virus. In the Republic of North Macedonia from 2006 to present day nephrologists and other medical personnel devoted to the early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of renal disease have participated in the activities of the World Kidney Day. These activities were supported by the Macedonian Society of Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation and Artificial Organs, the Department of Nephrology at the Medical Faculty, the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia, non-governmental nephrology organizations (NEFRON) and the media.

Combined use of qualitative and quantitative research methods in nephrology has increased over the last 10 years. In this review, we aim to advance the understanding of mixed-methods research within the kidney community. Qualitative and quantitative techniques provide different but noncompeting representations of what exists in the world; findings from qualitative research do not generalize to a large population, whereas those from quantitative research may not apply to individuals within the diverse and heterogeneous larger population. Mixed-methods research combines these complementary representations, allowing the strengths of each method to be combined and the strengths of 1 method to address the limitations of the other. Mixed-methods approaches can be used to: (i) gain a more complete understanding of a research problem, (ii) explain initial results from one method with results from another, (iii) generate instruments, for example, survey tools and interventions, (iv) evaluate services, and (v) optimize clinical trial design and delivery. There are 3 core mixed-methods designs: explanatory sequential, exploratory sequential, and convergent parallel, which can be combined. We discuss each design in turn before discussing analysis and integration of findings from the different methods.

Clinical medicine master's degree students who were trained in the Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from December 2015 to December 2021 were selected as the study objects. The selected students were divided into two groups: the LBL group comprised 16 graduate students who received the traditional LBL model from December 2015 to December 2018, and the CBL group comprised 18 graduate students who received the CBL teaching methods from January 2019 to December 2021. Both groups participated in the professional theoretical knowledge assessment, including objective and subjective questions and calculating the total score), and the examination of clinical skills communication ability, preparation of handling materials, anesthesia techniques, operational skills, aseptic techniques, and postoperative management), at the time of discharge from the department. The independent learning ability (self-management ability, information ability, and learning ability) of students of the two groups after teaching was then assessed, and the satisfaction of the two groups with their respective teaching mode (including satisfaction with the teaching format, teaching effectiveness, interest stimulation, independent learning and the improvement of teamwork ability) was assessed by the questionnaire on the degree of satisfaction of the two groups. The assessment scores of professional theoretical knowledge in the CBL group were significantly higher than those in the LBL group in objective questions, subjective questions, and total scores (P1 = .028; P2 = .036; P3 = .041). The CBL group scored higher than the LBL group in the assessment of communication skills, preparation of operative items, anesthesia technique, operative skills, aseptic technique, and postoperative handling skills, but the differences were not statistically significant (P1 = .071; P2 = .260; P3 = .184; P4 = .127; P5 = .352; P6 = .584). The self-management ability, information ability, and learning ability scores of students in the CBL group were significantly higher than those in the LBL group (P1 = .006; P2 = .013; P3 = .003).

Claims from the Medicare Part B Physician/Supplier Procedure Master File (a national Medicare database) for 2011-2021 were extracted using Current Procedural Terminology codes for PKB. Total volumes were compared by provider specialty. Non-facility reimbursement, work Relative Value Unit (RVU) non-facility practice expense RVU, and malpractice RVU were compared. Between 2011 and 2021, total volume of PKB by physicians and APPs increased from 30,753 to 34,090 (10.9%), with a peak of 37,882 in 2019 prior to the COVID 19 pandemic. Radiology performed the majority of procedures during the study period. Relative share for radiology increased from 67.6% to 81.1% while the relative share for internal medicine/nephrology decreased from 24.3% to 14.3%, accelerating between 2019 and 2020. Volume and relative share for APPs marginally increased (from 0.9% to 1.2%). Non-facility reimbursement decreased from $578.96 in 2010 to $568.76 in 2021 (1.7%), work RVU decreased from 2.63 to 2.38 (9.5%), non-facility practice expense RVU decreased from 14.10 to 13.71 (2.8%), and malpractice RVU decreased from 0.31 to 0.21 (32.3%). Volume and total share of PKB performed by radiology increased over the study period. Conversely, internal medicine/nephrology performed fewer kidney biopsies. Despite the expanding role for APPs in other image-guided procedures, very few PKBs were performed by APPs throughout the study period.

Survivors of critical illness and AKI experience poor kidney, cardiovascular and quality of life outcomes, along with increased mortality. Yet, many patients surviving AKI are unaware that there is a problem with their kidney health, and post-AKI nephrology follow-up occurs at very low rates. Although there is a paucity of evidence-based studies to guide post-AKI care, attention to risk factors such as hypertension and albuminuria are requisite. There are several ongoing or planned studies which are expected to help inform specific management in the future. Until then, a multidisciplinary approach is warranted to address areas such as quality of life, physical rehabilitation, dietary modifications, and medication reconciliation.",Advances in chronic kidney disease,2021-Jan,"Sohaney R, Heung M",2,882,nephrology,2025-11-22
34279209,The Link Between Conventional and Novel Anti-Cancer Therapeutics with Thrombotic Microangiopathy.,"Kidney disease associated with cancer and anti-cancer therapies has been increasingly recognized in the field of onco-nephrology. In particular, drug-induced nephrotoxicity has important implications since most chemotherapeutic agents have a nephrotoxic potential. Also, standard creatinine clearance methods used for the measurement of kidney function have been questioned in cancer patients due to factors like low muscle mass and poor nutritional status. Overestimations of the glomerular filtration rate, not only can increase the nephrotoxic potential of different agents, but also further limit the use of first-line therapies. This review covers specifically the drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy and its two pathophysiologic mechanisms which include immune or idiosyncratic reactions, and non-immune or dose-dependent ones. As novel cancer therapies are developed, it is paramount to pursue a better understanding of conventional and novel chemotherapeutic agents and their role in kidney disease.",Drug metabolism letters,2021-,"Cervantes CE, Kant S, Atta MG",3,1011,nephrology,2025-11-22

To date, no studies have specifically reported outcomes for these patients in Eastern Europe. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: We conducted a retrospective, unicentric study of consecutive newly diagnosed patients with MRKI in our tertiary nephrology service in Romania between 2015 and 2020; follow-up extended until 1 September 2022, covering a study period of 90 months. <i>Results</i>: We identified 89 consecutive patients with MRKI (median age 66 years, 38% male, median eGFR 5 mL/min). The majority of patients had arterial hypertension (71%) and systemic atherosclerosis (58%), and the most frequent clinical features at presentation were asthenia (75%) and bone pain (51%). Light-chain-restricted myeloma was the most common type (55%), with kappa free light chain being more frequent (53%). Among the patients, 81% presented with acute kidney injury (AKI), and 38% required hemodialysis at diagnosis. During the study period, 65% of the patients died, and hypoalbuminemia and the need for hemodialysis at diagnosis were significantly associated with mortality in multivariate analysis. <i>Conclusions</i>: Patients with MRKI who present to the nephrologist more frequently exhibit light chain restriction and most often present with AKI, with one-third requiring hemodialysis at diagnosis. Moreover, hypoalbuminemia and the initiation of hemodialysis at diagnosis were significantly associated with increased mortality.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2023-Jul,"Ștefan G, Cinca S, Chiriac C, Zugravu A, Stancu S",5,1677,nephrology,2025-11-22

The present study was designed to estimate the potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) through the prescription patterns provided to patients of the Nephrology Transplant Unit of Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty patients. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> 96 patients were included in the study. pDDIs among every combination of the prescribed drug were analyzed using the Thomson Reuters Micromedex. <i>Results:</i> We found 149 pDDIs making 2.16 interactions per prescription with incidence rates of 69.7%. Approximately 4.1% of interactions were of significant severity, 75.1% moderate severity, and 20.8% were classified as minor pDDIs. The most frequent interactions were found between iron and aluminum, calcium or magnesium-containing products (21.37%), calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers (8.96%); and aspirin and aluminum, calcium, or magnesium-containing products (7.58%). We identified 42 drug pairs with probability of clinical significance. The most commonly reported clinical outcomes of the pDDIs were hypo- or hypertension (39.24%), decreased drug efficacy (24.05%), and arrhythmia (9.49%). Aluminum, calcium, or magnesium-containing drug products (33.10%) constituted the primary class of drugs involved in interactions. <i>Conclusions:</i> This study showed pharmacodynamics (49%), pharmacokinetics (42.94%) interactions, polypharmacy and gender as determinant of pDDIs.

35368607,Setting Up and Expanding a Home Dialysis Program: Is There a Recipe for Success?,"Home dialysis modalities remain significantly underused in the United States despite similar overall survival in the modalities, and recent incentives to expand these modalities. Although the absolute number of patients using home modalities has grown, the proportion compared to in-center hemodialysis (ICHD) continues to remain quite low. Well known barriers to home dialysis utilization exist, and an organized and team-based approach is required to overcome these barriers. Herein, we describe our efforts at growing our home dialysis program at a large academic medical center, with the proportion of home dialysis patients growing from 12% to 21% over the past 9 years. We prioritized individualized education for patients and better training for physicians, with the help of existing resources, aimed at better utilization of home modalities; an example includes dedicated dialysis education classes taught twice monthly by an experienced nurse practitioner, as well as the utilization of the dialysis educator from a dialysis provider for inpatient education of patients with CKD. The nephrology fellowship curriculum was restructured with emphasis on home modalities, and participation in annual home dialysis conferences has been encouraged. For timely placement and troubleshooting of access for dialysis, we followed a complementary team approach using surgeons and interventional radiologists and nephrologists, driven by a standardized protocol developed at UAB, and comanaged by our access coordinators. A team-based approach, with emphasis on staff engagement and leadership opportunities for dialysis nurses as well as collaborative efforts from a team of clinical nephrologists and the dialysis provider helped maintain efficiency, kindle growth, and provide consistently high-quality clinical care in the home program. Lastly, efforts at reducing burden of disease such as decreased number of monthly visits as well as using innovative strategies, such as telenephrology and assisted PD and HHD, were instrumental in reducing attrition.",Kidney360,2020-Jun,"Ahmad M, Wallace EL, Jain G",3,2055,nephrology,2025-11-22

Several terms with similar meanings have been used in AKI and its dialysis modalities, causing confusion and disparities among patients, nephrologists, health institutions, private care companies, insurance companies and government entities. These disparities can impact medical care, hospital organization and care, as well as the funding and reimbursement of AKI-related procedures. Thus, consensual nomenclature and definitions were developed, including the definitions of AKI, acute kidney disease (AKD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Additionally, we addressed all dialysis modalities and extracorporeal procedures related to AKI, currently approved and available in the country.

Despite these benefits, patients still have very limited involvement in designing and conducting trials in nephrology. Many trials do not address research questions and outcomes that are important to patients, including patient-reported outcomes that reflect how patients feel and function. This limitation can undermine the relevance, reliability and value of trial-based evidence for decision-making in clinical practice and health policy. However, efforts to involve patients with kidney disease are increasing across all stages of the trial process from priority setting, to study design (including selection of outcomes and approaches to improve participant recruitment and retention) and dissemination and implementation of the findings.

A genetic test or kidney biopsy is necessary for a definite diagnosis of this disease, and an accurate diagnosis system for this disease is highly desired in each country. However, the current situation in Asian countries is not clear. Therefore, the tubular and inherited disease working group of the Asian Pediatric Nephrology Association (AsPNA) aimed to assess the current situation of diagnosis and treatment for Alport syndrome in Asia. The group conducted an online survey among the members of AsPNA in 2021-2022. Collected data included the number of patients for each inheritance mode, availability of gene tests or kidney biopsy, and treatment strategies for Alport syndrome. A total of 165 pediatric nephrologists from 22 countries in Asia participated. Gene test was available in 129 institutes (78%), but the cost was still expensive in most countries. Kidney biopsy was available in 87 institutes (53%); however, only 70 can access electron microscopy, and 42 can conduct type IV collagen α5 chain staining. Regarding treatment, 140 centers use renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (85%) for Alport syndrome patients. This study result might suggest that the system is underdeveloped enough to diagnose all Alport syndrome patients in most Asian countries. However, once diagnosed with Alport syndrome, most of them were treated with RAS inhibitors.

Therefore, prevention of renal dysfunction is an important treatment goal in the management of diabetes. The data of landmark cardiovascular outcome trials of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor showed profound reno-protective effects. The Korean Diabetes Association and the Korean Society of Nephrology reviewed clinical trials and performed meta-analysis to assess the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the preservation of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We limited the data of SGLT2 inhibitors which can be prescribed in Korea. Both eGFR value and its change from the baseline were significantly more preserved in the SGLT2 inhibitor treatment group compared to the control group after 156 weeks. However, some known adverse events were increased in SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, such as genital infection, diabetic ketoacidosis, and volume depletion. We recommend the long-term use SGLT2 inhibitor in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for attenuation of renal function decline. However, we cannot generalize our recommendation due to lack of long-term clinical trials testing reno-protective effects of every SGLT2 inhibitor in a broad range of patients with T2DM.

It collects epidemiological variables, contagion and diagnosis data, signs and symptoms, treatments and outcomes. It is an online registry. Patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the results of the PCR of the virus, carried out both in patients who had manifested compatible symptoms or had suspicious signs, as well as in those who had undergone screening after some contact acquainted with another patient. As of April 11, the Registry had data on 868 patients, from all the Autonomous Communities. The most represented form of RRT is in-center hemodialysis (ICH) followed by transplant patients. Symptoms are similar to the general population. A very high percentage (85%) required hospital admission, 8% in intensive care units. The most used treatments were hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir-ritonavir, and steroids. Mortality is high and reaches 23%; deceased patients were more frequently on ICH, developed pneumonia more frequently, and received less frequently lopinavir-ritonavir and steroids.

38769588,Global kidney health priorities-perspectives from the ISN-GKHA.,"Kidney diseases have become a global epidemic with significant public health impact. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is set to become the fifth largest cause of death by 2040, with major impacts on low-resource countries. This review is based on a recent report of the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas (ISN-GKHA) which uncovered gaps in key vehicles of kidney care delivery assessed using World Health Organization building blocks for health systems (financing, services delivery, workforce, access to essential medicines, health information systems and leadership/governance). High-income countries had more centres for kidney replacement therapies (KRT), higher KRT access, higher allocation of public funds to KRT, larger workforces, more health information systems, and higher government recognition of CKD and KRT as health priorities than low-income nations. Evidence identified from the current ISN-GKHA initiative should serve as template for generating and advancing policies and partnerships to address the global burden of kidney disease. The results provide opportunities for kidney health policymakers, nephrology leaders and organizations to initiate consultations to identify strategies for improving care delivery and access in equitable, resource-sensitive manners. Policies to increase use of public funding for kidney care, lower the cost of KRT and increase workforces should be a high priority in low-resource nations, while strategies that expand access to kidney care and maintain current status of care should be prioritized in high-income countries. In all countries, the perspectives of people with CKD should be exhaustively explored to identify core kidney care priorities.","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2024-Oct,"Okpechi IG, Luyckx VA, Tungsanga S, Ghimire A, Jha V, Johnson DW, Bello AK",7,1728,nephrology,2025-11-22

The questionnaire used to explore CKD knowledge consisted of 24 questions with 3 multiple-choice answers for each question: ""True,"" ""False,"" and ""I don't know."" Data were obtained from 185 patients who visited a nephrology clinic. The major study population was drawn from the western region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The participants' mean (SD) total renal disease knowledge scores was 12.56 (3.55) out of a maximum of 24 points on the renal disease knowledge assessment. This suggests that the participants, on average, exhibited a moderate level of knowledge regarding renal disease. Most respondents correctly answered questions related to blood and urine tests (90.3% and 89.7%, respectively), living with a single kidney (88.1%), kidney function in blood cleansing (83.8%), risk factors like diabetes (82.7%), and hypertension (80%). Additionally, they recognized symptoms such as water retention (85.9%) and fatigue (61.6%) and the potential of certain medications to slow chronic kidney disease progression (72.4%). However, fewer respondents correctly identified nausea/vomiting (31.4%) and loss of appetite (31.4%) as signs of kidney disease, the role of kidneys in maintaining blood pressure (58.9%) and bone health (16.2%), and obesity as a risk factor (54.1%). Furthermore, there were notable differences in knowledge scores between genders, with men scoring significantly higher than women (2.05, P = .041). In general, the understanding of CKD within the CKD patient community in the KSA was at a moderate level. However, male respondents had a greater understanding of CKD than did female respondents. The findings of this study indicate an urgent need to conduct educational activities to improve CKD knowledge among patients with CKD in the KSA.",Medicine,2024-Jun,Alobaidi S,1,2128,nephrology,2025-11-22
35459850,Artificial intelligence-enabled decision support in nephrology.,"Kidney pathophysiology is often complex, nonlinear and heterogeneous, which limits the utility of hypothetical-deductive reasoning and linear, statistical approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled decision support systems - which use algorithms based on learned examples - may have an important role in nephrology. Contemporary AI applications can accurately predict the onset of acute kidney injury before notable biochemical changes occur; can identify modifiable risk factors for chronic kidney disease onset and progression; can match or exceed human accuracy in recognizing renal tumours on imaging studies; and may augment prognostication and decision-making following renal transplantation. Future AI applications have the potential to make real-time, continuous recommendations for discrete actions and yield the greatest probability of achieving optimal kidney health outcomes. Realizing the clinical integration of AI applications will require cooperative, multidisciplinary commitment to ensure algorithm fairness, overcome barriers to clinical implementation, and build an AI-competent workforce. AI-enabled decision support should preserve the pre-eminence of wisdom and augment rather than replace human decision-making. By anchoring intuition with objective predictions and classifications, this approach should favour clinician intuition when it is honed by experience.",Nature reviews.

33565433,Causes of the delay in creating permanent vascular access in hemodialysis patients.,"Majority of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergo hemodialysis (HD) with central venous catheter which has multiple complications. This study aims to identify the physicians' perspectives regarding the reasons of delayed arteriovenous fistula (AVF) creation in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to improve the quality of CKD patients' care and prognosis and prevent complications. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on KSA nephrologists using a questionnaire which includes factors associated with delay in AVF creation, which were categorized into patient, physician, and hospital factors. The optimal timing of starting dialysis was also assessed. In a total of 212 participants, 131 (61.8%) were of consultant level, with the largest numbers being from the Central region (52.4%). The most important patient factors associated with delay in AVF creation were denial of kidney disease or the need of AVF (76.4%), dialysis fears and practical concern (75.9%), and patient refusal (73.1%). The most important physician and hospital factors were insufficient conduction of predialysis care and education (63.7%) and late referral to a nephrologist (56.6%). Participants would create AVF when the patient reaches Stage 4 CKD (69.3%) or Stage 5 (27.4%), and 88.7% of the participants would do so 3-6 months before the anticipated start of HD. Over two-thirds of the participants (68.4%) chose patient as the main factor contributing to the delay of permanent vascular access. A validated approach to patient selection, patient-centered predialysis care, and referral to vascular access creation that could be applied on different types of patients in different regions is required.","Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",2020-,"Alfarhan MA, Almatrafi SA, Alqaseer SM, Albkiry YA, AlSayyari A",5,1699,nephrology,2025-11-22
36924210,Pregnancy in end-stage kidney disease: Great news that needs to be handled carefully.,"Compared to women with normal kidney function, women with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are much less likely to become pregnant, but more likely to have a complicated pregnancy. While renal transplantation remains the best option for women who desire to have a child, pregnancy on dialysis should be considered an option for those who may not receive a transplant during their reproductive years. Many physicians do not encounter a pregnant patient with ESKD during their nephrology training, and may not feel prepared to provide care for such patients in a busy practice. In this paper, we briefly provide an overview of the most significant practical points related to management of a pregnant patient with ESKD through a real-life case with twin pregnancy. The two key elements in management of these patients would be an intensified hemodialysis regimen and a multidisciplinary team that can provide frequent, regular, and multifaceted assessments.",Hemodialysis international.

32721969,"Assessment of Hydration Status in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients: Validity, Prognostic Value, Strengths, and Limitations of Available Techniques.","The majority of patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) suffer from volume overload and this overhydration is associated with increased mortality. Thus, optimal assessment of volume status in PD is an issue of paramount importance. Patient symptoms and physical signs are often unreliable indexes of true hydration status. Over the past decades, a quest for a valid, reproducible, and easily applicable technique to assess hydration status is taking place. Among existing techniques, inferior vena cava diameter measurements with echocardiography and natriuretic peptides such as brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide were not extensively examined in PD populations; while having certain advantages, their interpretation are complicated by the underlying cardiac status and are not widely available. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) techniques are the most studied tool assessing volume overload in PD. Volume overload assessed with BIA has been associated with technique failure and increased mortality in observational studies, but the results of randomized trials on the value of BIA-based strategies to improve volume-related outcomes are contradictory. Lung ultrasound (US) is a recent technique with the ability to identify volume excess in the critical lung area. Preliminary evidence in PD showed that B-lines from lung US correlate with echocardiographic parameters but not with BIA measurements. This review presents the methods currently used to assess fluid status in PD patients and discusses existing data on their validity, applicability, limitations, and associations with intermediate and hard outcomes in this population. Key Message: No method has proved its value as an intervening tool affecting cardiovascular events, technique, and overall survival in PD patients. As BIA and lung US estimate fluid overload in different compartments of the body, they can be complementary tools for volume status assessment.",American journal of nephrology,2020-,"Alexandrou ME, Balafa O, Sarafidis P",3,1976,nephrology,2025-11-22

The aim of this study is to characterize the clinical features, severity, management, and outcomes of HUS patients. Retrospective study of HUS patients admitted to a Pediatric Nephrology Unit between 1996 and 2020. Demographic and clinical data regarding etiology, severity, treatment strategies, and patient outcome were collected. Twenty-nine patients with HUS were admitted to our unit, but four were excluded. Median age at diagnosis was two years (2 months - 17 years). Clinical manifestations included diarrhea, vomiting, oliguria, hypertension, and fever. During the acute phase, 14 patients (56%) required renal replacement therapy. Infectious etiology was identified in seven patients (five Escherichia coli and two Streptococcus pneumoniae). Since 2015, 2/7 patients were diagnosed with complement pathway dysregulation HUS and there were no cases of infectious etiology detected. Six of these patients received eculizumab. The global median follow-up was 6.5 years [3 months-19.8 years]. One patient died, seven had chronic kidney disease, four of whom underwent kidney transplantation, one relapsed, and seven had no sequelae. These results reflect the lack of infectious outbreaks in Portugal and the improvement on etiological identification since genetic testing was introduced. The majority of patients developed sequels and mortality was similar to that of other countries. HUS patients should be managed in centers with intensive care and pediatric nephrology with capacity for diagnosis, etiological investigation, and adequate treatment.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can have additional comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, which can add to the disease burden. The psychosocial or the mental component of the pediatric CKD patient is often overlooked by health care professionals due to a lack of resources and training in identifying psychological disorders. In addition, many components of kidney disease like fatigue from anemia and cognitive impairment make it difficult for the untrained physician to identify underlying psychological disorders.

We sent a genetic test on patients with atypical presentation of common kidney diseases, electrolytes derangements, and cystic kidney diseases. We were able to identify a gene variant contributing to patients' kidney disease in more than half of our cohort. We then showed that patients with ApoL1 risk allele have likely worse kidney disease, and we were able to confirm genetic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in 2 patients and avoid unnecessary immunosuppression. Genetic testing has also improved our operation to establish a polycystic kidney disease excellence center by confirming our diagnosis, especially in patients without a well-defined family history. In conclusion, utilizing genetic testing in a routine outpatient renal clinic did not cause any burden to either patients or nephrologists, with minimal administrative effort and no financial cost to our patients. We expect that genetic testing in the right setting should become routine in nephrology to achieve a patient-centered precision medicine with less invasive means of kidney disease diagnosis.",Clinical nephrology,2024-Jul,"Zhang J, Zeng W, Hamrahian S, Maarouf OH",4,1242,nephrology,2025-11-22

We explored the quality of kidney failure care delivery and the monitoring of quality indicators from data provided by an international survey of stakeholders from countries affiliated with the ISN from July to September 2022. One hundred and sixty seven countries participated in the survey, representing about 97.4% of the world's population. In countries where haemodialysis (HD) was available, 81% (n = 134) provided standard HD sessions (three times weekly for 3-4 h per session) to patients. Among countries with peritoneal dialysis (PD) services, 61% (n = 101) were able to provide standard PD care (3-4 exchanges per day). In high-income countries, 98% (n = 62) reported that >75% of centers regularly monitored dialysis water quality for bacteria compared to 28% (n = 5) of low-income countries (LICs).

To better understand these wide variations, we assessed different factors affecting countermeasure implementation rates and applied the capability, opportunity, motivation model of behaviour to describe their determinants. We undertook this international mixed methods study of increased depth and breadth to obtain more complete data and to better understand the resulting complex evidence. This study was conducted in 14 paediatric nephrology centres across 12 European countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 14 participants were paediatric nephrologists and EPDWG members from 12 European centres. 52 countermeasures clustered into eight response domains (access control, patient testing, personnel testing, personal protective equipment policy, patient cohorting, personnel cohorting, suspension of routine care, remote work) were categorised by implementation status, drivers (expert opinion, hospital regulations) and resource dependency. Governmental strictness and media attitude were independently assessed for each country and correlated with relevant countermeasure implementation factors. Implementation rates varied widely among response domains (median 49.5%, range 20%-71%) and centres (median 46%, range 31%-62%). Case loads were insufficient to explain response rate variability. Increasing case loads resulted in shifts from expert opinion-based to hospital regulation-based decisions to implement additional countermeasures despite increased resource dependency. Higher governmental strictness and positive media attitude towards countermeasure implementation were associated with higher implementation rates. COVID-19 countermeasure implementation by paediatric tertiary care centres did not reflect case loads but rather reflected heterogeneity of local rules and of perceived resources.

32710733,Impact of COVID-19 on Nephrology Patients: A Mechanistic Outlook for Pathogenesis of Acute Kidney Injury.,"Some research has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 has had effects on the various functions of the renal system. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a dangerous and broadly spread pathological illness. In this review, we emphasize that AKI can be a severe complication of COVID-19 and highlight the importance of assessing, defining, and reporting the course of AKI. The research team performed a literature review, searching relevant literature databases. We searched four databases, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI (Chinese Database), to identify studies reporting COVID-19. Articles published on or before May 10, 2020 were eligible for inclusion. We used the following search terms: ""Coronavirus"" or ""2019-nCoV"" or ""COVID-19"" or ""AKI"" or ""renal failure"" or ""nephrology"". This study was take place at Jouf University, Sakaka, Al-Jouf, Saudi Arabia. The review showed that AKI patients, who were susceptible to a cytokine storm, showed clinical deterioration. This result allowed the current research team to develop a hypothesis of a set of adverse events in COVID-19 that proposes the modification of inflammatory pathways by stimulation of nAChRα7. The stimulation could occur by way of IL-6 / JAK2 / STAT3 / SOCS3 and NF-κB (p65)/IL-18, which work together to induce AKI and increase overall renal-related diagnostic markers, such as plasma creatinine and tubular cell damage. In addition, the functioning of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway may be determined by nicotine. Pharmacological nicotine products are widely available, and their role in COVID-19-mediated AKI can be further evaluated. The research team concluded that the dysregulation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory system could explain most of the clinical features of severe COVID-19.",Alternative therapies in health and medicine,2020-Aug,"Saad Alharbi K, Al-Abbasi FA, Prasad Agrawal G, Sharma A, Kowti R, Kazmi I",6,1762,nephrology,2025-11-22

38705934,Consensus commentary and position of the Italian Society of Nephrology on KDIGO controversies conference on novel anemia therapies in chronic kidney disease.,"Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) are new drugs developed for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This class of drugs stimulates endogenous erythropoietin production and, at the same time, improves iron absorption and mobilization of iron stores (less evident with daprodustat, vadadustat and enarodustat). Several studies have been published in the last few years showing that these agents are not inferior to standard therapy in correcting anemia associated with CKD. The efficacy of HIF-PHIs is coupled with a safety profile comparable to that of standard erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) treatment. However, studies with HIF-PHIs were not long enough to definitively exclude the impact of new drugs on adverse events, such as cancer, death and possibly cardiovascular events, that usually occur after a long follow-up period. Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recently reported the conclusions of the Controversies Conference on HIF-PHIs held in 2021. The goal of the present position paper endorsed by the Italian Society of Nephrology is to better adapt the conclusions of the latest KDIGO Conference on HIF-PHIs to the Italian context by reviewing the efficacy and safety of HIF-PHIs as well as their use in subpopulations of interest as emerged from more recent publications not discussed during the KDIGO Conference.",Journal of nephrology,2024-Apr,"Locatelli F, Del Vecchio L, Esposito C, Gesualdo L, Grandaliano G, Ravera M, Minutolo R",7,1413,nephrology,2025-11-22
38082484,Prognostic Models in Nephrology: Where Do We Stand and Where Do We Go from Here? Mapping Out the Evidence in a Scoping Review.,"Prognostic models can strongly support individualized care provision and well-informed shared decision making. There has been an upsurge of prognostic research in the field of nephrology, but the uptake of prognostic models in clinical practice remains limited. Therefore, we map out the research field of prognostic models for kidney patients and provide directions on how to proceed from here. We performed a scoping review of studies developing, validating, or updating a prognostic model for patients with CKD. We searched all published models in PubMed and Embase and report predicted outcomes, methodological quality, and validation and/or updating efforts. We found 602 studies, of which 30.1% concerned CKD populations, 31.6% dialysis populations, and 38.4% kidney transplantation populations. The most frequently predicted outcomes were mortality ( n =129), kidney disease progression ( n =75), and kidney graft survival ( n =54). Most studies provided discrimination measures (80.4%), but much less showed calibration results (43.4%). Of the 415 development studies, 28.0% did not perform any validation and 57.6% performed only internal validation. Moreover, only 111 models (26.7%) were externally validated either in the development study itself or in an independent external validation study. Finally, in 45.8% of development studies no useable version of the model was reported. To conclude, many prognostic models have been developed for patients with CKD, mainly for outcomes related to kidney disease progression and patient/graft survival. To bridge the gap between prediction research and kidney patient care, patient-reported outcomes, methodological rigor, complete reporting of prognostic models, external validation, updating, and impact assessment urgently need more attention.",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,2024-Mar,"Milders J, Ramspek CL, Janse RJ, Bos WJW, Rotmans JI, Dekker FW, van Diepen M",7,1802,nephrology,2025-11-22
34074281,Adolescent and caregiver attitudes towards telemedicine use in pediatric nephrology.,"Telemedicine is increasingly utilized as an alternative to in person consultation. Current pandemic conditions are providing additional impetus to virtual care delivery. We compared both adolescent and caregiver (parent or guardian) attitudes towards telemedicine (here as tertiary center to remote health care location) as a crucial determinant of longer-term effectiveness. This qualitative research study analyzed transcribed structured telephone interviews with both 11-18 year-old pediatric nephrology patients and their caregivers and performed a quantitative analysis of patient demographics, disease factors and distance to tertiary center vs. telemedicine center. The study was conducted in a medium-sized tertiary pediatric nephrology centre with a large catchment area of over 0.5 million square kilometers and 629,000 children and adolescents under 18 years of age. Eleven dyads of adolescents and caregivers were enrolled. Five adolescents were male. The mean age of the adolescents was 14.4 ± 2.5 years (range 11.2-18.0). The median distance to our tertiary center was 191 km (range 110-1378 km). Four adolescents lived more than 500 km from our tertiary center. The 11 adolescents had a total of 334 in person visits (mean 30 ± 25) and 86 telemedicine visits (mean 8 ± 7). A ratio of 2:1 telemedicine to in-person visits was favored; with caregivers more in favor of remote care than adolescents. Qualitative analysis found that experiences with telemedicine were distinguished by consultation-specific factors and contextual factors. Contextual factors (travel/cost savings) were valued for telemedicine by adolescents and caregivers. Consultation-specific factors, such as the ability to show the doctor physical symptoms, were more valued during in-person consultations, especially by adolescents. The overall visit type preference was related to the nature of the consultation. For regular check-ups, and for adolescents with less complex needs, participants felt that telemedicine offered a comparable experience to in-person visits. Adolescents with more complex conditions preferred in-person visits. Indiscriminate transfer to chronic care predicated on mainly telemedicine approach is not compatible with user expressed attitudes (especially among adolescents). Accurately mapping models of care to these attitudes is an essential determinant of effective management and longer-term engagement with potentially life-long health challenges.",BMC health services research,2021-Jun,"Qiu Y, Coulson S, McIntyre CW, Wile B, Filler G",5,2463,nephrology,2025-11-22

To compare the effectiveness of sVLPD compared with LPD in patients regularly seen in tertiary nephrology care. Participants were patients with CKD stages 4-5, followed for at least 6 mo, randomly allocated to receive sVLPD or LPD [0.35 or 0.60 g/kg ideal body weight (IBW)/d, respectively], stratified by center and CKD stage. The primary outcome was time to renal death, defined as the first event between end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and all-cause mortality; secondary outcomes were the single components of the primary outcome, cardiovascular outcome, and nutritional status. We analyzed 223 patients (sVLPD, n = 107; LPD, n = 116). Mean age was 64 y, 61% were male, and 35% had diabetes. Median protein intake (PI), which was 0.8 g/kg IBW/d at baseline in both groups, was 0.83 and 0.60 g/kg IBW/d in LPD and sVLPD, respectively, during the trial with a large decrease only in sVLPD (P = 0.011). During a median of 74.2 mo, we recorded 180 renal deaths (141 dialysis and 39 deaths before dialysis). Risk of renal death did not differ in sVLPD compared with LPD (HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.57; P = 0.28). No difference was observed for ESRD (HR: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.56; P = 0.51), mortality (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.62, 1.45; P = 0.82), or time to fatal/nonfatal cardiovascular events (P = 0.2, log-rank test). After 36 mo, still active patients were 45 in sVLPD and 56 in LPD. No change of nutritional status emerged during the study in any arm. This long-term pragmatic trial found that in patients with CKD under stable nephrology care, adherence to protein restriction is low. Prescribing sVLPD compared with standard LPD is safe but does not provide additional advantage to the kidney or patient survival.",The American journal of clinical nutrition,2022-May,"Bellizzi V, Signoriello S, Minutolo R, Di Iorio B, Nazzaro P, Garofalo C, Calella P, Chiodini P, De Nicola L",9,1942,nephrology,2025-11-22

A retrospective study.,"The number of nephrologists has risen slowly, compared with the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Brazil. Data on patients referred to nephrology outpatient clinics remains scarce. To determine the demographic and kidney function characteristics of patients at their first appointment with a nephrologist. Retrospective study conducted at three nephrology outpatient clinics (public and private services), in São Paulo, Brazil. From December 2019 to February 2020, we collected patient data regarding demographics, kidney function parameters and comorbidities. We then analyzed data on 394 patients who met a nephrologist for their first appointment. The main comorbidities were hypertension (63.7%), diabetes (33.5%) and nephrolithiasis (22.3%). Regarding CKD stages, 24.1%, 9.1%, 13.7%, 15.2%, 15.2% and 2.3% of the patients were in stages 1, 2, 3a, 3b, 4 and 5, respectively. Proteinuria was absent or mild, moderate and high in 17.3%, 15.2% and 11.7%, respectively; and 16.2% had not undergone previous investigation of serum creatinine or proteinuria (55.8%). For 17.5%, referral to a nephrologist occurred late. Patients in public services were older than those in private services (59 years versus 51 years, respectively; P = 0.001), more frequently hypertensive (69.7% versus 57.5%; P = 0.01) and reached a nephrologist later (22.4% versus 12.4%; P = 0.009). Referrals to a nephrologist were not being made using any guidelines for CKD risk and many cases could have been managed within primary care.

35372874,Management of Hemodialysis Patients with Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 Infection: Perspective from the Spanish Nephrology.,"The recent SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has signified a significant effect on the health of the population worldwide. Patients on chronic RRT have been affected by the virus, and they are at higher risk due to the frequent comorbid conditions. Here, we show the results of the COVID-19 Registry of the Spanish Society of Nephrology during the first 6 weeks of the outbreak. This study is an analysis of the data recorded on a registry of patients with ESKD on RRT who tested positive for COVID-19. The aim was to evaluate clinical conditions, therapeutic management, and consequences, including outcome. The registry began on March 18th, 2020. It includes epidemiologic data, cause of CKD, signs and symptoms of the infection, treatments, and outcomes. Patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection on the basis of the results of PCR of the virus obtained from nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs. The tests were performed on symptomatic patients and on those who mentioned contact with infected patients. As of May 2, the registry included data on 1397 patients (in-center hemodialysis [IC-HD], 63%; kidney transplant [Tx], 34%; peritoneal dialysis [PD], 3%; and home hemodialysis, 0.3%). The mean age was 67±15 years, and two-thirds were men. Dialysis vintage was 46±41 months, and the time after transplantation was 59±54 months. Eighty-five percent of the patients required hospital admission, and 8% had to be transferred to intensive care units. Overall mortality was 25% (IC-HD, 27%; Tx, 23%; and PD, 15%), and significant proportions of deceased patients have advanced age, are on IC-HD, and presented pneumonia. Age and pneumonia were independently associated with the risk of death. SARS-CoV-2 infection affected a significant number of Spanish patients on RRT, mainly those on IC-HD. Hospitalization rates and mortality were high.

39602027,Clinical trial emulation in nephrology.,"Trial emulation, also known as target trial emulation, has significantly advanced epidemiology and causal inference by providing a robust framework for deriving causal relationships from observational data. This approach aims to reduce biases and confounding factors inherent in observational studies, thereby improving the validity of causal inferences. By designing observational studies to mimic randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as closely as possible, researchers can better control for confounding and bias. Key components of trial emulation include defining a clear time-zero, simulating random assignment using techniques like propensity score matching and inverse probability treatment weighting, assessing group comparability by standardized mean differences and establishing a clear comparison strategy. The increasing availability of large-scale real-world databases, such as research cohorts, patient registries, and hospital records, has driven the popularity of target trial emulation. These data sources offer information on patient outcomes, treatment patterns, and disease progression in real-world settings. By applying the principles of target trial emulation to these rich data sources, researchers can design studies that provide robust causal inferences about the effects of interventions, informing clinical guidelines and regulatory decisions. Despite its advantages, trial emulation faces challenges like data quality, unmeasured confounding, and implementation complexity. Future directions include integrating trial emulation with machine learning techniques and developing methods to address unmeasured confounding. Overall, trial emulation represents a significant advancement in epidemiology, offering a valuable tool for deriving accurate and reliable causal inferences from observational data, ultimately improving public health outcomes.",Journal of nephrology,2025-Jan,"Zoccali C, Tripepi G",2,1873,nephrology,2025-11-22
39289130,Core Patient-Reported Outcomes for Trials in Nephrology.,"The outcomes reported in trials across all stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are highly variable and often do not include outcomes that are directly relevant to patients and caregivers. Frequently, the outcomes reported in trials are often unvalidated surrogate biochemical end points. The omission of outcomes that are meaningful and important to patients can diminish the value of trials in supporting treatment decisions. In response, there have been increasing efforts across many health and medical disciplines to develop core outcome sets, defined as the minimum set of outcomes to be reported in all trials in a specific health area to improve the relevance and consistency of reporting trial outcomes. The international Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology (SONG) initiative was established in 2014 and has since developed seven core outcome sets for different diagnosis and treatment stages of CKD. The core outcomes were based on consensus among patients, caregivers, and health professionals. Each core outcome set includes at least one patient-reported outcome, including fatigue (hemodialysis), life participation (kidney transplantation, peritoneal dialysis, early CKD not yet requiring kidney replacement therapy, children and adolescents, and glomerular disease), and pain (polycystic kidney disease). This article outlines how patient-reported outcomes are currently reported in trials, discusses core patient-reported outcomes that have been established for trials in kidney disease, and outlines strategies for implementing core patient-reported outcomes in trials.",Seminars in nephrology,2024-,"Hughes A, Scholes-Robertson N, Ju A, Jauré A",4,1588,nephrology,2025-11-22

The objective of this study was to assess workforce capacity for kidney failure (KF) care across world countries and regions. Data were collected from published online sources and a survey was administered online to key stakeholders. All country-level data were analysed by International Society of Nephrology region and World Bank income classification. The general healthcare workforce varies by income level: high-income countries have more healthcare workers per 10 000 population (physicians: 30.3; nursing personnel: 79.2; pharmacists: 7.2; surgeons: 3.5) than low-income countries (physicians: 0.9; nursing personnel: 5.0; pharmacists: 0.1; surgeons: 0.03). A total of 160 countries responded to survey questions pertaining to the workforce for the management of patients with KF. The physicians primarily responsible for providing care to patients with KF are nephrologists in 92% of countries. Global nephrologist density is 10.0 per million population (pmp) and nephrology trainee density is 1.4 pmp. High-income countries reported the highest densities of nephrologists and nephrology trainees (23.2 pmp and 3.8 pmp, respectively), whereas low-income countries reported the lowest densities (0.2 pmp and 0.1 pmp, respectively). Low-income countries were most likely to report shortages of all types of healthcare providers, including nephrologists, surgeons, radiologists and nurses.

35931965,Disparities in dialysis modality decision-making using a social-ecological lens: a qualitative approach.,"Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) may choose to undergo dialysis in-center or at home, but uptake of home dialysis in the US has been minimal despite its benefits over in-center dialysis. Factors that may have led patients to select home dialysis over in-center dialysis are poorly understood in the literature, and interventions to improve selection of home dialysis have focused on patient knowledge and shared decision-making processes between patients and providers. The purpose of this study was to explore micro- and macro-level factors surrounding dialysis modality decision-making among patients undergoing in-center and home dialysis, and explore what leads patients to select home dialysis over in-center dialysis. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted in a dialysis clinic at a large Midwestern research hospital, from September 2019 to December 2020. Participants were 18 years or older, undergoing dialysis for ESKD, and had the cognitive ability to provide consent. Surveys assessing demographic and clinical information were administered to participants following their interviews. Forty patients completed interviews and surveys (20 [50%] in-center dialysis, 17 [43%] female, mean [SD] age, 59 [15.99] years). Qualitative findings suggested that healthcare access and engagement before entering nephrology care, after entering nephrology care, and following dialysis initiation influenced patients' awareness regarding their kidney disease status, progression toward ESKD, and dialysis options. Potential modifiers of these outcomes include race, ethnicity, and language barriers. Most participants adopted a passive-approach during decision-making. Finally, fatigue, concerns regarding one's dialyzing schedule, and problems with fistula/catheter access sites contributed to overall satisfaction with one's dialysis modality. Findings point to broader factors affecting dialysis selection, including healthcare access and racial/ethnic inequities. Providing dialysis information before entering nephrology and after dialysis initiation may improve patient agency in decision-making. Additional resources should be prioritized for patients of underrepresented backgrounds. Dialysis decision-making may be appropriately modeled under the social-ecological framework to inform future interventions.",BMC nephrology,2022-Aug,"Vélez-Bermúdez M, Adamowicz JL, Askelson NM, Lutgendorf SK, Fraer M, Christensen AJ",6,2340,nephrology,2025-11-22

While children are usually asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, children with pre-existing kidney conditions require specialized attention. This pivotal report, championed by the International Pediatric Nephrology Association (IPNA), delivers precise and actionable recommendations tailored for pediatric patients with kidney ailments in this pandemic landscape. Central to our findings are rigorous infection control protocols. These are particularly stringent in high-risk zones, emphasizing telehealth's indispensable role, the significance of curtailing in-person consultations, and the imperative of following rigorous guidelines in regions with heightened COVID-19 prevalence. Additionally, the report delves into vaccination approaches for children with kidney issues, highlighting that the choice of vaccine is often governed by regional accessibility and policy frameworks, rather than a universal preference.

34865609,"The history of peritoneal dialysis in China: past, present and future trends.","Peritoneal dialysis (PD) was introduced in China more than 60 years ago and has grown continuously since then. Now China leads the first of the world in number of patients on PD. In this manuscript a brief review of the history of peritoneal dialysis in China is presented; this includes a description of pioneers and their important contributions, discussion of peritoneal dialysate, the technique of the use of Tenckhoff catheter, the use of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and dialysis registration. Current ongoing PD research activities among Chinese PD academicians are also discussed. Finally, we present four areas of future focus: 1) the promotion of PD in rural areas where PD use is still very limited due to the lack of PD awareness and education; 2) PD quality management and continuous quality improvement (CQI) program particularly focusing on PD adequacy and patient rehabilitation; 3) development and enforcement of national standards on PD management; 4) multi-center studies to compare the benefits of PD and hemodialysis (HD) that should include survival, rehabilitation and cost-effectiveness.",Renal failure,2021-Dec,"Bi SH, Chen W, Wu JS, Wang T, Ahmad S",5,1131,nephrology,2025-11-22
36478499,Diagnostic and therapeutic management of vesico-ureteral reflux in pediatric kidney transplantation-Results of an online survey on behalf of the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology.,"Vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) is considered to be a risk factor for recurrent febrile urinary tract infections and impaired renal transplant survival. An online survey supported by the European Society for Paediatric Nephrology was designed to evaluate current management strategies of VUR in native and transplanted kidneys of recipients aged <18 years. Seventy-three pediatric transplant centers from 32 countries contributed to the survey. All centers performed urological evaluation prior to pediatric kidney transplantation (KTx) with subsequent interdisciplinary discussion. Screening for VUR in native kidneys (30% in all, 70% in selected patients) led to surgical intervention in 78% (11% in all, 89% in selected patients) with a decided preference of endoscopic intervention over ureterocystoneostomy. Following KTx, continuous antibiotic prophylaxis was applied in 65% of the patients and screening for allograft VUR performed in 93% of selected patients. The main management strategies of symptomatic allograft VUR were continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (83%) and surgical treatment (74%) (endoscopic intervention 55%, redo ureterocystoneostomy 26%). This survey demonstrates the high variability in the management of VUR in pediatric KTx recipients, points to knowledge gaps, and might serve as a starting point for improving the care for patients with VUR in native and transplanted kidneys.",Pediatric transplantation,2023-Mar,"Zirngibl M, Buder K, Luithle T, Tönshoff B, Weitz M",5,1403,nephrology,2025-11-22
31628564,Technical recommendations for clinical translation of renal MRI: a consensus project of the Cooperation in Science and Technology Action PARENCHIMA.,"The potential of renal MRI biomarkers has been increasingly recognised, but clinical translation requires more standardisation. The PARENCHIMA consensus project aims to develop and apply a process for generating technical recommendations on renal MRI. A task force was formed in July 2018 focused on five methods. A draft process for attaining consensus was distributed publicly for consultation and finalised at an open meeting (Prague, October 2018). Four expert panels completed surveys between October 2018 and March 2019, discussed results and refined the surveys at a face-to-face meeting (Aarhus, March 2019) and completed a second round (May 2019). A seven-stage process was defined: (1) formation of expert panels; (2) definition of the context of use; (3) literature review; (4) collection and comparison of MRI protocols; (5) consensus generation by an approximate Delphi method; (6) reporting of results in vendor-neutral and vendor-specific terms; (7) ongoing review and updating. Application of the process resulted in 166 consensus statements. The process generated meaningful technical recommendations across very different MRI methods, while allowing for improvement and refinement as open issues are resolved. The results are likely to be widely supported by the renal MRI community and thereby promote more harmonisation.","Magma (New York, N.Y.)",2020-Feb,"Mendichovszky I, Pullens P, Dekkers I, Nery F, Bane O, Pohlmann A, de Boer A, Ljimani A, Odudu A, Buchanan C, Sharma K, Laustsen C, Harteveld A, Golay X, Pedrosa I, Alsop D, Fain S, Caroli A, Prasad P, Francis S, Sigmund E, Fernández-Seara M, Sourbron S",23,1340,nephrology,2025-11-22
33835265,COVID-19 serology in nephrology healthcare workers.,"Chronic kidney disease patients show a high mortality in cases of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV‑2) infection. Thus, information on the sero-status of nephrology personnel might be crucial for patient protection; however, limited information exists about the presence of SARS-CoV‑2 antibodies in asymptomatic individuals. We examined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV‑2 IgG and IgM antibodies among healthcare workers of a tertiary care kidney center during the the first peak phase of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis in Austria using an orthogonal test strategy and a total of 12 commercial nucleocapsid protein or spike glycoprotein-based assays as well as Western blotting and a neutralization assay. At baseline 60 of 235 study participants (25.5%, 95% confidence interval, CI 20.4-31.5%) were judged to be borderline positive or positive for IgM or IgG using a high sensitivity/low specificity threshold in one test system. Follow-up analysis after about 2 weeks revealed IgG positivity in 12 (5.1%, 95% CI: 2.9-8.8%) and IgM positivity in 6 (2.6%, 95% CI: 1.1-5.6) in at least one assay. Of the healthcare workers 2.1% (95% CI: 0.8-5.0%) showed IgG nucleocapsid antibodies in at least 2 assays. By contrast, positive controls with proven COVID-19 showed antibody positivity among almost all test systems. Moreover, serum samples obtained from healthcare workers did not show SARS-CoV‑2 neutralizing capacity, in contrast to positive controls. Using a broad spectrum of antibody tests the present study revealed inconsistent results for SARS-CoV‑2 seroprevalence among asymptomatic individuals, while this was not the case among COVID-19 patients.

35614418,Bedside rationing and moral distress in nephrologists in sub- Saharan Africa.,"Kidney diseases constitute an important proportion of the non-communicable disease (NCD) burden in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), though prevention, diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases are less prioritized in public health budgets than other high-burden NCDs. Dialysis is not considered cost-effective, and for those patients accessing the limited service available, high out-of-pocket expenses are common and few continue care over time. This study assessed challenges faced by nephrologists in SSA who manage patients needing dialysis. The specific focus was to investigate if and how physicians respond to bedside rationing situations. A survey was conducted among a randomly selected group of nephrologists from SSA. The questionnaire was based on a previously validated survey instrument. A descriptive and narrative approach was used for analysis. Among 40 respondents, the majority saw patients weekly with acute kidney injury (AKI) or end-stage kidney failure (ESKF) in need of dialysis whom they could not dialyze. When dialysis was provided, clinical compromises were common, and 66% of nephrologists reported lack of basic diagnostics and medication and > 80% reported high out-of-pocket expenses for patients. Several patient-, disease- and institutional factors influenced who got access to dialysis. Patients' financial constraints and poor chances of survival limited the likelihood of receiving dialysis (reported by 79 and 78% of nephrologists respectively), while a patient's being the family bread-winner increased the likelihood (reported by 56%). Patient and institutional constraints resulted in most nephrologists (88%) frequently having to make difficult choices, sometimes having to choose between patients. Few reported existence of priority setting guidelines. Most nephrologists (74%) always, often or sometimes felt burdened by ethical dilemmas and worried about patients out of hospital hours. As a consequence, almost 46% of nephrologists reported frequently regretting their choice of profession and 26% had considered leaving the country. Nephrologists in SSA face harsh priority setting at the bedside without available guidance. The moral distress is high. While publicly funded dialysis treatment might not be prioritized in essential health care packages on the path to universal health coverage, the suffering of the patients, families and the providers must be acknowledged and addressed to increase fairness in these decisions.",BMC nephrology,2022-May,"Ashuntantang G, Miljeteig I, Luyckx VA",3,2469,nephrology,2025-11-22
38414130,Targeting the Kidneys at the Nanoscale: Nanotechnology in Nephrology.,"Kidney diseases, both acute and chronic, are a substantial burden on individual and public health, and they continue to increase in frequency. Despite this and an intense focus on the study of disease mechanisms, few new therapeutic approaches have extended to the clinic. This is in part due to poor pharmacology of many, if not most, therapeutics with respect to the sites of kidney disease within the glomerulus or nephron. Considering this, within the past decade, and more pointedly over the past 2 years, there have been substantial developments in nanoparticle systems to deliver therapeutics to the sites of kidney disease. Here, we provide a broad overview of the various classes of nanomaterials that have been developed to improve therapeutic development for kidney diseases, the strategy used to provide kidney accumulation, and briefly the disease models they focused on, if any. We then focus on one specific system, polymeric mesoscale nanoparticles, which has broadly been used over 13 publications, demonstrating targeting of the tubular epithelium with 26-fold specificity compared with other organs. While there have been several nanomedicines that have advanced to the clinic in the past several decades, including mRNA-based coronavirus disease vaccines and others, none have focused on kidney diseases specifically. In total, we are confident that the rapid advancement of nanoscale-based kidney targeting and a concerted focus by clinicians, scientists, engineers, and other stakeholders will push one or more of these technologies into clinical trials over the next decade.",Kidney360,2024-Apr,"Vasylaki A, Ghosh P, Jaimes EA, Williams RM",4,1597,nephrology,2025-11-22
37772459,'To improve quality of life': Diverging enactments of a value in nephrology clinical practices.,"Quality of life has become a central value in the provision of healthcare for patients with chronic conditions. This has engendered debates in critical medical sociology on the non-neutral effects that valuing health and illness, medical interventions, and health care delivery in terms of quality of life yields. Focusing on the case of nephrology, this paper presents qualitative data collected in Austria of two dialysis units in which nephrologists initiated projects aimed towards 'the improvement of patients' quality of life'. Whereas the first involved nurses supporting patients in the administration of peritoneal dialysis at home, the second implied the provision of treatment and care exclusively focused on a well-being 'in the here and now' to patients. By conceptualising physicians as actors within networks of relations and values enacted in practices, it analyses how in both dialysis units reference to quality of life enabled nephrologists to problematise the provision of standard haemodialysis treatment to multi-morbid, elderly patients, to develop a new treatment protocol, and to interest and enrol others in the provision of healthcare according this new protocol. Valuing medical interventions in terms of quality of life not only leads to a governmentalization of living and an economisation of health. It also allows physicians to articulate a socio-medico-ethical problem - the availability of life-prolonging technologies for a growing population of elderly, multi-morbid patients - and develop solutions locally. What the solutions consist in may fundamentally differ, however.","Health (London, England : 1997)",2024-Sep,Mann A,1,1609,nephrology,2025-11-22

A retrospective study included 18 neonates with HD (serum Na ≥150 mmol/L) hospitalized in the Department of Pediatrics and Nephrology between the years 2009-2019. The age at presentation was 7.5±4.7 days (range 2-18), weight loss was 15.9±8.3% (range 7.1-32.6) and serum Na range was 151- 192 mmol/L (median 155.5 mmol/L). In 12 (67%) neonates, breast or mixed fed, HD occurred due to inadequate milk intake, in 6 (33%) neonates feeding difficulties were secondary to an acute infection. There was positive correlation between serum Na level and percentage weight loss at presentation (r=0.88; p<0.001). In 6 (33%) patients serious complications of HD were found: AKI in 5 patients, convulsions in one. Percentage weight loss was significantly higher in neonates with HD-associated AKI than in neonates with HD without AKI (p<0.01). Serum Na level was marginally higher in neonates with AKI than in those without AKI (p=0.08). In univariate logistic regression analysis, higher percentage of weight loss and higher serum Na level at presentation were important diagnostic factors of AKI in neonates with HD (both p<0.05). ROC analysis determined good diagnostic profile only for percentage weight loss, with a best cut-off value of 24.8%, for predicting AKI in neonates with HD (AUC 0.862, sensitivity 80%, specificity 100%). Neonatal HD mostly occurs due to inadequate milk intake in breast or mixed fed babies, and rarely due to feeding difficulties in babies affected by an acute infection.

35564731,The Use of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Daily Clinical Practice of a Pediatric Nephrology Department.,"(1) Background: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is lower in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared to the general population. In 2011, the KLIK PROM portal was implemented in the Emma Children's Hospital to monitor and discuss HRQoL in daily care. This study describes and assesses the implementation and use of the KLIK PROM portal in the pediatric nephrology department. (2) Methods: CKD patients (self-report, if 8-18 years of age) and their parents (proxy-report, if 1-8 years) were invited to complete HRQoL patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs): TNO-AZL Preschool children Quality Of Life (TAPQOL) or Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory for Children (PedsQL). The PROMs were completed before and discussed during outpatient consultations. The adaptation rate-the proportion of patients/parents who were invited and completed at least one PROM-was calculated. Reported HRQoL scores of CKD patients were compared to the general population. (3) Results: In total, 142 patients (proxy- and self-report) were invited, 112 patients completed at least one PROM (adaptation rate 79%). Patients (<i>n</i> = 84 with informed consent for scientific use) with CKD reported lower HRQoL and HRQoL was more often impaired compared to the general Dutch population.

33418012,Diagnosis and Management of Renal Cystic Disease of the Newborn: Core Curriculum 2021.,"Renal cystic disease encompasses a large variety of illnesses with various phenotypic expressions that can manifest in utero, in infancy, and in childhood. These diseases may be unilateral or bilateral and present with single or multiple cysts. Various cystic diseases may also progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD), including kidney failure, and hepatic disease, thus potentially being life threatening. The prevalence and serious complications of CKD in the pediatric population make it vital that health care providers detect these conditions early and provide effective management. This installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology discusses various genetic and sporadic kidney cystic diseases, including multicystic dysplastic kidney, nephronophthisis, cystic dysplasia, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-β (HNF1-β) nephropathy, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Meckel-Gruber syndrome, Zellweger syndrome, calyceal diverticulum, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

38095483,Onconephrology: mitigation of renal injury in chemotherapy administration.,"Onconephrology was first coined as a name for the intersection of cancer medicine and nephrology in the early 2010s. It was recognized then that beyond and understanding of kidney physiology, a new generation of nephrologists skilled in both molecular biology and precision medicine were needed to deal with the challenges of emerging cancer therapies. Stem cell transplants, biologic agents, adjuvants blocking basic cellular signaling pathways, immunotherapy were found to promote novel anticancer outcomes, but also to pose new risks to the kidneys. The field rapidly overlapped with emerging expertise in vascular glomerular disease, glomerular disease, and the same biologic agents now applied to auto immune systemic and kidney diseases. Many categories of chemotherapeutic agents have been discovered to have adverse renal side effects. In this review, we address classic chemotherapeutic nephrotoxicity and oncologic clinical situations leading to acute kidney injury. We also review the frontiers of nephrotoxicity reported with cell cycle inhibitors, diverse classes of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, anticancer vaccines, and thrombotic microangiopathies triggered by malignancy and chemotherapy. The aim will be to focus on published strategies to mitigate nephrotoxicity. As onconephrology expands into its own field, it gives birth to new subdisciplines. An understanding that patient populations want the benefits of chemotherapy without the renal (and other) systemic toxicities is emerging. A need to develop a new class of molecular and genetic experts in onconephrology to mitigate nephrotoxicity from chemotherapy is apparent and urgent.",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,2024-Mar,"Selamet U, Ahdoot RS, Salasnek R, Abdelnour L, Hanna RM",5,1725,nephrology,2025-11-22
35628528,Precision Nephrology in Patients with Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease.,"Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure and specifically, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) occurs in up to 30% of all diabetic patients. Kidney disease attributed to diabetes is a major contributor to the global burden of the disease in terms of clinical and socio-economic impact, not only because of the risk of progression to End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD), but also because of the associated increase in cardiovascular (CV) risk. Despite the introduction of novel treatments that allow us to reduce the risk of future outcomes, a striking residual cardiorenal risk has been reported. This risk is explained by both the heterogeneity of DKD and the individual variability in response to nephroprotective treatments. Strategies that have been proposed to improve DKD patient care are to develop novel biomarkers that classify with greater accuracy patients with respect to their future risk (prognostic) and biomarkers that are able to predict the response to nephroprotective treatment (predictive). In this review, we summarize the principal prognostic biomarkers of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and the novel markers that help clinicians to individualize treatments and the basis of the characteristics that predict an optimal response.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022-May,"Provenzano M, Maritati F, Abenavoli C, Bini C, Corradetti V, La Manna G, Comai G",7,1245,nephrology,2025-11-22

It may also be associated with worse outcomes. The aim of the study was to assess the effect of referral time on the outcomes, such as number of hospitalizations, length of stay, kidney transplantation, and mortality. A study of 1303 patients with end-stage renal failure admitted for dialysis in the same period in Fresenius Nephrocare Poland dialysis centers was initiated. The type of vascular access during the first dialysis was accepted as the criterion differentiating LR (<i>n</i> = 457 with acute catheter) from early referral (ER; <i>n</i> = 846). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of death during the 13-month observation. By the end of observation, 341 (26.2%) of patients died. The frequency of death was 18.1 for ER and 37.9 for LR per 1000 patient-months. It can be estimated that 52.1% (95% CI: 40.5-61.5%) of the 341 deaths were caused by belonging to the LR group. Patients from LR group had longer hospitalizations, more malignancies, lower rate of vascular access in the form of a-v fistula, higher comorbidity index.

33713333,Nomenclature in nephrology: preserving 'renal' and 'nephro' in the glossary of kidney health and disease.,"A recently published nomenclature by a ""Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes"" (KDIGO) Consensus Conference suggested that the word ""kidney"" should be used in medical writings instead of ""renal"" or ""nephro"" when referring to kidney disease and kidney health. Whereas the decade-old move to use ""kidney"" more frequently should be supported when communicating with the public-at-large, such as the World Kidney Day, or in English speaking countries in communications with patients, care-partners, and non-medical persons, our point of view is that ""renal"" or ""nephro"" should not be removed from scientific and technical writings. Instead, the terms can coexist and be used in their relevant contexts. Cardiologists use ""heart"" and ""cardio"" as appropriate such as ""heart failure"" and ""cardiac care units"" and have not replaced ""cardiovascular"" with ""heartvessel"", for instance. Likewise, in nephrology, we consider that ""chronic kidney disease"" and ""continuous renal replacement therapy"" should coexist. We suggest that in scientific writings and technical communications, the words ""renal"" and ""nephro"" and their derivatives are more appropriate and should be freely used without any pressure by medical journals to compel patients, care-partners, healthcare providers, researchers and other stakeholders to change their selected words and terminologies. We call to embrace the terms ""kidney"", ""renal"" and ""nephro"" as they are used in different contexts and ask that scientific and medical journals not impose terminology restrictions for kidney disease and kidney health.

32560781,Quality Appraisal and Assurance Techniques for Free Open Access Medical Education (FOAM) Resources: A Rapid Review.,"Free open access medical education (FOAM) has disrupted traditional modes of knowledge translation and dissemination. These are popular resources with a wide educational reach. Nephrology has been a leader in FOAM, but many skeptics still question the accuracy and reliability of this content. Recently, quality-assurance techniques have been developed to address these concerns. These techniques may be helpful for readers to appraise the online literature and for institutions to reward the production of high-quality open educational resources. We performed a rapid review of the literature. A medical librarian conducted a systematic search of the Medline and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases. Two independent assessors screened and selected articles, performed a hand-search of reference lists, and scored articles on their quality using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument. Thirteen reports were included for the final descriptive analysis. We identified 10 quality-assessment techniques, and 4 of them having been validated. The quality of the reports was fairly high, with an average Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument score of 11.5 of 18 (SD, 2.3; range, 7.25-14.25). The calculated Cronbach α was 0.85. There is burgeoning literature on the topic of critical appraisal of open educational resources, and, more specifically, FOAM resources. Many of the techniques used are of varying quality and developed with different intended uses and audiences. By continuing to refine these tools, we can continue not only to support and legitimize the FOAM movement, but also foster individual critical appraisal skills that increasingly are necessary in this age of information.",Seminars in nephrology,2020-May,"Ting DK, Boreskie P, Luckett-Gatopoulos S, Gysel L, Lanktree MB, Chan TM",6,1749,nephrology,2025-11-22
38018697,Global variability of vascular and peritoneal access for chronic dialysis.,"Vascular and peritoneal access are essential elements for sustainability of chronic dialysis programs. Data on availability, patterns of use, funding models, and workforce for vascular and peritoneal accesses for dialysis at a global scale is limited. An electronic survey of national leaders of nephrology societies, consumer representative organizations, and policymakers was conducted from July to September 2018. Questions focused on types of accesses used to initiate dialysis, funding for services, and availability of providers for access creation. Data from 167 countries were available. In 31 countries (25% of surveyed countries), >75% of patients initiated haemodialysis (HD) with a temporary catheter. Seven countries (5% of surveyed countries) had >75% of patients initiating HD with arteriovenous fistulas or grafts. Seven countries (5% of surveyed countries) had >75% of their patients starting HD with tunnelled dialysis catheters. 57% of low-income countries (LICs) had >75% of their patients initiating HD with a temporary catheter compared to 5% of high-income countries (HICs). Shortages of surgeons to create vascular access were reported in 91% of LIC compared to 46% in HIC. Approximately 95% of participating countries in the LIC category reported shortages of surgeons for peritoneal dialysis (PD) access compared to 26% in HIC. Public funding was available for central venous catheters, fistula/graft creation, and PD catheter surgery in 57%, 54% and 54% of countries, respectively.

This is a prospective interventional study was conducted from November 2015 up to October 2016 in the Critical Care Nephrology and Dialysis Unit of Dhaka Shishu (Children) Hospital, Bangladesh. A total of 45 children with hypernatremia and AKI were evaluated. Patients were treated by the calculated amount of dextrose in normal saline mixed with various dilutions of 3% NaCl with a difference of serum to infusate sodium concentration around 10 mEq/L as per the American Academy of Pediatrics - 2005. Intermittent peritoneal dialysis was done when in the failure stage of AKI or when serum sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) >180 mEq/L. Depending on the outcome samples were divided into survival and death groups. Data were processed by software STATA 13 and analysis was done by one-way ANOVA, Tukey test, Chi-square test, F-test, and Student's t-test. Age ranged from one month to 6½ years and 91% were infants. Total 64% of patients were in the failure stage of AKI and majority were in the death group, 31% in injury and 4.4% patient in the risk stage. Out of 45 cases, 30 (67%) had severe hypernatremia. Significant reduction of serum Na+ was found and the rate of decline between days was optimum (8.4 mmol/L/day). Overall 60% survived with normal renal functions and 40% died. The calculated amount of dextrose in normal saline mixed with various dilutions of 3% NaCl is safe in severe hypernatremic dehydration with AKI.","Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",2021-,"Shireen A, Tahmina F, Farhana Y, Umme T, Sukriti B, Hossain MK",6,1657,nephrology,2025-11-22
33877358,Predictive effect of salt intake on patient and kidney survival in non-dialysis CKD: competing risk analysis in older versus younger patients under nephrology care.,"The optimal level of salt intake remains ill-defined in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients under regular nephrology care. This unanswered question becomes critical in older patients who are exposed to higher risk of worsening of cardiorenal disease due to volemic changes. In this pooled analysis of four prospective studies in CKD, we compared the risk of all-cause mortality and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) between patients ≤65 and >65 years of age stratified by salt intake level (<6, 6-8 and >8 g/day) estimated from two measurements of 24-h urinary sodium. The cohort included 1785 patients. The estimated glomerular filtration rate was 37 ± 21 mL/min/1.73 m2 overall, 41 ± 25 in younger patients and 34 ± 16 in older patients (P < 0.001). The median 24-h urinary sodium excretion was 143 mEq [interquartile range (IQR) 109-182] in all, 147 (112-185) in younger patients and 140 (106-179) in older patients (P = 0.012). Salt intake was ≤6, 6-8 and >8 g sodium chloride/day in 21.9, 26.2 and 52.0% of older patients and 18.6, 25.2 and 56.2% in younger patients, respectively (P = 0.145). During a median follow-up of 4.07 years we registered 383 ESKD and 260 all-cause deaths. In the whole cohort, the risks of ESKD and all-cause death did not differ by salt intake level. In older patients, ESKD risk [multi-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI)] was significantly lower at salt intakes of 6-8 g/day [HR 0.577 (95% CI 0.361-0.924)] and >8 g/day [HR 0.564 (95% CI 0.382-0.833)] versus the reference group (<6 g/day). Mortality risk was higher in older versus younger patients, with no difference across salt intake categories. No effect of salt intake on ESKD and mortality was observed in younger patients. CKD patients under nephrology care show a moderate salt intake (8.4 g/day) that is lower in older versus younger patients. In this context, older patients are not exposed to higher mortality across different levels of salt intake, while salt intake <6 g/day poses a greater risk of ESKD.","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2021-Dec,"Garofalo C, Provenzano M, Andreucci M, Pisani A, De Nicola L, Conte G, Borrelli S",7,2041,nephrology,2025-11-22
37861193,Adults are just big kids: pediatric considerations for adult critical care nephrology.,"In recent years, there has been growing attention to pediatric kidney health, especially pediatric acute kidney injury (AKI). However, there has been limited focus on the role of pediatric AKI on adult kidney health, specifically considerations for the critical care physician. We summarize what is known in the field of pediatric AKI to inform adult medical care including factors throughout the early life course, including perinatal, neonatal, and pediatric exposures that impact survivor care later in adulthood. The number of pediatric AKI survivors continues to increase, leading to a higher burden of chronic kidney disease and other long-term co-morbidities later in life. Adult medical providers should consider pediatric history and illnesses to inform the care they provide. Such knowledge may help internists, nephrologists, and intensivists alike to improve risk stratification, including a lower threshold for monitoring for AKI and kidney dysfunction in their patients.",Current opinion in critical care,2023-Dec,"Starr MC, Gilley SP, See EJ, Slagle C, Soranno DE",5,984,nephrology,2025-11-22

Accordingly, the National Kidney Foundation hosted an in-person, one and a half-day workshop that convened a multidisciplinary group of physicians, allied health care professionals, and pediatric patients with CKD and their parents, with the goal of developing key clinical recommendations regarding best practices for the clinical management of pediatric patients living with CKD. The key clinical recommendations pertained to 5 broad topics: addressing the needs of patients and parents/caregivers; modifying the progression of CKD; clinical management of CKD-mineral and bone disorder and growth retardation; clinical management of anemia, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension; and transition and transfer of pediatric patients to adult nephrology care.

35829911,Ethiopia's Tigray War: the agony of survival in kidney transplant recipients.,"A war between the Ethiopian federal government and Tigray regional government broke out on November 4, 2020 and is still ongoing. Regardless of the cause of the war, the civilian populations, who have no agency in the fighting, have often been at the receiving end of atrocities. Eight months into the war, a siege was imposed in Tigray, barring the entry of all forms of humanitarian aid, including food and medicines. As a result, civilians who survived hostilities are dying from hunger and diseases due to the blockade which has been put in place. One particular group of patients whose survival is at stake encompasses those with end-stage kidney disease, including kidney transplant recipients. The leading challenges of providing care to this group of patients amidst war and blockade include a barely functioning dialysis service, due to dwindling supplies, lack of access to the country's kidney transplant center in Addis Ababa, and severe shortages of immunosuppressive medications. To put this into perspective, we report on a 45-year-old female recipient of a kidney transplant at St. Paul's Hospital in Addis Ababa who succumbed in the besieged Tigray region as a result of lack of access to her transplant medicines. We urgently call upon the international nephrology societies and kidney transplant associations to advocate access to immunosuppressive medications for kidney transplant recipients in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia, to avert additional catastrophic events like the reported one.",Journal of nephrology,2022-Sep,"Berhe E, Kidu M, Teka H",3,1505,nephrology,2025-11-22

Patients with cancer, particularly those with hematological malignancies such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma, are at increased risk of developing acute kidney injury and CKD. On the other hand, emerging evidence from large observational registry analyses have consistently shown that cancer risk is increased by at least 2- to 3-fold in kidney transplant recipients, and the observed increased risk occurs not only in those who have received kidney transplants but also in those on dialysis and with mild- to moderate-stage CKD. The interactions between cancer and CKD have raised major therapeutic and clinical challenges in the management of these patients. Given the magnitude of the problem and uncertainties, and current controversies within the existing evidence, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) assembled a global panel of multidisciplinary clinical and scientific expertise for a controversies conference on onco-nephrology to identify key management issues in nephrology relevant to patients with malignancy.

We evaluated multinational practice patterns for lipid management in patients with advanced CKD under nephrology care. We analyzed lipid-lowering therapy (LLT), LDL- cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and nephrologist-specified LDL-C goal upper limits in adult patients with eGFR < 60 ml/min from nephrology clinics in Brazil, France, Germany, and the United States (2014-2019). Models were adjusted for CKD stage, country, cardiovascular risk indicators, sex, and age. LLT treatment differed significantly by country, from 51% in Germany to 61% in the US and France (p = 0.002) for statin monotherapy. For ezetimibe with or without statins, the prevalence was 0.3% in Brazil to 9% in France (< 0.001). Compared with patients not taking lipid-lowering therapy, LDL-C was lower among treated patients (p < 0.0001) and differed significantly by country (p < 0.0001). At the patient level, the LDL-C levels and statin prescription did not vary significantly by CKD stage (p = 0.09 LDL-C and p = 0.24 statin use). Between 7-23% of untreated patients in each country had LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL. Only 7-17% of nephrologists believed that LDL-C should be < 70 mg/dL. There is substantial variation in practice patterns regarding LLT across countries but not across CKD stages.

34138495,Appraising prediction research: a guide and meta-review on bias and applicability assessment using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST).,"Over the past few years, a large number of prediction models have been published, often of poor methodological quality. Seemingly objective and straightforward, prediction models provide a risk estimate for the outcome of interest, usually based on readily available clinical information. Yet, using models of substandard methodological rigour, especially without external validation, may result in incorrect risk estimates and consequently misclassification. To assess and combat bias in prediction research the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST) was published in 2019. This risk of bias (ROB) tool includes four domains and 20 signalling questions highlighting methodological flaws, and provides guidance in assessing the applicability of the model. In this paper, the PROBAST will be discussed, along with an in-depth review of two commonly encountered pitfalls in prediction modelling that may induce bias: overfitting and composite endpoints. We illustrate the prevalence of potential bias in prediction models with a meta-review of 50 systematic reviews that used the PROBAST to appraise their included studies, thus including 1510 different studies on 2104 prediction models. All domains showed an unclear or high ROB; these results were markedly stable over time, highlighting the urgent need for attention on bias in prediction research. This article aims to do just that by providing (1) the clinician with tools to evaluate the (methodological) quality of a clinical prediction model, (2) the researcher working on a review with methods to appraise the included models, and (3) the researcher developing a model with suggestions to improve model quality.","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2021-Dec,"de Jong Y, Ramspek CL, Zoccali C, Jager KJ, Dekker FW, van Diepen M",6,1686,nephrology,2025-11-22

Over the past decades, several extracorporeal blood purification therapies have been developed for both sepsis and sepsis-associated acute kidney injury management. Despite the widespread use of extracorporeal blood purification therapies in clinical practice, it is still unclear when to start this kind of treatment and how to define its efficacy. Indeed, several questions on sepsis-associated acute kidney injury and extracorporeal blood purification therapy still remain unresolved, including the indications and timing of renal replacement therapy in patients with septic vs. non-septic acute kidney injury, the optimal dialysis dose for renal replacement therapy modalities in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury patients, and the rationale for using extracorporeal blood purification therapies in septic patients without acute kidney injury. Moreover, the development of novel extracorporeal blood purification therapies, including those based on the use of adsorption devices, raised the attention of the scientific community both on the clearance of specific mediators released by microorganisms and by injured cells and potentially involved in the pathogenic mechanisms of organ dysfunction including sepsis-associated acute kidney injury, and on antibiotic removal. Based on these considerations, the joint commission of the Italian Society of Anesthesiology and Critical Care (SIAARTI) and the Italian Society of Nephrology (SIN) herein addressed some of these issues, proposed some recommendations for clinical practice and developed a common framework for future clinical research in this field.",Journal of nephrology,2023-Sep,"De Rosa S, Marengo M, Fiorentino M, Fanelli V, Brienza N, Fiaccadori E, Grasselli G, Morabito S, Pota V, Romagnoli S, Valente F, Cantaluppi V",12,1786,nephrology,2025-11-22
36376072,Potential impact of NICE guidelines on referrals from primary care to nephrology: a primary care database and prospective research study.,"National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2021 guidelines on chronic kidney disease (CKD) recommend the use of the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE), which includes measurement of albuminuria. The equation to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has also been updated. To investigate the impact of the use of KFRE and the updated eGFR equation on CKD diagnosis (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) in primary care and potential referrals to nephrology. Primary care database (Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank [SAIL]) and prospective cohort study (UK Biobank) using data available between 2013 and 2020. CKD diagnosis rates were assessed when using the updated eGFR equation. Among people with eGFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> the following groups were identified: those with annual albuminuria testing and those who met nephrology referral criteria because of: a) accelerated eGFR decline or significant albuminuria; b) eGFR decline <30 mL/ min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> only; and c) KFRE >5% only. Analyses were stratified by ethnicity in UK Biobank. Using the updated eGFR equation resulted in a 1.2-fold fall in new CKD diagnoses in the predominantly White population in SAIL, whereas CKD prevalence rose by 1.9-fold among Black participants in UK Biobank. Rates of albuminuria testing have been consistently below 30% since 2015. In 2019, using KFRE >5% identified 182/61 721 (0.3%) patients at high risk of CKD progression before their eGFR declined and 361/61 721 (0.6%) low-risk patients who were no longer eligible for referral. Ethnic groups 'Asian' and 'other' had disproportionately raised KFREs. Application of KFRE criteria in primary care will lead to referral of more patients at elevated risk of kidney failure (particularly among minority ethnic groups) and fewer low-risk patients.

This study aimed to explore the experiences of COVID-19 with renal healthcare practitioners during the first global lockdown between June 2020 and September 2020. A multi-methods approach was carried out including a quantitative survey and qualitative interviews. This was a multinational study of renal healthcare practitioners from 29 countries. Quantitative: A self-designed survey on COVID-19 experiences and standardised questionnaires (General Health Questionnaire-12; Maslach Burnout Inventory). Descriptive statistics were generated for numerical data. Qualitative: Online semi-structured interviews were conducted. Data was subjected to thematic analysis. Renal healthcare practitioners (n = 251) completed an online survey. Thirteen renal healthcare practitioners took part in semi-structured interviews (12 nurses and 1 dietician). The majority of participants surveyed were female (86.9 %; n = 218), nurses (86.9 %; n = 218) with an average 21.5 (SD = 11.1) years' experience since professional qualification, and 16.3 years (SD = 9.3) working in renal healthcare. Survey responses indicated a level of preparedness, training and satisfactory personal protective equipment during the pandemic however approximately 40.3 % experienced fear about attending work, and 49.8 % experienced mental health distress. The highest prevalence of burnout was emotional exhaustion (35.9 %). Three themes emerged from the qualitative analysis highlighting the holistic complexities in managing renal healthcare, a neglected specialist workforce, and the need for appropriate support at work during a pandemic. Results have highlighted the psychological impact, in terms of emotional exhaustion and mental health distress in our sample of renal healthcare practitioners. As the pandemic has continued, it is important to consider the long-term impact on an already stretched workforce including the risk of developing mental health disorders.

35732395,Optimising transitions of care for acute kidney injury survivors: protocol for a mixed-methods study of nephrologist and primary care provider recommendations.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects nearly 20% of all hospitalised patients and is associated with poor outcomes. Long-term complications can be partially attributed to gaps in kidney-focused care and education during transitions. Building capacity across the healthcare spectrum by engaging a broad network of multidisciplinary providers to facilitate optimal follow-up care represents an important mechanism to address this existing care gap. Key participants include nephrologists and primary care providers and in-depth study of each specialty's approach to post-AKI care is essential to optimise care processes and healthcare delivery for AKI survivors. This explanatory sequential mixed-methods study uses survey and interview methodology to assess nephrologist and primary care provider recommendations for post-AKI care, including KAMPS (kidney function assessment, awareness and education, medication review, blood pressure monitoring and sick day education) elements of follow-up, the role of multispecialty collaboration, and views on care process-specific and patient-specific factors influencing healthcare delivery. Nephrologists and primary care providers will be surveyed to assess recommendations and clinical decision-making in the context of post-AKI care. Descriptive statistics and the Pearson's χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher's exact test will be used to compare results between groups. This will be followed by semistructured interviews to gather rich, qualitative data that explains and/or connects results from the quantitative survey. Both deductive analysis and inductive analysis will occur to identify and compare themes. This study has been reviewed and deemed exempt by the Institutional Review Board at Mayo Clinic (IRB 20-0 08 793). The study was deemed exempt due to the sole use of survey and interview methodology.

34316720,Progress toward the Clinical Application of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells and Other Disease-Modulating Regenerative Therapies: Examples from the Field of Nephrology.,"Drawing from basic knowledge of stem-cell biology, embryonic development, wound healing, and aging, regenerative medicine seeks to develop therapeutic strategies that complement or replace conventional treatments by actively repairing diseased tissue or generating new organs and tissues. Among the various clinical-translational strategies within the field of regenerative medicine, several can be broadly described as promoting disease resolution indirectly through local or systemic interactions with a patient's cells, without permanently integrating or directly forming new primary tissue. In this review, we focus on such therapies, which we term disease-modulating regenerative therapies (DMRT), and on the extent to which they have been translated into the clinical arena in four distinct areas of nephrology: renovascular disease (RVD), sepsis-associated AKI (SA-AKI), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and kidney transplantation (KTx). As we describe, the DMRT that has most consistently progressed to human clinical trials for these indications is mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), which potently modulate ischemic, inflammatory, profibrotic, and immune-mediated tissue injury through diverse paracrine mechanisms. In KTx, several early-phase clinical trials have also tested the potential for <i>ex vivo</i>-expanded regulatory immune cell therapies to promote donor-specific tolerance and prevent or resolve allograft injury. Other promising DMRT, including adult stem/progenitor cells, stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles, and implantable hydrogels/biomaterials remain at varying preclinical stages of translation for these renal conditions. To date (2021), no DMRT has gained market approval for use in patients with RVD, SA-AKI, DKD, or KTx, and clinical trials demonstrating definitive, cost-effective patient benefits are needed. Nonetheless, exciting progress in understanding the disease-specific mechanisms of action of MSCs and other DMRT, coupled with increasing knowledge of the pathophysiologic basis for renal-tissue injury and the experience gained from pioneering early-phase clinical trials provide optimism that influential, regenerative treatments for diverse kidney diseases will emerge in the years ahead.",Kidney360,2021-Mar,"Hickson LJ, Herrmann SM, McNicholas BA, Griffin MD",4,2245,nephrology,2025-11-22
32927458,Genotype-Guided Hydralazine Therapy.,"Despite its approval in 1953, hydralazine hydrochloride continues to be used in the management of resistant hypertension, a condition frequently managed by nephrologists and other clinicians. Hydralazine hydrochloride undergoes metabolism by the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) enzyme. NAT2 is highly polymorphic as approximately 50% of the general population are slow acetylators. In this review, we first evaluate the link between NAT2 genotype and phenotype. We then assess the evidence available for genotype-guided therapy of hydralazine, specifically addressing associations of NAT2 acetylator status with hydralazine pharmacokinetics, antihypertensive efficacy, and toxicity. There is a critical need to use hydralazine in some patients with resistant hypertension. Available evidence supports a significant link between genotype and NAT2 enzyme activity as 29 studies were identified with an overall concordance between genotype and phenotype of 92%. The literature also supports an association between acetylator status and hydralazine concentration, as fourteen of fifteen identified studies revealed significant relationships with a consistent direction of effect. Although fewer studies are available to directly link acetylator status with hydralazine antihypertensive efficacy, the evidence from this smaller set of studies is significant in 7 of 9 studies identified. Finally, 5 studies were identified which support the association of acetylator status with hydralazine-induced lupus. Clinicians should maintain vigilance when prescribing maximum doses of hydralazine. Key Messages: NAT2 slow acetylator status predicts increased hydralazine levels, which may lead to increased efficacy and adverse effects. Caution should be exercised in slow acetylators with total daily hydralazine doses of 200 mg or more. Fast acetylators are at risk for inefficacy at lower doses of hydralazine. With appropriate guidance on the usage of NAT2 genotype, clinicians can adopt a personalized approach to hydralazine dosing and prescription, enabling more efficient and safe treatment of resistant hypertension.",American journal of nephrology,2020-,"Collins KS, Raviele ALJ, Elchynski AL, Woodcock AM, Zhao Y, Cooper-DeHoff RM, Eadon MT",7,2109,nephrology,2025-11-22
34627932,Research Priorities for Kidney-Related Research-An Agenda to Advance Kidney Care: A Position Statement From the National Kidney Foundation.,"Despite the high prevalence and economic burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the United States, federal funding for kidney-related research, prevention, and education activities under the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) remains substantially lower compared to other chronic diseases. More federal support is needed to promote critical research that will expand knowledge of kidney health and disease, develop new and effective therapies, and reduce health disparities. In 2021, the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) convened 2 Research Roundtables (preclinical and clinical research), comprising nephrology leaders from prominent US academic institutions and the pharmaceutical industry, key bodies with expertise in research, and including individuals with CKD and their caregivers and kidney donors. The goal of these roundtables was to identify priorities for preclinical and clinical kidney-related research. The research priorities identified by the Research Roundtables and presented in this position statement outline attainable opportunities for groundbreaking and critically needed innovations that will benefit patients with kidney disease in the next 5-10 years. Research priorities fall within 4 preclinical science themes (expand data science capability, define kidney disease mechanisms and utilize genetic tools to identify new therapeutic targets, develop better models of human disease, and test cell-specific drug delivery systems and utilize gene editing) and 3 clinical science themes (expand number and inclusivity of clinical trials, develop and test interventions to reduce health disparities, and support implementation science). These priorities in kidney-related research, if supported by additional funding by federal agencies, will increase our understanding of the development and progression of kidney disease among diverse populations, attract additional industry investment, and lead to new and more personalized treatments.",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2022-Feb,,0,2002,nephrology,2025-11-22
35713730,Management of the congenital solitary kidney: consensus recommendations of the Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology.,"In recent years, several studies have been published on the prognosis of children with congenital solitary kidney (CSK), with controversial results, and a worldwide consensus on management and follow-up is lacking. In this consensus statement, the Italian Society of Pediatric Nephrology summarizes the current knowledge on CSK and presents recommendations for its management, including diagnostic approach, nutritional and lifestyle habits, and follow-up. We recommend that any antenatal suspicion/diagnosis of CSK be confirmed by neonatal ultrasound (US), avoiding the routine use of further imaging if no other anomalies of kidney/urinary tract are detected. A CSK without additional abnormalities is expected to undergo compensatory enlargement, which should be assessed by US. We recommend that urinalysis, but not blood tests or genetic analysis, be routinely performed at diagnosis in infants and children showing compensatory enlargement of the CSK. Extrarenal malformations should be searched for, particularly genital tract malformations in females. An excessive protein and salt intake should be avoided, while sport participation should not be restricted. We recommend a lifelong follow-up, which should be tailored on risk stratification, as follows: low risk: CSK with compensatory enlargement, medium risk: CSK without compensatory enlargement and/or additional CAKUT, and high risk: decreased GFR and/or proteinuria, and/or hypertension. We recommend that in children at low-risk periodic US, urinalysis and BP measurement be performed; in those at medium risk, we recommend that serum creatinine also be measured; in high-risk children, the schedule has to be tailored according to kidney function and clinical data.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2022-Sep,"La Scola C, Ammenti A, Bertulli C, Bodria M, Brugnara M, Camilla R, Capone V, Casadio L, Chimenz R, Conte ML, Conversano E, Corrado C, Guarino S, Luongo I, Marsciani M, Marzuillo P, Meneghesso D, Pennesi M, Pugliese F, Pusceddu S, Ravaioli E, Taroni F, Vergine G, Peruzzi L, Montini G",25,1733,nephrology,2025-11-22
35212703,"Brazilian consensus recommendations for the diagnosis, screening, and treatment of individuals with fabry disease: Committee for Rare Diseases - Brazilian Society of Nephrology/2021.","Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked inherited disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene encoding enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A). The purpose of this study was to produce a consensus statement to standardize the recommendations concerning kidney involvement in FD and provide advice on the diagnosis, screening, and treatment of adult and pediatric patients. This consensus document was organized from an initiative led by the Committee for Rare Diseases (Comdora) of the Brazilian Society of Nephrology (SBN). The review considered randomized clinical trials, real-world data studies, and the expertise of its authors. The purpose of this consensus statement is to help manage patient and physician expectations concerning the outcomes of treatment. Our recommendations must be interpreted within the context of available evidence. The decisions pertaining to each individual case must be made with the involvement of patients and their families and take into account not only the potential cost of treatment, but also concurrent conditions and personal preferences. The Comdora intends to update these recommendations regularly so as to reflect recent literature evidence, real-world data, and appreciate the professional experience of those involved. This consensus document establishes clear criteria for the diagnosis of FD and for when to start or stop specific therapies or adjuvant measures, to thus advise the medical community and standardize clinical practice.",Jornal brasileiro de nefrologia,2022-,"Silva CAB, Andrade LGM, Vaisbich MH, Barreto FC",4,1479,nephrology,2025-11-22
36245341,Korean Society of Nephrology 2022 recommendations on controversial issues in diagnosis and management of hyponatremia.,"The Korean Society for Electrolyte and Blood Pressure Research, in collaboration with the Korean Society of Nephrology, has published a clinical practice guideline (CPG) document for hyponatremia treatment. The document is based on an extensive evidence-based review of the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia with the multidisciplinary participation of representative experts in hyponatremia with methodologist support for guideline development. This CPG consists of 12 recommendations (two for diagnosis, eight for treatment, and two for special situations) based on eight detailed topics and nine key questions. Each recommendation begins with statements graded by the strength of the recommendations and the quality of the evidence. Each statement is followed by rationale supporting the recommendations. The committee issued conditional recommendations in favor of rapid intermittent bolus administration of hypertonic saline in severe hyponatremia, the use of vasopressin receptor antagonists in heart failure with hypervolemic hyponatremia, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis with moderate to severe hyponatremia, the individualization of desmopressin use, and strong recommendation on the administration of isotonic fluids as maintenance fluid therapy in hospitalized pediatric patients. We hope that this CPG will provide useful recommendations in practice, with the aim of providing clinical support for shared decision-making to improve patient outcomes.",The Korean journal of internal medicine,2022-Nov,"Lee Y, Yoo KD, Baek SH, Kim YG, Kim HJ, Ryu JY, Paek JH, Suh SH, Oh SW, Lee J, Jhee JH, Suh JS, Yang EM, Park YH, Kim YL, Choi M, Oh KH, Kim S",18,1490,nephrology,2025-11-22
36203353,Global challenges with providing vascular access care during COVID era.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected health care systems and dialysis access care in the US and across the globe. Beyond the initial challenges posed by the pandemic and despite the actions taken by health care leaders/organizations/professional societies such as the ""Maintaining Lifelines for ESKD Patients"" joint statement, there continues to be delays in providing timely care and performing elective and emergent dialysis access procedures worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess the global challenges associated with providing dialysis vascular access care across the international vascular access community during the pandemic. The American Society of Diagnostic and Interventional Nephrology (ASDIN) conducted an online survey in 2021, that was administered to an expert panel of dialysis vascular access specialists and global leaders spanning across the international community. The respondents who are members of ASDIN, Association of Vascular Access and InTerventionAl Renal physicians (AVATAR), Asia Pacific Society of Dialysis Access (APSDA), Peruvian Vascular Access Society (APDAV), and Australia/New Zealand Society of Interventional Nephrology (ANZSIN) reported their experiences in the care of dialysis vascular access, practice patterns, and challenges faced during the COVID pandemic. Of the 53 individual surveys sent, 16 were opened and 11 (69%) responses were received from across the world and from different practice settings. The survey revealed the continued challenges facing the international community, the stark disparities in care delivery, supply chain disruption and logistical, regulatory, and financial issues that the global community continues to face in the ongoing pandemic. The COVID19 pandemic is far from over, and the challenges and barriers to providing dialysis access care seen on the initial ASDIN survey in the US seem to extend across the globe. We describe those results and discuss options, opportunities, and innovative tools to provide dialysis and access care during these trying times.",The journal of vascular access,2024-Mar,"Ramani K, Vachharajani TJ, Lerma E, Agarwal AK",4,2057,nephrology,2025-11-22
36084975,Managing the Nutritional Requirements of the Pediatric End-Stage Kidney Disease Graduate.,"The pediatric patient with end-stage kidney disease who transitions to the adult dialysis unit or nephrology center requires a unique nutritional focus. Clinicians in the adult center may be faced with complex issues that have often been part of the patient's journey since early childhood. The causes of kidney disease in children are often quite different than those which affect the adult population and may require different nutritional priorities. Abnormal growth including severe short stature, underweight, overweight or obesity, and poor musculature may affect the long-term health and psychosocial well-being of these patients. Nutritional assessment of these patients should include a focus on past growth and anthropometric data, dietary information, including appetite, quality of diet, and assessment of biochemical data through a pediatric lens. This review discusses the unique factors that must be considered when transitioning pediatric patients and notes major recommendations from a compilation of pediatric guideline statements.",Advances in chronic kidney disease,2022-May,"Nelms CL, Shroff R, Boyer O, Topaloglu R",4,1048,nephrology,2025-11-22
