34173093,Oxidative Stress: Pathogenetic Role in Diabetes Mellitus and Its Complications and Therapeutic Approaches to Correction.,"The review presents modern views about the role of oxidative stress reactions in the pathogenesis of types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus and their complications based on the analysis of experimental and clinical studies. The sources of increased ROS generation in diabetes are specified, including the main pathways of altered glucose metabolism, oxidative damage to pancreatic Î²-cells, and endothelial dysfunction. The relationship between oxidative stress, carbonyl stress, and inflammation is described. The significance of oxidative stress reactions associated with hyperglycemia is considered in the context of the ""metabolic memory"" phenomenon. The results of our studies demonstrated significant ethnic and age-related variability of the LPO-antioxidant defense system parameters in patients with diabetes mellitus, which should be considered during complex therapy of the disease. Numerous studies of the effectiveness of antioxidants in diabetes mellitus of both types convincingly proved that antioxidants should be a part of the therapeutic process. Modern therapeutic strategies in the treatment of diabetes mellitus are aimed at developing new methods of personalized antioxidant therapy, including ROS sources targeting combined with new ways of antioxidant delivery.",Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,2021-May,"Darenskaya MA, Kolesnikova LI, Kolesnikov SI",3,1277,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

34764939,The Utility of Exosomes in Diagnosis and Therapy of Diabetes Mellitus and Associated Complications.,"Diabetes mellitus and the associated complications are metabolic diseases with high morbidity that result in poor quality of health and life. The lack of diagnostic methods for early detection results in patients losing the best treatment opportunity. Oral hypoglycemics and exogenous insulin replenishment are currently the most common therapeutic strategies, which only yield temporary glycemic control rather than curing the disease and its complications. Exosomes are nanoparticles containing bioactive molecules reflecting individual physiological status, regulating metabolism, and repairing damaged tissues. They function as biomarkers of diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications. Considering that exosomes are bioactive molecules, can be obtained from body fluid, and have cell-type specificity, in this review, we highlight the multifold effects of exosomes in the pathology and therapy of diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2021-,"Sun Y, Tao Q, Wu X, Zhang L, Liu Q, Wang L",6,948,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Moreover, the variability of each risk factor, when contemporarily present, may have additive effects. However, the question is whether variability is causal or a marker. Evidence shows that the quality of care and the attainment of the target impact on the variability of all risk factors. On the other hand, for some of them causality may be considered. Although specific studies are still lacking, it should be useful checking the variability of a risk factor, together with its magnitude out of the normal range, in clinical practice. This can lead to an improvement of the quality of care, which, in turn, could further hesitate in an improvement of risk factors variability.",Cardiovascular diabetology,2021-May,"Ceriello A, Prattichizzo F",2,928,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

31057114,Microvascular Complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic, non communicable, multisystem disease that has reached epidemic proportions. Chronic exposure to hyperglycaemia affects the microvasculature, eventually leading to diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy with high impact on the quality of life and overall life expectancy. Sexual dysfunction is an often-overlooked microvascular complication of T2DM, with a complex pathogenesis originating from endothelial dysfunction. The purpose of this review is to present current definitions, epidemiological data and risk factors for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and sexual dysfunction. We also describe the clinical and laboratory evaluation that is mandatory for the diagnosis of these conditions. A comprehensive review of the literature was performed to identify data from clinical studies for the prevalence, risk factors and diagnostic methods of microvascular complications of T2DM. Diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy affect approximately 25% of patients with T2DM; diabetic neuropathy is encountered in almost 50% of the diabetic population, while the prevalence of erectile dysfunction ranges from 35-90% in diabetic men. The duration of T2DM along with glycemic, blood pressure and lipid control are common risk factors for the development of these complications. Criteria for the diagnosis of these conditions are well established, but exclusion of other causes is mandatory. Early detection of microvascular complications associated with T2DM is important, as early intervention leads to better outcomes. However, this requires awareness of their definition, prevalence and diagnostic modalities.",Current vascular pharmacology,2020-,"Faselis C, Katsimardou A, Imprialos K, Deligkaris P, Kallistratos M, Dimitriadis K",6,1673,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

30961501,The Growing Epidemic of Diabetes Mellitus.,"During the past decades, the prevalence of diabetes (DM) has increased significantly, mainly as a result of continuous rise in the incidence of type 2 DM. According to World Health Organization statistics, >422 million adults globally were suffering from DM in 2014 and a continuous rise in DM prevalence is expected. The present review considers recent epidemiological data providing worldwide estimates regarding the incidence of DM. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify available data from epidemiological studies evaluating the current burden of DM. Over the past few decades the prevalence of DM has risen significantly in nearly all countries and may be considered as a growing epidemic. Urbanization and income status are major factors which influence current rates in the prevalence studies introducing interesting differences between several population groups. Having recognized the global burden of DM, we now realize the urgent need for effective interventions. In order to monitor the public-health strategies and design effective future interventions we need reliable global estimates regarding the prevalence of DM.",Current vascular pharmacology,2020-,"Lovic D, Piperidou A, Zografou I, Grassos H, Pittaras A, Manolis A",6,1152,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
39556629,Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Evaluation and Treatment.,"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes resulting from an absolute or relative insulin deficiency. It can occur in patients of all ages and can be the initial presentation of diabetes, especially in young children. Polyuria and polydipsia are the most common symptoms, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, severe fatigue, dyspnea, and preceding febrile illness. Traditionally, DKA has been diagnosed by the triad of hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.3, serum bicarbonate less than 18 mEq/L, anion gap greater than 10 mEq/L), and elevated serum (preferred) or urine ketones. However, hyperglycemia has been de-emphasized in recent guidelines because of the increasing incidence of euglycemic DKA. The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors modestly increases the risk of DKA and euglycemic DKA. Electrolytes, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood cell count with differential, A1C, and electrocardiography should be evaluated for all patients diagnosed with DKA to identify causes and complications of DKA. Amylase, lipase, hepatic transaminase levels, troponin, creatine kinase, blood and urine cultures, and chest radiography are additional tests to consider. Treatment involves fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin, treatment of precipitating causes, and close monitoring to adjust therapy and identify complications. Prevention strategies include identifying diabetes before DKA develops, educating patients to manage high-risk situations, and ensuring uninterrupted access to therapies for diabetes.",American family physician,2024-Nov,"Veauthier B, Levy-Grau B",2,1682,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Two SGLT2 inhibitors, namely bexagliflozin and velagliflozin, were recently FDA approved for the treatment of uncomplicated feline diabetes mellitus. These oral hypoglycemic agents are a suitable option for many newly diagnosed cats, with rapid improvements in glycemic control and clinical signs. Suitable candidates must have some residual Î²-cell function, as some endogenous insulin production is required to prevent ketosis.

36916961,Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Therapy as a new Treatment Option for Diabetes Mellitus.,"The worldwide increase in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus has raised the demand for new therapeutic strategies targeting diabetic symptoms and its chronic complications. Among different treatment options for diabetes, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) therapy attract the most attention. The therapeutic effects of ADMSCs are based primarily on their paracrine release of immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and trophic factors. Animal models of diabetes as well as human clinical trials have shown that ADMSCs can effectively facilitate endogenous Î² cell regeneration, preserve residual Î² cell mass, reduce islet graft rejection, regulate the immune system, and ultimately improve insulin sensitivity or ameliorate insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Nevertheless, transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells is associated with certain risks; therefore recently much attention has been devoted to ADMSCs derivatives, such as exosomes or conditioned media, as therapeutic agents for the treatment of diabetes. Compared to ADMSCs, cell-free therapy has even better therapeutic potential. This narrative review summarizes recent outcomes and molecular mechanisms of ADMSCs action in the treatment for both type 1 DM and type 2 DM, as well as shows their feasibility, benefits, and current limitations.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2023-Jul,"MikÅosz A, Chabowski A",2,1322,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

37839502,Î²-cell neogenesis: A rising star to rescue diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM), a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose, is caused by various degrees of insulin resistance and dysfunctional insulin secretion, resulting in hyperglycemia. The loss and failure of functional Î²-cells are key mechanisms resulting in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of Î²-cell failure, and exploring approaches for Î²-cell neogenesis to reverse Î²-cell dysfunction may provide novel strategies for DM therapy. Emerging studies reveal that genetic susceptibility, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative stress, islet inflammation, and protein modification linked to multiple signaling pathways contribute to DM pathogenesis. Over the past few years, replenishing functional Î²-cell by Î²-cell neogenesis to restore the number and function of pancreatic Î²-cells has remarkably exhibited a promising therapeutic approach for DM therapy. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the underlying mechanisms of Î²-cell failure in DM, highlight the effective approaches for Î²-cell neogenesis, as well as discuss the current clinical and preclinical agents research advances of Î²-cell neogenesis.

Millions of people across the world are affected by diabetes mellitus which has serious implications for their health. Over the past few decades, diabetes has become a major cause of mortality and morbidity across the world due to its rapid prevalence. Treatment for diabetes that focuses on insulin secretion and sensitization can lead to unwanted side effects and/or poor compliance, as well as treatment failure. A promising way to treat diabetes is through gene-editing technologies such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9). However, issues such as efficiency and off-target effects have hindered the use of these technologies. In this review, we summarize what we know today about CRISPR/Cas9 technology's therapeutic potential for treating diabetes. We discuss how different strategies are employed, including cell-based therapies (such as stem cells and brown adipocytes), targeting critical genes involved in diabetes pathogenesis, and discussing the challenges and limitations associated with this technology.

DPN increases the risk of ulcers, foot infections, and noninvasive amputations, ultimately leading to long-term disability. Seven hundred patients with T2DM were investigated from 2013 to 2017 in the Sanlin community by obtaining basic data from the electronic medical record system (EMRS). From September 2018 to July 2019, 681 patients (19 missing) were investigated using a questionnaire, physical examination, biochemical index test, and follow-up Toronto clinical scoring system (TCSS) test. Patients with a TCSS score â¥6 points were diagnosed with DPN. After removing missing values, 612 patients were divided into groups in a 3:1 ratio for external validation. Using different Lasso analyses (misclassification error, mean squared error, -2log-likelihood, and area under curve) and a logistic regression analysis of the training set, models A, B, C, and D were established. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration plot, dynamic component analysis (DCA) measurements, net classification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used to validate discrimination and clinical practicality of the model. Through data analysis, model A (containing four factors), model B (containing five factors), model C (containing seven factors), and model D (containing seven factors) were built. After calibration, ROC curve, DCA, NRI and IDI, models C and D exhibited better accuracy and greater predictive power.

32894314,The clinical consequences of heterogeneity within and between different diabetes types.,"Advances in molecular methods and the ability to share large population-based datasets are uncovering heterogeneity within diabetes types, and some commonalities between types. Within type 1 diabetes, endotypes have been discovered based on demographic (e.g. age at diagnosis, race/ethnicity), genetic, immunological, histopathological, metabolic and/or clinical course characteristics, with implications for disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis and treatment. In type 2 diabetes, the relative contributions of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction are heterogeneous and relate to demographics, genetics and clinical characteristics, with substantial interaction from environmental exposures. Investigators have proposed approaches that vary from simple to complex in combining these data to identify type 2 diabetes clusters relevant to prognosis and treatment. Advances in pharmacogenetics and pharmacodynamics are also improving treatment. Monogenic diabetes is a prime example of how understanding heterogeneity within diabetes types can lead to precision medicine, since phenotype and treatment are affected by which gene is mutated. Heterogeneity also blurs the classic distinctions between diabetes types, and has led to the definition of additional categories, such as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, type 1.5 diabetes and ketosis-prone diabetes. Furthermore, monogenic diabetes shares many features with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which make diagnosis difficult. These challenges to the current classification framework in adult and paediatric diabetes require new approaches. The 'palette model' and the 'threshold hypothesis' can be combined to help explain the heterogeneity within and between diabetes types. Leveraging such approaches for therapeutic benefit will be an important next step for precision medicine in diabetes.

35008906,The Role of the Gut Microbiota in the Pathogenesis of Diabetes.,"Diabetes mellitus is a significant clinical and therapeutic problem because it can lead to serious long-term complications. Its pathogenesis is not fully understood, but there are indications that dysbiosis can play a role in the development of diabetes, or that it appears during the course of the disease. Changes in microbiota composition are observed in both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. These modifications are associated with pro-inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, endotoxemia, impaired Î²-cell function and development of insulin resistance. This review summarizes the role of the gut microbiota in healthy individuals and the changes in bacterial composition that can be associated with T1D or T2D.

38512073,"Diabetes: a review of its pathophysiology, and advanced methods of mitigation.","Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a long-lasting metabolic non-communicable disease often characterized by an increase in the level of glucose in the blood or hyperglycemia. Approximately, 415 million people between the ages of 20 and 79âyears had DM in 2015 and this figure will rise by 200 million by 2040. In a study conducted by CARRS, it's been found that in Delhi the prevalence of diabetes is around 27% and for prediabetic cases, it is more than 46%. The disease DM can be both short-term and long-term and is often associated with one or more diseases like cardiovascular disease, liver disorder, or kidney malfunction. Early identification of diabetes may help avoid catastrophic repercussions because untreated DM can result in serious complications. Diabetes' primary symptoms are persistently high blood glucose levels, frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. Therefore, DM is classified into four major categories, namely, Type 1, Type 2, Gestational diabetes, and secondary diabetes. There are various oral and injectable formulations available in the market like insulin, biguanides, sulphonylureas, etc. for the treatment of DM. Recent attention can be given to the various nano approaches undertaken for the treatment, diagnosis, and management of diabetes mellitus. Various nanoparticles like Gold Nanoparticles, carbon nanomaterials, and metallic nanoparticles are some of the approaches mentioned in this review. Besides nanotechnology, artificial intelligence (AI) has also found its application in diabetes care. AI can be used for screening the disease, helping in decision-making, predictive population-level risk stratification, and patient self-management tools. Early detection and diagnosis of diabetes also help the patient avoid expensive treatments later in their life with the help of IoT (internet of medical things) and machine learning models. These tools will help healthcare physicians to predict the disease early. Therefore, the Nano drug delivery system along with AI tools holds a very bright future in diabetes care.",Current medical research and opinion,2024-May,"Gupta S, Sharma N, Arora S, Verma S",4,2071,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The pre-diabetic phase of the disease is called tropical chronic pancreatitis (TCP). Currently FCPD is classified as a secondary form of diabetes called pancreatic diabetes, because essentially the disease is caused by pancreatic damage. There is an overlap of these subjects with idiopathic, non-alcoholic pancreatitis. This review will cover the etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and management of this clinical condition. FCPD could lead to endocrine dysfunction (diabetes and its complications) as well as exocrine dysfunction, and is associated with a higher risk of pancreatic cancer, for which early detection is important.",Journal of diabetes and its complications,2021-Jan,"Kumaran S, Unnikrishnan AG",2,798,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

DM complications mostly impact the patient's quality of life (QoL). Only a few studies have been conducted summarizing the types of nursing interventions for improving the QoL of DM patients. The objective of this study is to explore the types of nursing interventions that can improve the QoL of DM patients. The online databases, including ScienceDirect, Medline, Google Search, and Pro-Quest, were used to search for the relevant articles. Articles that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed, and their level of evidence was determined and synthesized. A total of 30 articles defining the types of nursing intervention on improving the QoL of DM patients were discovered, comprising the five types of nursing interventions, such as health education (15 articles), exercise (8 articles), WhatsApp/short message service (WA/SMS) gateway (3 articles), blood glucose control (3 articles), and black garlic herbal therapy (1 article). Sequentially, the most common types of nursing interventions to improve the QoL of DM patients was health education, followed by exercise, WA/SMS gateway, and glucose control. A personal approach to health education is a significant point in improving the QoL of DM patients in the future.

There is an interplay of nongenetic and genetic components in pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications. There are several established genes such as ABCC8, TCF7L2, SLC2A2, and CAPN10 which are known to influence blood insulin and glucose levels. Current management of diabetes types may include lifetime burdensome use of insulin, insulin sensitizers, insulin secretagogues, etc. There has been increasing interest in improving genetic editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 and using genetically edited stem cells to alter diabetes disease course or possibly cure it. Current research on microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs may provide insights into the pathways involved in development of diabetes and its complications.

38890775,Estimation of the direct health and indirect societal costs of diabetes in the UK using a cost of illness model.,"The direct cost of diabetes to the UK health system was estimated at around Â£10 billion in 2012. This analysis updates that estimate using more recent and accurate data sources. A pragmatic review of relevant data sources for UK nations was conducted, including population-level data sets and published literature, to generate estimates of costs separately for Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes. A comprehensive cost framework, developed in collaboration with experts, was used to create a population-based cost of illness model. The key driver of the analysis was prevalence of diabetes and its complications. Estimates were made of the excess costs of diagnosis, treatment and diabetes-related complications compared with the general UK population. Estimates of the indirect costs of diabetes focused on productivity losses due to absenteeism and premature mortality. The direct costs of diabetes in 2021/22 for the UK were estimated at Â£10.7 billion, of which just over 40% related to diagnosis and treatment, with the rest relating to the excess costs of complications. Indirect costs were estimated at Â£3.3 billion. Diabetes remains a considerable cost burden in the UK, and the majority of those costs are still spent on potentially preventable complications. Although rates of some complications are reducing, prevalence continues to increase and effective approaches to primary and secondary prevention continue to be needed.

DM is one of the fastest growing challenges to global health in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and places a tremendous burden on affected individuals and their families and countries. Although insulin and antidiabetic drugs have been used to treat DM, a radical cure for the disease is unavailable. The pathogenesis of DM remains unclear. Emerging roles of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in DM have become a subject of global research. CircRNAs have been verified to participate in the onset and progression of DM, implying their potential roles as novel biomarkers and treatment tools.

Male Factor Infertility (MFI) is responsible, alone or in combination with female factors, for about half of the overall cases of couple infertility. MFI is gradually increasing in prevalence, with a notable decline in semen parameters over the last decades. The aetiologies behind the finding of decreasing sperm counts are difficult to pinpoint but might be due in part to increasing rates of overweight and obesity in men of childbearing age. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common and chronic metabolic disease, whose prevalence is also gradually increasing, rising up to 10% of the population. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that there are currently more than 500 million people living with DM worldwide, the vast majority of whom suffering from type 2 DM (T2DM). There is growing awareness of the relationship between unhealthy lifestyle, in particular unhealthy diet, and MFI. Starting from all these premises, the aim of this narrative review is to describe the current evidence on the link between DM and MFI, both in terms of DM as a cause of/a risk factor for MFI and of MFI as a possible predictive marker for T2DM. Finally, we will discuss the risk of DM as a consequence of the therapy of MFI or assisted reproductive techniques.",Molecular aspects of medicine,2024-Oct,"Graziani A, Scafa R, Grande G, Ferlin A",4,1393,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
39461229,Prevalence and clinical implications of diabetes mellitus in autoimmune nodopathies: A systematic review.,"Autoimmune nodopathies comprise a newly-established subtype of immune-mediated peripheral neuropathies, characterized by circulating autoantibodies that target nodal-paranodal proteins, including contactin-1 (CNTN1), contactin-associated protein-1 (Caspr1), neurofascin-155 (NF155) and neurofascin-isoforms (NF140 and NF186). Emerging evidence suggests that diabetes mellitus (DM) may confer increased risk for autoimmune nodopathies. A systematic search was performed including studies reporting on patients harboring nodal/paranodal antibodies (CNTN1, Caspr1, NF155, NF140 and NF186). We sought to evaluate: (1) the prevalence of DM among patients with autoimmune nodopathies; (2) the phenotype of DM-patients harboring different types of nodal/paranodal antibodies; (3) clinical features that allow distinction of autoimmune nodopathies from diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Five cohort studies, 3 case-reports and one case-series study were identified comprising 114 patients with autoimmune nodopathies. DM prevalence was documented to range between 10.5Â % and 60Â %. DM-patients harbored mostly paranodal antibodies; CNTN1: 58.3Â %, followed by pan-neurofascin: 33.3Â %, and Caspr1: 25Â % antibodies. No significant differences in clinical phenotype were uncovered between DM-patients and their non-DM counterparts. Overall, DM patients were refractory to intravenous-immunoglobulins (IVIG), but responded well to escalation immunotherapies. Compared to DPN, distinctive features of autoimmune nodopathy comprised: (i) severe ataxia, tremor, and cranial nerve involvement; (ii) neurophysiological findings indicative of nodal-paranodal pathology, including (reversible) conduction failure and conduction velocity slowing, often accompanied by reduced compound muscle and sensory nerve action potentials; and (iii) marked protein-elevation or albuminocytological dissociation in cerebrospinal fluid analysis. DM patients fall under the typical clinical phenotype of autoimmune nodopathy, displaying predominantly paranodal antibodies.

37449742,Chronic Venous Disease and Its Intersections With Diabetes Mellitus.,"Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a vascular disorder in which blood return is severely compromised and CVD is usually characterized by venous hypertension. Along with obesity and diabetes mellitus, CVD is one of the most common civilization diseases. In general, the estimated prevalence of CVD ranges from 60-80 %. Early diagnosis and adequate treatment are important for preventing progression to more severe stages of the disease like venous leg ulcers. Clinical manifestations of CVD in initial stages of the disease are often asymptomatic. However, as CVD progresses, symptoms begin to develop. Treatment of CVD could be divided into conservative and surgical. Conservative therapy consists of compression, pharmacological treatment and lifestyle change. In cases where conservative therapy is ineffective, surgical or endovascular treatment may be required. The intersections between diabetes mellitus (DM) and CVD are not to be underestimated. CVD and DM have often the same risk factors. Symptoms of CVD can be modified by late complications of DM, but the incidence of different CVD degrees seems to be the same as in diabetics as in non-diabetics population. We are particularly concerned in diabetics about worse compliance with treatment due to their often-poorer adherence to treatment of DM and lifestyle changes. Moreover, there exist a higher risk of CVD and peripheral arterial disease in diabetics patients. Patients with CVD should always be inspected for the presence of DM, considering its presence can have a bearing on CVD symptoms, diagnostic procedures, and therapeutic strategies.",Physiological research,2023-Jul,"JaroÅ¡Ã­kovÃ¡ R, RoztoÄil K, HusÃ¡kovÃ¡ J, DubskÃ½ M, BÃ©m R, WoskovÃ¡ V, FejfarovÃ¡ V",7,1605,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The objective was to determine differences in the prevalence as well as in the outcomes in diabetic vs. non-diabetic PAD patients. The current review followed a study protocol that was published online in German in 2017. The search included societal practice guidelines, consensus statements, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and observational studies published from 2007 to 2020 reporting symptomatic PAD and concomitant DM in patients undergoing invasive open-surgical and endovascular revascularizations. German and English literature has been considered. Eligibility criteria were verified by three independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by discussion involving a fourth reviewer. 580 articles were identified. After exclusion of non-eligible studies, 61 papers from 30 countries remained, respectively 850,072 patients. The included studies showed that PAD prevalence differed between diabetic vs. non-diabetic populations (20-50% vs. 10-26%), and further by age, gender, ethnicity, duration of existing diabetes, and geographic region. The included studies revealed worse outcomes regarding perioperative complications, amputation rate, and mortality rate in diabetic patients when compared to non-diabetic patients. In both groups, the amputation rates decreased during the research period. This review emphasizes an interrelationship between PAD and DM. To improve the outcomes, early detection of PAD in diabetic patients, and vice versa, should be recommended.

38732253,Pathophysiology and Advances in the Therapy of Cardiomyopathy in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is known as the first non-communicable global epidemic. It is estimated that 537 million people have DM, but the condition has been properly diagnosed in less than half of these patients. Despite numerous preventive measures, the number of DM cases is steadily increasing. The state of chronic hyperglycaemia in the body leads to numerous complications, including diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). A number of pathophysiological mechanisms are behind the development and progression of cardiomyopathy, including increased oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, increased synthesis of advanced glycation products and overexpression of the biosynthetic pathway of certain compounds, such as hexosamine. There is extensive research on the treatment of DCM, and there are a number of therapies that can stop the development of this complication. Among the compounds used to treat DCM are antiglycaemic drugs, hypoglycaemic drugs and drugs used to treat myocardial failure. An important element in combating DCM that should be kept in mind is a healthy lifestyle-a well-balanced diet and physical activity. There is also a group of compounds-including coenzyme Q10, antioxidants and modulators of signalling pathways and inflammatory processes, among others-that are being researched continuously, and their introduction into routine therapies is likely to result in greater control and more effective treatment of DM in the future.

This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the emerging roles of MVs in the pathogenesis of diabetes and associated complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, cardiomyopathy, and neuropathy. MVs, through their cargo of proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and miRNAs, regulate critical processes like inflammation, oxidative stress, immune responses, and tissue remodeling, all of which contribute to the progression of diabetes and its complications. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying MVs' involvement in these pathological processes and discuss their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic tools, particularly for drug delivery. Despite promising evidence, challenges remain in isolating and characterizing MVs, understanding their molecular mechanisms, and validating them for clinical use. Advanced techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomics are required to gain deeper insights.

On the one hand, diabetes mellitus is considered one of the most important risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19. Several factors that are often present in diabetes mellitus are likely to contribute to this risk, such as older age, a proinflammatory and hypercoagulable state, hyperglycemia and underlying comorbidities (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and obesity). On the other hand, a severe COVID-19 infection, and its treatment with steroids, can have a specific negative impact on diabetes itself, leading to worsening of hyperglycemia through increased insulin resistance and reduced Î²-cell secretory function. Worsening hyperglycemia can, in turn, adversely affect the course of COVID-19.

36376223,Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes: Clinical approach and knowledge gaps.,"Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes (CFRD) is a unique type of diabetes mellitus that shares some features with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Yet, its distinguishing feature of acute pulmonary complications associated with hyperglycemia and the catabolic metabolism associated with a relative insulin deficiency poses challenges to the application of traditional definitions and treatments for diabetes mellitus. People with CF (pwCF) undergo rigorous annual screening starting at age 10, a process that is challenging for patients and limited by sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. As pwCF continue to live longer, over 50% are expected to develop CFRD over their lifetime, including up to 20% of adolescents. Increasing numbers of people with CFRD will make this disease increasingly relevant to diabetes practitioners. Evidence-guided practice in CFRD care is limited by small and short studies. Our current understanding of CFRD may change significantly with the recent introduction of CF Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) modulator medications. This review will explore current challenges in the diagnosis and management of CFRD, specifically highlighting knowledge gaps in the pathophysiology of CFRD, optimal screening methods, priorities for research and provide guidance with regards to screening, diagnosis, and treatment.",Paediatric respiratory reviews,2023-Jun,"Prentice BJ, Potter KJ, Coriati A, Boudreau V, Rusnell L, Kherani T, Senior PA, Hameed S, Rabasa-Lhoret R",9,1340,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
32299722,Diabetes: an Overview for Clinical Oncologists.,"Diabetes and cancer are common conditions highly prevalent in the general population. The co-existence of diabetes and cancer in a patient is therefore not unexpected. Diabetes increases the risk of mortality from cancer and morbidity from the treatment of cancer. Furthermore, many cancer chemotherapeutic regimens increase glucose levels, especially those involving glucocorticoids. Many clinical oncologists will deal with patients with diabetes in their clinical work, and some working knowledge of diabetes diagnosis and management is helpful when managing such patients. This overview aims to summarise the clinical diagnosis and management of diabetes, review the potential links between diabetes and cancer, and provide some practical guidance on the management of hyperglycaemia in patients undergoing cancer therapy.",Clinical oncology (Royal College of Radiologists (Great Britain)),2020-Sep,"Lee YN, Chowdhury TA",2,826,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
39316333,"Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diabetes mellitus.","Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment, offering hope for patients with various malignancies. However, along with their remarkable anticancer effects, ICIs can also trigger immune-related adverse events (irAEs). One such noteworthy complication is the development of Diabetes Mellitus (DM), which particularly resembles Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). The aim of this review is to provide insights into the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic issues, and treatment considerations of ICI-induced DM (ICI-DM), emphasizing the importance of early recognition and management to mitigate adverse outcomes. Although still rare, the incidence has increased with the widespread use of ICIs, especially PD-1/PD-L1 blockers (from 0.2% to 1.9%). Factors affecting the development of ICI-DM, such as specific ICIs, patient demographics, and genetic predispositions, are discussed. The complex interplay between immune dysregulation and pancreatic Î²-cell destruction contributes to diagnostic challenges, with presentations varying from asymptomatic hyperglycemia to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Management strategies prioritize meticulous glycemic and electrolyte regulation along with tailored intravenous insulin therapy in cases of DKA. DM remission is rare, therefore treatment with both long-acting insulin at bedtime and short-acting insulin before meals is needed in longterm. Total daily insulin requirements can be estimated at 0.3-0.4 units/kg/day for most patients as a starting dose.",Endocrine,2025-Mar,"Kani ER, Karaviti E, Karaviti D, Gerontiti E, Paschou IA, Saltiki K, Stefanaki K, Psaltopoulou T, Paschou SA",9,1524,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
33789298,Post-Transplantation Diabetes Mellitus in Pediatric Patients.,"More than 80% of pediatric solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients now survive into young adulthood and many encounter transplant-related complications. Post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM), sometimes also referred to as post-transplant diabetes or new onset diabetes after transplant, occurs in 3-20% of pediatric SOT recipients depending upon the organ transplanted, age at transplantation, immunosuppressive regimen, family history, and time elapsed since transplant. To diagnose PTDM, hyperglycemia must persist beyond the initial hospitalization for transplantation when a patient is on stable doses of immunosuppressive medications. Though standard diagnostic criteria used by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) to diagnose diabetes are employed, clinicians need to be aware of the limitations of using these criteria in this unique patient population. Management of PTDM parallels strategies used for type 2 diabetes (T2D), while also carefully considering comorbidities and potential interactions with immunosuppressive medications in these patients. In caring for patients with PTDM, it is important to be familiar with these interactions and comorbidities in order to coordinate care with the transplant team and optimize outcomes for these patients.",Hormone research in paediatrics,2020-,"Grundman JB, Wolfsdorf JI, Marks BE",3,1274,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
34462631,Diabetes Mellitus Prediction and Severity Level Estimation Using OWDANN Algorithm.,"Today, diabetes is one of the most prevalent, chronic, and deadly diseases in the world owing to some complications. If accurate early diagnosis is feasible, the risk factor and incidence of diabetes may be greatly decreased. Diabetes prediction is stable and reliable, since there are only minimal labelling evidence and outliers found in the datasets of diabetes. Numerous works coped with diabetes disease prediction and provided the solution. But the existing methods proffered low accuracy detection and consumed more training time. So, this paper proposed an OWDANN algorithm for diabetes mellitus disease prediction and severity level estimation. The proposed system mainly consists of two phases, namely, disease prediction and severity level estimation phase. In the disease prediction phase, the preprocessing is performed for the Pima dataset. Then, the features are extracted from the preprocessed data, and finally, the classification step is performed by using OWDANN. In the severity level estimation phase, the diabetes positive dataset is preprocessed first. Then, the features are extracted, and lastly, the severity level is predicted using GDHC. The extensive experimental results showed that the proposed system outperforms with 98.97% accuracy, 94.98% sensitivity, 95.62% specificity, 97.02% precision, 93.84% recall, 9404% <i>f</i>-measure, 0.094% FDR, and 0.023% FPR compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",Computational intelligence and neuroscience,2021-,"R A, R N",2,1434,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
35775305,Feline Comorbidities: Clinical perspective on diabetes mellitus and pancreatitis.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common feline endocrine disorders. It has been shown by several studies that DM in cats frequently coexists with pancreatitis. It has not been definitively established what the exact pathogenetic association between DM and pancreatitis is in the cat. However, the association between these two conditions is most likely bidirectional, with DM predisposing cats to pancreatitis and vice versa. Diagnosis of pancreatitis in cats with DM is crucial because concurrent pancreatitis commonly leads to difficulties in the management of DM. When pancreatitis is associated with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), therapeutic management is even more challenging. This review focuses on the concurrent presence of DM or DKA and pancreatitis in cats, mainly focusing on their clinical management. Information provided in this review is based on feline-specific clinical research when available. In addition, comparative and human research, as well as clinical experience, has been used to enrich knowledge in areas where feline-specific research is not yet available.",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,2022-Jul,"Xenoulis PG, Fracassi F",2,1093,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
39041707,The connections of sialic acids and diabetes mellitus: therapeutic or diagnostic value?,"Modulation of sialic acids is one of the important pathological consequences of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus with or without the micro- and macrovascular complications. However, the mechanistic, therapeutic and/or diagnostic implications of these observations are uncoordinated and possibly conflicting. This review critically analyses the scientific investigations connecting sialic acids with diabetes mellitus. Generally, variations in the levels and patterns of sialylation, fucosylation and galactosylation were predominant across various tissues and body systems of diabetic patients, but the immune system seemed to be most affected. These might be explored as a basis for differential diagnosis of various diabetic complications. Sialic acids are predominantly elevated in nearly all forms of diabetic conditions, particularly nephropathy and retinopathy, which suggests some diagnostic value but the mechanistic details were not unequivocal from the available data. The plausible mechanistic explanations for the elevated sialic acids are increased desialylation by sialidases, stimulation of hexosamine pathway and synthesis of acute phase proteins as well as oxidative stress. Additionally, sialic acids are also profoundly associated with glucose transport and insulin resistance in human-based studies while animal-based studies revealed that the increased desialylation of insulin receptors by sialidases, especially NEU1, might be the causal link. Interestingly, inhibition of the diabetes-associated NEU1 desialylation was beneficial in diabetes management and might be considered as a therapeutic target. It is hoped that the article will provide an informed basis for future research activities on the exploitation of sialic acids and glycobiology for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes against diabetes mellitus.",Glycobiology,2024-Jul,"Ibrahim MA, Isah MB, Inim MD, Abdullahi AD, Adamu A",5,1847,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
38251642,Early post-transplant hyperglycemia and post-transplant diabetes mellitus following heart transplantation.,"Heart transplantation is an important treatment for end-stage heart failure. Early post-transplant hyperglycemia (EPTH) and post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) are common following heart transplantation and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This review summarizes the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of EPTH and PTDM in cardiac transplant patients, incorporating findings from non-cardiac solid organ transplant studies where relevant due to limited heart-specific research. EPTH following heart transplantation is common yet understudied and is associated with the later development of PTDM. PTDM is associated with adverse outcomes including infection, renal dysfunction, microvascular disease, and an increased risk of re-transplantation and mortality. Risk factors for EPTH include the post-operative immunosuppression regimen, recipient and donor age, body mass index, infections, and chronic inflammation. Early insulin treatment is recommended for EPTH, whereas PTDM management is varied and includes lifestyle modification, anti-glycemic agents, and insulin. Given the emerging evidence on the transplant benefits associated with effective glucose control, and the cardioprotective potential of newer anti-glycemic agents, further focus on the management of EPTH and PTDM within heart transplant recipients is imperative.",Expert review of endocrinology & metabolism,2024-Mar,"Kuang W, Raven LM, Muir CA",3,1374,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

It may be productive for both classification and clinical discovery to consider variant forms of diabetes as a spectrum. Maturity onset diabetes of youth and neonatal diabetes serve as models for etiologically defined, rare forms of diabetes in the spectrum.

33082551,The trials and tribulations of determining HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets for diabetes mellitus.,"Glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) is considered the gold standard for predicting glycaemia-associated risks for the microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus over 5-10 years. The value of HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the care of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is unassailable, yet HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets remain contentious. Guidelines from diabetes care organizations recommend conflicting HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets - generally between 6.5% and 8%. However, all such organizations advocate for individualization of HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets, leaving both health-care providers and their patients confused about what HbA<sub>1c</sub> target is appropriate in an individual patient. In this Review, we outline the landmark T1DM and T2DM trials that informed the current guidelines, we discuss the evidence that drives individualized HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets, we examine the limitations of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and we consider alternatives for monitoring glycaemic control. Ultimately, in synthesizing this literature, we argue for an HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of <7% for most individuals, but emphasize the importance of helping patients determine their own personal goals and determinants of quality of life that are independent of a particular glycaemic target. We also recognize that as newer technologies and anti-hyperglycaemic therapies emerge, glycaemic targets will continue to evolve.",Nature reviews.

32176560,The assessment and management of quality of life of older adults with diabetes mellitus.,"<b>Introduction</b>: As the population ages, the number of older adults with diabetes mellitus will continue to rise. The burden of diabetes on older adults is significant due to the disease itself, its complications, and its treatments. This is compounded by geriatric syndromes such as frailty and cognitive dysfunction. Consequently, health and diabetes-related quality of life (QoL) are diminished.<b>Areas covered</b>: This article reviews the value of assessing QoL in providing patient-centered care and the associations between QoL measures and health outcomes. The determinants of QoL particular to diabetes and the older population are reviewed, including psychosocial, physical, and cognitive burdens of diabetes and aging and the impact of hypoglycemia on QoL. Strategies are described to alleviate these burdens and improve QoL, and barriers to multidisciplinary patient-centered care are discussed. QoL measurement instruments are reviewed.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The goals of treating diabetes and its complications should be considered carefully along with each patient's capacity to withstand the burdens of treatment. This capacity is reduced by socioeconomic, psychological, cognitive, and physical factors reduces this capacity.

39666834,Diabetes and cardiovascular disease in older adults.,"An aging population combined with a rapidly increasing prevalence of diabetes foreshadows a global epidemic of cardiovascular and kidney disease that threatens to halt improvements in life and health-span and will have particularly severe consequences in older adults. The management of diabetes has been transformed with the recent development of newer anti-hyperglycemic agents that have demonstrated superior efficacy. However, the utility of these drugs extends beyond glycemic control to benefits for managing obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. Numerous cardiovascular and kidney outcomes trials of these drugs have played an instrumental role in shaping current guidelines for the management of diabetes and CVD. Older adults with diabetes are diverse in terms of their comorbidities, diabetic complications, and cognitive and functional status. Therefore, there is an unmet need for personalized management of diabetes and CVD in this population. In this review, we provide an overview of the epidemiological burden and management of diabetes and CVD in older adults. We then focus on randomized cardiovascular and kidney outcome trials with anti-hyperglycemic agents to propose an evidence-based approach to the management of diabetes in older adults with high risk of cardiovascular and kidney disease.",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2025-Jan,"Bilal A, Pratley R",2,1358,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
32562358,Challenges in the diagnosis of diabetes type in pediatrics.,"The incidence of diabetes, both type 1 and type 2, is increasing. Health outcomes in pediatric diabetes are currently poor, with trends indicating that they are worsening. Minority racial/ethnic groups are disproportionately affected by suboptimal glucose control and have a higher risk of acute and chronic complications of diabetes. Correct clinical management starts with timely and accurate classification of diabetes, but in children this is becoming increasingly challenging due to high prevalence of obesity and shifting demographic composition. The growing obesity epidemic complicates classification by obesity's effects on diabetes. Since the prevalence and clinical characteristics of diabetes vary among racial/ethnic groups, migration between countries leads to changes in the distribution of diabetes types in a certain geographical area, challenging the clinician's ability to classify diabetes. These challenges must be addressed to correctly classify diabetes and establish an appropriate treatment strategy early in the course of disease for all. This may be the first step in improving diabetes outcomes across racial/ethnic groups. This review will discuss the pitfalls in the current diabetes classification scheme that is leading to increasing overlap between diabetes types and heterogeneity within each type. It will also present proposed alternative classification schemes and approaches to understanding diabetes type that may improve the timely and accurate classification of pediatric diabetes type.",Pediatric diabetes,2020-Nov,"Siller AF, Tosur M, Relan S, Astudillo M, McKay S, Dabelea D, Redondo MJ",7,1527,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

39544236,"The clinical potential of 1,5-anhydroglucitol as biomarker in diabetes mellitus.","A crucial measure of diabetes management is to monitor blood glucose, which often requires continuous blood collection, leading to economic burden and discomfort. Blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin A1c serve as traditional indicators of glucose monitoring. But now glycated albumin, fructosamine, and 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) have been gaining more attention. 1,5-AG is a chemically stable monosaccharide that exists in the human body. Its serum concentration remains stable when blood glucose levels are normal. However, it decreases when blood glucose exceeds the renal glucose threshold. Studies have shown that 1.5-AG reflects blood glucose changes in 1 to 2 weeks; therefore, decreased levels of serum 1,5-AG can serve as a clinical indicator of short-term blood glucose disturbances. Recent studies have shown that 1,5-AG can be used not only for the screening and managing of diabetes but also for predicting diabetes-related adverse events and islet Î² cell function in prediabetic patients. In addition, saliva 1,5-AG demonstrates potential value in the screening and diagnosis of diabetes.

38000983,Association between unstable diabetes mellitus and risk of pancreatic cancer.,"Deterioration of glycaemic control in people with long-standing diabetes mellitus (diabetes) may be a possible indicator of pancreatic cancer. However, the magnitude of the association between diabetes deterioration and pancreatic cancer has received little attention. We conducted a matched cohort study, nested within a population-based cohort of Australian women with diabetes. Women with unstable diabetes, defined as a change in medication after a 2-year period of stable medication use, were matched by birth year to those with stable diabetes, in a 1:4 ratio. We used flexible parametric survival models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 134,954 and 539,789 women in the unstable and stable diabetes cohorts, respectively (mean age 68 years). In total, 1,315 pancreatic cancers were diagnosed. Deterioration of stable diabetes was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer (HR 2.55; 95% CI 2.29-2.85). The risk was particularly high within the first year after diabetes deteriorated. HRs at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year were: 5.76 (95% CI 4.72-7.04); 4.56 (95% CI 3.81-5.46); and 3.33 (95% CI 2.86-3.89), respectively. The risk was no longer significantly different after 7 years. Deterioration in glycaemic control in people with previously stable diabetes may be an indicator of pancreatic cancer, suggesting investigations of the pancreas may be appropriate. The weaker longer-term (3-7 years) association between diabetes deterioration and pancreatic cancer may indicate that poor glycaemic control can be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer.",Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 is an important regulator of the fibrinolytic process and levels of this antifibrinolytic protein are elevated in diabetes and insulin resistant states. This review describes both the physiological and pathological role of PAI-1 in health and disease, focusing on the mechanism of action as well as protein abnormalities in vascular disease with special focus on diabetes. Attempts at inhibiting protein function, using different techniques, are also discussed including direct and indirect interference with production as well as inhibition of protein function. Developing PAI-1 inhibitors represents an alternative approach to managing hypofibrinolysis by targeting the pathological abnormality rather than current practice that relies on profound inhibition of the cellular and/or acellular arms of coagulation, and which can be associated with increased bleeding events. The review offers up-to-date knowledge on the mechanisms of action of PAI-1 together with the role of altering protein function to improve hypofirbinolysis.

39280004,Association and causality between diabetes and activin A: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Activin A, a cytokine belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Î²) superfamily, mediates a multifunctional signaling pathway that is essential for embryonic development, cell differentiation, metabolic regulation, and physiological equilibrium. Biomedical research using diabetes-based model organisms and cellular cultures reports evidence of different activin A levels between diabetic and control groups. Activin A is highly conserved across species and universally expressed among disparate tissues. A systematic review of published literatures on human populations reveals association of plasma activin A levels with diabetic patients in some (7) but not in others (5) of the studies. With summarized data from publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWASs), a two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) analysis is conducted on the causality between the exposure and the outcome. Wald ratio estimates from single instruments are predominantly non-significant. In contrast to positive controls between diabetes and plasma cholesterol levels, inverse-variance-weighted (IVW), Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode MR methods all lead to no observed causal link between diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and plasma activin A levels. Unavailability of strong instruments prevents the reversal MR analysis of activin A on diabetes. In summary, further research is needed to confirm or deny the potential association between diabetes and plasma activin A, and to elucidate the temporal incidence of these traits in human populations. At this stage, no causality has been found between diabetes and plasma activin A based on TSMR analysis.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,Wang M,1,1660,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

36277725,Progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus after gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed by IADPSG criteria: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To estimate the progression rates to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) diagnosed by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) criteria. Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted by searching Medline, Embase, and Cochrane between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2021 for observational studies investigating progression to T2DM after GDM. Inclusion criteria were IADPSG-diagnosed GDM, studies with both GDM and controls, postpartum follow-up duration at least one year. Data were pooled by random effects meta-analysis models. Heterogeneity was assessed by I<sub>2</sub> statistic. The pooled relative risk for incidence of T2DM and pre-diabetes between GDM participants and controls were estimated. Reasons for heterogeneity among studies were investigated by prespecified subgroup and meta-regression analysis. Publication bias was assessed by the Begg's and Egger's tests. This meta-analysis of six studies assessed a total of 61932 individuals (21978 women with GDM and 39954 controls). Women with IADPSG-diagnosed GDM were 6.43 times (RR=6.43, 95% CI:3.45-11.96) more likely to develop T2DM in the future compared with controls. For GDM women, the cumulative incidence of T2DM was 12.1% (95% CI: 6.9%-17.3%), while the pooled cumulative incidence of T2DM was estimated to be 8% (95% CI: 5-11%) in studies with 1 to 5 years of follow-up and increased to 19% (95% CI: 3-34%) for studies with more than 5 years of follow-up. Women with IADPSG-diagnosed GDM had 3.69 times (RR=3.69, 95% CI:2.70-5.06) higher risk of developing pre-diabetes (including impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance) than controls. Meta-regression analysis showed that the study effect size was not significantly associated with study design, race, length of follow-up, and maternal age (P>0.05). Overall, the studies had a relatively low risk of bias. Women with IADPSG-diagnosed GDM have higher risk of developing T2DM and pre-diabetes. The risk of T2DM in GDM women are higher with longer follow-up duration. Our results highlight the importance of promoting postpartum screening and keeping health lifestyle as well as pharmacological interventions to delay/prevent the onset of T2DM/pre-diabetes in GDM women. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero, identifier (CRD42022314776).",Frontiers in endocrinology,2022-,"Juan J, Sun Y, Wei Y, Wang S, Song G, Yan J, Zhou P, Yang H",8,2366,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
38870560,Incretin therapy in feline diabetes mellitus - A review of the current state of research.,"Incretin hormones potentiate the glucose-induced insulin secretion following enteral nutrient intake. The best characterised incretin hormones are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) which are produced in and secreted from the gut in response to nutrient ingestion. The property of incretins to enhance endogenous insulin secretion only at elevated blood glucose levels makes them interesting therapeutics for type 2 diabetes mellitus with a better safety profile than exogenous insulin. While incretin therapeutics (especially GLP-1 agonists, and more recently also GLP-1 / GIP dual agonists and other drugs that influence the incretin metabolism (e.g., dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors)) are already widely used treatment options for human type 2 diabetes, these drugs are not yet approved for the therapy of feline diabetes mellitus. This review provides an introduction to incretins and feline diabetes mellitus in general and summarises the current study situation on incretins as therapeutics for feline diabetes mellitus to assess their possible future potential in feline medicine. Studies to date on the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) in healthy cats largely confirm their insulinotropic effect known from other species. In diabetic cats, GLP-1RAs appear to significantly reduce glycaemic variability (GV, an indicator for the quality of glycaemic control), which is important for the management of the disease and prevention of long-term complications. However, for widespread use in feline diabetes mellitus, further studies are required that include larger numbers of diabetic cats, and that consider and test a possible need for dose adjustments to overweight and diabetic cats. Also evaluation of the outcome of GLP-1RA monotherapy will be neceessary.",Domestic animal endocrinology,2024-Oct,"Haller N, Lutz TA",2,1835,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
31074371,A Comprehensive Review on Preclinical Diabetic Models.,"Preclinical experimental models historically play a critical role in the exploration and characterization of disease pathophysiology. Further, these in-vivo and in-vitro preclinical experiments help in target identification, evaluation of novel therapeutic agents and validation of treatments. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a multifaceted metabolic disorder of multidimensional aetiologies with the cardinal feature of chronic hyperglycemia. To avoid or minimize late complications of diabetes and related costs, primary prevention and early treatment are therefore necessary. Due to its chronic manifestations, new treatment strategies need to be developed, because of the limited effectiveness of the current therapies. The study included electronic databases such as Pubmed, Web of Science and Scopus. The datasets were searched for entries of studies up to June, 2018. A large number of in-vivo and in-vitro models have been presented for evaluating the mechanism of anti-hyperglycaemic effect of drugs in hormone-, chemically-, pathogen-induced animal models of diabetes mellitus. The advantages and limitations of each model have also been addressed in this review. This review encompasses the wide pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms associated with diabetes, particularly focusing on the challenges associated with the evaluation and predictive validation of these models as ideal animal models for preclinical assessments and discovering new drugs and therapeutic agents for translational application in humans. This review may further contribute to discover a novel drug to treat diabetes more efficaciously with minimum or no side effects.

The essential diabetic difficulties are including cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, inflammation, and retinopathy. Despite developments in glucose decreasing treatments and drugs, these diabetic complications are still ineffectively reversed or prohibited. Several signaling and molecular pathways are vital targets in the new therapies of diabetes. This review assesses the newest researches about the key molecules and signaling pathways as targets of molecular pharmacology in diabetes and diseases related to it for better treatment based on molecular sciences. The disease is not cured by current pharmacological strategies for type 2 diabetes. While several drug combinations are accessible that can efficiently modulate glycemia and mitigate long-term complications, these agents do not reverse pathogenesis, and in practice, they are not established to modify the patient's specific molecular profiling.

37039964,Pre-transplant HbA1c and risk of diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation: a single center retrospective analysis.,"Post-transplant diabetes mellitus occurs in 10-40% of kidney transplant recipients and is associated with increased risk ofÂ developingÂ cardiovascular diseases. Early identification of patients with a higher risk of developing diabetesÂ could allow to take timely measures. However, no validated model exists to predict the risk of post-transplant diabetes mellitus. This retrospective study includes 267 adult patients who underwent kidney transplantation at the Antwerp University Hospital between January 2014 and August 2021. Post-transplant diabetes mellitus was diagnosed based on the American Diabetes Association definition at 3Â months post-transplant. First, a logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors for post-transplant diabetes mellitus. Second, criteria to identify patients with a high risk (>â35%) of developing post-transplant diabetes mellitus at 3Â months were established. At 3Â months post-transplantation, 54 (20.2%) patients developed post-transplant diabetes mellitus. Univariable analysis showed that age, body mass index and HbA1c on the day of transplantation were associated with post-transplant diabetes mellitus. However, in a multivariable model with the same parameters, only HbA1c remained statistically significant. An absolute increase in HbA1c of 0.1% increases the odds for developing post-transplant diabetes mellitus by 28% (95% confidence interval 1.15-1.42). An HbA1c levelââ¥â5.3% at transplantation, regardless of age or body mass index, is sufficient to identify patients with a post-transplant diabetes mellitus risk ofââ¥â35% with a positive predictive value of 39% and a negative predictive value of 88%. The HbA1c value at transplantation was the strongest predictor for post-transplant diabetes mellitus at 3Â months post-transplant. Furthermore, at least in our population,Â a pre-transplant HbA1c ofââ¥â5.3% can be usedÂ as an easy tool to identify patients at high risk of early post-transplant diabetes mellitus.",Journal of nephrology,2023-Sep,"Laghrib Y, Massart A, de Fijter JW, Abramowicz D, De Block C, Hellemans R",6,1974,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
32413571,Therapeutic approaches to diabetic cardiomyopathy: Targeting the antioxidant pathway.,"The global epidemic of cardiovascular disease continues unabated and remains the leading cause of death both in the US and worldwide. We hereby summarize the available therapies for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in diabetics. Clearly, the current approaches to diabetic heart disease often target the manifestations and certain mediators but not the specific pathways leading to myocardial injury, remodeling and dysfunction. Better understanding of the molecular events determining the evolution of diabetic cardiomyopathy will provide insight into the development of specific and targeted therapies. Recent studies largely increased our understanding of the role of enhanced inflammatory response, ROS production, as well as the contribution of Cyp-P450-epoxygenase-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET), Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator-1Î± (PGC-1Î±), Heme Oxygenase (HO)-1 and 20-HETE in pathophysiology and therapy of cardiovascular disease. PGC-1Î± increases production of the HO-1 which has a major role in protecting the heart against oxidative stress, microcirculation and mitochondrial dysfunction.

34369715,Role of Heavy Metals in Diabetes: Mechanisms and Treatment Strategies.,"Toxic metals affecting metabolic pathways have a broad range in the ecosystem from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Because of constant contamination from waste and untreated chemical effluents, their emissions have risen significantly over the last few decades, quickly gaining attention due to their crucial role in the development of several metabolic disorders, notably diabetes mellitus. Cadmium and arsenic not only spread widely in our atmosphere but are also linked to a wide range of health hazards. These are primarily accumulated in the liver, kidney, and pancreas once they reach the human body, where they have deleterious effects on the metabolism of glucose and its association with other metabolic pathways, particularly glycolysis, glycogenesis, and gluconeogenesis, by altering and impairing the specific activity of major enzymes. Impairment of hepatic glucose homeostasis plays a crucial role in diabetes mellitus pathogenesis. Impaired liver and kidney functions, as well as decreased pancreatic and muscle function, also contribute significantly to elevated levels of blood glucose. Heavy metals have the potential to cause changes in the conformation in these enzymes. They also impair hormonal balance by destroying the pancreas and adrenal glands. Such metals often facilitate the development of reactive oxygen species and inhibit antioxidant defense mechanisms, with multiple organs subsequently damaged. This review briefly discusses the involvement of heavy metals in metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, the enzymes involved in this pathway, and glucose homeostasis.",Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression,2021-,"Javaid A, Akbar I, Javed H, Khan U, Iftikhar H, Zahra D, Rashid F, Ashfaq UA",8,1613,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
35619303,Telemedicine for Diabetes Mellitus Management in Older Adults: A Systematic Review.,"Diabetes mellitus affects almost 20% of the world's population between 65 and 99 years old. The care for this disease urges a complex, multidisciplinary, and stepwise approach. Telemedicine has been evaluated, and clinical trials as well as systematic reviews have been performed, and most have shown the benefits of its use in DM management. However, as the prevalence of diabetes mellitus increases, as well as the population ages, considerations regarding access and compliance of older patients to such technologies arise. The study aimed to determine the efficacy of telemedicine medical consultations in comparison to standard face-to-face consultations. A systematic literature search to identify trials investigating the effect of telemedicine medical consultations in clinical-laboratory aspects of DM management was conducted. The search was carried out in electronic databases: Medline, EMBASE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the CENTRAL Cochrane. Two authors independently assessed the included studies using the proper bias assessment tool for each study design. In agreement with the eligibility criteria, three studies were included. In terms of the main outcome, HbA1c, only one out of three articles showed a significant difference between the groups, favoring patients in the telemedicine group. With respect to blood pressure, Sood A reported that the usual care group exhibited a greater improvement in systolic blood pressure with statistical differences. All other results displayed no significant statistical difference between the groups. Also, no statistical difference was found in most of the lipid profile results.

Retrospective analysis of the clinical and genetic profile of 12 NDM patients. Eight patients presented with NDM before the age of 6 mo. Three other patients, including 2 siblings presented in later part of infancy. An additional patient was diagnosed at age 5 y with the same etiology as her infant sibling. Four patients had transient diabetes [TNDM:1 each with a mutation in KCNJ11 and INS gene, 2 with ABCC8 mutation], 7 had permanent diabetes [PNDM: 2 siblings with complete glucokinase deficiency, 2 siblings with thiamine responsive megaloblastic anemia (TRMA), 1 with Immune dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome and 2 with Wolcott Rallison syndrome, (WRS)]. Four patients had 5 novel mutations. Genetic etiology could not be established in 1 patient with features of insulin resistance. Poorly controlled blood glucose in the TRMA patient led to hyperglycemia-induced hemichorea-hemiballismus, a rare manifestation in children.

34040951,Health System Capacity and Access Barriers to Diagnosis and Treatment of CVD and Diabetes in Nepal.,"Universal access to essential medicines and routine diagnostics is required to combat the growing burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Evaluating health systems and various access dimensions availability, affordability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality is crucial yet rarely performed, especially in low- and middle-income countries. To evaluate health system capacity and barriers in accessing diagnostics and essential medicines for CVD and diabetes in Nepal. We conducted a WHO/HAI nationally-representative survey in 45 health-facilities (public-sector: 11; private-sector: 34) in Nepal to collect availability and price data for 21 essential medicines for treating CVD and diabetes, during MayJuly 2017. Data for 13 routine diagnostics was obtained in 12 health facilities. Medicines were considered unaffordable if the lowest paid worker spends >1 days wage to purchase a monthly supply. To evaluate accessibility, we conducted facility exit interviews among 636 CVD patients. Accessibility (e.g., private-public health facility mix, travel to hospital/pharmacy) and acceptability (i.e. Nepals adoption of WHO Essential Medicine List, and patient medication adherence) were summarized using descriptive statistics, and we conducted a systematic review of relevant literature. We did not evaluate medicine quality. We found that mean availability of generic medicines is low (<50%) in both public and private sectors, and less than one-third medicines met WHOs availability target (80%). Mean (SD) availability of diagnostics was 73.1% (26.8%). Essential medicines appear locally unaffordable. On average, the lowest-paid worker would spend 1.03 (public-sector) and 1.26 (private-sector) days wages to purchase a monthly supply. For a person undergoing CVD secondary preventive-interventions in the private sector, the associated expenditure would be 7.511.2% of monthly household income. Exit-interviews suggest that a long/expensive commute to health-facilities and poor medicine affordability constrain access. This study highlights critical gaps in Nepals health system capacity to offer basic health services to CVD and diabetes patients, owing to low availability, poor affordability and accessibility of essential medicines and diagnostics. Research and policy initiatives are needed to ensure uninterrupted supply of affordable essential medicines and diagnostics.",Global heart,2021-May,"Sharma A, Kaplan WA, Satheesh G, Poudyal IP, Gyawali P, Neupane D, Bhandari PM, Malla M, Sapkota S, Mishra SR",10,2402,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Indeed, diabetic glomerulopathy is the predominant renal lesion in type 1 diabetes, although also tubular, interstitial and arteriolar lesions are present in the advanced stages of renal disease. In contrast, in type 2 diabetes renal lesions are heterogeneous, and a substantial number of type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic kidney disease have mild or absent glomerulopathy with tubulointerstitial and/or arteriolar abnormalities. In addition, a high prevalence of non-diabetic renal diseases, isolated or superimposed on classic diabetic nephropathy lesions have been reported in patients with type 2 diabetes, often reflecting the bias of selecting patients for unusual clinical presentations for renal biopsy. This review focuses on renal structural changes in type 2 diabetes, emphasizing the contribution of research kidney biopsy studies to the understanding of the pathogenesis of DKD and of the structural lesions responsible for the different clinical phenotypes.

This national study aimed to assess the prevalence and clinical aspects of diabetes mellitus in Lebanon with special focus on type 1 (T1DM). A national multistage, random household sample survey was conducted, using face-to-face interviews with 1 questionnaire per household. A total of 4500 households were selected from all areas based on a pre-existing sampling frame of the Lebanese population. The prevalence of previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus in the surveyed population of 17 832 persons (mean age ~36 years) was 7.95%. The prevalence of T1DM in particular was estimated at 0.1%, or almost 1% of all detected cases of diabetes mellitus. Most persons with diabetes mellitus reported obtaining their usual care from endocrinologists rather than primary healthcare physicians. Delayed performance of haemoglobin A1c test was reported in 25% of 1418 patients. Hypoglycaemic episodes recently occurred in 30% of patients; of whom, at least one third required medical attention, including hospital admission.

39106207,Monogenic Diabetes: A Comprehensive Overview and Therapeutic Management of Subtypes of Mody.,"Monogenic diabetes often occurs as a result of single-gene mutations. The illness is minimally affected by environmental and behavioral factors, and it constitutes around one to five percent of all cases of diabetes. Newborn diabetes mellitus (NDM) and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) are the predominant causes of monogenic diabetes, accounting for a larger proportion of cases, while syndromic diabetes represents a smaller percentage. MODY, a group of inherited non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus disorders, is quite common. However, it remains frequently misdiagnosed despite increasing public awareness. The condition is characterized by insulin resistance, the development of diabetes at a young age (before 25 years), mild high blood sugar levels, inheritance in an autosomal dominant pattern, and the preservation of natural insulin production. Currently, there are 14 distinct subtypes of MODY that have been identified. Each subtype possesses distinct characteristics in terms of their frequency, clinical symptoms, severity of diabetes, related complications, and response to medicinal interventions. Due to the clinical similarities, lack of awareness, and high expense of genetic testing, distinguishing between type I (T1D) and type II diabetes mellitus (T2D) can be challenging, resulting in misdiagnosis of this type of diabetes.

Of these, 13,421 had T2DM and 1196 had T1DM. The linear MR analyses were conducted in the UK Biobank with 6838 cases of microvascular diseases and 10,755 controls. Lung function measurements included forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1Â s (FEV1). The study outcome was microvascular diseases, a composite outcome including chronic kidney diseases, retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy. During a median follow-up of 12.1 years, 2668 new-onset microvascular diseases were recorded. FVC (%predicted) was inversely associated with the risk of new-onset microvascular diseases in participants with diabetes (Per SD increment, adjusted HRÂ =Â 0.86; 95%CI:0.83-0.89), T2DM (Per SD increment, adjusted HRÂ =Â 0.86; 95%CI:0.82-0.90) and T1DM (Per SD increment, adjusted HRÂ =Â 0.87; 95%CI: 0.79-0.97), respectively. Similar results were found for FEV1 (%predicted). In MR analyses, genetically predicted FVC (adjusted RRÂ =Â 0.55, 95%CI:0.39-0.77) and FEV1 (adjusted RRÂ =Â 0.48, 95%CI:0.28-0.83) were both inversely associated with microvascular diseases in participants with T1DM. No significant association was found in those with T2DM. Similar findings were found for each component of microvascular diseases. There was a causal inverse association between lung function and risks of microvascular diseases in participants with T1DM, but not in those with T2DM.","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2024-Oct,"Zhou C, Ye Z, Zhang Y, He P, Liu M, Zhang Y, Yang S, Gan X, Nie J, Qin X",10,1775,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
32650008,Pleiotropic effects of anti-diabetic drugs: A comprehensive review.,"Diabetes mellitus characterized by hyperglycaemia presents an array of comorbidities such as cardiovascular and renal failure, dyslipidemia, and cognitive impairments. Populations above the age of 60 are in an urgent need of effective therapies to deal with the complications associated with diabetes mellitus. Widely used anti-diabetic drugs have good safety profiles and multiple reports indicate their pleiotropic effects in diabetic patients or models. This review has been written with the objective of identifying the widely-marketed anti-diabetic drugs which can be efficiently repurposed for the treatment of other diseases or disorders. It is an updated, comprehensive review, describing the protective role of various classes of anti-diabetic drugs in mitigating the macro and micro vascular complications of diabetes mellitus, and differentiating these drugs on the basis of their mode of action. Notably, metformin, the anti-diabetic drug most commonly explored for cancer therapy, has also exhibited some antimicrobial effects. Unlike class specific effects, few instances of drug specific effects in managing cardiovascular complications have also been reported. A major drawback is that the pleiotropic effects of anti-diabetic drugs have been mostly investigated only in diabetic patients. Thus, for effective repurposing, more clinical trials devoted to analyse the effects of anti-diabetic drugs in patients irrespective of their diabetic condition, are required.",European journal of pharmacology,2020-Oct,"Nath M, Bhattacharjee K, Choudhury Y",3,1481,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
38833191,Diabetes and Infectious Diseases with a Focus on Melioidosis.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) leads to impaired innate and adaptive immune responses. This renders individuals with DM highly susceptible to microbial infections such as COVID-19, tuberculosis and melioidosis. Melioidosis is a tropical disease caused by the bacterial pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, where diabetes is consistently reported as the most significant risk factor associated with the disease. Type-2 diabetes is observed in 39% of melioidosis patients where the risk of infection is 13-fold higher than non-diabetic individuals. B. pseudomallei is found in the environment and is an opportunistic pathogen in humans, often exhibiting severe clinical manifestations in immunocompromised patients. The pathophysiology of diabetes significantly affects the host immune responses that play a critical role in fighting the infection, such as leukocyte and neutrophil impairment, macrophage and monocyte inhibition and natural killer cell dysfunction. These defects result in delayed recruitment as well as activation of immune cells to target the invading B. pseudomallei. This provides an advantage for the pathogen to survive and adapt within the immunocompromised diabetic patients. Nevertheless, knowledge gaps on diabetes-infectious disease comorbidity, in particular, melioidosis-diabetes comorbidity, need to be filled to fully understand the dysfunctional host immune responses and adaptation of the pathogen under diabetic conditions to guide therapeutic options.",Current microbiology,2024-Jun,"Uthaya Kumar A, Ahmad Zan M, Ng CL, Chieng S, Nathan S",5,1476,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

We aimed to develop an expert opinion on prediabetes in Lebanon to pave the way for national guidelines tailored for the Lebanese population in the near future. A panel of seven diabetes experts conducted a thorough literature review and discussed their opinions and experiences before coming up with a set of preliminary recommendations for the detection and management of prediabetes in Lebanon. Lebanese physicians employ multiple tests for the diagnosis of prediabetes and no national cut-off values exist. The panel agreed that prediabetes screening should be focused on patients exceeding 45âyears of age with otherwise no risk factors and on adults with risk factors. The panel reached that fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c should be used for prediabetes diagnosis in Lebanon. FPG values of 100-125âmg/dL or HbA1c values of 5.7%-6.4% were agreed upon as indicative of prediabetes. For the management of prediabetes, a three-step approach constituting lifestyle modifications, pharmacological treatment and bariatric surgery is recommended. There should be more focus on research on prediabetes in Lebanon. This preliminary report will be further discussed with the Lebanese Society of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Lipids in 2021 in order to come up with the first Lebanese national guidelines for the detection and management of prediabetes in Lebanon.",Science progress,2021-,"Andari E, Atallah P, Azar S, Echtay A, Jambart S, Saab C, Howlett HC, Al-Naqshbandi M",8,1514,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
33232247,Deep Learning for Diabetes: A Systematic Review.,"Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects an estimated 463 million people worldwide. Aiming to improve the treatment of people with diabetes, digital health has been widely adopted in recent years and generated a huge amount of data that could be used for further management of this chronic disease. Taking advantage of this, approaches that use artificial intelligence and specifically deep learning, an emerging type of machine learning, have been widely adopted with promising results. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the applications of deep learning within the field of diabetes. We conducted a systematic literature search and identified three main areas that use this approach: diagnosis of diabetes, glucose management, and diagnosis of diabetes-related complications. The search resulted in the selection of 40 original research articles, of which we have summarized the key information about the employed learning models, development process, main outcomes, and baseline methods for performance evaluation. Among the analyzed literature, it is to be noted that various deep learning techniques and frameworks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many diabetes-related tasks by outperforming conventional machine learning approaches. Meanwhile, we identify some limitations in the current literature, such as a lack of data availability and model interpretability. The rapid developments in deep learning and the increase in available data offer the possibility to meet these challenges in the near future and allow the widespread deployment of this technology in clinical settings.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2021-Jul,"Zhu T, Li K, Herrero P, Georgiou P",4,1632,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
32341338,Use and abuse of dietary supplements in persons with diabetes.,"The dietary supplement industry has estimated sales of over $30 billion in the US and over $100 billion globally. Many consumers believe that dietary supplements are safer and possibly more effective than drugs to treat diabetes. The sheer volume of the literature in this space makes compiling them into one review challenging, so much so that primarily narrative reviews currently exist. By applying the interactive database supplied by the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health, we identified the top 100 ingredients that appeared most often in dietary supplement products. One-hundred different keyword searches using the ingredient name and the word diabetes were performed using a program developed to automatically scrape PubMed. Each search was retained in a separate Excel spreadsheet, which was then reviewed for inclusion or exclusion. The studies that met the inclusion criteria were evaluated for effect of reducing and controlling diabetes. The PubMed scrape resulted in 6217 studies. For each keyword search only the most recent 100 were retained, which refined the total to 1823 studies. Of these 425 met the screening criteria. The ingredients, fiber, selenium and zinc had the most studies associated with improvement in diabetes. Several popular supplement ingredients (phosphorus, pantothenic acid, calcium, magnesium, glutamine, isoleucine, tyrosine, choline, and creatine monohydrate) did not result in any studies meeting our screening criteria. Our study demonstrates how to automate reviews to filter and collapse literature in content areas that have an enormous volume of studies.

32903709,The Challenges in the Development of Diabetes Prevention and Care Models in Low-Income Settings.,"In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the burden of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes is rapidly rising, overpassing the existing burden of communicable diseases. Patients with diabetes living in low-income communities face unique challenges related to lack of awareness, difficulty in accessing health care systems and medications, and consequently failure in achieving optimal diabetes management and preventing complications. Effective diabetes prevention and care models could help reduce the rising burden by standardizing guidelines for prevention and management, improving access to care, engaging community and peers, improving the training of professionals and patients and using the newest technology in the management of the disease. In this article, we review the latest research and evidence on effective models of diabetes prevention and diabetes care delivery in low- income settings.

38642828,Virus-induced diabetes mellitus: revisiting infection etiology in light of SARS-CoV-2.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is comprised of two predominant subtypes: type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), accounting for approximately 5Â % of cases worldwide and resulting from autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing Î²-cells, and type 2 (T2DM), accounting for approximately 95Â % of cases globally and characterized by the inability of pancreatic Î²-cells to meet the demand for insulin due to a relative Î²-cell deficit in the setting of peripheral insulin resistance. Both types of DM involve derangement of glucose metabolism and are metabolic diseases generally considered to be initiated by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Viruses have been reported to play a role as infectious etiological factors in the initiation of both types of DM in predisposed individuals. Among the reported viral infections causing DM in humans, the most studied include coxsackie B virus, cytomegalovirus and hepatitis C virus. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the diabetogenic potential of SARS-CoV-2, rekindling interest in the field of virus-induced diabetes (VID).

33674220,Do adult patients with diabetes mellitus living in rural part of Ethiopia and having poor social support have disproportionately poor self-care practice? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis is aimed at determining the pooled national percentage of diabetic self-care practice and its determinants among adult diabetic patients in Ethiopian. Different electronic databases including PubMed/Medline and search engines such as Google scholar were used to retrieve published studies. The Joanna Briggs Institute quality appraisal checklists were used to appraise the quality of studies. Data were extracted using excel spreadsheets and analyses were done by STATA 14. Heterogeneity among studies was diagnosed using the I<sup>2</sup> test. The DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was employed for substantial heterogeneity (I2 > 50%). The pooled estimate of diabetic self-care and odds ratio was reported based on the 95% CI. A total of 3861 studies were identified, of which only 19 studies have reached the final qualitative synthesis and quantitative analysis. Well over half of the Ethiopian diabetic patients have good self-care 54.04% (47.07-61.01, I<sup>2</sup> = 97.3, P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis by region showed that the highest pooled estimate was observed in Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples 81.96% (71.85-92.04), I<sup>2</sup> = 89.1, p < 0.002), whereas the lowest was from the Harari region 44.53% (32.16-56.89%) I<sup>2</sup> = 94%, p < 0.001). Being knowledgeable about diabetes Mellitus 2.69 (1.62, 4.46; I2 = 99%, p < 0.001), having good social support 2.25 (1.49-3.39; I<sup>2</sup> = 99%, p = 0.00), owning private glucometer 3.04(1.64, 5.65; I<sup>2</sup> = 97.4, P < 0.001), and being urban residents 3.26 (2.24, 4.74; I<sup>2</sup> = 96.3%, P < 0.001) promote diabetic victims to apply self-care practice. Despite the life-threatening complications of diabetes Mellitus, the percentage of patients applying self-care has remained low in Ethiopia, depicting the high proportion of diabetic patients are prone to develop long and short-term sequelae of diabetes Mellitus. Therefore, improving the client's awareness about the disease and counseling clients about the significance of social support are believed to be possible strategies to improve self-care practice and policymakers are strongly recommended to combat complications to attain sustainable development goal 3.4 Aims to reduce premature death.

It affects more than 463 million people worldwide and is expected to reach 700 million by 2045. In the Southeast Asian region, the prevalence of DM has tripled to 115 million due to rapid urbanization, unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyles, and genetic factors. In Nepal, a developing country, DM affects 8.5% of adults, with an alarming increase in recent years. Lack of diabetes education and limited populational adoption of behavioural changes further hamper care. In the present study, we performed a scoping review to determine the status of awareness, attitudes, and knowledge about diabetes in the Nepalese population with a focus on the educational initiatives that have been implemented. We also conducted a two-week international case study discussion among medical students to brainstorm viable intervention strategies. Our findings indicate that limited data is available on the level of education or initiatives to improve knowledge and practice among healthcare professionals and community members. Targeted studies of people with diabetes also present heterogeneous results due to differences in the sample population, geographic location, education, age, and gender. Accordingly, we propose five interrelated education-based strategies that leverage existing networks to expand community outreach and engagement, improve system resilience, and improve health outcomes.

Thus, it is of utmost importance to detect heart failure in patients with diabetes and to screen all patients with heart failure for the presence of diabetes. Moreover, the diagnosis of heart failure in diabetes often requires an adjustment of medical therapy.

It currently finds itself in a state of taxonomic dereliction and requires a long overdue refurbishment. Correct conceptualisation is a key precondition for knowledge development in this disorder. This article lays out the epistemological foundation for diabetes of the exocrine pancreas (DEP) and presents a synthesis of the current interdisciplinary discourse on diagnosing and classifying DEP. A diagnosis of DEP in people with no medical records of pre-existing diabetes is generally based on the most up-to-date biochemical criteria endorsed by the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes. The presence of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction is not considered a mandatory diagnostic criterion for DEP but is rather a significant risk factor for developing DEP. DEP principally comprises post-pancreatitis diabetes mellitus, pancreatic cancer-related diabetes, and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, which are mutually exclusive with autoimmune diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Other exclusions and stipulations apply. The DEP criteria will be instrumental in aiding optimal design and conduct of clinical studies, uniform collection of health utilisation data, meaningful comparison of scientific findings across countries, and clear communication among stakeholders (healthcare providers, patients, medical regulatory authorities, pharmaceutical industry).",European journal of endocrinology,2021-Apr,"Petrov MS, Basina M",2,1531,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
31490762,Dietary Phytonutrients in the Prevention of Diabetes-related Complications.,"The increasing prevalence of reported cases of diabetes has evidently become a major global public health concern. Although diabetes management is possible by the administration of synthetic anti-diabetic agents, there are profound side-effects associated with their long-term usage. Hence there is a demand for safer alternatives which could be possibly formulated using specific yet common phytonutrients. The main objective of this review is to describe the cellular mechanisms of phytonutrients as an alternative to commercially available synthetic anti-diabetic agents in the management of diabetes and related complications. Furthermore, the clinical evidence that supports this view is also highlighted. An in-depth review of published literature was carried out to identify the most promising phytonutrients in the management of diabetes and related complications. A number of phytonutrients are reported to be potential anti-diabetic agents. Few examples include biguanides, resveratrol, lycopene, thymoquinone and quercetin. However, suitable formulations using these phytonutrients and their clinical trials are still underway. Most of the reported findings focus on one aspect of several biochemical processes e.g. enhancement of glucose utilization, antioxidation, induction of insulin production, antiglycation, etc. An in-depth study of phytonutrients with respect to functional, immunological as well as biochemical factors suggesting their efficacy, as well as safety in the management of diabetes, is rarely reported. Our study thus highlights the abundance of clinical evidence of the efficiency of phytonutrients, and at the same time, the scarcity of clinically approved and marketed phytonutrients, as drugs, for the management of diabetes and related complications.",Current diabetes reviews,2020-,"Jha P, Kumari S, Jobby R, Desai N, Ali A",5,1788,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

When diabetes is not well controlled, it can cause complications and affect health-related quality of life. Determining the burden of diabetes in elderly patients can provide a good health-related quality of life. The study was conducted to examine the relationship between diabetes burden and health-related quality of life in elderly patients with diabetes. This is a descriptive and correlational study of 207 patients who applied to the diabetes outpatient clinics of a private and a public hospital in Istanbul. Respondents were completed with ""Personal Information Form for Elderly People"", ""Elderly Diabetes Burden Scale"" and the ""Quality of Life in the Elderly Scale"". Data were analyzed by SPSS. The tests used are Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal Wallis and Spearman Correlation tests. The mean total score from the Elderly Diabetes Burden Scale was 47.13Â Â±Â 11.95 (18-88), and the mean score from the Quality of Life in the Elderly Scale was 19.36Â Â±Â 7.00.

Mean yearly costs per patient were â¬6978, with diabetes care costs of â¬1109. Mean hospital costs of patients exceeded that of the Dutch population three- to sixfold. Total hospital costs increased with age, whereas diabetes expenditure decreased with age (18-40âyears, â¬1575; >70âyears, â¬932). Of all patients with diabetes, 51.3% (nâ=â99â457) received care related to cardiovascular complications. Micro- and macrovascular complications, or a combination, increased hospital costs (1.4-5.3 times higher). The hospital resource use of Dutch diabetes patients is high, with a large burden of cardiovascular complications. Resource use is rooted mainly in hospital care of diabetes-related complications, not in the treatment of diabetes. Early treatment and prevention of complications remain imperative to taper future healthcare expenditure on patients with diabetes.","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2023-Aug,"de Vries SAG, Bak JCG, Stangenberger VA, Wouters MWJM, Nieuwdorp M, Sas TCJ, Verheugt CL",7,1607,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
31797455,Behaviour change in diabetes: behavioural science advancements to support the use of theory.,"Behaviour is central to the management of diabetes, both for people living with diabetes and for healthcare professionals delivering evidence-based care. This review outlines the evolution of behavioural science and the application of theoretical models in diabetes care over the past 25 years. There has been a particular advancement in the development of tools and techniques to support researchers, healthcare professionals and policymakers in taking a theory-based approach, and to enhance the development, reporting and replication of successful interventions. Systematic guidance, theoretical frameworks and lists of behavioural techniques provide the tools to specify target behaviours, identify why ideal behaviours are not implemented, systematically develop theory-based interventions, describe intervention content using shared terminology, and evaluate their effects. Several examples from a range of diabetes-related behaviours (clinic attendance, self-monitoring of blood glucose, retinal screening, setting collaborative goals in diabetes) and populations (people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, healthcare professionals) illustrate the potential for these approaches to be widely translated into diabetes care. The behavioural science approaches outlined in this review give healthcare professionals, researchers and policymakers the tools to deliver care and design interventions with an evidence-based understanding of behaviour. The challenge for the next 25 years is to refine the tools to increase their use and advocate for the role of theoretical models and behavioural science in the commissioning, funding and delivery of diabetes care.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2020-Mar,"McSharry J, Byrne M, Casey B, Dinneen SF, Fredrix M, Hynes L, Lake AJ, Morrissey E",8,1662,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The WHO Diabetes Compact recommends that countries meet and monitor these targets for diabetes management. Surveillance-ie, continuous, systematic measurement, analysis, and interpretation of data-is a crucial component of public health. In this Personal View, we use the case of India as an illustration of the challenges and future directions needed for a diabetes surveillance system that documents national progress and persistent gaps. To address the growing burdens of diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases, the Government of India has launched programmes such as the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases. Different surveys have provided estimates of the diabetes care continuum of awareness, treatment, and control at the national, state, and, very recently, district level. We reviewed the literature to analyse how these surveys have varied in both their data collection methods and the reported estimates of the diabetes care continuum. We propose an integrated surveillance and monitoring framework to augment decentralised decision making, leveraging the complementary strengths of different surveys and electronic health record databases, such as data obtained by the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases, and building on methodological advances in model-based small-area estimation and data fusion.

We examined the presence of microvascular and macrovascular disease in individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes by glycemic status within 3 years before diagnosis. We identified 159â736 individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink database in England between 2004 and 2017. We used logistic regression models to compare presence of microvascular (retinopathy and nephropathy) and macrovascular (acute coronary syndrome, cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial disease) disease at the time of type 2 diabetes diagnosis by prior glycemic status. Half of the study population (49.9%) had at least one vascular disease, over one-third (37.4%) had microvascular disease, and almost a quarter (23.5%) had a diagnosed macrovascular disease at the time of type 2 diabetes diagnosis.Compared with individuals with glycemic values within the normal range, those detected with pre-diabetes before the diagnosis had 76% and 14% increased odds of retinopathy and nephropathy (retinopathy: adjusted OR (AOR) 1.76, 95%âCI 1.69 to 1.85; nephropathy: AOR 1.14, 95%âCI 1.10 to 1.19), and 7% higher odds of the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (OR 1.07, 95%âCI 1.03 to 1.12) in fully adjusted models at time of diabetes diagnosis. Microvascular and macrovascular diseases are detected in 37%-24% of people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

Prediabetes also predisposes to the development of macrovascular and to a lesser extent of microvascular complications of diabetes. In a large community-based epidemiological study, the Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB), data reported an overall prevalence of prediabetes of 10.3%, derived from 15 Indian states. This shows that the diabetes epidemic is far from over as many of them may soon convert to diabetes. Prediabetes, however, should not be considered a path to diabetes rather it should be a window of opportunity for the prevention of diabetes.

From 1998 to 2004, 159,755 adults from Mexico City were recruited to a prospective study, and from 2015 to 2019, 10,144 survivors were resurveyed. Diabetes was defined as self-reported diagnosis, glucose-lowering medication use, or HbA<sub>1c</sub> â¥6.5%. Controlled diabetes was defined as HbA<sub>1c</sub> <7%. Prevalence estimates were uniformly standardized for age, sex, and residential district. Cox models explored the relevance of controlled and inadequately controlled diabetes to cause-specific mortality. During 1998-2004 and 2015-2019, 99,623 and 8,986 participants were aged 45-84 years. Diabetes prevalence had increased from 26% in 1998-2004 to 35% by 2015-2019. Of those with diabetes, the proportion previously diagnosed had increased from 76% to 89%, and glucose-lowering medication use among them had increased from 80% to 94%. Median HbA<sub>1c</sub> among those with diabetes had decreased from 8.2% to 7.3%, and the proportion of participants with controlled diabetes had increased from 16% to 37%. Use of blood pressure-lowering medication among those with previously diagnosed diabetes had increased from 35% to 51%, and their use of lipid-lowering therapy had increased from 1% to 14%. The excess mortality risk associated with diabetes accounted for 34% of deaths at ages 35-74 years, of which 5% were attributable to controlled and 29% to inadequately controlled diabetes.

33186216,Novel management of diabetes in kidney transplantation.,"Posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a prevalent complication in kidney transplant recipients, and has been associated with worse short-term and long-term outcomes. While hyperglycemia is frequently seen in the early posttransplant period because of surgical stress, infection, and use of high-dose steroids, the diagnosis of PTDM should be established after patients are clinically stable and on stable maintenance immunosuppression. In the early posttransplant period, hyperglycemia is typically treated with insulin, and pilot data have suggested potential benefit of lower vs. higher glycemic targets in this setting. Growing data indicate lifestyle modifications, including dietary interventions, physical activity, and mitigation of obesity, are associated with improved posttransplant outcomes. While there are limited data to support a first-line antidiabetic medication for PTDM, more established pharmacotherapies such as sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and dipetidyl peptidase IV inhibitors are commonly used. Given recent trials showing the benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists upon kidney outcomes in nontransplant patients, further study of these agents specifically in kidney transplant recipients are urgently needed. Increasing evidence supports a multidisciplinary approach, including lifestyle modification, obesity treatment, judicious immunosuppression selection, and careful utilization of novel antidiabetic therapies in PTDM patients.",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,2021-Jan,"Ong SC, Rhee CM",2,1524,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Despite the improvements in therapy, the clinical management of DM patients remains challenging as they develop more extensive CAD at a younger age and consistently have worse clinical outcomes than non-DM patients. Current diagnostic modalities as well as revascularisation treatments mainly focus on ischemic lesions. However, the impact of plaque morphology and composition are emerging as strong predictors of adverse cardiac events even in the absence of identified ischemia. In particular, the presence of vulnerable plaques such as thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) lesions has been identified as a very strong predictor of future adverse events. This emphasises the need for an approach combining both functional and morphological methods in the assessment of lesions. In particular, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has proven to be a valuable asset by truly identifying TCFAs. New treatment strategies should consist of individualised and advanced medical regimens and may evolve towards plaque sealing through percutaneous treatment.",Cardiovascular diabetology,2023-May,"Hommels TM, Hermanides RS, Fabris E, Kedhi E",4,1211,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

We aimed to investigate changes in these outcomes of diabetes as depressive symptoms aggravate. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 14 328 participants in the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants were classified into depressive symptom groups of none, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depending on their Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted in three models adjusted for expanding confounders to evaluate the associations between severity of depressive symptoms and prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of DM. As depressive symptom severity worsened, both prevalence and awareness of DM increased regardless of models (p value for trend <0.01 in all models for prevalence and awareness; adjusted OR (aOR) 2.14, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.56 for prevalence in the severe group, model 1; aOR 2.43, 95% CI 1.27 to 4.64 for awareness in the moderately severe group, model 1).

32458291,Review of the veteran affairs diabetes trial: Lessons learned.,"Despite robust evidence linking long-term hyperglycemia with cardiovascular complications, several large randomized trials found only modest benefits from intensive compared to standard glucose control. Of these trials, the Veteran Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT), offers a unique long-term perspective in that there were analyses of outcomes at the end of the intervention trial, 5-years post-trial, and after 10-years post-trial. From the VADT and other large trials, we draw several valuable lessons that are relevant to the care of patients with type 2 diabetes. Intensive glucose control reduces development of nephropathy and retinopathy but not neuropathy, though evaluations of neuropathy are less consistent and conclusions regarding outcomes less reliable. While the VADT did not demonstrate reduction in cardiovascular outcomes at completion of the glucose lowering intervention, it did demonstrate a 17% reduction 5-years post-trial, which waned by 10-years post-trial observation. Of interest, the 5-year post trial period included 3 additional years of HbA1c separation between treatment groups which suggests that longer-term glucose control may be needed before benefits are seen. Other factors including hypoglycemia and increased glucose variation are also associated with cardiovascular events and are more prevalent during intensive glucose control, potentially lessening the benefit of lowering average glucose levels. Finally, intensive glucose control requires substantial effort from both the patient and clinician perspective. All of these factors must be kept in mind when considering the benefits of aggressive glucose control for each patient.",Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,2020-Dec,"Tran K, Reaven P",2,1669,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

32198703,Novel Challenges in Aging with Type 1 Diabetes.,"Due to treatment advancements, individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are living longer, presenting a unique understudied population with advanced complex needs. This article is a review of the aging literature in T1D and identifies existing gaps while serving as a call to the research community. Recent studies have identified an association between cognitive impairment and glycemic variability, as well as increased risk and frequency of hypoglycemia in older adults with T1D. However, limited research exists about additional physical and mental health conditions and barrier to successful treatment in this population. Older adults may experience both age- and diabetes-related barriers to diabetes management. Due to the scarcity of aging T1D research, current treatment guidelines for this age group are based on type 2 diabetes research. There is a critical need to further investigate the physical and mental effects of T1D and aging as well as public health policy; insurance challenges; and needs for support and interventions for older adults with T1D.",Current diabetes reports,2020-Mar,"Bispham JA, Hughes AS, Driscoll KA, McAuliffe-Fogarty AH",4,1065,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
33403912,"Feline comorbidities: Recognition, diagnosis and management of the cushingoid diabetic.","Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common feline endocrinopathy, and is often driven by underlying insulin resistance with associated pancreatic beta (Î²)-cell dysfunction. Although spontaneous hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) with hypercortisolemia (hypercortisolism) is relatively uncommon in cats, it is a well-established cause of insulin resistance and is routinely associated with DM in this species. Many of the clinical signs associated with feline HAC are subtle and may be attributed to concurrent DM or the aging process. Failure to recognize HAC in the diabetic cat can impact patient wellbeing and predispose the patient to progressive compromise. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to establish a diagnosis of HAC, as test results may be influenced by poor diabetic regulation, and protocols are different to those used in canine patients. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause, and often require careful, ongoing assessment and modulation of both adrenal function and insulin requirements. However, various approaches have been shown to either improve glycemic control in cats with sustained insulin dependence, or facilitate diabetic remission. This review summarizes the current literature on feline HAC, with a particular focus on cats with concurrent DM. The clinical findings that suggest HAC are discussed, along with an outline of diagnostic options and their limitations. Published outcomes for various medical options, surgical procedures and radiation therapy are provided. The authors also share their thoughts on the safe and effective management of cats with HAC and DM, with an emphasis on the anticipation and recognition of changing insulin requirements.",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,2021-Jan,"Cook AK, Evans JB",2,1682,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Conflicting findings from previous studies have resulted in inconsistencies in guidelines regarding DR management in pregnancy. Global estimates of DR prevalence and progression in pregnancy are therefore required to provide clearer information about the overall true burden of DR in this population. To estimate the prevalence of DR and its progression rate in pregnant women with preexisting T1D or T2D diagnosed before pregnancy. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, conducted from November 27, 2018, to June 29, 2021, a systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE/Ovid, Embase/Ovid, and Scopus databases to identify English-language articles that were published from inception through October 2020. Observational studies that reported on DR and its changes in pregnant women with preexisting T1D and T2D. Two independent reviewers extracted relevant data from each included study. Data were pooled using a random-effects model with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. This study followed the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) reporting guidelines. Prevalence of any DR, proliferative DR (PDR), and DR progression rates. A total of 18 observational studies involving 1464 pregnant women with T1D and 262 pregnant women with T2D were included in the analysis. The pooled prevalence of any DR and PDR in early pregnancy was 52.3 (95% CI, 41.9-62.6) and 6.1 (95% CI, 3.1-9.8) per 100 pregnancies, respectively. The pooled progression rate per 100 pregnancies for new DR development was 15.0 (95% CI, 9.9-20.8), worsened nonproliferative DR was 31.0 (95% CI, 23.2-39.2), progression from nonproliferative DR to PDR was 6.3 (95% CI, 3.3-10.0), and worsened PDR was 37.0 (95% CI, 21.2-54.0). DR progression rates per 100 pregnancies were similar between the T1D and T2D groups, except for the development of new DR (T1D groups: 15.8; 95% CI, 10.5-21.9; T2D groups: 9.0; 95% CI, 4.9-14.8). A global trend toward a lower DR progression rate was observed after the 1989 St Vincent Declaration. Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that women with T1D and T2D had a similar risk of DR progression during pregnancy.

This scoping review explored the relationship between self-compassion and adaptive affect, self-regulation and engagement in health-promoting/management behaviours among people with prediabetes or diabetes. We conducted a scoping literature search from 6 databases for studies and conference abstracts. Randomized controlled trials and cross-sectional, longitudinal, observational and qualitative designs focused on self-compassion were included. Eligible studies included adults with diabetes (prediabetes, type 1, type 2 and gestational), measured self-compassion using a validated Self-Compassion Scale (quantitative) or included the 3 components (qualitative) and investigated: negative affect, health promoting/management behaviours and/or self-regulation. After deduplication, 5,338 quantitative and 953 qualitative abstracts, and 18 conference proceedings were screened leaving 35 articles. Full-text screening retained 11 eligible studies (6 cross-sectional studies, 2 randomized controlled trials, 2 longitudinal studies and 1 qualitative study). Higher self-compassion was associated with decreased negative affect in 9 studies and was positively associated with well-being in 1 cross-sectional study. Self-compassion led to decreased negative affect and improved blood glucose in 2 interventions. Five studies found positive associations between self-compassion and health-promoting/management behaviours. One qualitative study found self-compassion to benefit affective reactions, health-promoting behaviours and self-regulation. This review shows that self-compassion is linked to adaptive behavioural and affective responding among people with prediabetes and diabetes, and the need for more research on self-compassion and self-regulation in these populations.",Canadian journal of diabetes,2020-Aug,"Morgan TL, Semenchuk BN, Ceccarelli L, Kullman SM, Neilson CJ, Kehler DS, Duhamel TA, Strachan SM",8,2103,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
33860488,Metformin for Preventing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Women with a Previous Diagnosis of Gestational Diabetes: A Narrative Review.,"Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) when compared with women who have not had GDM. To delay or prevent T2DM, guidelines recommend regular screening in the primary care setting and lifestyle interventions that are largely focused on dietary and physical activity modifications. As the postpartum period can be challenging for women, uptake and engagement in screening and lifestyle interventions have been poor. Poor uptake and engagement places women with a history of GDM at heightened risk for future morbidity and development of T2DM. Metformin has been a longstanding and safe treatment for the control of blood glucose in people with T2DM. Research has supported the efficacy of metformin, used as an adjunct to a lifestyle intervention or as a stand-alone treatment, in preventing T2DM in people at high risk of T2DM. Findings from longitudinal studies have demonstrated the potential for metformin to reduce conversion to T2DM when used by women with a previous diagnosis of GDM. This review examines the potential effectiveness of metformin to reduce the incidence of T2DM among women with a previous diagnosis of GDM in the ""real-world"" setting.",Seminars in reproductive medicine,2020-Nov,"Versace VL, Beks H, Wesley H, McNamara K, Hague W, Anjana RM, Mohan V, Khunti K, Dunbar JA",9,1244,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
39408828,Monogenic Defects of Beta Cell Function: From Clinical Suspicion to Genetic Diagnosis and Management of Rare Types of Diabetes.,"Monogenic defects of beta cell function refer to a group of rare disorders that are characterized by early-onset diabetes mellitus due to a single gene mutation affecting insulin secretion. It accounts for up to 5% of all pediatric diabetes cases and includes transient or permanent neonatal diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), and various syndromes associated with diabetes. Causative mutations have been identified in genes regulating the development or function of the pancreatic beta cells responsible for normal insulin production and/or release. To date, more than 40 monogenic diabetes subtypes have been described, with those caused by mutations in <i>HNF1A</i> and <i>GCK</i> genes being the most prevalent. Despite being caused by a single gene mutation, each type of monogenic diabetes, especially MODY, can appear with various clinical phenotypes, even among members of the same family. This clinical heterogeneity, its rarity, and the fact that it shares some features with more common types of diabetes, can make the clinical diagnosis of monogenic diabetes rather challenging. Indeed, several cases of MODY or syndromic diabetes are accurately diagnosed in adulthood, after having been mislabeled as type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The recent widespread use of more reliable sequencing techniques has improved monogenic diabetes diagnosis, which is important to guide appropriate treatment and genetic counselling. The current review aims to summarize the latest knowledge on the clinical presentation, genetic confirmation, and therapeutic approach of the various forms of monogenic defects of beta cell function, using three imaginary clinical scenarios and highlighting clinical and laboratory features that can guide the clinician in reaching the correct diagnosis.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024-Sep,"Serbis A, Kantza E, Siomou E, Galli-Tsinopoulou A, Kanaka-Gantenbein C, Tigas S",6,1798,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

However, the result of these studies lacks consistency. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis estimates the pooled level of HRQoL and their associated factors among diabetic patients in sub-Saharan countries. Electronic databases predominantly PubMed were searched. Databases, such as Google and Google scholar, were searched for gray literature. A funnel plot and Egger's regression test were used to see publication bias. Heterogeneity of the studies was checked by Forest plot and I-squared statistic. Both inverse-variance fixed-effect and DerSimonian and Laird random-effects methods were applied to estimate the pooled level of HRQoL (for both WHO-QoL-BREF and SF-36) and the effect size of associated factors. From a total 776 retrieved studies, 16 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled mean score of physical health, psychological, social relation and environmental health domain of WHO-QoL-BREF were 43.12, 47.40, 46.60 and 45.59 respectively. Age had a significant association (pooled Î²â=â-â0.47), (pooled Î²â=â-â0.24), (pooled Î²â=â-â0.32) and (pooled Î²â=â-â0.03) with physical health, psychological health, social relation and environmental health domains respectively. Being rural residence (pooled Î²â=â-â0.32) was inversely associated with environmental health domain of WHO-QoL-BREF. Increased fasting blood sugar had a significant association (pooled Î²â=â-â0.08, 95% CI -â0.11, -â0.05), (pooled Î²â=â-â0.07) and (pooled Î²â=â-â0.004) with physical health, psychological health and environmental health domains respectively. Having Co-morbidity (pooled Î²â=â-â6.25) and diabetes related complication (pooled Î²â=â-â5.65) were contrarily related to physical health domain of WHO-QoL-BREF. The pooled mean of physical and environmental domains of HRQOL scores was the least compared to the psychological and social domains. Being Old age and rural residence, increased fasting blood sugar, having co-morbidity and diabetic related complications were contrarily related to level of HRQoL. Therefore, we recommend that early detection and treatment of diabetes related complication and comorbidity and control of fasting blood sugar.

32566680,Measuring the Quality of Life in Diabetic Patients: A Scoping Review.,"Diabetes mellitus is a widely diffused chronic condition which impacts on several aspects of patients' lives. In the current clinical practice, the implementation in the clinical routine of monitoring systems of patients' outcomes has led to an increased generation and use of several measures for the assessment of patients' quality of life (QOL). Nevertheless, this construct appears to be particularly complex, and its operationalization is variable across different measures. The purpose of this paper is to offer an updated review of the diabetes-specific QOL measures present in scientific literature with a specific focus on the broad domains assessed. A scoping review was carried out with the purpose of identifying the existing measures in literature and describing their implicit representation of QOL in diabetes care. Five different databases (Scopus; Web of Science Core Collection; Medline; PsycInfo; and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched with a string including validation studies of adult-only, diabetes-specific QOL measures. Each measure was then qualified according to its structure, a qualitative assessment of the broad domains of QOL it comprises, and finally an overview of the psychometric properties of its first validation. 30 scales were identified and assessed. Theme analysis shows that QOL is operationalized with multidimensional surveys comprising of both mental, physical, and social health components. Some scales also consider the impact of societal attitudes, public policies, and context on QOL. Several self-report measures of QOL specifically developed for diabetic patients exist in scientific literature. The present scoping review reports scales structure, broad domains of QOL, and development purpose. This may help in understanding the concept of QOL in diabetic patients and may also serve the purpose of guiding the reader in the choice of the most appropriate instrument or in the development of a new one.",Journal of diabetes research,2020-,"Palamenghi L, Carlucci MM, Graffigna G",3,1983,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Poor glycemic control, longer duration, and poor medication adherence increased the risk of DM complications. Comprehensive evidence on the pooled prevalence of microvascular complications in DM patients in Ethiopia is not available. Furthermore, individual study findings for the prevalence of microvascular complications in DM patients, and associated factors were not consistent. This systemic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the pooled prevalence of microvascular complications in DM patients, and its associated risk factors in Ethiopia. Systematic search on Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct electronic database, Google Scholar search engine, and library registration was used to identify relevant studies following reviews and meta-analysis guidelines. Microsoft Excel spreadsheets were used to extract data, and Extracted data was analyzed using STATA software version 17.0. A Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the role of each study in the final result and the presence of publication bias was assessed by Egger's test. Heterogeneity across studies was checked by Cochran's Q statistic and I2 statistics and significant heterogeneity was assessed using subgroup analysis. The pooled prevalence of microvascular complications in DM patients was 32.89Â % (95Â % CI: 28.17-37.60). In addition, the pooled prevalence of retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy in DM patients was 17.16Â % (95Â % CI: 12-22Â %), 10.49Â % (95Â % CI: 8-13Â %) and 11.52Â % (95Â % CI: 9-15Â %) respectively.

The impact of DM on public health in developing countries has triggered alarm due to the exaggerated costs of the treatment and monitoring of patients with this disease. Considerable efforts have been made to try to prevent the onset and reduce the complications of DM. However, because insulin-producing pancreatic Î²-cells progressively deteriorate, many people must receive insulin through subcutaneous injection. Additionally, current therapies do not have consistent results regarding the prevention of chronic complications. Leveraging the approval of real-time continuous glucose monitors and sophisticated algorithms that partially automate insulin infusion pumps has improved glycemic control, decreasing the burden of diabetes management. However, these advances are facing physiologic barriers. New findings in molecular and cellular biology have produced an extraordinary advancement in tissue development for the treatment of DM. Obtaining pancreatic Î²-cells from somatic cells is a great resource that currently exists for patients with DM. Although this therapeutic option has great prospects for patients, some challenges remain for this therapeutic plan to be used clinically.

Addressing the heterogeneity of T2D is a major task of diabetes research to lower the high rate of treatment failure as well as to reduce the risk of long-term complications. A pathophysiology-based clustering system seems the most promising to help in the stratification of diabetes in terms of complication risk and response to treatment. This urges for clinical studies looking at novel biomarkers related to the different metabolic pathways of T2D and able to inform about the therapeutic cluster of each patient.

However, compared to households without diabetes, households with diabetes had a significantly higher probability of spending a higher monetary percentage on butter, oil and dressings; non-sugary drinks; processed red meat and ready meals as well as a significantly lower probability of spending a higher monetary percentage on accessory compounds; alcoholic beverages; eggs; grains; rice and pasta, and raw vegetables. Households with diabetes spent a relatively higher monetary value on several unhealthy foods and less on several healthy groceries compared to households without diabetes.

34643502,Glucocorticoid pathway polymorphisms and diabetes after kidney transplantation.,"To find possible associations between new-onset diabetes after transplantation and polymorphisms in glucocorticoid pathway. A total of 290 patients from our national cohort of kidney transplant patients with functioning graft transplanted in 6 consecutive years (2010 - 2015) were included in the study. All patients were genotyped for polymorphisms in genes coding for glucocorticoid receptor (<i>NR3C1</i> rs33389, rs6198 and rs33388), P-glycoprotein (<i>ABCB1</i> rs1045642, rs1128503, and rs2032582), and glutathione S-transferase P1 (<i>GSTP1</i> rs1695 and rs1138272). For interim analysis, clinical data were obtained from medical records for 79 patients. 22.8% of patients developed NODAT in the first post-transplant year. <i>GSTP1 rs1695</i> and <i>rs1138272</i> polymorphisms were associated with an increased risk for NODAT. <i>NR3C1</i> rs6198 polymorphism was associated with higher serum glucose at the end of the first post-transplant year. The observed incidence of NODAT in the first post-transplant year is in accordance with the literature data. <i>GSTP1</i> genotypes leading to decreased conjugation capacity were associated with higher probability of NODAT. As these polymorphisms can be determined already before kidney transplantation, they can help planning early glucocorticoid withdrawal if a favorable post-transplant course permits it.",Clinical nephrology,,"Pahor K, Maver B, Blagus T, VonÄina B, Praznik M, GoriÄar K, DolÅ¾an V, Arnol M, MlinÅ¡ek G",9,1365,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
32539915,Recent clinical advances of glucokinase activators in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2.,"Glucokinase (GK) is an isozyme of hexokinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose. GK is present in many organs of the human body, including the liver and pancreas. GK plays an important role in promoting the synthesis of hepatic glycogen and balancing postprandial blood glucose. Mutations in the GK gene can result in the inclusion of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY2) and permanent neonatal Diabetes mellitus (PNDM). Glucokinase activators (GKAs) are a class of type 2 diabetes drugs designed for this target. In various animal models of type 2 diabetes, GKAs have been shown to have the ability to decrease blood glucose, and some GKAs also have the ability to stimulate Î² cell proliferation. However, due to the induction of hypoglycemia and increased liver burden, many candidates stopped in phase II clinical trials. Recently, dorzagliatin has reached the primary endpoint of phase III clinical trial, which can repair the core function of GK as a blood glucose sensor, and can delay or even reverse islet Î² -cell damage and functional decline. This provides a promising prospect for the study of GKAs as candidates for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This review summarizes the clinical advances in GKAs.",Die Pharmazie,2020-Jun,"Li W, Zhang X, Sun Y, Liu Z",4,1234,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

36757165,Adverse Effects of Tacrolimus and Its Associated Risk Factors in Renal Transplant Recipients.,"Tacrolimus, an important constituent of the immunosuppressant regimen for renal transplant recipients, can result in posttransplant diabetes mellitus. The adverse effect profile of tacrolimus is yet to be completely understood. The relationship between the blood level of tacrolimus and development of posttransplant diabetes mellitus has not been clearly elucidated in Indian populations. We conducted this study to investigate the frequency of posttransplant diabetes mellitus and other adverse effects of tacrolimus, to enumerate the risk factors associated with posttransplant diabetes mellitus development, and to correlate the blood levels of tacrolimus with its occurrence. This prospective observational study included 77 renal transplant patients receiving tacrolimus. The blood sugar levels (fasting and postprandial) were monitored, and patients were asked regularly about the adverse effects of tacrolimus experienced by them for 6 months posttransplant. Trough levels of tacrolimus in blood were correlated with occurrence of posttransplant diabetes mellitus. Posttransplant diabetes mellitus developed in 62.3% (48/77) of renal transplant recipients on a tacrolimus-based regimen. Other adverse effects observed included tremors, diarrhea, alopecia, cyto- megalovirus infection, headache, biopsy-proven calci- neurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and BK virus infection. Higher tacrolimus trough level at month 1 posttransplant was significantly associated with the development of posttransplant diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio = 1.379; 95% CI, 1.02-1.86). The best cutoff of tacrolimus trough level at month 1 posttransplant to reduce the risk of posttransplant diabetes mellitus was 8.1 ng/mL. There was a 5 times increased risk of developing posttransplant diabetes mellitus when tacrolimus trough level at month 1 posttransplant was >8.1 ng/mL (adjusted odds ratio = 5.4; 95% CI, 1.4-19.9). Posttransplant diabetes mellitus is a common adverse effect of tacrolimus among renal transplant recipients. A trough level >8.1 ng/mL at month 1 posttransplant was an important predictor for posttransplant diabetes mellitus.",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,2023-Jan,"Meera M, Manikandan S, Parameswaran S",3,2160,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

This is a qualitative study where participants were invited to respond by direct interview to a standard questionnaire that is validated by the World Health Organization (WHO), ""Tool for Assessment of Diabetic Retinopathy and DM Management Systems"". The questionnaire casts out of the WHO Health Systems Framework concept, assessing the presence of programs, guidelines, health technology and workforce, health promotion, and financing of DM and DR care in Jordan. Forty-two participants were included. DM is considered as priority in Jordan, but no programs are implemented. National guidelines are present for DM but not for DR. Networking should be improved between different disciplines caring for DM and DR. Human resources for DM and DR care were found insufficient and inadequately distributed. Health technology is only present in major cities and central hospitals. There is no nationwide data on disease burden nor a screening program for DR. More collaborated efforts should be spent on health education and raising awareness among people living with diabetes about the risk of DR. Advanced DM and DR care is not accessible to most people.

33475814,Association of diabetes type and chronic diabetes complications with early exit from the labour force: register-based study of people with diabetes in Finland.,"Diabetes and diabetes complications are a cause of substantial morbidity, resulting in early exits from the labour force and lost productivity. The aim of this study was to examine differences in early exits between people with type 1 and 2 diabetes and to assess the role of chronic diabetes complications on early exit. We also estimated the economic burden of lost productivity due to early exits. People of working age (age 17-64) with diabetes in 1998-2011 in Finland were detected using national registers (N<sub>type 1</sub>â=â45,756, N<sub>type 2</sub>â=â299,931). For the open cohort, data on pensions and deaths, healthcare usage, medications and basic demographics were collected from the registers. The outcome of the study was early exit from the labour force defined as pension other than old age pension beginning before age 65, or death before age 65. We analysed the early exit outcome and its risk factors using the Kaplan-Meier method and extended Cox regression models. We fitted linear regression models to investigate the risk factors of lost working years and productivity costs among people with early exit. The difference in median age at early exit from the labour force between type 1 (54.0) and type 2 (58.3) diabetes groups was 4.3Â years. The risk of early exit among people with type 1 diabetes increased faster after age 40 compared with people with type 2 diabetes. Each of the diabetes complications was associated with an increase in the hazard of early exit regardless of diabetes type compared with people without the complication, with eye-related complications as an exception. Diabetes complications partly but not completely explained the difference between diabetes types. The mean lost working years was 6.0Â years greater in the type 1 diabetes group than in the type 2 diabetes group among people with early exit. Mean productivity costs of people with type 1 diabetes and early exit were found to be 1.4-fold greater compared with people with type 2 diabetes. The total productivity costs of incidences of early exits in the type 2 diabetes group were notably higher compared with the type 1 group during the time period (â¬14,400 million, â¬2800 million). We found a marked difference in the patterns of risk of early exit between people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The difference was largest close to statutory retirement age. On average, exits in the type 1 diabetes group occurred at an earlier age and resulted in higher mean lost working years and mean productivity costs. The potential of prevention, timely diagnosis and management of diabetes is substantial in terms of avoiding reductions in individual well-being and productivity.",Diabetologia,2021-Apr,"Kurkela O, Forma L, Ilanne-Parikka P, Nevalainen J, Rissanen P",5,2688,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

We sought to describe the clinical care of individuals with prediabetes, determine patient factors associated with this care, and evaluate risk for diabetes development. Retrospective cohort study using linked claims and electronic health record data. We created a cohort of adults with prediabetes based on laboratory measures. We excluded patients with a prior history of diabetes, pregnancy in prior 6 months, or recent steroid use. We measured ordering and completion of clinical services targeting prediabetes management and diabetes incidence within 12 months following cohort entry. We tested the strength of the association between individuals' characteristics and outcomes of interest using bivariate and multiple logistic regression. Our cohort included 3888 patients with a laboratory diagnosis of prediabetes (incident or prevalent prediabetes). Within 12 months, 63.4% had repeat glycemic testing, yet only 10.4% had coded diagnoses of prediabetes, 1.0% were referred for nutrition services, and 5.4% were prescribed metformin. Most patients completed labs and nutrition visits when referred and filled metformin when prescribed. Individuals with a higher glycemic level or BMI were more likely to receive prediabetes clinical care. Six percent of individuals developed diabetes within 12 months of cohort entry and had higher glycemic levels and BMI â¥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to determine the relationship between metformin use and ND risk based on data from population-based cohort studies. Articles were systematically searched in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs were obtained using a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses and meta-regression were performed to identify the sources of heterogeneity and strengthen the results. Twelve population-based cohort studies involving 194,792 participants (94,462Â metformin users and 100,330Â metformin non-users) were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The pooled RR of NDs reached 0.77 (95% CI 0.67-0.88) when comparing metformin users with non-users. The effects were more prominent in long-term metformin users (â¥4Â years) (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13-0.44) and studies from Asian countries (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.64-0.74).

However, the results on overall healthcare costs and the final health outcome were unclear. It appears that HDHPs negatively impact low-income diabetic patients by leading them to forgo preventive and primary care services and experience excessive preventable emergency department visits.

The Risk Assessment and Management Program (RAMP) in Hong Kong has been providing long-term face-to-face follow-up to DM patients in the government out-patient clinics since 2009. However, under the current outbreak of COVID-19, these face-to-face consultations were ceased over and over again to lower the risk of disease transmission. With the advancement in technology, the recent emergence of telecare has provided an alternative to replace the conventional consultations in the clinics.

35633439,SGLT2 Inhibition in Type 1 Diabetes with Diabetic Kidney Disease: Potential Cardiorenal Benefits Can Outweigh Preventable Risk of Diabetic Ketoacidosis.,"The aim of this review is to summarize existing research investigating the use of sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) while highlighting potential strategies to mitigate the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). SGLT2 inhibitors have been studied in patients with T1DM in phase 3 clinical trials such as the inTandem, DEPICT, and EASE trials, which demonstrated consistent reductions in HbA1c. Secondary analyses of these trials have also reported potential kidney protective effects that are independent of improved glycemic control. However, trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have found an increased risk of DKA with SGLT2 inhibitors, a serious concern in patients with T1DM. SGLT2 inhibitors provide cardiovascular benefits and kidney protection in patients with T2DM and are a promising therapeutic option for patients with T1DM due to overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms. However, SGLT2 inhibitors increase the risk of DKA, and there is currently a lack of research investigating the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T1DM. Preventative measure for DKA would have to be implemented and the risks would need to be carefully balanced with the benefits offered by SGLT2 inhibitors. Additional research will also be required to determine the kidney protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T1DM and diabetic kidney disease and to quantify the risk of DKA after the implementation of preventative measures, proper patient education, and ketone monitoring.",Current diabetes reports,2022-Jul,"Liu H, Sridhar VS, Perkins BA, Rosenstock J, Cherney DZI",5,1582,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
38269835,Surveillance for Diabetes in Hospital-Evaluation of Dashboard Effectiveness.,"There is a large burden of diabetes in Western Sydney, and this descriptor is also valid for the inpatient population. Optimizing diabetes care in hospital is important to prevent inpatient morbidity. A surveillance system was developed to address this need and a diabetes dashboard was developed around a data model built around the patient journey that integrated key data feeds from the pathology, medication, and patient administration systems. This facilitated the rapid identification and triaging of individuals with diabetes. We evaluated this dashboard using high level clinical and financial indicators. This implementation resulted in an improved time to patient review, and a reduction in 28-day readmission rates but the inpatient length of hospital stay was unchanged.

We investigated sudomotor dysfunction in a large group of participants with diabetes, prediabetes, and nondiabetic healthy subjects. This study aimed to complete knowledge on sudomotor dysfunction in this population, especially regarding the threshold values for the electrochemical skin conductance (ESC) and factors affecting it. A total of 690 volunteers in four groups were included in the study (type 1 [T1DG]: nÂ =Â 80, 61.3% women; type 2 diabetes [T2DG]: nÂ =Â 438, 63.5% women; prediabetes [Pre-DG]: nÂ =Â 88, 80.7% women; healthy control [HC-G]: nÂ =Â 84, 67.5% women). All subjects were investigated for clinical diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy and sudomotor dysfunction. The characteristics of participants obtained from outpatient records were evaluated. We used the Sudoscan device to measure ESC which was normalized for BMI, to improve the discriminative capability of the method. Diabetic polyneuropathy was found in 17.5% of T1DG, 27.4% of T1DG, and 10.2% of Pre-DG. The mean ESC/BMI was lower in subgroups with diabetic polyneuropathy than those without. Mean ESC/BMI was lowest in T2DG and highest in HC-G but comparable in T1DG and Pre-DG. We accepted the ""mean ESC/BMI-1Â SD"" in the HC-G as the threshold for sudomotor dysfunction. Accordingly, the prevalence of sudomotor dysfunction was 18.8%, 44.3%, 59.1%, and 15% in T1DG, T2DG, Pre-DG, and HC-G, respectively. In T2DG, sudomotor dysfunction was found in 66.7% of persons with retinopathy, of which 56.3% had clinical diabetic polyneuropathy. The prevalence of sudomotor dysfunction in subjects with peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension was 46.7%, 47.4%, 43.4%, and 50%, respectively, and 42.9%, 38.9%, 45.5%, and 37.3% of whom in the same order detected with clinical diabetic polyneuropathy. Considering the entire group, a logistic regression model demonstrated that the variables associated with SMD were: retinopathy (OR: 2.969; 95% CI: 1.723, 5.114), female gender (OR: 1.952; 95% CI: 1.287, 2.962), and e-GFR (OR: 0.989; 95% CI: 0.981, 0.998). Since the rate of complications was very low in T1DG, excluding this group, a new model similarly revealed that retinopathy and female gender were associated with SMD, however, the association with e-GFR was disappeared. The prevalence of sudomotor dysfunction is high when established peripheral polyneuropathy was present in diabetes. Even though, sudomotor dysfunction can also occur before clinical polyneuropathy in both types of diabetes (T1DG: 18.8%, T2DG 44.3%), prediabetes (59.1%), and nondiabetic healthy subjects (15%). The variables associated with sudomotor dysfunction were retinopathy and female sex. Normalization of ESC for BMI would be a beneficial approach. However, before this method is included in the routine screening programs for diabetic polyneuropathy, large-scale and prospective studies are required to reach a consensus on the pathological threshold values.",Primary care diabetes,2023-Oct,"Calikoglu BF, Celik S, Idiz C, Bagdemir E, Issever H, Calvet JH, Satman I",7,3020,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Diabetes-related microvascular complications and periodontitis are also closely related to systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that periodontitis and oral hygiene markers might increase the risk of microvascular complications in diabetes mellitus. We enrolled 11,353 diabetes participants without prior microvascular complications who received complete oral health checkups in the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort in 2003-2004. The primary outcome was the first development of diabetes-related microvascular complications, including nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. The age of all participants was 55.27Â Â±Â 9.46Â years, and 7833 (68.99%) participants were male. Periodontitis was noted in 8.37%. During the 7.03Â Â±Â 4.30Â year of the mean follow-up period, 7227 patients experienced diabetes-related microvascular complications (2645 with nephropathy, 2513 with neuropathy, 2069 with retinopathy).

34299172,Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young-New Approaches for Disease Modelling.,"Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically heterogeneous group of monogenic endocrine disorders that is characterised by autosomal dominant inheritance and pancreatic Î²-cell dysfunction. These patients are commonly misdiagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, as the clinical symptoms largely overlap. Even though several biomarkers have been tested none of which could be used as single clinical discriminator. The correct diagnosis for individuals with MODY is of utmost importance, as the applied treatment depends on the gene mutation or is subtype-specific. Moreover, in patients with HNF1A-MODY, additional clinical monitoring can be included due to the high incidence of vascular complications observed in these patients. Finally, stratification of MODY patients will enable better and newer treatment options for MODY patients, once the disease pathology for each patient group is better understood. In the current review the clinical characteristics and the known disease-related abnormalities of the most common MODY subtypes are discussed, together with the up-to-date applied diagnostic criteria and treatment options. Additionally, the usage of pluripotent stem cells together with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing for disease modelling with the possibility to reveal new pathophysiological mechanisms in MODY is discussed.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021-Jul,"Skoczek D, Dulak J, Kachamakova-Trojanowska N",3,1346,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Knowledge, attitude, and practice of the pre-diabetic stage are of great importance and can decrease complications. The present study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practice of the pre-diabetic older people. This cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2022 to August 2022 on 219 pre-diabetic older people referring to Sina Hospital in Tabriz, one of the most populated cities in the northwest of Iran. Data were collected using questionnaires of Knowledge, Attitude, Practice-Prediabetes Assessment Questionnaire (KAP-PAQ). The data were analyzed by SPSS 21. The mean scores of knowledge (in the range of 0-17), attitude (in the range of -10, +â10), and practice (in the range of 0-26) were 1.72âÂ±â1.0, 2.24âÂ±â1.92, and 5.76âÂ±â2.61, respectively. The older people's knowledge and practice levels in the pre-diabetes stage were low and about 50% of them had negative views. According to the Spearman correlation test, there was a positive significant relationship between the older people's knowledge and practice (pâ<â0.001, râ=â0.234). The older people in the pre-diabetes stage had low knowledge and attitude and a negative viewpoint towards correcting lifestyle on diet, exercising and physical activity, weight control, diagnostic and screening methods. Increased knowledge about pre-diabetes and strengthened positive attitude towards correcting lifestyle through counseling as well as empowering the pre-diabetic older people can increase the efficiency of pre-diabetes prevention and control programs and prevent its progression to the diabetes stage.",BMC geriatrics,2024-Mar,"Pakpour V, Molayi F, Nemati H",3,1695,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

In addition, alterations in post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) also contribute to the development of diabetes pathogenesis. Recent advances in omics technologies have broadened the perspective for systematic investigation of proteome alterations in understanding the pathogenesis of diabetes. Further, PPIs are central to cellular signaling in all living organisms and deranged PPIs lead to diabetic complications. In this context, affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) along with diverse bioinformatic approaches has proven to be competent in mapping large-scale PPI networks around the critical players in the glucose homeostasis.

31833083,Sweet dreams or bitter nightmare: a narrative review of 25 years of research on the role of sleep in diabetes and the contributions of behavioural science.,"The aim of this review was to provide an overview of developments, clinical implications and gaps in knowledge regarding the relationship between diabetes and sleep over the past 25 years, with special focus on contributions from the behavioural sciences. Multiple prospective observational and experimental studies have shown a link between suboptimal sleep and impaired glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity and the development of type 2 diabetes. While prevalence rates of suboptimal sleep vary widely according to definition, assessment and sample, suboptimal subjective sleep quality appears to be a common reality for one-third of people with type 1 diabetes and over half of people with type 2 diabetes. Both physiological and psychosocial factors may impair sleep in these groups. In turn, suboptimal sleep can negatively affect glycaemic outcomes directly or indirectly via suboptimal daytime functioning (energy, mood, cognition) and self-care behaviours. Technological devices supporting diabetes self-care may have both negative and positive effects. Diabetes and its treatment also affect the sleep of significant others. Research on the merits of interventions aimed at improving sleep for people with diabetes is in its infancy. Diabetes and sleep appear to be reciprocally related. Discussion of sleep deserves a central place in regular diabetes care. Multi-day, multi-method studies may shed more light on the complex relationship between sleep and diabetes at an individual level. Intervention studies are warranted to examine the potential of sleep interventions in improving outcomes for people with diabetes.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2020-Mar,"Nefs GM, Bazelmans E, Donga E, Tack CJ, de Galan BE",5,1641,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Ensuring optimal diabetes management through minimizing drug therapy problems is important for improving patient outcomes. However, data on the prevalence and factors associated with unmet drug-related needs in patients with diabetes in Ethiopia is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence of unmet drug-related needs among patients with diabetes mellitus in Ethiopia. A thorough exploration of databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Hinari, and Embase and Google Scholar, was conducted to identify pertinent studies. Inclusion criteria involved observational studies that reported the prevalence of unmet drug-related needs in Ethiopian patients with diabetes. The quality of the studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists. A random-effects meta-analysis was employed to amalgamate data on study characteristics and prevalence estimates, followed by subsequent subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Graphical and statistical assessments were employed to evaluate publication bias. Analysis of twelve studies involving 4,017 patients revealed a pooled prevalence of unmet drug-related needs at 74% (95% CI 63-83%). On average, each patient had 1.45 unmet drug-related needs. The most prevalent type of unmet need was ineffective drug therapy, 35% (95% CI 20-50). Type 2 diabetes, retrospective study designs, and studies from the Harari Region were associated with a higher prevalence. Frequently reported factors associated with the unmet drug-related needs includes multiple comorbidities, older age, and polypharmacy. Notably, the results indicated significant heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 99.0%; p value < 0.001), and Egger's regression test revealed publication bias with p<0.001. The prevalence of unmet drug-related needs among diabetes patients with diabetes in Ethiopia is high with the most prevalent issue being ineffective drug therapy.

LADA patients were matched for age (Â±â2Â years) and sex to T1DM (1:1) and T2DM (1:2) patients. Retrieved variables included demographic characteristics, diabetes history, laboratory test findings, and history of DR screening, etc. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to identify influencing factors of DR. A decision tree was used to explore interactions between diabetes type and other influencing factors of DR. We included 110 LADA, 101 T1DM, and 220 T2DM patients. DR prevalence was 26.4% in LADA patients, lower than that in T1DM (50.5%) and T2DM (47.7%) patients (Pâ<â0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that diabetes duration (ORâ=â1.15, 95% CI: 1.1-1.26, Pâ<â0.001) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) (ORâ=â42.39, 95% CI: 10.88-165.11, Pâ<â0.001) were independent risk factors for DR, and regular DR screening (ORâ=â0.33, 95% CI: 0.16-0.69, Pâ=â0.003) was an independent protective factor. Decision tree analysis showed that in patients without DN with a diabetes duration of at least 10.5Â years, T1DM and LADA patients had a higher incidence of DR than T2DM patients (72.7% vs. 55.1%). The prevalence of DR in diabetes patients was affected by diabetes duration, DN occurrence, and regular DR screening.

This research was the first phase of a mixed-methods approach known as the focused rapid assessment process (fRAP). Using data from the Lehigh Valley Health Network in eastern Pennsylvania, geographical information systems mapping and spatial analyses were performed to identify diabetes prevalence and A1c control spatial clusters and outliers. We used a spatial empirical Bayes approach to adjust diabetes-related measures, mapped outliers and used the Local Moran's I to identify spatial clusters and outliers. Patients with diabetes were identified from the Lehigh Valley Practice and Community-Based Research Network (LVPBRN), which comprised primary care practices that included a hospital-owned practice, a regional practice association, independent small groups, clinics, solo practitioners and federally qualified health centres. Using this novel approach, we identified five priority ZCTAs and three bright spot ZCTAs in LVPBRN. Three of the priority ZCTAs were located in the urban core of Lehigh Valley and have large Hispanic populations. The other two bright spot ZCTAs have fewer patients and were located in rural areas. As the first phase of fRAP, this method of identifying high-performing and low-performing areas offers potential to mitigate health disparities related to diabetes through targeted exploration of local factors contributing to diabetes management. This novel approach to identification of populations with diabetes performing well or poor at the local community level may allow practitioners to target focused qualitative assessments where the most can be learnt to improve diabetic management of the community.",Family medicine and community health,2021-Oct,"Topmiller M, Mallow PJ, Shaak K, Kieber-Emmons AM",4,1893,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

31797443,Assessing the impact of diabetes on quality of life: what have the past 25 years taught us?,"Over the past 25 years, there has been significant acknowledgement of the importance of assessing the impact of diabetes on quality of life. Yet, despite the development of several diabetes-specific quality of life measures, the challenges we faced in 1995 remain. There is little consensus on the definition of quality of life because of the complexity and subjectivity of the concept. General quality of life comprises several domains of life, and these are highly individualized. Assessing the impact of diabetes on these life domains adds to the complexity. While comprehensive diabetes-specific quality-of-life measures typically increase respondent burden, brief questionnaires may not capture all relevant/important domains. Today, the lack of resolution of these challenges may explain why the impact of diabetes on quality of life is not systematically assessed in research or clinical care. Few researchers report detailed rationales for assessment, there is often a mismatch between the concept of interest and the measure selected, and data are misinterpreted as assessing the impact of diabetes on quality of life when, in reality, related but distinct constructs have been assessed, such as diabetes distress, treatment satisfaction or health status. While significant efforts are being made to increase routine monitoring of psychological well-being and understand the lived experience, no guidelines currently recommend routine clinical assessment of diabetes-specific quality of life, and there is no consensus on which questionnaire(s) to use. The gaps identified in this review need urgent attention, starting with recognition that assessment of diabetes-specific quality of life is as important as biomedical markers, if we are to improve the lives of people with diabetes.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2020-Mar,"Speight J, Holmes-Truscott E, Hendrieckx C, Skovlund S, Cooke D",5,1793,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

To investigate the association between proliferative retinopathy and serum bile acid level in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Three hundred and thirty-six patients with T2DM were included, of which, 229 had a history of more than 10 years without diabetic retinopathy (no diabetic retinopathy, NDR) and 107 had proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The baseline characteristics of the two groups were compared. According to the level of bile acid, the patients were divided into low, medium and high bile acid groups. The ratio of proliferative retinopathy in each group was compared. The presence of retinopathy was taken as the dependent variable, and the significant variables were analyzed by logistic regression. The level of total bilirubin and bile acid in the NDR group was significantly higher than that in the PDR group, while the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol and LDL-C were significantly lower than that in the PDR group (P<0.05). With the increase of bile acid level, the proportion of proliferative retinopathy decreased. Logistic regression analysis showed that bilirubin and bile acid were protective factors of diabetic retinopathy, while SBP, LDL-C and UAER were risk factors of diabetic retinopathy. Bile acid might be a protective factor for diabetic retinopathy in T2DM, which might be a potential therapeutic role in retinal disorders.","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2021-,"Su Z, Liu W, Yang J",3,1526,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

32674731,Current Approaches in Diabetes Treatment and Other Strategies to Reach Normoglycemia.,"Cells are mainly dependent on glucose as their energy source. Multicellular organisms need to adequately control individual glucose uptake by the cells, and the insulin-glucagon endocrine system serves as the key glucose regulation mechanism. Insulin allows for effective glucose entry into the cells when blood glucose levels are high, and glucagon acts as its opponent, balancing low blood glucose levels. A lack of insulin will prevent glucose entry to the cells, resulting in glucose accumulation in the bloodstream. Diabetes is a disease which is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. All diabetes types are characterized by an inefficient insulin signaling mechanism. This could be the result of insufficient insulin secretion, as in the case of type I diabetes and progressive incidents of type II diabetes or due to insufficient response to insulin (known as insulin resistance). We emphasize here, that Diabetes is actually a disease of starved tissues, unable to absorb glucose (and other nutrients), and not a disease of high glucose levels. Indeed, diabetic patients, prior to insulin discovery, suffered from glucose malabsorption. In this mini-review, we will define diabetes, discuss the current status of diabetes treatments, review the current knowledge of the different hormones that participate in glucose homeostasis and the employment of different modulators of these hormones. As this issue deals with peptide therapeutics, special attention will be given to synthetic peptide analogs, peptide agonists as well as antagonists.",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,2020-,"Sirhan W, Piran R",2,1558,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
35393535,Donor and recipient polygenic risk scores influence the risk of post-transplant diabetes.,"Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) reduces allograft and recipient life span. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) show robust association with greater risk of developing typeâ2 diabetes (T2D). We examined the association of PTDM with T2D PRS in liver recipients (nâ=â1,581) and their donors (nâ=â1,555), and kidney recipients (nâ=â2,062) and their donors (nâ=â533). Recipient T2D PRS was associated with pre-transplant T2D and the development of PTDM. T2D PRS in liver donors, but not in kidney donors, was an independent risk factor for PTDM development. The inclusion of a combined liver donor and recipient T2D PRS significantly improved PTDM prediction compared with a model that included only clinical characteristics: the area under the curve (AUC) was 67.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 64.1-71.1%) for the combined T2D PRS versus 62.3% (95% CI 58.8-65.8%) for the clinical characteristics model (Pâ=â0.0001). Liver recipients in the highest quintile of combined donor and recipient T2D PRS had the greatest risk of PTDM, with an odds ratio of 3.22 (95% CI 2.07-5.00) (Pâ=â1.92âÃâ10<sup>-7</sup>) compared with those in the lowest quintile. In conclusion, T2D PRS identifies transplant candidates with high risk of PTDM for which pre-emptive diabetes management and donor selection may be warranted.",Nature medicine,2022-May,"Shaked A, Loza BL, Van Loon E, Olthoff KM, Guan W, Jacobson PA, Zhu A, Fishman CE, Gao H, Oetting WS, Israni AK, Testa G, Trotter J, Klintmalm G, Naesens M, Asrani SK, Keating BJ",17,1306,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

36629168,Increasing diabetes testing adherence with incentives in rural Northwestern Ontario.,"The health outcomes of rural Canadians have been described as poor and can in some part be related to diabetes mellitus. Despite the high mortality and morbidity rates associated with the disease, compliance with management remains low. Research has shown that a small financial incentive used to modify patient behaviour, can improve outcomes in cardiac disease and exercise adherence. This study aims to evaluate if a small financial incentive awarded to rural Northwestern Ontario patients with diabetes who complete an haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test, would result in greater compliance in test completion. Patients were recruited through two Northern rural clinics. Participants were divided into two groups: Group A received a financial incentive, whereas Group B received a letter of reminder. HbA1c tests were recorded every 6 months for 2 years and compliance was analysed using a t-test and Chi-square. One hundred and forty-six participants were recruited with 30 lost to follow-up. Overall, the incentive group completed a statistically significantly higher number of HbA1c tests compared to those in the control group. In addition, it was noted that there was an increase in test adherence for participants that received reminder letters, although not an initially expected outcome of the study. The results suggest that either a financial incentive or a reminder directed towards rural Canadians could have a benefit in promoting health behaviours to subsequent medical management of diabetes mellitus.",Canadian journal of rural medicine : the official journal of the Society of Rural Physicians of Canada = Journal canadien de la medecine rurale : le journal officiel de la Societe de medecine rurale du Canada,2023-,"Mashru J, Gagnon G, Kaus C, Gagnon Y, Moir A",5,1513,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
39393003,Bringing the assessment and treatment of diabetes distress into the real world of clinical care: Time for a shift in perspective.,"Diabetes distress (DD) refers to the emotional and behavioural challenges associated with managing this demanding chronic disease over time. DD is alarmingly common and it has a significant impact on self-management behaviours and clinical outcomes. Thus, there is growing recognition that DD is a pressing problem that deserves careful attention in clinical care. Translating the application of validated DD assessment and intervention protocols from the research to the clinical setting, however, presents challenges that require a reconsideration of some common assumptions about what DD is, how prevalent it is, how it presents itself clinically, how it might best be assessed and by whom. We employed data from six large-scale studies using five common DD measures. Using these data, we review and challenge several common assumptions about DD. These data suggest that, because of its relative ubiquity, DD should not be viewed as a 'co-morbidity' or 'complication' of diabetes and it should not be seen as a mental health/illness 'condition'. Furthermore, we argue that DD assessment should: (1) be accepted as a standard part of comprehensive diabetes care, (2) occur regularly using broad rather than brief screening measures and (3) be addressed directly by diabetes clinicians, rather than exclusively by behavioural specialists. The results form the basis of a series of suggestions to enhance the translation, adoption and implementation of DD knowledge derived from the research setting directly into the real world of clinical care.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2024-Dec,"Fisher L, Guzman S, Polonsky W, Hessler D",4,1546,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The study was done using a retrospective study design. Fasting blood samples from consented patients with no previous diagnosis of diabetes and within the specified age range were collected from King Edward Hospital in Durban. The pre-diabetes diagnosis was confirmed in participants with fasting glucose concentrations between 5.6 and 6.9Â mmol/L and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels between 5.7 % and 6.4 % using the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and World Health Organisation (WHO) diagnosis criteria.

An alarming 68 % average pre-diabetes prevalence across ADA and WHO criteria in the Durban, eThekwini district sample population. The highest prevalence was recorded using the IFG criterion (83%) and the lowest when using the HbA1c criterion (54 %). Between the White, Black and Indian ethnic groups, the Indian group were more predisposed to pre-diabetes onset, with a prevalence of 62.7 %. If pre-diabetes management is unattended, an unprecedented increase in metabolic disorders such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and all-cause mortality incidence can be expected.

32128655,"Type 2 diabetes - unmet need, unresolved pathogenesis, mTORC1-centric paradigm.","The current paradigm of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is gluco-centric, being exclusively categorized by glycemic characteristics. The gluco-centric paradigm views hyperglycemia as the primary target, being driven by resistance to insulin combined with progressive beta cells failure, and considers glycemic control its ultimate treatment goal. Most importantly, the gluco-centric paradigm considers the non-glycemic diseases associated with T2D, e.g., obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, macrovascular disease, microvascular disease and fatty liver as 'risk factors' and/or 'outcomes' and/or 'comorbidities', rather than primary inherent disease aspects of T2D. That is in spite of their high prevalence (60-90%) and major role in profiling T2D morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the gluco-centric paradigm fails to realize that the non-glycemic diseases of T2D are driven by insulin and, except for glycemic control, response to insulin in T2D is essentially the rule rather than the exception. Failure of the gluco-centric paradigm to offer an exhaustive unifying view of the glycemic and non-glycemic diseases of T2D may have contributed to T2D being still an unmet need. An mTORC1-centric paradigm maintains that hyperactive mTORC1 drives the glycemic and non-glycemic disease aspects of T2D. Hyperactive mTORC1 is proposed to act as double-edged agent, namely, to interfere with glycemic control by disrupting the insulin receptor-Akt transduction pathway, while concomitantly driving the non-glycemic diseases of T2D. The mTORC1-centric paradigm may offer a novel perspective for T2D in terms of pathogenesis, clinical focus and treatment strategy.",Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,2020-Dec,Bar-Tana J,1,1648,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

A follow-up study on two independent cohorts having oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 1991/1992 and 2011-2016: Cohort 1 consisted of 406 women including 54 with GDM and 352 with a non-GDM OGTT-test and cohort 2 had 433 women diagnosed with GDM. The first cohort had nearly 25Â years of follow-up and gave information on magnitude, conversion rate and type of diabetes manifestation. The second cohort was started recently to evaluate whether newer diagnostic criteria and baseline information on the old cohort are still valid for prediction of diabetes risk. The risk of manifest diabetes in cohort 1 at the end of follow-up was six times higher in women with previous GDM compared with non-GDM (RRâ=â6; 95% CI 4-11). We observed a 70% diabetes rate 25Â years after pregnancy. Only family history of diabetes in cohort 2 was associated with conversion to manifest diabetes (pâ=â0.002), also after adjustment for age, BMI, non-Danish origin and smoking during pregnancy (pâ<â0.001) CONCLUSION: The incidence of diabetes after GDM is higher than that previously reported in Scandinavian populations and the rate of manifest diabetes rises steeply 15Â years after pregnancy and after 40Â years of age. The women of cohort 2 with recent GDM are at risk of DM at a higher rate.

37861021,From Gut to Glucose: A Comprehensive Review on Functional Foods and Dietary Interventions for Diabetes Management.,"In the realm of diabetes research, considerable attention has been directed toward elucidating the intricate interplay between the gastrointestinal tract and glucose regulation. The gastrointestinal tract, once exclusively considered for its role in digestion and nutrient assimilation, is presently acknowledged as a multifaceted ecosystem with regulatory supremacy over metabolic homeostasis and glucose metabolism. Recent studies indicate that alterations in the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota could potentially influence the regulation of glucose levels and glucose homeostasis in the body. Dysbiosis, characterized by perturbations in the equilibrium of gut microbial constituents, has been irrevocably linked to an augmented risk of diabetes mellitus (DM). Moreover, research has revealed the potential influence of the gut microbiota on important factors, like inflammation and insulin sensitivity, which are key contributors to the onset and progression of diabetes. The key protagonists implicated in the regulation of glucose encompass the gut bacteria, gut barrier integrity, and the gut-brain axis. A viable approach to enhance glycemic control while concurrently mitigating the burden of comorbidities associated with diabetes resides in the strategic manipulation of the gut environment through adapted dietary practices. This review aimed to provide a deep understanding of the complex relationship between gut health, glucose metabolism, and diabetes treatment. This study has presented an exhaustive overview of dietary therapies and functional foods that have undergone extensive research to explore their potential advantages in the management of diabetes. It looks into the role of gut health in glucose regulation, discusses the impact of different dietary elements on the course of diabetes, and evaluates how well functional foods can help with glycemic control. Furthermore, it investigates the mechanistic aspects of these therapies, including their influence on insulin sensitivity, Î²-cell activity, and inflammation.

Using a fly-in, fly-out model of service delivery and supporting telehealth services, upskilling of rural primary healthcare professionals occurred and credentialled diabetes educator (CDE) accessibility increased in WQ. This study objectively measured the impact of the VCDEP. Practice report data from five representative VCDEP practices and five non-VCDEP practices were analysed using Pearson Chi-squared tests to ascertain associations in reporting of blood pressure (BP), HbA1c, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), total cholesterol, microalbumin, body mass index (BMI) and foot and eye examinations, as well as improvements in BP, HbA1c, eGFR, total cholesterol, microalbumin and BMI measures at two set date points.

35008927,Stem Cell-Derived Î² Cells: A Versatile Research Platform to Interrogate the Genetic Basis of Î² Cell Dysfunction.,"Pancreatic Î² cell dysfunction is a central component of diabetes progression. During the last decades, the genetic basis of several monogenic forms of diabetes has been recognized. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have also facilitated the identification of common genetic variants associated with an increased risk of diabetes. These studies highlight the importance of impaired Î² cell function in all forms of diabetes. However, how most of these risk variants confer disease risk, remains unanswered. Understanding the specific contribution of genetic variants and the precise role of their molecular effectors is the next step toward developing treatments that target Î² cell dysfunction in the era of personalized medicine. Protocols that allow derivation of Î² cells from pluripotent stem cells, represent a powerful research tool that allows modeling of human development and versatile experimental designs that can be used to shed some light on diabetes pathophysiology. This article reviews different models to study the genetic basis of Î² cell dysfunction, focusing on the recent advances made possible by stem cell applications in the field of diabetes research.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022-Jan,BartolomÃ© A,1,1177,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
31841261,Prevalence of hyperglycaemia without previously recognised diabetes mellitus in the emergency department and subsequent management: a retrospective cross-sectional study.,"Australian hospital data on hyperglycaemia without previously known diabetes are lacking. To determine the prevalence of hyperglycaemia without previously recognised diabetes among all patients screened in the emergency department (ED). Secondary aims are to describe the extent of haemoglobin A1c testing for evaluation of new diabetes, adequate glucose monitoring, treatment of significant hyperglycaemia and documented follow-up plans. Patients presenting to ED at the Alfred (tertiary hospital in Melbourne) have undergone screening random plasma glucose (RPG) with their first plasma biochemistry since 2015. Of the 16â268 adults screened from July to December 2015, a retrospective, cross-sectional study was undertaken evaluating those with hyperglycaemia (RPG >7.8âmmol/L) but without previously recognised diabetes as determined from coding data. After patient records were reviewed to correct for coding errors, a nested cohort of 200 such patients were further evaluated. Glucose monitoring was deemed adequate if undertaken for â¥48 h. Significant hyperglycaemia (RPG >11âmmol/L) was considered appropriately treated if insulin/hypoglycaemic agents were prescribed. Documented follow-up plans were acceptable if found in the discharge summary. Among all patients screened, 1178 had hyperglycaemia without coded diabetes. After adjusting for coding errors, the prevalence was 5.2%. Within the nested cohort, only 7.5% had a follow-up haemoglobin A1c ordered, 9.5% underwent adequate glucose monitoring, 6.5% had appropriate treatment of significant hyperglycaemia and 2% had documentation of a follow-up plan. Hyperglycaemia without previously recognised diabetes is commonly seen and justifies ED screening.

37560999,Utility of Polygenic Scores for Differentiating Diabetes Diagnosis Among Patients With Atypical Phenotypes of Diabetes.,"Misclassification of diabetes type occurs in people with atypical presentations of type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although current clinical guidelines suggest clinical variables and treatment response as ways to help differentiate diabetes type, they remain insufficient for people with atypical presentations. This work aimed to assess the clinical utility of 2 polygenic scores (PGSs) in differentiating between T1D and T2D. Patients diagnosed with diabetes in the UK Biobank were studied (N = 41 787), including 464 (1%) and 15 923 (38%) who met the criteria for classic T1D and T2D, respectively, and 25 400 (61%) atypical diabetes. The validity of 2 published PGSs for T1D (PGST1D) and T2D (PGST2D) in differentiating classic T1D or T2D was assessed using C statistic. The utility of genetic probability for T1D based on PGSs (GenProb-T1D) was evaluated in atypical diabetes patients. The joint performance of PGST1D and PGST2D for differentiating classic T1D or T2D was outstanding (C statistic = 0.91), significantly higher than that of PGST1D alone (0.88) and PGST2D alone (0.70), both P less than .001. Using an optimal cutoff of GenProb-T1D, 23% of patients with atypical diabetes had a higher probability of T1D and its validity was independently supported by clinical presentations that are characteristic of T1D.

35603258,Prevention of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes: importance of a screening program for the early detection of risk conditions in a target population.,"Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are two of the main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In their genesis, an important role is played by some behavioural risk factors that may induce the onset of further risk factors represented by hypertension, prediabetes, overweight and obesity. This study aimed to show the importance of the screening methodology for early detection of these risk conditions in order to reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes complications. We carried out a screening programme involving a cohort of people aged 45-60 in which risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes were evaluated. The subjects were then classified into four groups according to the risk conditions. A high percentage (27.0%) of the sample had some alteration in the detected anthropometric and/or clinical-laboratory parameters but were unaware of this condition and, consequently, not under therapeutic treatment. The screening programme allowed the early detection of hypertension and prediabetes or full-blown diabetes conditions in subjects who were unaware they had a pathological condition, and consequently to proceed with adequate investigations and start healthy lifestyles/pharmacological therapies. Overall, the results highlight the need to anticipate these screening campaigns, especially in men, to increase the effectiveness of the prevention programmes.",Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,2021-Dec,"FacciolÃ  A, Visalli G, D'Andrea G, VarvarÃ  M, Santoro G, Cuffari R, DI Pietro A",7,1407,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis on 500 patients who attended the Endocrinology department at a quaternary health care center in Kerala between November 2017 and April 2018. Patients above the age of 30 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) were included. They underwent a detailed medical history, dilated fundus examination for DR, assessment and grading of DPN, and blood investigations. Among these, 49 randomly selected patients without DR had peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) assessed by optical coherence tomogram. RNFL and GCIPL changes in different grades of neuropathy were evaluated. Out of 500 patients, 303 (60.6%) were males and 197 (39.4%) were females. Prevalence of DR was 48% and DPN 71.8%. Risk factors for the development of DR included duration of DM >15 years, HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) greater than 6.5%, serum creatinine more than 1.5 mg/dl, and the presence of DPN. There was a statistically significant association between DR and DPN. There was significant thinning of GCIPL in patients with moderate to severe neuropathy without DR. There is a significant association between DR and DPN and their severities. There are early changes in inner retinal layers of diabetic patients without microvascular changes of DR.

39019572,New Perspectives and Prospects of microRNA Delivery in Diabetic Wound Healing.,"The remarkable potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) as a class of biotherapeutic agents in the treatment of diverse pathological conditions has garnered significant interest in recent years. To heal both acute and chronic wounds, miRNAs work by post-transcriptionally controlling various proteins and the pathways that are linked to them. Diabetes mellitus predisposes to several macro- and microvascular defects of end organs such as atherosclerosis, peripheral artery disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and impaired wound healing. Here, miRNAs emerge as a beacon of hope, with the capacity to heal diabetic wounds by precisely modulating the expression of genes involved in the healing process. Despite the therapeutic promise, the journey to realizing the full potential of miRNAs is fraught with challenges. Their intrinsic instability and the inefficient delivery into target cells pose significant barriers to their clinical application. Consequently, a major focus of current research is the discovery of novel miRNAs and the development of innovative delivery systems that can effectively transport these nucleic acids into the cells where they are needed most. This review delves into the intricate roles that miRNAs play at various stages of diabetic wound healing, providing a comprehensive overview of the latest research findings. The review also addresses the obstacles and opportunities that come with translating miRNA-based strategies into clinical practice, offering a critical assessment of the field's advancements and the hurdles that remain to be overcome.

36127565,A simulation model estimates lifetime health and economic outcomes of screening prediabetes using the 1-h plasma glucose.,"The current method to diagnose impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is based on the 2-h plasma glucose (2-hPG) value during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Robust evidence demonstrates that the 1-h post-load plasma glucose (1-hPG)ââ¥â8.6Â mmol/L in those with normal glucose tolerance is highly predictive of type 2 diabetes (T2D), micro and macrovascular complications and mortality. The aim of this study was to conduct a health economic analysis to estimate long-term cost-effectiveness of using the 1-hPG compared to the 2-hPG for screening and assessing the risk of diabetes over 35Â years. The main outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A Monte Carlo-based Markov simulation model was developed to forecast long-term effects of two screening strategies with regards to clinical and cost-effectiveness outcomes. The base case model included 20,000 simulated patients over 35-years follow-up. Transition probabilities on disease progression, mortality, effects on preventive treatments and complications were retrieved from landmark diabetes studies. Direct medical costs were sourced from published literature and inflated to 2019 Euros. In the lifetime analysis, the 1-hPG was projected to increase the number of years free from disease (2Â years per patient); to delay the onset of T2D (1Â year per patient); to reduce the incidence of T2D complications (0Â·6 RR-Relative Risk per patient) and to increase the QALY gained (0Â·58 per patient). Even if the 1-hPG diagnostic method resulted in higher initial costs associated with preventive treatment, long-term diabetes-related costs as well as complications costs were reduced leading to a lifetime saving of -â31225719.82â¬. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was -â8214.7â¬ per each QALY gained for the overall population. Screening prediabetes with the 1-hPG is feasible and cost-effective resulting in reduced costs per QALY. Notwithstanding, the higher initial costs of testing with the 1-hPG compared to the 2-hPG due to incremental preventive intervention, long-term diabetes and complications costs were reduced projecting an overall cost saving of -â8214.7â¬ per each QALY gained.",Acta diabetologica,2023-Jan,"Andellini M, Manco M, Esposito MT, Tozzi AE, Bergman M, Ritrovato M",6,2174,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of secondary data comprising Portuguese PHC indicators by health centres group (ACES) and the National Hospital Morbidity Database. We calculated and analysed age-sex-adjusted rates for each PQI. Worse-performing ACES were identified using the 2017 median PQI values as an assessment cut-off. A multivariate logistic analysis was carried to find variables associated with the likelihood of being a worse-performing ACES for the biennium. The median values of the indicator PQI93 - Prevention Quality Diabetes Composite were 79 and 65.2 hospitalizations per 100 000 pop, in 2016 and 2017 respectively. Diabetes long term complications (PQI 03) accounted for most of the hospitalizations. The quality indicator in PHC with greater influence on PQI93 was the proportion of DM patients with <65 years with test results for HbA1câ<â=â6.5%. This study shows that some PHC quality indicators are closely related to DM care, and so their monitoring is of high importance.

The aim of this study was to identify barriers and enablers of DRS attendance among YAs in the UK living with type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). YAs (18-34 years) were invited to complete an anonymous online survey in June 2021 assessing agreement with 30 belief statements informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) of behavior change describing potential barriers/enablers to DRS. In total, 102 responses were received. Most had T1D (65.7%) and were regular attenders for DRS (76.5%). The most salient TDF domains for DRS attendance were '<i>Goals</i>', with 93% agreeing that DRS was a high priority, and '<i>Knowledge</i>', with 98% being aware that screening can detect eye problems early.Overall, 67.4% indicated that they would like greater appointment flexibility <i>(Environmental context/resources</i>) and 31.3% reported difficulties getting time off work/study to attend appointments <i>(Environmental context/resources</i>). This was more commonly reported by occasional non-attenders versus regular attenders (59.1% vs 23.4%, p=0.002). Most YAs were worried about diabetic retinopathy (74.3%), anxious when receiving screening results (63%) (<i>Emotion</i>) and would like more support after getting their results (66%) (<i>Social influences</i>). Responses for T1D and T2D were broadly similar, although those with T2D were more likely have developed strategies to help them to remember their appointments (63.6% vs 37.9%, p=0.019) (<i>Behavioral regulation</i>).

To assess the risk of developing diabetes-associated ocular complications among youth diagnosed with diabetes. This retrospective, population-based medical record review included all residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (95.7% White in 1990), diagnosed with diabetes at younger than 22 years (hereinafter referred to as children) from January 1, 1970, through December 31, 2019. Risk of developing ocular complications over time. Among 1362 individuals with a diagnostic code of diabetes, medical record reviews confirmed a diagnosis of T1D or T2D in 606 children, of whom 525 (86.6%) underwent at least 1 eye examination (mean [SD] age at diabetes diagnosis, 12.1â[5.4] years; 264 [50.3%] male). Diabetes-associated ocular complications occurred in 147 of the 461 children (31.2%) with T1D and in 17 of the 64 children (26.6%) with T2D. The hazard ratio illustrating the risk between T2D and T1D rates was 1.88 (95% CI, 1.13-3.12; P = .02) for developing any diabetic retinopathy (nonproliferative or greater), 2.33 (95% CI, 0.99-5.50; P = .048) for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 1.49 (95% CI, 0.46-4.89; Pâ=â.50) for diabetic macular edema, 2.43 (95% CI, 0.54-11.07; Pâ=â.24) for a visually significant cataract, and 4.06 (95% CI, 1.34-12.33; Pâ=â.007) for requiring pars plana vitrectomy by 15 years after the diagnosis of diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and the need for pars plana vitrectomy occurred within a shorter diabetes duration for children with T2D compared with T1D in this population-based cohort. Children with T2D had almost twice the risk of developing retinopathy compared with those with T1D.

35098857,Mother-Infant Dyad program in primary care: evidence-based postpartum care following gestational diabetes.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a common complication of pregnancy, is associated with a 10-fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to the general population. Evidence-based guidelines recommend that patients with GDM receive postpartum care for T2DM risk reduction including an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 4-12âweeks after delivery, yet half of patients with GDM did not return for their postpartum visits by 12âweeks postpartum. Additionally, only 10% utilize primary care within 12âmonths of delivery and one-third of GDM patients receive timely postpartum OGTT. To determine if the Mother-Infant Dyad postpartum primary care program provides a framework to link well-child visits with postpartum primary care visits to increase postpartum clinical interactions promoting longitudinal care, such as postpartum visit attendance and T2DM screening. All patients with a diagnosis of GDM that received care at a postpartum mother-infant dyad program at a Midwestern academic medical center internal medicine and pediatrics primary care clinic were enrolled. Clinic level data was obtained by baseline and 6-month post-enrollment surveys and chart review. A comparison population was identified from Medicaid claims data using propensity score matching to enable a comparison of program participants' outcomes to a population comprised of similar individuals diagnosed with GDM that received care at sites not participating in the Dyad program. Our primary outcome was completion of T2DM screening in the 4-12âweek postpartum period. The secondary outcomes were postpartum visit attendance with a prenatal provider, and prediabetes diagnoses. A total of 75 mother-infant dyads were seen by the clinic. Of the enrolled women, 43% were Non-Hispanic White and 30% were Non-Hispanic Black; mean age was 30.75âyears. The matched comparison group (<i>n</i>â=â62) had a mean age of 30.75âyears, were 43% Non-Hispanic White and 30% Non-Hispanic Black. Women who participated in the program were more likely to receive T2DM screenings than women who did not participate (87 vs. 79%, <i>p</i><.001) and complete postpartum visits (95 vs. 58%, respectively; <i>p</i><.001). Additionally, a higher rate of new prediabetes diagnoses was observed (12 vs. 6%, <i>p</i>â<â.001). The Mother-Infant Dyad postpartum primary care program improved T2DM screenings and postpartum visit attendance. In addition, a greater proportion of Dyad program participants experienced new prediabetes diagnoses that those in the comparison group. Our findings suggest that the dyad care model, in which women with GDM engage in postpartum primary care concurrent with well-child visits, can improve longitudinal postpartum care after a GDM diagnosis.","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2022-Dec,"Bose Brill S, May S, Lorenz AM, Spence D, Prater L, Shellhaas C, Otsubo M, Mao S, Flanigan M, Thung S, Leonard M, Jiang F, Oza-Frank R",13,2750,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The objective of this study was to investigate the direct and indirect costs of HF patients with and without DM. Patients with a first-time diagnosis of HF from 1998 to 2016 were identified through nationwide Danish registries and stratified according to DM status into HF with or without DM. The economic healthcare cost analysis was based on both direct costs, including hospitalization, procedures, medication and indirect costs including social welfare and lost productivity. The economic burden was investigated prior to, at, and following diagnosis of HF. Patients with concomitant HF and DM were younger (median age 74 vs. 77), had more comorbidities and fewer were female as compared to patients with HF but without DM. The socioeconomic burden of concomitant HF and DM compared to HF alone was substantially higher; 45% in direct costs (â¬16,237 vs. â¬11,184), 35% in home care costs (â¬3123 vs. â¬2320), 8% in social transfer income (â¬17,257 vs. â¬15,994) and they had 27% lower income (â¬10,136 vs. â¬13,845).

32738013,Novel insights into diabetes mellitus due to DNAJC3-defect: Evolution of neurological and endocrine phenotype in the pediatric age group.,"A number of inborn errors of metabolism caused by abnormal protein trafficking that lead to endoplasmic reticulum storage diseases (ERSD) have been defined in the last two decades. One such disorder involves biallelic mutations in the gene encoding endoplasmic reticulum resident co-chaperone DNAJC3 (P58<sup>IPK</sup> ) that leads to diabetes in the second decade of life, in addition to multiple endocrine dysfunction and nervous system involvement. The aim of this study was to define the natural history of this new form of diabetes, especially the course of abnormalities related to glucose metabolism. Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing was used to detect DNAJC3 defect in two patients. Detailed analysis of their clinical history as well as biochemical, neurological and radiological studies were carried out to deduce natural history of neurological and endocrine phenotype. DNAJC3 defect led to beta-cell dysfunction causing hyperinsulinemichypoglycemia around 2âyears of age in both patients, which evolved into diabetes with insulin deficiency in the second decade of life, probably due to beta cell loss.

32820876,Genotype and Phenotype Heterogeneity in Neonatal Diabetes: A Single Centre Experience in Turkey.,"Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) may be transient or permanent, and the majority is caused by genetic mutations. Early diagnosis is essential to select the patients who will respond to oral treatment. In this investigation, we aimed to present the phenotype and genotype of our patients with NDM and share our experience in a single tertiary center A total of 16 NDM patients from 12 unrelated families are included in the study. The clinical presentation, age at diagnosis, perinatal and family history, consanguinity, gender, hemoglobin A1c, C-peptide, insulin, insulin autoantibodies, genetic mutations, and response to treatment are retrospectively evaluated. The median age at diagnosis of diabetes was five months (4 days-18 months) although six patients with a confirmed genetic diagnosis were diagnosed >6 months. Three patients had <i>KCNJ11</i> mutations, six had <i>ABCC8</i> mutations, three had <i>EIF2AK3</i> mutations, and one had a <i>de novo INS</i> mutation. All the permanent NDM patients with <i>KCNJ11</i> and <i>ABCC8</i> mutations were started on sulfonylurea treatment resulting in a significant increase in C-peptide level, better glycemic control, and discontinuation of insulin. Although NDM is defined as diabetes diagnosed during the first six months of life, and a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is more common between the ages of 6 and 24 months, in rare cases NDM may present as late as 12 or even 24 months of age. Molecular diagnosis in NDM is important for planning treatment and predicting prognosis.

In this study, we explore health care providers' (HCPs) knowledge of problems associated with diabetes and driving, and evaluate the consistency of counseling on driving safety for patients with diabetes. We conducted a cross-sectional survey-based study among HCPs in Saudi Arabia. We designed a web-based questionnaire to collect demographic data, assess HCPs' knowledge of driving and diabetes and their compliance with driving safety regulations, and meet Diabetes Canada's and the British Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's recommendations. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square analysis. We received 389 responses to the questionnaire. The majority of the respondents were consultants (38.8%), worked in governmental institutes (72.2%), and managed more than 30 patients weekly (34.4%). Only 5.7% of HCPs correctly answered all the driving safety questions. Diabetes educators and general practitioners had the fewest correct answers (p-value 0.03). About 12.6% of HCPs stated that they always counseled their patients about driving safety strategies.

School nurses are central to a school-aged child's diabetes care and they must make important moment-to-moment decisions requiring understanding of and comfort with diabetes care and technology. The rapid changes in diabetes care and technology make ongoing education essential, yet access to up-to-date and practical education is limited for many school nurses. Integrating needs data and stakeholders' input, this group developed Diabetes in School Health (DiSH) to address this gap. We adapted a well-established, innovative, and easily-accessible telementoring educational model, Project ECHO, to create a collaborative learning community.

We focused on a cohort of diabetic patients with HHCN belonging to Resource Utilization Bands 4 and 5 according to the Adjusted Clinical Group (ACG) system. Their comorbidities were assessed using the clinical diagnoses that the ACG system assigns to single patients by combining different information flows. Regression models were applied to analyze the associations between comorbidities and health care service use or costs, adjusting for age and sex. Our analyses showed that all health care service usage measures (e.g. access to emergency care; number of outpatient visits) and the total annual costs and pharmacy costs are associated significantly with comorbidity class. Instead, no differences in hospitalization rates by comorbidity class were revealed. The association between a larger number of comorbidities and higher total health care service usage and costs was seen mainly for primary care services.

This is partly explained by the separate treatment of diabetes and SMI, which occurs in parallel silos in many healthcare systems. The Steno Diabetes Center Sjaelland and Region Zealand established the Fusion Clinic to offer combined psychiatric and diabetes care delivered by both diabetes and mental healthcare professionals. This study describes how the clinic was established and the initial diabetes outcomes. The Fusion Clinic was co-designed by people with diabetes and SMI and healthcare professionals to improve the care of adults with diabetes and SMI. The clinic approach utilised the F-ACT model. The 63 people referred to the Fusion Clinic between 01.02.2020 and 01.01.2022 who attended the clinic for more than 6âmonths were included in this study. Diabetes outcomes were recorded in the electronic medical records (Sundhedsplatformen EPIC). There was a high prevalence of diabetes complications at baseline. Furthermore, 70% had one or more additional concomitant diseases, as well as SMI and diabetes. Assessment of diabetes complications and measurements of HbA<sub>1c</sub> and lipid profile improved after referral to the clinic.

New Zealanders aged â¥65Â years in 2013 were identified using anonymised linkage of national administrative health databases. Dispensing of blood pressure lowering (BPL), lipid lowering (LL) or antithrombotic (AT) medications, was documented, stratified by age and by history of CVD, diabetes, or neither. Of the 593,549 people identified, 32% had prior CVD, 14% had diabetes (of whom half also had prior CVD) and 61% had neither diagnosis. For those with prior CVD, between 79-87% were dispensed BPL and 73-79% were dispensed AT medications, across all age groups. In contrast, LL dispensing was lower than either BPL or AT in every age group, falling from 75% at age 65-69Â years to 43% at 85+ years. For people with diabetes, BPL and LL dispensing was similar to those with prior CVD, but AT dispensing was approximately 20% lower. Among people without prior CVD or diabetes, both BPL and AT dispensing increased with age (from 39% and 17% at age 65-69 years to 56% and 35% at 85+ years respectively), whereas LL dispensing was 26-31% across the 65-84Â year age groups, falling to 17% at 85+ years.

39470889,"A novel (-)-(2S)-7,4'-dihydroxyflavanone compound for treating age-related diabetes mellitus through immunoinformatics-guided activation of CISD3.","The iron-sulfur domain (CISD) proteins of CDGSH are classified into three classes: CISD1, CISD2, and CISD3. During premature ageing, mutations that affect these proteins, namely their binding sites, could result in reduced protein production and an inability to preserve cellular integrity. Consequently, this leads to the development of conditions such as diabetes. Notably, CISD3 plays a crucial role in the management of age-related disorders such as Wolfram syndrome, which is often referred to as DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness). Computational analyses have predicted that CISD3 regulates the redox state, safeguards the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, and maintains intracellular calcium levels. CISD3, a member of a recently discovered gene family associated with the CDGSH iron protein apoptotic compensatory response, fulfils a crucial function in mitigating the effects of accelerated ageing. The compound ""(-)-(2S)-7,4'-Dihydroxyflavanone"" has been discovered by computational drug design as a possible activator of CISD3. It shows potential therapeutic benefits in ameliorating metabolic dysfunction and enhancing glucose regulation. The ligand binds to the binding pocket of the CISD3 protein, increasing the stability of the protein and enhancing its functionality. The current research investigates the binding processes of the molecule in various structures and its anticipated effects on these tissues, therefore providing valuable insights into the mitigation of age-related diabetes and metabolic dysfunction. The projected tripling of the worldwide population of individuals aged 50 and above by 2050 necessitates the urgent development of immunoinformatics-based approaches, including pharmaceutical therapies that target CISD3, to prevent age-related pathologies.

In total, 100 physicians participated in the study. Physicians responded that criteria used for referral for DR screening according to duration was <5 years (n = 0), 5-10 years (n = 60), >10 years (n = 10), and irrespective of the duration (n = 30). According to severity, well-controlled DM without (n = 30) and with other system involvement (n = 50) and uncontrolled DM without (20) and with other system involvement (n = 50) and irrespective of the severity of disease (n = 30) was reported. Physicians (n = 40) responded that patients who were diagnosed with DR belonged to the Type 1 DM category rather than Type 2 DM (P < 0.05). With regard to the barriers and challenges faced in ensuring DR screening, the following themes emerged: no ocular symptoms, lack of compliance, time constraint for the patient, and lack of motivation. We found that the preferred practice pattern of physicians regarding referral for DR screening was dependent on the duration of the disease (mostly 5-10 years of the disease) and severity (when other systems were involved). Noncompliance with advice was the major barrier to DR screening.",Indian journal of ophthalmology,2021-Nov,"Moudgil T, Bains BK, Bandhu S, Kanda N",4,1670,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
38900771,The effect of multi-component exercise on cognition function in patients with diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This meta-analysis investigated the influence of exercise on cognitive function in people living with diabetes. Stringent criteria for literature inclusion and exclusion were defined. Searches were conducted across four English databases to gather randomized controlled trials investigating exercise interventions for cognitive function in people living with diabetes. Outcome indicators from 1193 subjects across 12 articles were analyzed using RevMan 5.4 software. Exercise intervention demonstrated the ability to mitigate cognitive decline in people living with diabetes, with a combined effect size (standardized mean difference) of 0.91, 95% CI: 0.28, 1.54, P < 0.00001. The intervention effect showed significant modulation by intervention content (I2 = 95%), intervention duration (I2 = 95%), intervention frequency (I2 = 95%), and intervention cycle (I2 = 96%). Among these factors, multi-component exercise, sessions >40 minutes, exercise frequency >4 times per week, and sustained exercise for >6 months were paramount, all with P < 0.05. Exercise intervention emerges as a viable strategy for delaying cognitive decline in people living with diabetes. Its efficacy is subject to modulation by various variables. Optimal intervention includes multi-component exercise, individual sessions lasting 40-60 minutes, exercising >4 times a week, and continuous exercise for over 6 months.",PloS one,2024-,"Sun Z, Liu H, Yan M, Zeng H, Hu Y, Tian X, Mao D",7,1393,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
34620282,Time-to-onset of diabetes with everolimus use: analysis of a spontaneous reporting system database.,"The incidence of hyperglycemia and diabetes induced by everolimus has been shown in previous studies. Our study analyzed diabetes time-to-onset profiles after everolimus use in patients who underwent transplantation and patients with cancer. Using data from April 2007 to December 2018 in the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database, the reports with everolimus were classified according to its use as an immunosuppressant or anticancer drug. The median (25%-75%) days of diabetes time-to-onset in patients who underwent transplantation and patients with cancer were 172 (56-315) and 32 (18.5-57), respectively. There were no significant variations among patients with breast cancer, neuroendocrine tumor, and renal cell carcinoma. By conducting a Weibull shape parameter test, the lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals of the shape parameter Î² values for the indications of the cancer types were >1, indicating the wear out failure type profile, whereas those for transplantation data indicated a random failure type profile. The diabetes time-to-onset profiles after everolimus use differed between usage as an anticancer drug and immunosuppressant and there were no significant variations among the type of cancer. It was suggested that the incidence of diabetes should be monitored for 1-2 months in patients with cancer, whereas continuous monitoring is needed in patients who undergo transplantation.",Die Pharmazie,2021-Oct,"Ohyama K, Hirakawa K, Sasazaki K, Tanaka H, Hori Y, Takeuchi H",6,1417,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

A randomized controlled trial with a 12-week follow-up was conducted in 41 study sites across Germany. Key eligibility criteria were a diagnosis of type 1, type 2, or gestational diabetes and regular self-monitoring of blood glucose. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to either use the digital diabetes logbook (mySugr PRO), or to the control group without app use. The primary outcome was the reduction in diabetes distress at the 12-week follow-up. All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population with all randomized participants. The trial was registered at the German Register for Clinical Studies (DRKS00022923). Between February 11, 2021, and June 24, 2022, 424 participants (50% female, 50% male) were included, with 282 being randomized to the intervention group (66.5%) and 142 to the control group (33.5%). A total of 397 participants completed the trial (drop-out rate: 6.4%). The median reduction in diabetes distress was 2.41 (interquartile range [IQR]: -2.50 to 8.11) in the intervention group and 1.25 (IQR: -5.00 to 7.50) in the control group. The model-based adjusted between-group difference was significant (-2.20, IQR: -4.02 to -0.38, <i>P</i> = .0182) favoring the intervention group.

CDPM includes intensive patient education, care by multidisciplinary teams and risk management in primary care. The objective of this article is to determine CDPM coverage bottlenecks and to explore facilitators and barriers to implementation. The National Health and Nutrition Survey 2018 was processed to identify key diabetes prevalence, coverage, quality and outcome indicators. Key IMSS informant interviews and document content analyses were undertaken following the Tanahashi coverage decay model and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). IMSS screens 49% of adult beneficiaries for diabetes but only 26% with presumptive diagnosis proceed to confirmation. Out of 4.1 million adults with diabetes, IMSS diagnoses 94% and treats 85%. Medications are received by 90% of patients but only 63% of those requiring insulin receive it. The overall quality of care indicator attains 37% of potential. Coverage of diabetes education, monitoring with HbA1c and interdisciplinary care are 20%, 15% and 3%, respectively. Among IMSS beneficiaries treated by the institute 38.1% have HbA1c levels below 7% and 26.1% have levels above 9%. CDPM facilitators are the perceived threat of uncontrolled diabetes, compatibility of innovation values and willingness for institutional learning. Barriers are centralized decision making, functional differentiation across managers and practitioners and lack of incentives, resource shortages and the lack of measures to ensure fidelity.

34739523,Alleviating the burden of diabetes with Health Equity Funds: Economic evaluation of the health and financial risk protection benefits in Cambodia.,"In Cambodia, diabetes caused nearly 3% of the country's mortality in 2016 and became the fourth highest cause of disability in 2017. Providing sufficient financial risk protection from health care expenditures may be part of the solution towards effectively tackling the diabetes burden and motivating individuals to appropriately seek care to effectively manage their condition. In this study, we aim to estimate the distributional health and financial impacts of strategies providing financial coverage for diabetes services through the Health Equity Funds (HEF) in Cambodia. The trajectory of diabetes was represented using a Markov model to estimate the societal costs, health impacts, and individual out-of-pocket expenditures associated with six strategies of HEF coverage over a time horizon of 45 years. Input parameters for the model were compiled from published literature and publicly available household survey data. Strategies covered different combinations of types of diabetes care costs (i.e., diagnostic services, medications, and management of diabetes-related complications). Health impacts were computed as the number of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted and financial risk protection was analyzed in terms of cases of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) averted. Model simulations demonstrated that coverage for medications would be cost-effective, accruing health benefits ($27 per DALY averted) and increases in financial risk protection ($2 per case of CHE averted) for the poorest in Cambodia. Women experienced particular gains in health and financial risk protection. Increasing the number of individuals eligible for financial coverage also improved the value of such investments. For HEF coverage, the government would pay between an estimated $28 and $58 per diabetic patient depending on the extent of coverage and services covered. Efforts to increase the availability of services and capacity of primary care facilities to support diabetes care could have far-reaching impacts on the burden of diabetes and contribute to long-term health system strengthening.",PloS one,2021-,"Feldhaus I, Nagpal S, Verguet S",3,2107,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
35939485,Is mental health co-morbidity an influencing factor in the health service utilisation of women with diabetes mellitus?,"Diabetes Mellitus, affecting nearly half a billion people worldwide, is a substantial global public health issue. Although diabetes predominantly affects men, women with diabetes have specific risks and self-management characteristics. Women have a higher risk of either presenting with or developing depression or anxiety, as well as being high users of complementary medicine which can create clinical governance issues. In spite of these known gender differences, limited research has explored gender-specific diabetes care, especially health service use patterns. As increasing attention has turned to supporting people with diabetes to successfully self-manage their diabetes, it is important that we understand how women with diabetes are using health services, and if their specific risk profile is influencing their health care choices. Our study sought to examine the relationship between mental health status and the patterns of conventional and complementary medicine health service use by women diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Our results showed that women with diabetes and any mental health co-morbidity were more likely to visit their general practitioner more frequently or use herbal medicine than those without a mental health co-morbidity. Women with depression and anxiety were also less likely to consult a physiotherapist and those with anxiety less likely to consult a podiatrist over time when compared to the other mental health groups.",PloS one,2022-,"Oorschot T, Adams J, Sibbritt D",3,1463,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Little is known about healthcare professionals' (HCPs) experiences of supporting people affected by diabetes and FI, and no national guidelines incorporate consideration of FI within UK diabetes care. A qualitative study of NHS HCPs' consideration of FI within diabetes care, and the extent to which it informs their clinical practice, was undertaken. Fifteen HCPs providing self-management support to people with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes in a Scottish Health Board took part in semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using a thematic framework approach informed by the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour (COM-B) model of behaviour change. Although the potential impact of FI on diabetes self-management was recognised, this important consideration was not currently core to their clinical practice. Enablers and barriers identified included: personal feelings about raising the issue, lack of knowledge of available resources, the patient-practitioner relationship, and the wider socioeconomic environment. Practical suggestions to support HCPs included: specific training on communication, access to patient support information, use of a screening tool to assess FI, and building NHS-third sector links. Our findings provide insight into cognitive factors, emotional processes and environmental systems impacting on HCPs' practice supporting individuals with diabetes and FI.

Questionnaires were administered to 321 certified diabetes educator nurses from 1277 institutions. The practice of periodontal care was assessed, with factors contributing to periodontal care through items developed based on the capability, opportunity, and motivation-behavior model. Fisher's exact tests and logistic regression were performed. >70% of certified diabetes educator nurses did not provide periodontal care for diabetes patients. The respondents who assessed people's oral conditions were more likely to engage in individual or group education and consult for oral management professionals than those who did not. Significant factors for such assessment were low psychological capability and reflective motivation, irregular and weak intention to engage in oral management, and working at an institution without an outpatient department specializing in diabetes. The education for certified diabetes educator nurses who do not work at an institution with an outpatient department specialized in diabetes care should be prioritized.

39696157,"Identify unmet needs in diabetes care in Shandong, China: a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study using cascade of care framework.","The continuum management of diabetes remains under-evaluated in China. This study aimed to estimate the proportions of diabetes adults at each stage of the cascade of care framework in Shandong, China. We conducted a secondary analysis using the 2018 China Adult Chronic Disease and Nutrition Surveillance (CACDNS) data in Shandong. This nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted between September and November 2018, investigating the major chronic diseases among Chinese adults through interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. We employed the cascade model to examine the proportion of diabetes adults, including both type 1 and type 2, from diabetes screening, diagnosis, pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical treatments, to single and comprehensive management targets, and quantified the attrition between each stage. Diabetes screening was defined as participants reported to have ever received a blood glucose test. Diabetes diagnosis was defined as: 1) fasting plasma glucose (FPG)ââ¥â126 mg/dL, or 2) 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (2 h-OGTT)ââ¥â200 mg/dL, or 3) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)ââ¥â6.5%, or 4) self-reported diabetes. Diabetes management targets included: 1) single glycemic target of personalized HbA1c level, 2) comprehensive ABC targets of personalized HbA1c level, blood pressure (BP)â<â140/80 mm Hg, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levelâ<â2.6 mmol/L, 3) lifestyle target of not currently smoking. The estimated proportion was calculated through self-reported diabetes status and FPG, 2h-OGTT and HbA1c. The number of diabetes cases in Shandong was extrapolated using the 2018 provincial census data for adults aged 18 years and above (Nâ=â80.6 million). The cascade of diabetes care was further examined by age, sex, and Basic Public Health Service (BPHS) enrollment. This secondary analysis included 8,462 individuals (47.8% males, median age: 49.0), among whom 12.4% had diabetes (self-reported: 4.2%, newly diagnosed: 8.2%) and 41.1% had prediabetes. In 2018, an estimated 9.2 million adults in Shandong had diabetes, with 6.4 million (69.6%) receiving diabetes screening but 6.2 million (67.7%) remaining unaware of their conditions. Among self-reported diabetes adults, 2.7 million (86.4%) and 2.8 million (89.6%) received pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical treatment, respectively. Of those with treatments, 1.2 million (58.2%) met personalized glycemic target. A rapid decline, however, was observed in BP (31.1%) and LDL-c (39.3%) control among diabetes patients with multimorbidity (â¥â2 diseases). Ultimately, 0.1 million self-reported diabetes adults (3.8%) achieved the ABC targets. BPHS Enrollment slightly improved comprehensive management with ABC targets. A significant unmet need exists for diabetes adults from screening to management, particularly the comprehensive management of glycemia, BP and LDL-c levels among those with multimorbidity.

Their simultaneous development remains disputable. The aim of the present study was to examine the correlation between CAN and the presence/severity of DSPN in DM. Subjects with type 1 (group A: n=51; mean age 40.4 years) and type 2 DM (group B: n=153; mean age 64.6 years) were studied. Evaluation of DSPN was based on neuropathy disability score. Assessment of CAN was based on the battery of 4 standardized cardiovascular autonomic function tests. In group A, patients with moderate/severe DSPN exhibited a 12-fold higher likelihood of CAN in univariate analysis (p=0.035). However, significance was lost after adjustment for gender, age, DM duration, and haemoglobin A1c. In group A, likelihood for CAN did not correlate with the presence of mild DSPN in univariate and multivariate analysis. In group B, likelihood of CAN was similar in patients with mild and in those with moderate/severe DSPN compared with patients without DSPN in univariate and multivariate analysis. In between group comparison CAN was similarly distributed in the 2 groups (p for interaction=0.367), in patients with no, mild and moderate/severe DSPN.

34689778,Are racial/ethnic minorities recently diagnosed with diabetes less likely than white individuals to receive guideline-directed diabetes preventive care?,"Diabetes mellitus has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. As the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise, the burden of disease is divided unevenly among different populations. Racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes care are pervasive, including the provision of care for prevention of complications. Prevention efforts should be focused on the time that immediately follows a diagnosis of diabetes. The aim of this study was to assess racial/ethnic differences in the receipt of guideline-directed diabetes care for complication prevention by individuals recently diagnosed with diabetes. We used repeated cross-sections of individuals recently diagnosed with diabetes (within the past 5 years) from the National Health Interview Survey from 2011 to 2017. Multivariate regression was used to estimate the associations between race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic) and guideline-directed process measures for prevention of diabetes complications (visits to an eye and foot specialist, and blood pressure and cholesterol checks by a health professional - each in the prior year). We assessed effect modification of these associations by socioeconomic status (SES). In a sample of 7,341 participants, Hispanics had lower rates of having any insurance coverage (75.9â%) than Non-Hispanic Whites (93.2â%) and Blacks (88.1â%; p<0.001). After adjustment for demographics, total comorbidities, SES, and health insurance status, Hispanics were less likely to have an eye exam in the prior year (OR 0.80; (95â% CI 0.65-0.99); p=0.04) and a blood pressure check (OR 0.42; (95â% CI 0.28-0.65); p<0.001) compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. There was no significant effect modification of race/ethnicity by SES. Hispanics recently diagnosed with diabetes were less likely to receive some indicators of guideline-directed care for the prevention of complications. Lack of insurance and SES may partially explain those differences.

There have been few factors that can predict future diabetic complications at the time of diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. This study aimed to clarify the clinical usefulness of MBBO for predicting the development of advanced diabetic microvascular complications. This was a cross-sectional observational study. Of 1304 consecutively admitted patients with type 2 diabetes, we enrolled 435 patients for whom we could confirm their MBBO. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to examine whether MBBO or BMI on admission was associated with advanced diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy. To evaluate the predictive performance of these indexes, we performed cross-validation in various models with MBBO or BMI and evaluated the areas under the curve (AUCs) yielded by these analyses. Univariate analyses suggested that MBBO was associated with advanced retinopathy and nephropathy, while BMI on admission was associated only with advanced nephropathy. In multivariate analyses, MBBO was significantly associated with advanced complications, while BMI on admission was not. For advanced diabetic retinopathy, the AUCs were 0.70-0.72, and for advanced nephropathy, the AUCs were 0.81-0.83. When comparing the AUCs among models, the models with MBBO sustained high predictive performance for diabetic complications. MBBO was independently associated with advanced diabetic complications, while BMI on admission was not. Diabetic microvascular complications in patients with high MBBO could progress more rapidly.

HOUSES is a validated, standardized housing-based SES measure constructed from publicly available county assessor's office data. Diabetic control was assessed by the D5 (HgbA1c < 8, BP < 140/90, statin use, nonsmoking status, and antiplatelet therapy). In the lowest HOUSES quartile, more patients had an uncontrolled D5 (56.4%) than any of the other quartiles (49.2%, 49.8%, 49.6% respectively, p < 0.001). A multivariate analysis shows the adjusted odds of D5 control for patients in the 2nd, 3rd or 4th HOUSES quartiles as opposed to the 1st quartile are 1.28, 1.21, and 1.20, respectively. Lower SES as represented by the first quartile of HOUSES index, is associated with lower odds of D5 control and thus worse diabetic outcomes. Using the HOUSES index to identify these individuals in a patient centered medical home might prove useful in deciding where to focus diabetic control efforts.",Primary care diabetes,2022-Feb,"Greenwood J, Zurek KI, Grimm JM, Wi CI, Vogel JT, Garrison GM",6,1483,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
39656459,Glycemic Control With Layperson-Delivered Telephone Calls vs Usual Care for Patients With Diabetes: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Diabetes is associated with emotional distress and poor mental health, especially for individuals with low income, hindering patients' ability to manage their condition. The health care system's workforce constraints limit its capacity to holistically support patients. To assess the effectiveness of layperson-delivered empathetic engagement over the telephone in helping improve glycemic management for patients with diabetes. This parallel-arm randomized clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment was conducted from February 12, 2022, to April 15, 2023, with final measurements on November 18, 2023, among 260 patients with uncontrolled diabetes from a federally qualified health center in Austin, Texas, engaging telephonically from home. Patients assigned to the intervention group received empathy-oriented telephone calls by community-hired laypeople for 6 months, while those assigned to the control group received usual care. Patients were stratified by baseline score (â¥5 vs <5) on the depressive symptom scale of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The primary outcome was hemoglobin A1c level at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months, assessed for interaction between time and trial arm. Secondary outcomes were self-perceptions of managing diabetes, diabetes-related behaviors and distress, and mental health symptoms (measured via surveys). Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Of 260 participants (mean [SD] age, 49.5 [10.1] years; 163 of 259 women [62.9%]; 176 of 203 [86.7%] with annual income <$40â¯000) enrolled, 6 withdrew. At 6 months, 204 of 254 (80.3%; intervention, 109 of 127 [85.8%] and control, 95 of 127 [74.8%]) returned for measurements. Participants in the intervention group had statistically significant mean (SD) decreases in hemoglobin A1c level at 6 months (from 10.0% [1.9%] to 9.3% [2.0%]) compared with those in the control group (from 9.8% [1.6%] to 9.7% [2.3%]) (Pâ=â.004). The within-person change in hemoglobin A1c level was -0.7% (95% CI, -1.0% to -0.4%) for the intervention group and 0.02% (95% CI, -0.4% to 0.4%) for the control group. For the subgroup with a PHQ-9 score of 5 or more at baseline (38.1% [99 of 260]), the within-person change in hemoglobin A1c was -1.1% (95% CI, -1.8% to -0.5%) for the intervention group and 0.1% (95% CI, -0.7% to 0.8%; Pâ=â.004) for the control group. For the subgroup with a PHQ-9 score less than 5, the within-person change in hemoglobin A1c was -0.4% (95% CI, -0.8% to -0.1%) for the intervention group and -0.02% (95% CI, -0.5% to 0.5%; Pâ=â.21) for the control group. At 6 months, 91.7% of the participants (99 of 108) responded that the program was very or extremely beneficial. In this randomized clinical trial of telephone-based layperson-delivered empathetic engagement, patients with diabetes and low income achieved clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control.

32561381,Predictors of adherence to physical activity guidelines in patients with diabetes mellitus in the US in 2017: An exploratory analysis.,"To identify if there is an association between socio-economic or demographic factors, lifestyle habits, or chronic conditions and meeting the current exercise recommendations for adult patients with Diabetes Mellitus 2 in the United States. This secondary analysis of a cross sectional study used data from participants who reported having diabetes and answered questions regarding physical activity in the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey (n=37,204; 42% women; 30%<60 years-of-age). Respondents were dichotomized according to physical activity adherence. Predictors tested included socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, lifestyle habits, and chronic conditions. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Our data showed that 46.5% of participants with diabetes adhered to the physical activity guidelines. Daily smokers were 25% less likely to adhere to the physical activity recommendations (95% CI 0.59-0.95), patients with obesity were 37% less likely (95% CI 0.53-0.74), and those with chronic kidney disease were 24% (95% CI 0.61-0.94) less likely to do so. The odds of adhering to exercise guidelines were reduced by 20% (95% CI 0.70-0.92), 42% (95% CI 0.49-0.68), and 47% (95% CI 0.32-0.57) in good, fair, and poor health respectively.

34874534,To Tweet or Not to Tweet: A Longitudinal Analysis of Social Media Use by Global Diabetes Researchers.,"Engaging influential stakeholders in meaningful exchange is essential for pharmaceutical companies aiming to improve care. At a time where opportunities for face-to-face engagement are limited, the ability to interact,Â learnÂ and generate actionable insights through digital channels such as Twitter, is of considerable value. The aim of this study was to evaluate digital engagement among global diabetes mellitus researchers. We identified every global tweet (20,614,515) and scientific publication (44,135) regarding diabetes mellitus from 1 August 2018 to 1 August 2020. Through author matching we combined datasets, resulting in a list of digitally active scientific authors. Generalised linear modelling identified factors predicting their digital engagement. Globally, 2686 diabetes researchers used Twitter to discuss the management of diabetes mellitus, posting 110,346 diabetes-related tweets. As Twitter followers increased, so did tweet frequency (pÂ <Â 0.001), retweets (pÂ <Â 0.001) and replies (pÂ <Â 0.001) to their content. Publication count (overall/per month) and proportion of first/last authorships were unrelated to tweet frequency and the likelihood of being retweeted or replied to (pÂ >Â 0.05). Those with the most Â academicÂ co-authors were significantly less likely to tweet than those with smaller networks (<Â 50; pÂ =Â 0.001). Finally, those publishing most frequently on specific themes, including insulin (pÂ =Â 0.041) and paediatrics (pÂ <Â 0.001), were significantly more likely to tweet about these themes. Academic expertise and seniority cannot be assumed as proxies for digital influence. Those aiming to promote science and obtain digital insights regarding condition management should consider looking beyond well-known 'key opinion leaders' to perhaps lesser known 'digital opinion leaders' with smaller academic networks, who are likely to specialise in the delivery of highly specific content to captive audiences.",Pharmaceutical medicine,2021-Nov,"Leigh S, Noble ME, Pearson FE, Iremonger J, Williams DT",5,1940,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Records from the Diabetes Eye Screening Wales (DESW) service for people in Wales, UK, with T1DM diagnosed under age 18 years were combined with other electronic health record (EHR) data in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Data close to the screening date were collected, and risk factors derived from multivariate, multinomial logistic regression modelling. Data from 4172 persons, with median (lower quartile, upper quartile) age 16.3 (13.0, 22.3) years and duration of diabetes 6.6 (2.3, 12.3) years were analysed. 62.6% (nâ=â2613) had no DR, 26.7% (nâ=â1112) background DR, and 10.7% (nâ=â447) had referable DR (RDR). No RDR was observed under 19 years of age. Factors associated with an increased risk of DR were diabetes duration, elevated HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and diastolic blood pressure. People diagnosed with T1DM at 12 years or older had an additional risk for each year they had diabetes compared to those diagnosed before age 12 controlling for the diabetes duration (odds ratios 1.23 and 1.34, respectively). This study found that 37.4% of the study cohort had DR at first screening, the risk being greater the longer the duration of diabetes or higher the HbA<sub>1c</sub> and diastolic blood pressure. In addition, people diagnosed at 12 years of age or over were more likely to have DR with each additional year with diabetes.","Eye (London, England)",2021-Oct,"Rafferty J, Owens DR, Luzio SD, Watts P, Akbari A, Thomas RL",6,1515,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Data regarding the prognostic significance of HbA1c levels in contemporary intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU) patients is limited. All patients admitted to the ICCU at a tertiary care medical center between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, with documented admission HbA1c levels were included in the study. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their HbA1c levels: <â5.7Â g% [no diabetes mellitus (DM)], 5.7-6.4Â g% (pre-DM), â¥â6.5Â g% (DM). A total of 1412 patients were included. Of them, 974 (69%) were male with a mean age of 67(Â±â15.7) years old. HbA1c level <â5.7Â g% was found in 550 (39%) patients, 5.7-6.4Â g% in 458 (32.4%) patients and â¥â6.5Â g% in 404 (28.6%) patients. Among patients who did not know they had DM, 81 (9.3%) patients had high HbA1c levels (â¥â6.5Â g%) on admission.

38768121,"Exploring the path to optimal diabetes care by unravelling the contextual factors affecting access, utilisation, and quality of primary health care in West Africa: A scoping review protocol.","The prevalence of diabetes in West Africa is increasing, posing a major public health threat. An estimated 24 million Africans have diabetes, with rates in West Africa around 2-6% and projected to rise 129% by 2045 according to the WHO. Over 90% of cases are Type 2 diabetes (IDF, World Bank). As diabetes is ambulatory care sensitive, good primary care is crucial to reduce complications and mortality. However, research on factors influencing diabetes primary care access, utilisation and quality in West Africa remains limited despite growing disease burden. While research has emphasised diabetes prevalence and risk factors in West Africa, there remains limited evidence on contextual influences on primary care. This scoping review aims to address these evidence gaps. Using the established methodology by Arksey and O'Malley, this scoping review will undergo six stages. The review will adopt the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to ensure methodological rigour. We will search four electronic databases and search through grey literature sources to thoroughly explore the topic. The identified articles will undergo thorough screening. We will collect data using a standardised data extraction form that covers study characteristics, population demographics, and study methods. The study will identify key themes and sub-themes related to primary healthcare access, utilisation, and quality. We will then analyse and summarise the data using a narrative synthesis approach.

32057724,Perceptions of health care professionals towards clinical practice guidelines: The case of Diabetes Mellitus in Saudi Arabia.,"Clinical practice guidelines are developed by healthcare policy makers and disseminated to practitioners in order to minimize practice variations and to improve the quality of care. Problems arise when there is a sole reliance on passive dissemination strategies such as mailing or publishing the guidelines, as these approaches do not usually lead to the adoption. This study aims to explore the perspectives of the health care professionals toward the Saudi National Diabetes Guidelines in terms of awareness, adherence and their preferred dissemination and implementation strategies of the guideline. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among physicians and nurses working in twenty primary health care centers in the city of Riyadh between February and March 2019. Nearly half of the total 179 respondents reported that they were unaware of the guidelines (49.1%), and 92% of the remaining 91 participants who were aware of the guideline reported that they had first heard about it through their official mail. The mean scores ranked according to the most preferred methods for disseminating and implementing the diabetes guidelines were as follows: via reminder systems 4.35Â±0.74, financial incentives 4.33Â±0.65, and audit and feedback 4.27Â±0.58. On the other hand, the least favorable strategies were traditional education 3.79Â±0.96 and the distribution of the guideline by mail 3.13Â±0.95. The level of awareness of the diabetes guidelines among the primary health care professionals was suboptimal. This was more likely due to the Ministry of Health's reliance on passive implementation strategies. In order to have the guidelines translated into clinical practice, active and targeted implementation strategies such as reminder systems, audit and feedback must be considered by the Saudi health policy makers.",Primary care diabetes,2020-Dec,"Alharbi NS, Alanazi MA",2,1820,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Individuals with prediabetes were identified and mailed letters encouraging them to enroll. We surveyed those who enrolled and a random sample of those who did not using the HBM as a framework to examine factors associated with enrollment. Analyses were performed using multivariable logistic regression models. Of 64,131 employees, retirees, and dependents, 8131 were identified with prediabetes and 776 (9.5%) enrolled in the National DPP. Of those surveyed, 532 of 776 National DPP enrollees and 945 of 2673 non-enrollees responded to the survey (adjusted response rates 74% and 43%, respectively). Among survey respondents, factors associated with National DPP enrollment included older age, female sex, higher BMI, prediabetes awareness, greater perceived benefits of health-protective action, and one or more cues to action.

38184599,Determinants of disparities of diabetes-related hospitalization rates in Florida: a retrospective ecological study using a multiscale geographically weighted regression approach.,"Early diagnosis, control of blood glucose levels and cardiovascular risk factors, and regular screening are essential to prevent or delay complications of diabetes. However, most adults with diabetes do not meet recommended targets, and some populations have disproportionately high rates of potentially preventable diabetes-related hospitalizations. Understanding the factors that contribute to geographic disparities can guide resource allocation and help ensure that future interventions are designed to meet the specific needs of these communities. Therefore, the objectives of this study were (1) to identify determinants of diabetes-related hospitalization rates at the ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA) level in Florida, and (2) assess if the strengths of these relationships vary by geographic location and at different spatial scales. Diabetes-related hospitalization (DRH) rates were computed at the ZCTA level using data from 2016 to 2019. A global ordinary least squares regression model was fit to identify socioeconomic, demographic, healthcare-related, and built environment characteristics associated with log-transformed DRH rates. A multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model was then fit to investigate and describe spatial heterogeneity of regression coefficients. Populations of ZCTAs with high rates of diabetes-related hospitalizations tended to have higher proportions of older adults (pâ<â0.0001) and non-Hispanic Black residents (pâ=â0.003). In addition, DRH rates were associated with higher levels of unemployment (pâ=â0.001), uninsurance (pâ<â0.0001), and lack of access to a vehicle (pâ=â0.002). Population density and median household income had significant (pâ<â0.0001) negative associations with DRH rates. Non-stationary variables exhibited spatial heterogeneity at local (percent non-Hispanic Black, educational attainment), regional (age composition, unemployment, health insurance coverage), and statewide scales (population density, income, vehicle access). The findings of this study underscore the importance of socioeconomic resources and rurality in shaping population health. Understanding the spatial context of the observed relationships provides valuable insights to guide needs-based, locally-focused health planning to reduce disparities in the burden of potentially avoidable hospitalizations.",International journal of health geographics,2024-Jan,"Lord J, Odoi A",2,2356,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

A systematic random sampling of persons with diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) attending five health centers in Kingston, Jamaica, was conducted. A modified Ministry of Health paper-based audit tool captured quality of care and outcome indicators (blood pressure and glycemic control). Additional chart audits were conducted by a physician and nurse to assess reliability. One hundred and forty-nine charts were audited between January and September 2017. One hundred and thirty-eight persons (92.6%) had hypertension (27 men and 111 women); 77 persons (51.7%) had DM (14 men and 63 women). The median age was 64Â years old. Approximately two-thirds of persons with HTN and DM had electrolytes, lipid profile, and ECG done within the last year. One-fifth of persons with hypertension (18.5% men and 19.8% women, PÂ =Â 1.000) had adequate blood pressure control with greater control among persons with HTN only compared to persons with both DM and HTN. Poor glycemic control was recorded for 69% of persons with DM (57% men and 71% women, PÂ =Â .297). Moderate to substantial inter-rater agreement was observed for quality of care indicators. Our findings confirmed that hypertension and glycemic control are inadequate among persons attending primary care clinics in Jamaica's capital city. Simplified clinical audits can provide important quality of care and outcome indicators without losing the meaningfulness of the data collected.","Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)",2020-Jul,"Duncan JP, Tulloch-Reid MK, Reid-Jones H, Figueroa JP",4,1606,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
38980510,Community-engaged Systems for Population Health Improvement: A Novel Approach to Improve Diabetes Outcomes in Rural Communities.,"Approaches to prevent and manage diabetes at a community population level are hindered because current strategies are not aligned with the structure and function of a community system. We describe a community-driven process based on local data and rapid prototyping as an alternative approach to create diabetes prevention and care management solutions appropriate for each community. We report on the process and provide baseline data for a 3-year case study initiative to improve diabetes outcomes in two rural Nebraska communities. We developed an iterative design process based on the assumption that decentralized decision-making using local data feedback and monitoring will lead to the innovation of local sustainable solutions. Coalitions act as community innovation hubs and meet monthly to work through a facilitated design process. Six core diabetes measures will be tracked over the course of the project using the electronic health record from community clinics as a proxy for the entire community. Baseline data indicate two-thirds of the population in both communities are at risk for prediabetes based on age and body mass index. However, only a fraction (35% and 12%) of those at risk have been screened. This information led both coalitions to focus on improving screening rates in their communities. In order to move a complex system towards an optimal state (e.g., improved diabetes outcomes), stakeholders must have access to continuous feedback of accurate, pertinent information in order to make informed decisions.

Key government organizations have developed clinical quality indicators (CQIs) to ensure patients receive adequate care. The CQIs for comprehensive diabetes care are complex and often indicate a gap-in-care among vulnerable populations. To evaluate if the availability of point-of-care (POC) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing in a mobile clinic increases CQIs adherence in vulnerable populations. This evidence-based clinical practice change project (EBCPCP) focused on improving diabetic CQIs in vulnerable populations by implementing POC HbA1c testing on a federally qualified health centers (FQHC) mobile clinic. The results, 125 individuals having received HbA1c results, indicate having POC HgbA1c testing available on the mobile unit increased HbA1c testing. No patients had an HbA1c lab completed prior to the availability of POC testing. The availability of POC testing on a mobile clinic increases access to HbA1c for vulnerable populations which improves practice outcomes and increased CQI adherence.

The classifier has three predictors age, <i>b</i>/<i>a</i>, and SP indices in which they achieved an overall accuracy of 92.3% in the prediction of diabetes. In this study, a total of 587 subjects were enrolled. A total of 459 subjects were used for model training and development, while the rest of the 128 subjects were used for model testing and validation. The classifier was able to diagnose 63 patients correctly as diabetes while 27 subjects were wrongly classified as nondiabetes with an accuracy of 70%. Again, the model classified 479 subjects as nondiabetes correctly while it incorrectly classified 18 subjects as diabetes with an accuracy of 96.4%. Finally, the proposed model revealed an overall predictive accuracy of 92.3% which makes it a reliable surrogate measure for diabetes classification and prediction in clinical settings.",BioMed research international,2020-,"Qawqzeh YK, Bajahzar AS, Jemmali M, Otoom MM, Thaljaoui A",5,1016,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
35435949,A Machine Learning-Based Predictive Model to Identify Patients Who Failed to Attend a Follow-up Visit for Diabetes Care After Recommendations From a National Screening Program.,"Reportedly, two-thirds of the patients who were positive for diabetes during screening failed to attend a follow-up visit for diabetes care in Japan. We aimed to develop a machine-learning model for predicting people's failure to attend a follow-up visit. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults with newly screened diabetes at a national screening program using a large Japanese insurance claims database (JMDC, Tokyo, Japan). We defined failure to attend a follow-up visit for diabetes care as no physician consultation during the 6 months after the screening. The candidate predictors were patient demographics, comorbidities, and medication history. In the training set (randomly selected 80% of the sample), we developed two models (previously reported logistic regression model and Lasso regression model). In the test set (remaining 20%), prediction performance was examined. We identified 10,645 patients, including 5,450 patients who failed to attend follow-up visits for diabetes care. The Lasso regression model using four predictors had a better discrimination ability than the previously reported logistic regression model using 13 predictors (C-statistic: 0.71 [95% CI 0.69-0.73] vs. 0.67 [0.65-0.69]; P < 0.001). The four selected predictors in the Lasso regression model were lower frequency of physician visits in the previous year, lower HbA1c levels, and negative history of antidyslipidemic or antihypertensive treatment. The developed machine-learning model using four predictors had a good predictive ability to identify patients who failed to attend a follow-up visit for diabetes care after a screening program.",Diabetes care,2022-Jun,"Okada A, Hashimoto Y, Goto T, Yamaguchi S, Ono S, Ikeda Kurakawa K, Nangaku M, Yamauchi T, Yasunaga H, Kadowaki T",10,1647,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
34209306,Acellular Dermal Matrix Used in Diabetic Foot Ulcers: Clinical Outcomes Supported by Biochemical and Histological Analyses.,"Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a diabetes complication which greatly impacts the patient's quality of life, often leading to amputation of the affected limb unless there is a timely and adequate management of the patient. DFUs have a high economic impact for the national health system. Data have indeed shown that DFUs are a major cause of hospitalization for patients with diabetes. Based on that, DFUs represent a very important challenge for the national health system. Especially in developed countries diabetic patients are increasing at a very high rate and as expected, also the incidence of DFUs is increasing due to longevity of diabetic patients in the western population. Herein, the surgical approach focused on the targeted use of the acellular dermal matrix has been integrated with biochemical and morphological/histological analyses to obtain evidence-based information on the mechanisms underlying tissue regeneration. In this research report, the clinical results indicated decreased postoperative wound infection levels and a short healing time, with a sound regeneration of tissues. Here we demonstrate that the key biomarkers of wound healing process are activated at gene expression level and also synthesis of collagen I, collagen III and elastin is prompted and modulated within the 28-day period of observation. These analyses were run on five patients treated with Integra<sup>Â®</sup> sheet and five treated with the injectable matrix Integra<sup>Â®</sup> Flowable, for cavitary lesions. In fact, clinical evaluation of improved healing was, for the first time, supported by biochemical and histological analyses. For these reasons, the present work opens a new scenario in DFUs treatment and follow-up, laying the foundation for a tailored protocol towards complete healing in severe pathological conditions.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021-Jun,"Campitiello F, Mancone M, Cammarota M, D'Agostino A, Ricci G, Stellavato A, Della Corte A, Pirozzi AVA, Scialla G, Schiraldi C, Canonico S",11,1833,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The study explores disparities in the availability of services and predicts the readiness of primary healthcare facilities to manage diabetes in Tanzania. The study analyzed data from the 2014-2015 Tanzania Service Provision Assessment Survey. A total of 1142 primary healthcare facilities were included in this analysis. The Negative binomial regression models were fitted to predict each of selected independent variable that is associated with the readiness of primary healthcare to manage diabetes. The overall availability of services was significantly different across the type of facility and managing authority. In an adjusted model, the following were the predictors for a significant increase in readiness to manage diabetes: health center [Î² = 0.470], private facilities [Î² = 0.252], the performance of management meetings [Î² = 0.446], having source of fund other than government [Î² = 0.193,], and presence of medical doctors [Î² = 0.677]. The robust primary care systems to manage diabetes could be achieved by improving the readiness of primary healthcare facilities through optimizing the availability of diagnostic tools, basic medicines, medical doctors, and early release of a government fund to publicly-owned facilities.",Primary care diabetes,2021-Apr,"Bintabara D, Shayo FK",2,1338,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

To determine the difference in 30-day hospital readmission rates for patients who receive IDPE compared to those who do not. This retrospective cohort was completed at UTMC. Patients admitted between October 1, 2012, and September 30, 2013, were included if they were â¥18 years and had one of the following: (1) diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, (2) blood glucose >200 mg/dL (>11.11 mmol/L) on admission, or (3) hemoglobin A<sub>1C</sub> of >6.5% (>48 mmol/mol). Patients who received IDPE from a pharmacist or student pharmacist (intervention group) were compared to patients who did not receive IDPE (control group). The 30-day readmission rate was 13.2% for the intervention group (n = 364) and 21.5% for the control group (n = 149) (<i>P</i> = .023). Average time to 30-day readmission was 13.1 (Â±8.3) days for the IDPE group and 11.9 (Â±7.9) days for the control group. There was no significant difference in diabetes-related readmission between the intervention and control groups (25.5% vs 21.9%). An IDPE program delivered primarily by pharmacists and student pharmacists significantly reduced 30-day readmission rates among patients with diabetes.",Journal of pharmacy practice,2020-Dec,"Murphy JA, Schroeder MN, Ridner AT, Gregory ME, Whitner JB, Hackett SG",6,1307,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
32839128,Readiness for utilizing digital intervention: Patterns of internet use among older adults with diabetes.,"The Internet is an important source of health and self-care information for older adults with diabetes. This study examined whether older adults with diabetes can be classified into different profiles based on Internet use. A latent class analysis based on 10 Internet activities was conducted using a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 65 and older (N = 1919). A multinomial logistic regression was performed to explore the potential differences related to socio-demographic characteristics and health-related factors among the classes. Three distinct classes were identified based on Internet use: non-users (n = 1299, 67.6%), communicating users (n = 327, 17.4%), and smart users (n = 293, 15.3%). Smart users were more likely to be highly educated, wealthy, and socially active, and to have good physical and cognitive functioning abilities in comparison, to the other classes. The communicating users were defined by a low incidence of depression. Older adults with diabetes are a diverse group in terms of their Internet activities. Distinguishing among the various types of older adults with diabetes can help healthcare providers tailor their approach to encourage such adults to engage in digital self-care.",Primary care diabetes,2020-Dec,"Park S, Kim B",2,1234,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Class imbalance happens where an instance in the class of interest is relatively low, when compared to the rest of the data. This study aims to apply oversampling strategies in an attempt to balance the classes and improve classification performance. We evaluated four different classifiers from k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and decision trees (DT) with 73 oversampling strategies. In this work, we used imbalanced learning oversampling techniques to improve classification in datasets that are distinctively sparser and clustered.

34237470,Use of Endocrine Consultation for Hemoglobin A1C â¥9.0% as a Standardized Practice in an Emergency Department Observation Unit.,"Severely uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with poor long-term outcomes and may remain unrecognized. A high frequency of uncontrolled DM has been identified in the acute-care setting, including the emergency department observation unit (EDOU). We assess the use of standardized endocrine consultation in the EDOU for hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels â¥9%. Standard practice in our EDOU includes universal HbA1C screening and endocrine consultation for HbA1C levels â¥9.0%. As part of a quality improvement program, EDOU patients with HbA1C levels â¥9.0% had an endocrinology consult. One-month follow-up phone calls assessed the effects of consultation after discharge. HbA1C tests were administered to 3688 (95.7%) of 3853 EDOU patients, of which 7.0% (nÂ = 258) were found to have an HbA1C level â¥9% (mean Â± SD, 11.7 Â± 1.8%; range, 9%-16.6%). Endocrine consults were completed for 73.6% (190/258) patients with severely uncontrolled DM. Among the 190 patients, 92.1% (nÂ = 175) had discharge DM medication adjustments. For known patients with DM (nÂ = 142), injectable diabetes medication prescriptions increased from 47.2% (67/142) on EDOU arrival to 78.2% (111/142) upon discharge. Newly diagnosed DM injectable prescriptions increased from 0% (0/48) on arrival to 72.9% (35/48) upon discharge. A total of 72.6% (nÂ = 138) were contacted at a 1-month follow-up and 94.9% (nÂ = 131) reported taking DM medications, compared with 68.2% (nÂ = 94) before consult.

Among the numerous techniques dedicated to tackle this problem, data preprocessing solutions are known to be efficient and easy to implement. In this paper, we propose a selective data preprocessing approach that embeds knowledge of the outlier instances into artificially generated subset to achieve an even distribution. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) was used to balance the training data by introducing artificial minority instances. However, this was not before the outliers were identified and oversampled (irrespective of class). The aim is to balance the training dataset while controlling the effect of outliers.

The objective of this study was to assess variation in overall and individual diabetes care practices and identify specific factors associated with differences in these practices in a representative sample of US diabetic adults. Cross-sectional data were from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Survey logistic regression was used to account for the complex sampling design. Among 30â780 eligible participants, 8957 (equivalent to 28% of the target population) followed all four diabetes care practices. Insulin-dependent participants had higher adjusted odds (adjusted OR=2.95; 95% CI 2.62 to 3.31) of following all four diabetic care practices compared with those who did not. Cost-related variables (having healthcare coverage and/or a personal doctor) were positively associated with diabetes care practices, with the strongest association observed for adherence to more costly practices (annual eye examination and cholesterol check) versus less costly ones (daily blood glucose check, daily foot check).

39577876,Clinical utility of novel diabetes subgroups in predicting vascular complications and mortality: up to 25 years of follow-up of the HUNT Study.,"Cluster analysis has previously revealed five reproducible subgroups of diabetes, differing in risks of diabetic complications. We aimed to examine the clusters' predictive ability for vascular complications as compared with established risk factors in a general adult diabetes population. Participants from the second (HUNT2, 1995-1997) and third (HUNT3, 2006-2008) surveys of the Norwegian population-based TrÃ¸ndelag Health Study (HUNT Study) with adult-onset diabetes were included (n=1899). To identify diabetes subgroups, we used the same variables (age at diagnosis, body mass index, HbA1c, homeostasis model assessment estimates of beta cell function and insulin resistance, and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies) and the same data-driven clustering technique as in previous studies. We used Cox proportional hazards models to investigate associations between clusters and risks of vascular complications and mortality. We estimated the C-index and R<sup>2</sup> to compare predictive abilities of the clusters to those of established risk factors as continuous variables. All models included adjustment for age, sex, diabetes duration and time of inclusion. We reproduced five subgroups with similar key characteristics as identified in previous studies. During median follow-up of 9-13 years (differing between outcomes), the clusters were associated with different risks of vascular complications and all-cause mortality. However, in prediction models, individual established risk factors were at least as good predictors as cluster assignment for all outcomes. For example, for retinopathy, the C-index for the model including clusters (0.65 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.68)) was similar to that of HbA1c (0.65 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.68)) or fasting C-peptide (0.66 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.68)) alone. For chronic kidney disease, the C-index for clusters (0.74 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.76)) was similar to that of triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein ratio (0.74 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.76)) or fasting C-peptide (0.74 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.76)), and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate yielded a C-index of 0.76 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.78).

39531755,Prognostic value of pulse wave velocity for cardiovascular disease risk stratification in diabetic patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Arterial stiffness, a significant cardiovascular risk marker, is particularly important in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Pulse wave velocity (PWV), a non-invasive measure of arterial stiffness, has emerged as an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, its precise prognostic value in DM patients for cardiovascular risk stratification remains unclear. To address this, a systematic review was conducted. A thorough search of Ovid and Scopus databases was performed for cohort studies on PWV measurements for cardiovascular risk stratification in DM patients. Nine studies were included, examining the relationship between PWV and cardiovascular events or composite endpoints in DM patients asymptomatic of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The review revealed that optimal PWV cutoffs to predict composite cardiovascular events ranged from 10 to 12.16Â m/s (aortic PWV) and 14 to 16.72Â m/s (brachial-ankle PWV). In addition, meta-analysis yielded a HR of 1.15 (95Â % CI 1.07-1.24, pÂ <Â 0.001, I<sup>2</sup>Â =Â 70Â %) for aortic PWV in predicting cardiovascular events. The assessment of arterial stiffness via PWV shows promise as an early diagnostic marker for CVD in DM patients, aiding in improved disease management. This underscores the potential of PWV in enhancing cardiovascular risk assessment and guiding clinical decisions in this high-risk population, without invasive procedures or radiation exposure.",Journal of diabetes and its complications,2024-Dec,"Cheong SS, Samah N, Che Roos NA, Ugusman A, Mohamad MSF, Beh BC, Zainal IA, Aminuddin A",8,1448,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
34213655,Redefining distal symmetrical polyneuropathy features in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review.,"Diabetic neuropathy is among the most frequent complications of both type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and commonly manifests as a distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN). Despite evidence that T1DM- and T2DM-related DSPN are separate entities, most of our knowledge on diabetic DSPN derives from studies focused on type 2 diabetes. This systematic review provides an overview of current evidence on DSPN in T1DM, including its epidemiological, pathophysiological and clinical features, along with principal diagnostic tests findings. This review included 182 clinical and preclinical studies. The results indicate that DSPN is a less frequent complication in T1DM compared with T2DM and that distinctive pathophysiological mechanisms underlie T1DM-related DSPN development, with hyperglycemia as a major determinant. T1DM-related DSPN more frequently manifests with non-painful than painful symptoms, with lower neuropathic pain prevalence compared with T2DM-associated DSPN. The overt clinical picture seems characterized by a higher prevalence of large fiber-related clinical signs (e.g., ankle reflexes reduction and vibration hypoesthesia) and to a lesser extent small fiber damage (e.g., thermal or pinprick hypoesthesia). These findings as a whole suggest that large fibers impairment plays a dominant role in the clinical picture of symptomatic T1DM-related DSPN. Nevertheless, small fiber diagnostic testing shows high diagnostic accuracy in detecting early nerve damage and may be an appropriate diagnostic tool for disease monitoring and screening.",Acta diabetologica,2022-Jan,"Galosi E, Hu X, Michael N, Nyengaard JR, Truini A, Karlsson P",6,1567,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

It is suspected that 1-2 % of women diagnosed with GDM are misdiagnosed maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). MODY often has a subclinical course; thus, it is challenging for clinicians to aptly diagnose monogenic diabetes in pregnancy. Proper diagnosis is crucial for the effective treatment of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy. Many studies revealed that misdiagnosis of MODY increases the rate of complications for both mother and fetus. This literature review reports the current knowledge regarding diagnosis, treatment, and complications of the most common types of MODY in pregnancy.",Current diabetes reviews,2023-,"Majewska A, Stanirowski P, WielgoÅ M, Bomba-OpoÅ D",4,866,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

32428521,Heat transfer analysis of blood perfusion in diabetic rats using a genetic algorithm.,"Diabetes is frequently associated with structural and functional impairment of the microcirculation. Blood perfusion is an important indicator of both physiological and pathological conditions of the microcirculation. Given that temperature is closely related to blood perfusion and is more easily measured, blood perfusion can be estimated from variations in skin temperature using an inverse method. The aim of this paper was to develop a thermal analysis method for estimation of blood perfusion and apply it in the assessment of skin blood perfusion in diabetic rats. First, diabetes was induced in the rat models of the experimental group. Skin temperature from the rats left hind paws was measured during a 10-min local heating period followed by a 15-min cooling period. A simple one-dimensional heat transfer model, including an arteriolar vessel node, was used to describe the skin heat transfer process. The blood perfusion of the arteriole was estimated by correlating the calculated skin temperature with known experimental temperatures using a genetic algorithm. The results indicated that the average blood perfusion in the control group was higher during local heating and decreased faster during the cooling period, showing dynamic responses to the thermal stimuli. In contrast, the blood perfusion of diabetic rats was reduced compared with that of the control rats during the heating phase and the rate of decrease in perfusion during the cooling stage was similarly reduced, implying a slower response to thermal stimulation in these rats. It is interesting to note that diabetic rats fed a normal diet showed a similar blood perfusion pattern to that in the control rats, implying that diet may be important in the treatment of diabetes-associated microvascular dysfunction.",Microvascular research,2020-Sep,"Wang Y, Mu L, He Y, Tang Y, Liu C, Lu Y, Xu L",7,1794,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
37120507,A multiple case study of pre-diabetes care undertaken by general practice in Aotearoa/New Zealand: de-incentivised and de-prioritised work.,"In Aotearoa/New Zealand (NZ) general practices diagnose and manage pre-diabetes. This work is important as it has the potential to delay or prevent the onset of Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM), reduce NZ's health inequities, and the burden that T2DM places on health care services. However, no study has previously examined how this work routinely occurs in NZ. Two case studies of practices serving ethnically and socio-economically diverse populations, followed by cross-case analysis. The NZ health care context including funding mechanisms, reporting targets, and the disease centred focus of care, acted together to dis-incentivise and de-prioritise pre-diabetes care in general practices. The social determinants of health differentially influenced patients' ability to engage with and respond to pre-diabetes care, significantly impacting this work. Differing perspectives about the significance of pre-diabetes and gaps in systematic screening practices were identified. Interventions used were inconsistent and lacked comprehensive ongoing support. Complex multi-layered factors impact on pre-diabetes care, and many of the barriers cannot be addressed at the general practice level. The practice serving the most disadvantaged population who concurrently have higher rates of pre-diabetes/T2DM were more adversely affected by the barriers identified.",BMC primary care,2023-Apr,"Barthow C, Krebs J, McKinlay E",3,1351,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

There is minimal research and a serious lack of screening models for people with a family history of diabetes (FHD), especially one which incorporates gender characteristics. Therefore, the primary objective of our study was to develop a screening model for estimating UDM among people with FHD and enable its validation. We used data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). KNAHNES (2010-2016) was used as a developmental cohort (n = 5939) and was then evaluated in a validation cohort (n = 1047) KNHANES (2017). We developed the screening model for UDM in male (SMM), female (SMF), and male and female combined (SMP) with FHD using backward stepwise logistic regression analysis. The SMM and SMF showed an appropriate performance (area under curve (AUC) = 76.2% and 77.9%) compared with SMP (AUC = 72.9%) in the validation cohort. Consequently, simple screening models were developed and validated, for the estimation of UDM among patients in the FHD group, which is expected to reduce the burden on the national health care system.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020-Nov,"Ryu KS, Kang HYJ, Lee SW, Park HW, You NY, Kim JH, Hwangbo Y, Choi KS, Cha HS",9,1176,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The current novel corona virus-19 epidemic has limited our ability to conduct in-person consultations with patients as before and most of us limit physical contact to the minimum. This has made the process of history taking either by virtual consultations or physically in our offices but by maintaining appropriate physical distance more important than even before. This review summarizes an easy-to-understand hierarchy of questioning to help us in maximizing the information obtained by history taking. We initiate the clinical interview with a warm welcome and first focus on the primary felt need of the patient. Then we interview the patient about his duration and current control of his diabetes. The second part of the interview focuses on current clinical status including reviewing for complications and co-morbidities. The third part focuses on current ongoing management including life style, diet, glucose lowering and other drugs and the use of complementary and alternative medicines. The fourth part of the interview focuses on emotional status including religious and cultural beliefs about diabetes management and presence of diabetes related distress.

This review examined the applicability of the ROH to diabetes in Australia. Five databases were searched for articles and government reports published between January 2000 and August 2019. Data was extracted for each level of the framework, and pooled sample proportions calculated for the total population and sub-group analysis by ethnicity and type of diabetes. The results showed that 72% of people with diabetes are diagnosed. Approximately 50% are receiving standard care, and 40-60% are meeting treatment targets for HbA1c, blood pressure and lipid levels. Overall, Australia is doing better than the ROH when it comes to achieving treatment outcomes; prevalence of microvascular complications was 20-30% and cardiovascular disease 62%. Indigenous people were less likely to meet treatment targets and more likely to experience adverse complications of diabetes.

Although evidence on the positive effects of family-centered care on older adults and their families is accumulating, less is known about the providers' beliefs, attitudes and practices related to family-centeredness, especially regarding community-based primary healthcare services for the rapidly-ageing Chinese population. This study investigated Chinese primary care providers' perceptions and experiences of family-centered care for older adults, using community-based diabetes management services as an example. Ten focus-group interviews involving 48 community health professionals were conducted. Major themes were identified using thematic analysis. The interviews revealed that the providers acknowledged the importance of the family in older patients' diabetes management, while their current scope of practice with the patients' families was limited and informal. The barriers to implementing family-centered care were attributed to structural and environmental obstacles associated with the patients' families and the community healthcare context and culture. To engage patients' families more effectively, the providers suggested that family-centered values endorsed by their healthcare organizations and reinforced by policies, a trained interdisciplinary team of health professionals and community social workers, and also that the utilization of technology would be beneficial. Our study extends the evidence of family-centered care for older adults in Chinese community-based healthcare settings, contributing to the design of a tailored healthcare delivery model embodying ageing in place.",BMC geriatrics,2021-Jul,"Tu J, Liao J",2,1784,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Therefore, it is imperative to reassess the management of post-transplant diabetes mellitus and consider the role of newer agents. With improved transplant-related survival and high prevalence of post-transplant diabetes, management of long-term complications such as diabetes are increasingly important. There are limited guidelines to assist in choice of appropriate agents after solid organ transplantation. Traditional therapies including insulin and sulfonylureas may still have a role; however, other agents should be considered prior. The evidence of novel glucose-lowering agents in post-transplant care is limited, and most studies have focused on kidney transplant recipients. While there are some parallels between renal and cardiac transplant recipients, the potential cardiovascular benefits, particularly on cardiac fibrosis are unique to cardiac transplantation. The treatment of diabetes, with a focus on additional cardiac and renal benefits, needs to be brought to the forefront of post-transplant care with incorporation of recent evidence outside of transplantation.

31494031,Smoking and Diabetes Control in Adults With Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes: A Nationwide Study From the 2018 National Program for Prevention and Control of Diabetes of Iran.,"Smoking is among the top leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, studies on the association between smoking and diabetes complications and metabolic control have shown conflicting results. In this study, we aimed to assess the association of smoking with micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes and lipid and glycemic indices. We used the National Program for Prevention and Control of Diabetes of Iran database of 99,651 adult patients with diabetes across Iran. Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association between smoking and diabetes complications including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy. This association was adjusted for age, sex, duration of diabetes, glycated hemoglobin (A1C), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, medication, obesity and type of diabetes. Smoking was associated with cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy (odds ratios [ORs] for patients with type 1 diabetes were 1.51, 2.29, 2.70 and 2.40, respectively; for patients with type 2 diabetes, ORs were 1.27, 1.21, 1.51 and 1.70, respectively; all with p values <0.001). Among patients with type 1 diabetes, smoking was significantly (p<0.05) associated with A1C (OR, 2.12), 2-h postglucose level (OR, 1.30), triglycerides (OR, 1.48) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) control (OR, 1.34). Among patients with type 2 diabetes, smoking was significantly associated with A1C (OR, 1.09) and HDL control (OR, 1.21). Smoking was associated with multiple diabetes complications including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy and worse A1C and HDL control in both patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Recent evidence showed increased cutaneous macrophage infiltration in patients with type 2 diabetes and painful DPN, and this study aimed to understand whether the same applies to type 1 diabetes. The study included 104 participants: 26 healthy controls and 78 participants with type 1 diabetes (participants without DPN [n = 24], participants with painless DPN [n = 29], and participants with painful DPN [n = 25]). Two immune cells, dermal IBA1<sup>+</sup> macrophages and epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs, CD207<sup>+</sup>), were visualized and quantified using immunohistological labeling and stereological counting methods on skin biopsies from the participants. The IBA1<sup>+</sup> macrophage infiltration, LC number density, LC soma cross-sectional area, and LC processes were measured in this study. Significant difference in IBA1<sup>+</sup> macrophage expression was seen between the groups (<i>p</i> = 0.003), with lower expression of IBA1 in participants with DPN. No differences in LC morphologies (LC number density, soma cross-sectional area, and process level) were found between the groups (all <i>p</i> > 0.05). In addition, IBA1<sup>+</sup> macrophages, but not LCs, correlated with intraepidermal nerve fiber density, Michigan neuropathy symptom inventory, (questionnaire and total score), severity of neuropathy as assessed by the Toronto clinical neuropathy score, and vibration detection threshold in the whole study cohort. This study showed expressional differences of cutaneous IBA1<sup>+</sup> macrophages but not LC in participants with type 1 diabetes-induced DPN compared with those in controls.

Though HbA1c criteria are convenient for diagnosis there is a discrepancy between the fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c for diagnosis. Objective To assess the comparability between fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels in the new-onset diabetes mellitus. Method This is a hospital-based descriptive cross-sectional study including 128 newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus conducted at Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital. New onset diabetes patients above 18 years of age who met inclusion criteria were included. The clinical characteristics and biochemical parameters were analyzed. Statistical analysis was done using student's t-test and correlation coefficient. Result There were 128 newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus patients included in the study among which 57.0% were males with a mean age of 49.48Â±11.40 years. The mean fasting plasma glucose, postprandial sugar (PPBS), and glycated hemoglobin were 205.54Â±88.93 mg/dL, 331.08Â±146.61 mg/dL, and 9.59Â±2.70% respectively. Diabetes was diagnosed using fasting plasma glucose, and glycated hemoglobin criteria in 84.4% and 90.6% of patients. In new-onset diabetic patients, 76.56% of patients had both elevated levels of fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin. Of the diabetic patients who had fasting plasma glucose â¥126 mg/dL, 90.7% of patients had HbA1c â¥ 6.5% whereas 1.6% of new-onset diabetes had < 126 mg/dL and glycated hemoglobin < 6.5%.

However, data regarding the predictors of healthcare resource utilization in DKA is limited and inconsistent. This study aimed to identify key predictors of hospital length of stay (LOS), readmission and recurrent DKA episodes. We undertook a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of all DKA admissions from 2015 to 2021 across four hospitals in Qatar. The primary outcomes were the length of stay (LOS), 90-day readmission and 6-month and 1-year DKA recurrence. We included 922 patients with a median age of 35âyears (25-45). 62% were males with type-1 diabetes-mellitus (T1DM) and type-2âDM (T2DM), present in 52% and 48% of patients. The median LOS was 2.6âdays (IQR 1.1-4.8), and the median DKA resolution time was 18âh (10.5-29). Male-gender, new-onset DM, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), lower haemoglobin, sodium and potassium, higher urea, longer DKA duration and MICU admission predicted a longer LOS in a multivariate regression analysis. None of the factors were significantly associated with 90-day readmission. Patients with pre-existing T1DM were more likely to have a six-month DKA recurrence than pre-existing T2DM. Patients with a 6-month DKA recurrence, female gender and T1DM had higher odds of 12-month recurrence, whereas a consult with a diabetes educator at the index admission was associated with decreased odds of recurrence. This is the most extensive study from the Middle-East region reporting on LOS, readmissions and the recurrence of DKA.

33550441,Realising the long-term promise of insulin therapy: the DCCT/EDIC study.,"The introduction of insulin in the treatment of juvenile-onset, now type 1, diabetes mellitus transformed a rapidly fatal disease into a chronic degenerative one. During the insulin-treatment era, long-term microvascular and cardiovascular complications proved to be the bane of existence for people with type 1 diabetes, leading to blindness, kidney failure, amputations, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and premature mortality. The nascent understanding of the link between non-physiologically regulated glucose levels and these complications led to the development of new treatment tools in the 1970s and 1980s that facilitated the delivery of insulin to achieve glucose levels closer to non-diabetic levels. These therapeutic advances set the stage for definitive testing of the glucose hypothesis. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), supported by the National Institute of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH), definitively established the benefits and risks of intensive therapy that substantially lowered mean blood glucose levels, measured by HbA<sub>1c</sub>, over a mean 6.5Â years of therapy. Intensive therapy in the DCCT, resulting in a mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> of ~7% (53Â mmol/mol), reduced the development and progression of early microvascular and neurological complications associated with diabetes by 34-76% compared with the conventional-treatment group, which maintained an HbA<sub>1c</sub> of ~9% (75Â mmol/mol). Intensive therapy was also associated with weight gain and a threefold increased risk for hypoglycaemia. At the end of the DCCT, a long-term observational follow-up study, the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study, commenced. Despite the convergence of HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels between the two groups during EDIC, owing to the adoption of intensive therapy by the original DCCT conventional-treatment group and the return of all participants to their own healthcare providers for diabetes care, the development and progression of complications continued to be substantially less in the original intensive-treatment group vs the conventional-treatment group; this phenomenon was termed 'metabolic memory'. The DCCT demonstrated a major reduction in early-stage complications with intensive therapy and the metabolic memory phenomenon during EDIC contributed to a substantially lower burden of advanced complications over time. These included a 57% lower risk of CVD events and 33% lower rate of mortality in the original intensive-treatment group compared with the conventional-treatment group. DCCT/EDIC has ushered in the intensive-treatment era, which has been universally adopted and includes the goal of achieving HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels less than 7% (53Â mmol/mol) for most patients. Although the challenge of making intensive therapy (with the aim of achieving normoglycaemia) as widely accessible and safe as possible remains, continuing improvements in insulin therapy 100Â years after its introduction promise a brighter future for people with type 1 diabetes.",Diabetologia,2021-May,Nathan DM,1,3080,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

34762354,Using the AUSDRISK score to screen for pre-diabetes and diabetes in GP practices: a case-finding approach.,"To identify the optimal AUSDRISK threshold score to screen for pre-diabetes and diabetes. A total of 406 adult patients not diagnosed with diabetes were screened in General Practices (GP) between May and October 2019. All patients received a point of care (POC) HbA1c test. HbA1c test results were categorised into diabetes (â¥6.5% or â¥48 mmol/mol), pre-diabetes (5.7-6.4% or 39-47 mmol/mol), or normal (<5.7% or 39 mmol/mol). Of these patients, 9 (2%) had undiagnosed diabetes and 60 (15%) had pre-diabetes. A Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to predict the presence of pre-diabetes and diabetes; the area under the ROC curve was 0.72 (95%CI 0.65-0.78) indicating modest predictive ability. The optimal threshold cut point for AUSDRISK score was 17 (sensitivity 76%, specificity 61%, + likelihood ratio (LR) 1.96, - likelihood ratio of 0.39) while the accepted cut point of 12 performed less well (sensitivity 94%, specificity 23%, +LR=1.22 -LR+0.26). The AUSDRISK tool has the potential to be used as a screening tool for pre-diabetes/diabetes in GP practices. A cut point of â¥17 would potentially identify 75% of all people at risk and three in 10 sent for further testing would be positive for prediabetes or diabetes.

Using a grounded theory approach, we explored diagnosis from the patient's perspective and through the lens of the electronic health record (EHR). A thematic analysis was conducted on interview and EHR data from 28 patients, using the constant comparative method. The emerging model of shared meaningful diagnosis included four stages: stimulus to screen, medical decision making, medical information transfer, and patient sensemaking. Barriers to a meaningful diagnosis emerged in clinical documentation, clinician communication, and patient sensemaking. This study expands current understanding of ""diagnosis,"" suggesting additional stages between diagnostic labeling and disease management. The additional stages of medical information transfer and patient sensemaking are critical steps to a shared meaningful diagnosis that could enable teamwork among the patient and healthcare team. To sustain meaningful diagnosis for the patient, clinicians should document what language they used to explain the diagnosis to the patient so that subsequent clinicians can use similar language. Clinicians who work as a team should unify their approach to discussing prediabetes.",Patient education and counseling,2021-Jan,"Ledford CJW, Seehusen DA, Crawford PF",3,1388,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

33628833,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy in Ethiopia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Currently, diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most severe complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). Despite the seriousness of this problem, limited evidence is available on the prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patients with diabetes mellitus in Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, there were no updated studies that estimate the national prevalence of DPN. Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis provided a national prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patients with diabetes mellitus in Ethiopia. This study was submitted for registration with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) in March 2020 and accepted with the registration number CRD42020173831. Different database searching engines were searched online to retrieve related articles, including PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, African Journals Online, World Health Organization (WHO) Afro Library, and Cochrane Review. The reviewers used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline in the reviewing process. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, all published and unpublished articles were analyzed. The reviewers used the random effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among diabetes mellitus patients. The reviewers conducted the statistical analysis using the R version 3.5.3 and RStudio version 1.2.5033 software for Windows. The reviewers evaluated the heterogeneity across the included studies by the inconsistency index (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>). The reviewers examined the publication bias by the funnel plot. The search of the databases produced 245 papers. After checking the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 38 articles with 14029 total patients with diabetes mellitus were found suitable for the review. Except for three (retrospective cohort study), all studies were cross-sectional. The overall pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was 22% (95% CI 18% to 26%). The subgroup analysis of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patients with diabetes in the different regions was 23% (95% CI 17% to 29%) in Addis Ababa, 27% (95% CI 16% to 38%) in Oromia, 16% (95% CI 14% to 18%) in South nation and nationalities, and 15% (95% CI 6% to 24%) in Amhara. More than one-fifth of patients with diabetes have diabetic peripheral neuropathy. According to this study, the prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in Ethiopia is considerably high.

38773932,MicroRNA-29-mediated cross-talk between metabolic organs in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and its complications: A narrative review.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by hyperglycemia. Microribonucleic acids (microRNAs) are noncoding RNA molecules synthesized in the nucleus, modified, and exported to the extracellular environment to bind to their complementary target sequences. It regulates protein synthesis in the targeted cells by inhibiting translation or triggering the degradation of the target messenger. MicroRNA-29 is one of noncoding RNA that can be secreted by adipose tissue, hepatocytes, islet cells, and brain cells. The expression level of the microRNA-29 family in several metabolic organs is regulated by body weight, blood concentrations of inflammatory mediators, serum glucose levels, and smoking habits. Several experimental studies have demonstrated the effect of microRNA-29 on the expression of target genes involved in glucose metabolism, insulin synthesis and secretion, islet cell survival, and proliferation. These findings shed new light on the role of microRNA-29 in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications, which plays a vital role in developing appropriate therapies. Different molecular pathways have been proposed to explain how microRNA-29 promotes the development of diabetes and its complications. However, to the best of our knowledge, no published review article has summarized the molecular mechanism of microRNA-29-mediated initiation of DM and its complications. Therefore, this narrative review aims to summarize the role of microRNA-29-mediated cross-talk between metabolic organs in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications.",Cell biochemistry and function,2024-Jun,"Yesuf HA, Molla MD, Malik T, Seyoum Wendimagegn Z, Yimer Y",5,1601,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
37498716,Assessing fear of complications in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes with the Fear of Diabetes Complications Questionnaire.,"Fear of diabetes complications (FDC) is a common source of emotional distress in people with diabetes across types and treatments and may affect health outcomes. To assess FDC, the Fear of Diabetes Complications Questionnaire (FDCQ) was developed. This study evaluates the FDCQ's German version in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). A German version of the FDCQ was developed and administered as part of four different studies sampling people with T1D and T2D. Measurement properties were evaluated across studies using factor analyses, reliability estimates, and associations of the measure within a network of variables. A cutoff criterion for elevated FDC was derived. A short form scale was also developed. High reliability and validity were supported. FDC as measured by the FDCQ was independently associated with higher diabetes distress and depressive symptoms. A cut-off score for elevated FDC was set at â¥30 in the 15-item FDCQ. Elevated FDCQ scores were detected in 36% of participants in secondary diabetes care and up to 46% of those in tertiary care. FDC is prevalent in people with T1D and T2D and associated with diabetes distress and depressive symptoms. The FDCQ is a reliable and valid tool for assessing FDC in research and practice. It may help identify persons in need of tailored education and care and monitor effects following treatment.

32561466,A randomized clinical trial of a collaborative home-based diabetes intervention to reduce emergency department visits and hospitalizations in black individuals with diabetes.,"The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in black individuals (blacks) is twice that of white individuals (whites), and blacks are more likely to have worse glycemic control, less optimal medication regimens, and higher levels of mistrust in the medical system. These three factors account for higher rates of acute medical care use in blacks with DM. To address this disparity, we developed DM I-TEAM (Diabetes Interprofessional Team to Enhance Adherence to Medical Care), a home-based multidisciplinary behavioral intervention that integrates care from a community health worker (CHW), the participant's primary care physician (PCP), a DM nurse educator, and a clinical pharmacist. Treatment is delivered during 9 sessions over 1Â year, and includes diabetes education and goal setting, telehealth visits with participants' PCP and a DM nurse educator, and comprehensive medication reviews by a pharmacist. We describe the rationale and methods for a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of DM I-TEAM to reduce emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. We are enrolling 200 blacks with DM during an ED visit. Participants are randomized to DM I-TEAM or Usual Medical Care (UMC). Follow-up assessments are conducted at 6 and 12Â months. The primary outcome is the number of ED visits and hospitalizations over 12Â months, and is measured by participant self-report and medical record review. Secondary outcomes include hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), number of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs), and trust in health care.",Contemporary clinical trials,2020-Aug,"Casten R, Rovner B, Chang AM, Hollander JE, Kelley M, Leiby B, Nightingale G, Pizzi L, White N, Rising K",10,1547,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Considering the proven benefit of patient education programs, DiaLife was elaborated as the first German education program addressing the needs of relatives. The objective of this study was to investigate its efficacy. The evaluation was implemented in the form of a cRCT with longitudinal design and waiting list condition.In total, 179 relatives were recruited. Participants' diabetes-related knowledge was defined as the primary outcome. Diabetes-related strains, family interaction and other psychosocial factors were determined as secondary outcomes. A generalized estimating equation model showed a persistent increase of diabetes-related knowledge in the intervention group compared to the control group regardless of the type of diabetes. Concerning secondary outcomes, mixed linear models showed an improvement for relatives of people with type 2 diabetes who participated in the DiaLife program. This study provides evidence of DiaLife's efficacy regarding a persistent increase of diabetes-related knowledge and a positive effect on psychosocial outcomes in relatives of people with type 2 but not in type 1 diabetes. Adding (an)other psychosocial module(s) might improve their well-being and psychosocial outcomes.

Exosomes can carry diverse cargo including RNA, DNA, lipids, proteins, and metabolites. Exosomes transfer substances and information between cells by circulating in body fluids and are thus involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes in the human body. Recent studies have closely associated exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) with various human diseases, including diabetes mellitus (DM), which is a complex multifactorial metabolic disorder disease. Exosomal miRNAs are emerging as pivotal regulators in the progression of DM, mainly in terms of pancreatic Î²-cell injury and insulin resistance. Exosomal miRNAs are closely associated with DM-associated complications, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic nephropathy (DN), and diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), etc. Further investigations of the mechanisms of action of exosomal miRNAs and their role in DM will be valuable for the thorough understanding of the physiopathological process of DM.

38087202,Making prediabetes visible in primary health care: a qualitative study of health care professionals' perspectives.,"People with prediabetes are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and its complications, such as cardiovascular diseases and premature mortality. Primary prevention and health maintenance are therefore imperative. Evidence has shown that prediabetes can be prevented or delayed with behavioural change, mainly in eating habits and physical activity. Interventions that use a person-centered approach can lead to improvements in self-management, quality of life, and health outcomes. Nevertheless, there is a need for further research that engages healthcare professionals and people with prediabetes in constructing and implementing preventive programs. The purpose of this study is to explore and describe how healthcare professionals perceive prediabetes, the current challenges in its detection and treatment, and what is needed to improve quality of care. This qualitative study was conducted in Region Stockholm. A total of 26 primary health care professionals participated in individual interviews: 15 diabetes nurses and/or district nurses, five general practitioners, five dietitians, and one physiotherapist. Interview transcripts were analyzed with qualitative content analysis. The analysis revealed two main themes that emphasize the need to make prediabetes more visible in primary health care. Despite the healthcare professionals' engagement and their motivation to improve prediabetes care, ad hoc practices and the absence of clear screening guidelines and referral pathways made it harder to focus on primary prevention. Supporting professionals in implementing structured care for people with prediabetes might encourage more efficient interprofessional collaboration and contribute to better strategies for promoting behavioural change. Establishing prediabetes care guidelines, supporting health care professionalsÂ´ knowledge and skills in prediabetes care, and implementing interprofessional referral pathways are some steps to enhance prediabetes detection and care precedence in primary health care. These steps could lead to more preventive care and ensure patient safety and health care equity.",BMC primary care,2023-Dec,"Harcke K, Graue M, Skinner TC, Olsson CB, Saleh-Stattin N",5,2125,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
36929661,Use of continuous glucose monitors in low- and middle-income countries: A scoping review.,"The use of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) has been shown to have positive impact on diabetes management for people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and gestational diabetes (GDM) in high-income countries. However, as useful as CGMs are, the experience in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited and has not been summarized. A scoping review of the scientific literature was conducted. Medline, Embase, Global Health and Scopus were used to seek original research conducted in LMICs. The search results were screened by two reviewers independently. We included studies assessing health outcomes following the use of CGMs at the individual level (e.g. glycaemic control or complications) and at the health system level (e.g. barriers, facilitators and cost-effectiveness) in English, Portuguese, Spanish and French. Results were summarized narratively. From 4772 records found in database search, 27 reports were included; most of them from China (nÂ =Â 7), Colombia (nÂ =Â 5) and India (nÂ =Â 4). Thirteen reports studied T1DM, five T2DM, seven both T1DM and T2DM and two GDM. Seven reports presented results of experimental studies (five randomized trials and two quasi-experimental); two on cost-effective analysis and the remaining 18 were observational. Studies showed that CGMs improved surrogate glycaemic outcomes (HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction), hard endpoints (lower hospitalization rates and diabetes complications) and patient-oriented outcomes (quality of life). However, several caveats were identified: mostly observational studies, few participants in trials, short follow-up and focused on surrogate outcomes. The scoping review identified that studies about CGMs in LMICs have several limitations. Stronger study designs, appropriate sample sizes and the inclusion of patient-important outcomes should be considered to inform the evidence about CGMs for the management of people with diabetes in LMICs.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2023-Jun,"Bernabe-Ortiz A, Carrillo-Larco RM, Safary E, Vetter B, Lazo-Porras M",5,1944,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
39559363,"A comprehensive review of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related diabetes mellitus: incidence, clinical features, management, and prognosis.","Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related diabetes mellitus (ICI-DM) is a rare complication that medical oncologists seldom encounter in routine practice. The sporadic nature and intrinsic complexity of ICI-DM make it challenging to analyze comprehensively in experimental settings. In this review, we examine phase 3 clinical trials on ICIs and published case reports of ICI-DM, aiming to summarize its incidence, clinical features, management, and prognosis. Phase 3 clinical trials reveal that the incidence of ICI-DM is higher with combination therapies, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-L1, compared to anti-PD-1 monotherapy. ICI-DM typically presents as severe hyperglycemia with a fulminant onset and is often associated with diabetic ketoacidosis, accompanied by unexpectedly low HbA1c and C-peptide levels. ICI-DM shares similarities with classic type 1 diabetes, particularly in terms of autoimmunity and genetic predisposition. This includes a high prevalence of islet autoantibodies and susceptibility to certain HLA haplotypes, often with concurrent endocrine gland dysfunction. This suggests that genetic susceptibility and exposure to ICIs may both be necessary for triggering islet autoimmunity and inducing ICI-DM. Notably, patients with positive islet autoantibodies, such as glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody and islet-associated antigen 2 antibody, tend to experience rapid onset of ICI-DM after ICI exposure. Although patients with ICI-DM generally show a high objective response rate to immunotherapy, a significant proportion also face the need to permanently discontinued treatment. Further research is urgently needed to determine whether permanent discontinuation of immunotherapy is necessary and whether this discontinuation negatively impacts overall survival.",Frontiers in immunology,2024-,"Zhou L, Yang S, Li Y, Xue C, Wan R",5,1798,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
31912528,State of the art: understanding and integration of the social context in diabetes care.,"We review the past 25Â years of research addressing challenges people living with diabetes experience in their daily lives related to social contexts, i.e. in their family, at work and in society at large, and identify research gaps. We found that young people with diabetes, as they develop through to adulthood, are exposed to considerable risks to their physical and mental health. Family-system interventions have had mixed outcomes. Research in this area would benefit from attention to ethnic/cultural diversity, and involving fathers and other family members. In adults with diabetes, social support relates to better diabetes outcomes. While family member involvement in care is likely to affect health and psychosocial outcomes of the person with diabetes, key elements and mediators of effective family interventions need to be identified. The challenges of diabetes management at work are under-researched; distress and intentional hyperglycaemia are common. When depression is comorbid with diabetes, there are increased work-related risks, e.g. unemployment, sickness absence and reduced income. Research to support people with diabetes at work should involve colleagues and employers to raise awareness and create supportive environments. Stigma and discrimination have been found to be more common than previously acknowledged, affecting self-care, well-being and access to health services. Guidance on stigma-reducing choice of language has been published recently. Resilience, defined as successful adaptation to adversity such as stigma and discrimination, requires studies relevant to the specific challenges of diabetes, whether at diagnosis or subsequently. The importance of the social context for living well with diabetes is now fully recognized, but understanding of many of the challenges, whether at home or work, is still limited, with much work needed to develop successful interventions.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2020-Mar,"de Wit M, Trief PM, Huber JW, Willaing I",4,1916,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Our study is a cross-sectional analysis using data from the ""OrmÃ¡nsÃ¡g Health Program"". The ""OrmÃ¡nsÃ¡g Health Program"" was launched to improve the health of individuals in a deprived region of Hungary. Participants in the program were coded as diagnosed diabetes based on diagnosis by a physician as a part of the program, self-reported diabetes status, and self-reported prescription of antidiabetic medication. Undiagnosed diabetes was defined as elevated blood glucose levels without self-reported diabetes and antidiabetic prescription. Diagnosis and therapeutic characteristics were presented descriptively. To examine lifestyle factors and screening participation, patients with diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes were compared to healthy participants using linear regression or multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for sex and age. Our study population consisted of 246 individuals, and 17.9% had either diagnosed (n=33) or undiagnosed (n=11) diabetes.

Diabetes mellitus is a common complication of acromegaly, occurring in approximately one-third of patients. The risk of diabetes mellitus in acromegaly is driven by increased exposure to growth hormone, which directly attenuates insulin signalling and stimulates lipolysis, leading to decreased glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. Acromegaly is a unique human model, where insulin resistance occurs independently of obesity and is paradoxically associated with a lean phenotype and reduced body adipose tissue mass. Diabetes mellitus in patients with acromegaly is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Therefore, preventive measures and optimized treatment of diabetes mellitus are essential in these patients. However, specific recommendations for the management of diabetes mellitus secondary to acromegaly are lacking due to limited research on this subject. This Review explores the underlying mechanisms for diabetes mellitus in acromegaly and its effect on morbidity and mortality.

39552432,George Gomori's Contributions to Diabetes Research and the Origins of the <i>Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry</i>.,"Over a period of almost 30 years, Gomori was one of the most prolific and productive investigators in the emerging field of enzyme histochemistry and was recognized by his peers as a pioneer in developing methods for the histochemical demonstration of hydrolytic enzyme activity, most notably phosphatases, esterases, and lipases. Gomori also made important contributions to diabetes research by developing histological techniques that reliably stained the insulin-secreting B cell of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Gomori's aldehyde fuchsin staining method was standard for pathological and physiological studies on islet B cells in relation to diabetes and obesity until insulin antibodies became widely available for immunohistochemical identification of B cells. Gomori was a founding member of The Histochemical Society in 1950. When the HCS established the <i>Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry</i> in 1953, Gomori served as one of the first Associate Editors. He also served as President of The Histochemical Society.",The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,2024-,Baskin DG,1,1039,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

34610191,Dietary interventions on the prevention and management of diabetes in post-kidney transplantation - A systematic review.,"Post-transplant diabetes mellitus is associated with long-term immunosuppression and weight gain, and is related to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, accelerated loss of graft and increased mortality. There is an absence of strong evidence-based dietary guidelines for the prevention and management of post-transplant diabetes mellitus in kidney transplant recipients. The aim of this study was to systematically review all dietary evidence for kidney transplant recipients on clinical outcomes relating to diabetes, patient-reported outcomes and economic outcomes. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in August 2020 using the databases Medline, Embase, CENTRAL and CINAHL. Studies were critically appraised using Cochrane risk of bias tools and GRADE. A total of 12 studies and 1928 participants were included. Four papers focused on diet and exercise, one paper on diet only, two papers on magnesium supplementation, one paper on magnesium and fibre intake, two papers on Mediterranean diet, one paper on marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation and one paper on fruit and vegetable intake. There were no significant effects on outcomes relating to dietary counselling, magnesium supplementation, magnesium and fibre intake or marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation. Low-quality evidence supports the Mediterranean diet in reducing the risk of post-transplant diabetes mellitus and fasting plasma glucose levels. Low-quality evidence suggests vegetable intake being associated with a lower risk of post-transplant diabetes mellitus. This review demonstrates limited evidence for dietary interventions in the prevention and management of diabetes in post-kidney transplantation. The findings suggest that further high-quality research with robust study designs is required.","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2022-Mar,"Li J, Chong A, Carey S",3,1793,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

36948381,Prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes related to periodontitis and its risk factors in elderly individuals.,"The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was estimated to increase with age and can reach 3.5%. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes in the elderly patients who attended a dental clinic and to find common risk factors. Male patients, older than 50 years, attended their first dental visit to the School of Dentistry for a period of two years, and it was proposed to evaluate undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. Periodontal, biochemical, microbiological examinations, nutritional profile, and physical activity were performed. A total of 106 patients were examined, 6 (5.6%) had diabetes, and 37 (34.9%) had prediabetes without prior diagnosis. The severity of periodontitis was greater in patients with diabetes. Most of the patients were overweight and had increased systolic blood pressure. Patients with prediabetes and periodontitis had a low adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Tannerella forsythia was present in more patients with periodontitis, and the prevalence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is practically absent in groups with periodontitis, except for the group with diabetes. In the population studied, the prevalence of patients without a diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes was very high and underestimated. The increased severity of periodontitis in patients with diabetes and in conjunction with the high level of cortisol seen in patients with periodontitis, especially those with diabetes, emphasize the dysregulation of the immunoinflammatory system. It is essential to add all this data to our dental practice to cover patient health with a broader landscape.",Journal of dentistry,2023-May,"Portes J, BullÃ³n B, Gallardo I, Fernandez-Riejos P, Quiles JL, Giampieri F, BullÃ³n P",7,1654,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
34872802,Animal models of diabetic microvascular complications: Relevance to clinical features.,"Diabetes has become more common in recent years worldwide, and this growth is projected to continue in the future. The primary concern with diabetes is developing various complications, which significantly contribute to the disease's mortality and morbidity. Over time, the condition progresses from the pre-diabetic to the diabetic stage and then to the development of complications. Years and enormous resources are required to evaluate pharmacological interventions to prevent or delay the progression of disease or complications in humans. Appropriate screening models are required to gain a better understanding of both pathogenesis and potential therapeutic agents. Different species of animals are used to evaluate the pharmacological potentials and study the pathogenesis of the disease. Animal models are essential for research because they represent most of the structural, functional, and biochemical characteristics of human diseases. An ideal screening model should mimic the pathogenesis of the disease with identifiable characteristics. A thorough understanding of animal models is required for the experimental design to select an appropriate model. Each animal model has certain advantages and limitations.

37227368,Evaluating Metformin Strategies for Cancer Prevention: A Target Trial Emulation Using Electronic Health Records.,"Metformin users appear to have a substantially lower risk of cancer than nonusers in many observational studies. These inverse associations may be explained by common flaws in observational analyses that can be avoided by explicitly emulating a target trial. We emulated target trials of metformin therapy and cancer risk using population-based linked electronic health records from the UK (2009-2016). We included individuals with diabetes, no history of cancer, no recent prescription for metformin or other glucose-lowering medication, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <64 mmol/mol (<8.0%). Outcomes included total cancer and 4 site-specific cancers (breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate). We estimated risks using pooled logistic regression with adjustment for risk factors via inverse-probability weighting. We emulated a second target trial among individuals regardless of diabetes status. We compared our estimates with those obtained using previously applied analytic approaches. Among individuals with diabetes, the estimated 6-year risk differences (metformin - no metformin) were -0.2% (95% CI = -1.6%, 1.3%) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.0% (95% CI = -2.1%, 2.3%) in the per-protocol analysis. The corresponding estimates for all site-specific cancers were close to zero. Among individuals regardless of diabetes status, these estimates were also close to zero and more precise. By contrast, previous analytic approaches yielded estimates that appeared strongly protective. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that metformin therapy does not meaningfully influence cancer incidence. The findings highlight the importance of explicitly emulating a target trial to reduce bias in the effect estimates derived from observational analyses.","Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",2023-Sep,"Dickerman BA, GarcÃ­a-AlbÃ©niz X, Logan RW, Denaxas S, HernÃ¡n MA",5,1766,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
33275827,Application of new international classification of adult-onset diabetes in Chinese inpatients with diabetes mellitus.,"To determine whether the new international cluster-based classification method can be applied to Chinese inpatients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Adult patients with DM hospitalized in our tertiary care centre from January 2017 to December 2018 were included in the study. K-means cluster analysis was done in clusters based on glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, body mass index, glycosylated haemoglobin, homeostasis model-assessed beta cell function, insulin resistance index, and age at diagnosis of DM. Chi-square test was used to analyse inter-subgroup differences in DM-related complications and family history of DM. pÂ <Â 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 1152 inpatients with DM were included in the study. Five subgroups were obtained by cluster analysis with highest proportion of population in mild obesity-related DM subgroup (34.55%), followed by mild age-related DM (21.55%), severe insulin deficiency DM (20.51%), severe insulin resistance DM (19.02%), and severe autoimmune DM subgroup (4.36%). The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic peripheral vascular disease, diabetic ketosis, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and family history of DM differed significantly among the subgroups (pÂ <Â 0.05 for all). This cluster-based classification could be applied to hospitalized adult patients with DM in China.

A total of 60 type-2 diabetic patients, assigned to either a diabetes mellitus (DM) with microalbuminuria group (DM/MA+, n=30) or a DM without microalbuminuria group (DM/MA-, n=30), and 30 age-matched control subjects were enrolled in this study. All cases underwent evaluation of blood glucose level, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, lipid fractions, body mass index (BMI), and corneal sensitivity (CS). Corneal nerve fiber length (NFL), nerve fiber density (NFD), nerve branch density (NBD), and tortuosity coefficient (TC) were quantified by IVCCM. None of the patients had peripheral neuropathy or retinopathy. Compared with the healthy subjects, NFL and NFD were reduced in both diabetic groups (P<0.0001), while NBD was significantly reduced in the DM/MA+ group. Between the diabetic groups, NFL, NFD, and NBD were significantly higher in the DM/MA- group (all P's<0.001). CS was significantly lower in DM/MA+ compared with DM/MA- and controls (both P's<0.0001). NFD and NFL were inversely correlated with age, triglyceride level, and BMI. These results indicate that significant damage to small nerves, quantified using IVCCM, can be detected in the absence of retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy or microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients. The severity of corneal nerve involvement may further increase in the presence of nephropathy. This feature may also be valuable for early detection of microvascular complications of DM, allowing for the prevention of progression of life threatening microvascular complications.",Journal francais d'ophtalmologie,2021-Apr,"Celiker H, Erekul G, Turhan SA, Kokar S, Yavuz DG, Gunduz OH, Tavakoli M, Toker E",8,1742,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
31638279,Twenty-five years of diabetes distress research.,"The term 'diabetes distress' first entered the psychosocial research vernacular in 1995, and refers to 'the negative emotional or affective experience resulting from the challenge of living with the demands of diabetes'. At first the proponents of the concept were hesitant in advocating that diabetes distress was a major barrier to individuals' self-care and management of diabetes. Since then, a burgeoning body of evidence, now including several systematic reviews of intervention studies, suggests that diabetes distress, in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, across ages and in all countries and cultures where it has been studied, is common and can be a barrier to optimal emotional well-being, self-care and management of diabetes. As a consequence, monitoring diabetes distress as part of routine clinical care is part of many national guidelines. The present narrative review summarizes this research and related literature, to postulate the aetiology of diabetes distress, and thus how it may be prevented.

It may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality after kidney transplant. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of diabetes that developed after transplant on outcomes in kidney transplant recipients. This study included renal allograft recipients without diabetes who received transplants from 2008 to 2019 in our Department of Nephrology at Sahloul Hospital (Tunisia). Demographic and clinical data at transplant time and clinical events during the study period were collected. Patient and graft survival rates were analyzed. Patients with and without diabetes after transplant were compared. In the 257 patients (median age of 36 years) included in our study, the overall incidence of diabetes after transplant was 21.8%. Laboratory data (serum cholesterol, serum creatinine at discharge, and 24-hour proteinuria) were similar in those with and without diabetes after transplant. We observed no significant differences in cardiovascular diseases and infectious complication rates between patients with and without diabetes after transplant. There was also no significant difference in graft loss at 5 years between those with and without diabetes after transplant (P = .582). The 5-year patient survival rate in kidney transplant recipients with diabetes after transplant was 87.5%. There was no significant difference in death rate between those with and without diabetes after transplant (P = .566). Diabetes after transplant affected graft and patient survival and increased the incidence of posttransplant cardiovascular disease. The incidence and impact of diabetes after transplant can be minimized through pre- and posttransplant screening to identify patients at higher risk.",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,2022-Mar,"Ouni A, Sahtout W, Hadj Brahim M, Azzabi A, Aicha NB, Mrabet S, Fradi A, Zallema D, Guedri Y, Achour A",10,1772,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

This study aimed to investigate balancing ability using a multi-directional reach test (MDRT) in older adults with and without diabetes mellitus. 72 older adults with and without diabetes mellitus were recruited, and divided into two groups, including older adults without diabetes mellitus (n = 36) and older adults with diabetes mellitus (n = 36). All subjects completed all directions of the MDRT. There were no significant differences in MDRT scores in all directions between the two groups (p>0.05). Both groups achieved the highest MDRT scores in the forward direction. In contrast, the two groups had the lowest scores of MDRT in a backward direction. Furthermore, older adults with diabetes mellitus had lower MDRT scores in all directions than older adults without diabetes mellitus.

The aim of the present study is to verify the COVID-19 pandemic effects on diabetes control and management. The study was designed as a retrospective observational study, performed on two cohorts of patients with diabetes in 2019 and 2020. Data used for the analyses were gathered from administrative and laboratory databases, which do not include any sensible information on COVID-19. The Tuscany Regional Health Agency is data controller for current administrative databases and has been working to produce available information for policy decision-making. In 2020, in comparison with 2019, a relevant reduction of the number of patients measuring HbA1c was observed during the March-April lockdown, and again during the second pandemic wave in Autumn. A similar pattern was observed for specialist visits for diabetes, for which the introduction of televisits only partly compensated for the reduction of traditional office visits. The number of patients receiving drugs for diabetes each week in 2020 was very similar to 2019. The mean HbA1c values and the proportion of HbA1c valuesÂ >Â 8% for each week, were higher during the 2020 Spring and Autumn lockdown. COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacts diabetes management, reducing specialist visits and HbA1c determinations during the first and second pandemic wave.

35877064,The Therapeutic Potential of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exist in many tissues and can differentiate into cells of multiple lineages, such as adipocytes, osteoblasts, or chondrocytes. MSC administration has demonstrated therapeutic potential in various degenerative and inflammatory diseases (<i>e.g.</i>, graft-vs.-host disease, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, organ fibrosis, and diabetes mellitus [DM]). The mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effects of MSCs are multifaceted. Generally, implanted MSCs can migrate to sites of injury, where they establish an anti-inflammatory and regenerative microenvironment in damaged tissues. In addition, MSCs can modulate innate and adaptive immune responses through immunosuppressive mechanisms that involve immune cells, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and immunomodulatory factors. DM has a high prevalence worldwide; it also contributes to a high rate of mortality worldwide. MSCs offer a promising therapeutic agent to prevent or repair damage from DM and diabetic complications through properties such as multilineage differentiation, homing, promotion of angiogenesis, and immunomodulation (<i>e.g.</i>, prevention of oxidative stress, fibrosis, and cell death). In this study, we review current findings regarding the immunomodulatory and regenerative mechanisms of MSCs, as well as their therapeutic applications in DM and DM-related complications.",Cellular reprogramming,2022-Dec,"Zhu L, Wang S, Qu J, Hui Z, Kan C, Hou N, Sun X",7,1386,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

We assessed the AF-related hospitalizations trends in patients with diabetes, and compared AF outcomes in patients with diabetes to those without diabetes. AF-related health outcomes differ between patient with diabetes and without diabetes. Using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2004-2014, we studied trends in AF hospitalization rate among diabetic patients, and compared in-hospital case fatality rate, length of stay (LOS), cost and utilization of rhythm control therapies, and 30-day readmission rate between patients with and without diabetes. Logistic or Cox regression models were used to assess the differences in AF outcomes by diabetes status. Over the study period, there were 4â325â522 AF-related hospitalizations, of which 1â075â770 (24.9%) had a diagnosis of diabetes. There was a temporal increase in AF hospitalization rate among diabetic patients (10.4 to 14.4 per 1000 hospitalizations among patients with diabetes; +4.4% yearly change, p-trendâ<â.0001). Among AF patients, those with diabetes had a lower in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.65-0.72) and LOS (aOR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.94-0.96), but no difference in costs (aOR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.94-0.96) and a higher 30-day rate of readmissions compared with no diabetes (aHR 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01-1.08), compared to individuals without diabetes.

We underline the essential aspects to consider when using RWD and the key features limiting the translational potential of RWD in generating high-quality and applicable RWE. Only if viewed in the context of other study designs and statistical methods, with its pros and cons carefully considered, RWE will exploit its full potential as a complementary or even, in some cases, substitutive source of evidence compared to the expensive evidence obtained from randomized controlled trials.","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2020-Apr,"Zaccardi F, Davies MJ, Khunti K",3,1354,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The objective of this study was to evaluate the short- and long-term outcome of CP in comparison to DP. Patients who received CP in a large tertiary care pancreatic surgery center between 2001 and 2020 were identified from a prospectively maintained database and compared via propensity score matching with patients receiving DP during the same time period. Perioperative rate of complications and long-term outcome of pancreatic endocrine and exocrine function were evaluated. One hundred and seven patients undergoing open CP were compared to 107 patients with open DP. No significant difference in rates or severity of most surgical complications could be found including postoperative pancreatic fistula, intraabdominal fluid collection, delayed gastric emptying and wound infection. However, patients receiving CP had a significantly higher risk of grade C postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH) (CP: 10 patients, 9.3% versus DP: 1 patient, 0.9%; pÂ =Â .0019). Perioperative mortality was comparable. Long-term follow-up of 60 matched pairs revealed significantly less patients with new-onset diabetes after CP (eight patients, 13.3%) compared to DP (22 patients, 36.7%, pÂ =Â .0056).

We aimed to review the relevant literature and highlight challenges in the provision of routine care for patients with diabetes during the COVID-19 outbreak. We systematically searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Embase databases up till August 13, 2020 and retrieved relevant articles published on difficulties on routine diabetes management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through our reading of the recent literature discussing the difficulties of routine healthcare provision for patients with diabetes amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we have identified nine themes as follows: lockdown of standard outpatient clinics, decreased inpatient capacity, staff shortage, medicine shortage, unaffordable medicine, delayed care seeking, limited self-care practice, transport difficulties, and undiagnosed cases/events. Diabetes management during lockdown is particularly challenging. This review specified a summary of difficulties of diabetes care during COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare policy makers as well as healthcare providers could take advantage of the results of this review to mitigate the adverse effect of the crisis on provision of routine care for diabetes as well as other chronic conditions.",Primary care diabetes,2021-Dec,"Mohseni M, Ahmadi S, Azami-Aghdash S, Mousavi Isfahani H, Moosavi A, Fardid M, Etemadi M, Ghazanfari F",8,1331,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
32012347,Renal outcomes with the newer antidiabetes drugs: the era before and after CREDENCE.,"In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration provided guidance for the evaluation of the cardiovascular safety of antidiabetes drugs. The newer antidiabetes drugs, approved after 2008, were therefore evaluated in long-term cardiovascular outcome trials, designed and powered for the assessment of cardiovascular safety. Accordingly, the primary endpoint of these trials was a cardiac composite endpoint. Since 2008, the data from various cardiovascular outcome trials have been reported, including SAVOR-TIMI 53 (saxagliptin), EXAMINE (alogliptin), TECOS (sitagliptin), CARMELINA (linagliptin), CAROLINA (linagliptin), ELIXA (lixisenatide), LEADER (liraglutide), EXSCEL (exenatide once-weekly), SUSTAIN-6 (injectable semaglutide), HARMONY Outcomes (albiglutide), REWIND (dulaglutide), PIONEER-6 (oral semaglutide), EMPA-REG OUTCOME (empagliflozin), the CANVAS Program (canagliflozin) and DECLARE-TIMI 53 (dapagliflozin). Some of these trials subsequently also published data on renal outcomes, although these were secondary or exploratory analyses. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists had beneficial effects on albuminuria, while sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors additionally showed a positive effect on 'hard' renal outcomes. In contrast to the cardiovascular outcome trials, the renal outcome trial of canagliflozin, CREDENCE, assessed a hard renal endpoint as its primary endpoint and showed positive effects on these hard renal outcomes. In this review, we aim to highlight the renal outcome data from the cardiovascular outcome trials and the CREDENCE trial and understand the differences between their results. The post CREDENCE era would appear to reinforce the position of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors as drugs providing cardiorenal protection, in addition to their anti-glycaemic effects.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2020-Apr,"Rajani A, Sahay M, Bhattacharyya A, Amar A",4,1865,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
38739122,Metabolomics Signature in Prediabetes and Diabetes: Insights From Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analysis.,"This study investigates the metabolic differences between normal, prediabetic and diabetic patients with good and poor glycaemic control (GGC and PGC). In this study, 1102 individuals were included, and 50 metabolites were analysed using tandem mass spectrometry. The diabetes diagnosis and treatment standards of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) were used to classify patients. The nearest neighbour method was used to match controls and cases in each group on the basis of age, sex and BMI. Factor analysis was used to reduce the number of variables and find influential underlying factors. Finally, Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to check the correlation between both glucose and HbAc1 as independent factors with binary classes. Amino acids such as glycine, serine and proline, and acylcarnitines (AcylCs) such as C16 and C18 showed significant differences between the prediabetes and normal groups. Additionally, several metabolites, including C0, C5, C8 and C16, showed significant differences between the diabetes and normal groups. Moreover, the study found that several metabolites significantly differed between the GGC and PGC diabetes groups, such as C2, C6, C10, C16 and C18. The correlation analysis revealed that glucose and HbA1c levels significantly correlated with several metabolites, including glycine, serine and C16, in both the prediabetes and diabetes groups. Additionally, the correlation analysis showed that HbA1c significantly correlated with several metabolites, such as C2, C5 and C18, in the controlled and uncontrolled diabetes groups. These findings could help identify new biomarkers or underlying markers for the early detection and management of diabetes.","Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism",2024-May,"Jabbar Al-Rikabi SA, Etemadi A, Morad MM, Nowrouzi A, Panahi GS, Mondeali M, Toorani-Ghazvini M, Nasli-Esfahani E, Razi F, Bandarian F",10,1710,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

From our electronic medical records, we retrieved clinical and biochemical details of 4555 individuals with childhood and adolescent onset diabetes (diagnosed below the age of 20âyears) seen between 1992 and 2017. T1DM was diagnosed if there was history of ketoacidosis or fasting C-peptide <0.3 PMol/mL and stimulated C-peptide <0.6 PMol/mL or if insulin treatment was required from the time of diagnosis. T2DM was diagnosed based on absence of ketosis, or fasting C-peptide â¥0.6 PMol/mL and stimulated >1.0 PMoL/mL, or response to oral hypoglycemic agents for more than 2âyears. We calculated the incidence rates of retinopathy (presence of at least one definite microaneurysm by retinal photography), nephropathy (urinary albumin excretion â¥30âÎ¼g/mg of creatinine) and neuropathy (vibration perception threshold â¥20âV) per 1000 person-years of follow up. Among the 4555 individuals with childhood and adolescent-onset diabetes, 71.4% had T1DM, 19.5% T2DM and 9.1% other forms of diabetes. Age at first visit and duration of diabetes were significantly higher in T2DM when compared to T1DM. The age adjusted incidence of retinopathy was 52.9/1000 person years (Confidence Intervals [CI]: 42.9-62.8) in T1DM and 49.8/1000 person years (CI 30.8-68.8) in T2DM; nephropathy, 6.2 (CI 3.3-9.0) and 13.8 (CI 5.6-22.0); and neuropathy, 8.8(CI 3.6-14.0) and 24.0 (CI 9.8-38.2) in T1DM and T2DM, respectively.

32970763,Heritability and complex segregation analysis of naturally-occurring diabetes in Australian Terrier Dogs.,"The Australian Terrier breed is the breed at highest risk for naturally-occurring diabetes mellitus in the United States, where it is 32 times more likely to develop diabetes compared to mixed breed dogs. However, the heritability and mode of inheritance of spontaneous diabetes in Australian Terriers has not been reported. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the heritability and mode of inheritance of diabetes in Australian Terriers. A cohort of related Australian Terriers including 383 Australian Terriers without diabetes, 86 Australian Terriers with spontaneous diabetes, and 14 Australian Terriers with an unknown phenotype, was analyzed. A logistic regression model including the effects of sex was formulated to evaluate the heritability of diabetes. The inheritance pattern of spontaneous diabetes in Australian Terriers was investigated by use of complex segregation analysis. Six possible inheritance models were studied, and the Akaike Information Criterion was used to determine the best model for diabetes inheritance in Australian Terriers, among the models deemed biologically feasible. Heritability of diabetes in Australian Terriers was estimated at 0.18 (95% confidence interval 0.0-0.67). There was no significant difference in the effect of males and females on disease outcome. Complex segregation analysis suggested that the mode of diabetes inheritance in Australian Terriers is polygenic, with no evidence for a large effect single gene influencing diabetes. It is concluded that in the population of Australian Terriers bred in the United States, a relatively small degree of genetic variation contributes to spontaneous diabetes. A genetic uniformity for diabetes-susceptible genes within the population of Australian Terriers bred in the Unites States could increase the risk of diabetes in this cohort. These findings hold promise for future genetic studies of canine diabetes focused on this particular breed.",PloS one,2020-,"Mui ML, Famula TR, Henthorn PS, Hess RS",4,1957,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
32981196,The accuracy of provider diagnosed diabetes type in youth compared to an etiologic criteria in the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study.,"Although surveillance for diabetes in youth relies on provider-assigned diabetes type from medical records, its accuracy compared to an etiologic definition is unknown. Using the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Registry, we evaluated the validity and accuracy of provider-assigned diabetes type abstracted from medical records against etiologic criteria that included the presence of diabetes autoantibodies (DAA) and insulin sensitivity. Youth who were incident for diabetes in 2002-2006, 2008, or 2012 and had complete data on key analysis variables were included (n = 4001, 85% provider diagnosed type 1). The etiologic definition for type 1 diabetes was â¥1 positive DAA titer(s) or negative DAA titers in the presence of insulin sensitivity and for type 2 diabetes was negative DAA titers in the presence of insulin resistance. Provider diagnosed diabetes type correctly agreed with the etiologic definition of type for 89.9% of cases. Provider diagnosed type 1 diabetes was 96.9% sensitive, 82.8% specific, had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 97.0% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 82.7%. Provider diagnosed type 2 diabetes was 82.8% sensitive, 96.9% specific, had a PPV and NPV of 82.7% and 97.0%, respectively. Provider diagnosis of diabetes type agreed with etiologic criteria for 90% of the cases. While the sensitivity and PPV were high for youth with type 1 diabetes, the lower sensitivity and PPV for type 2 diabetes highlights the value of DAA testing and assessment of insulin sensitivity status to ensure estimates are not biased by misclassification.",Pediatric diabetes,2020-Dec,"Crume TL, Hamman RF, Isom S, Divers J, Mayer-Davis EJ, Liese AD, Saydah S, Lawrence JM, Pihoker C, Dabelea D",10,1576,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
32774444,Research of Epidemic Big Data Based on Improved Deep Convolutional Neural Network.,"In recent years, with the acceleration of the aging process and the aggravation of life pressure, the proportion of chronic epidemics has gradually increased. A large amount of medical data will be generated during the hospitalization of diabetics. It will have important practical significance and social value to discover potential medical laws and valuable information among medical data. In view of this, an improved deep convolutional neural network (""CNN+"" for short) algorithm was proposed to predict the changes of diabetes. Firstly, the bagging integrated classification algorithm was used instead of the output layer function of the deep CNN, which can help the improved deep CNN algorithm constructed for the data set of diabetic patients and improve the accuracy of classification. In this way, the ""CNN+"" algorithm can take the advantages of both the deep CNN and the bagging algorithm. On the one hand, it can extract the potential features of the data set by using the powerful feature extraction ability of deep CNN. On the other hand, the bagging integrated classification algorithm can be used for feature classification, so as to improve the classification accuracy and obtain better disease prediction effect to assist doctors in diagnosis and treatment. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional convolutional neural network and other classification algorithm, the ""CNN+"" model can get more reliable prediction results.",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2020-,Wang W,1,1459,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The evidence supports theory-based intervention in promoting self-care behaviors. However, no systematic review was done to monitor these interventions and compare more effective constructs. This study was conducted to investigate the studies using self-care theories and introducing the most effective theories. This is a systematic review study during which some scientific databases including Scopus, Elsevier, Google scholar and PubMed were searched by using some key words like self-care or self-management, diabetes, theory or model. English articles from the start of 2013 up to the end of November 2020 were monitored. 20 articles were selected and studied based on eight theories which they used. These theories were: Social support theory, Health Belief Model, Heath Belief Model and Empowerment Theory, Empowerment Theory, Self-efficacy Theory, precede-proceed model, Self-regulation Theory, behavioral theory and Social Cognitive Theory. Four theories appeared to be more effective for the target behavior of present research: Social Support Theory and the combination of Empowerment Theory and Health Belief Model, Social Cognitive Theory and Self Efficacy Theory. Taken together, the findings of this systematic review suggest that interventions that go beyond individual determinants (such as changing knowledge and attitudes) to determinants of upper cognitive, motor, and social levels (such as the development of skills and competencies) they have led to raised self-care outcomes.",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2020-,"Zare S, Ostovarfar J, Kaveh MH, Vali M",4,1610,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Diabetic bladder dysfunction is thought to affect up to 60%-90% of individuals with diabetes and can significantly impact quality of life. Despite the prevalence of diabetic bladder dysfunction, the exact pathophysiological mechanism, and resulting clinical presentation, remains debated. Our objective was to compare urodynamic parameters between diabetic and nondiabetic women, assessing the impact of various markers of diabetes severity on bladder function. A retrospective chart review was conducted on female patients aged 18 and above who underwent urodynamic studies at a single tertiary care university hospital system from 2014 to 2020. Patients were categorized based on diabetes status, and diabetes severity including duration of disease, hemoglobin A1c levels, insulin dependence, and markers of end-organ dysfunction. Urodynamic variables, including compliance, bladder voided efficiency, bladder contractility index, postvoid residual, maximum flow rate, capacity, voided volume, and detrusor overactivity, were assessed by two independent reviewers. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the impact of diabetes and diabetic severity on urodynamic parameters. A total of 652 female patients were included in the study, of which, 152 (23.3%) had diabetes, with an average duration of diagnosis of 82.3 months. Diabetic women were older and had higher body mass index compared to nondiabetic women. Diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy were present in 18% and 54.6% of diabetic patients, respectively. Significant differences in urodynamic parameters were observed between diabetic and nondiabetic women, with diabetic women showing higher rates of detrusor overactivity (pâ=â0.01), particularly associated with increasing BMI (pâ=â0.03). However, classic markers of diabetes severity including duration, as well as markers of end-organ damage, showed mixed associations with urodynamic changes. Despite the prevalence of diabetic bladder dysfunction and its impact on patient quality of life, the exact mechanisms and clinical presentation remain elusive. Our study highlights the significant differences in urodynamic parameters between diabetic and nondiabetic women, emphasizing the need for further research into the relationship between diabetes and diabetic bladder dysfunction.",Neurourology and urodynamics,2024-Sep,"Burns RT, Arnold PJ, Song L, Moss KL, Powell CR",5,2468,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
37345245,Ketosis-prone Diabetes and Hypogonadism: A New Clinical Association to be Aware of ?,"Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) is an emerging entity, sharing features of both type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with KPD usually present with diabetic ketoacidosis without the classic phenotype of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. In most cases, they are Afro-American adults, who require insulin therapy for the management of acute decompensation, then usually encountering insulin-free remission for prolonged periods of time with diet or with non-insulin agents. Meanwhile, hypogonadism is a known condition that could be associated with higher risk of developing both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and could be a risk factor for decompensated diabetes. The association of KPD and hypogonadism is reported for the first time in literature. Here we report two peculiar cases of young African patients, affected by KPD and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, respectively Klinefelter's syndrome and primary ovarian failure. Both patients were treated promptly for the ketoacidosis with intravenous fluids combined with continuous insulin infusion, and then switched to subcutaneous regimen. After the correct clinical evaluation, oral antidiabetic drugs were added. KPD remains an under-recognized and under-diagnosed type of diabetes. As hypogonadism is strongly linked to dysmetabolic disorders, the evaluation of sex hormones should be performed at the onset of diabetes. Further studies should investigate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and its role in the development of KDP and its manifestations and complications.","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2023-,"Graziani A, Pollis RM, Bonora BM, Scaroni C, Sabbadin C",5,1547,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Diabetes is an epidemic in the United States, and the disease is associated with altered gut motility. As a result, we suspected that a significant number of patients referred for GES may have undiagnosed DM or pre-DM. Given that established procedure standards for GES require all patients to prepare with an 8-h fast, an opportunity is provided to measure the fasting blood glucose (FBG) in all individuals before they undergo the examination. <b>Methods:</b> The charts of patients undergoing GES were reviewed for a history of DM and correlated with FBG and GES results.

We ascertained diabetes incidence rates, clinical and demographic characteristics, and classifications and prescription patterns of glucose-lowering therapy and compared these parameters across diabetes subgroups. Among 398,456 adults with new-onset diabetes, 5,879 (1.5%) had PPDM, 9,252 (2.3%) type 1 diabetes, and the remaining type 2 diabetes (96.2%). The incidence rate of PPDM was 7.9 (95% CI 7.7-8.1) per 100,000 person-years versus 12.5 (95% CI 12.2-12.7) for type 1 diabetes (incidence rate ratio 0.6 [95% CI 0.6-0.7]; <i>P</i> < 0.001). A sizeable proportion of patients with PPDM were classified as having type 2 diabetes (44.9%) and prescribed sulfonylureas (25.2%) and incretin-based therapies (18.0%) that can potentially be harmful in PPDM. In contrast, 35.0% of patients never received biguanides, which are associated with a survival benefit in PPDM. Increased insulin requirements were observed for patients with PPDM compared with type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio 3.10 [95% CI 2.96-3.23]; <i>P</i> < 0.001) in particular for PPDM associated with chronic pancreatitis (hazard ratio 4.30 [95% CI 4.01-4.56]; <i>P</i> < 0.001). PPDM is a common type of secondary diabetes in adults but is often misclassified and treated as type 2 diabetes, although PPDM requires special considerations for management.",Diabetes care,2021-Sep,"Viggers R, Jensen MH, Laursen HVB, Drewes AM, Vestergaard P, Olesen SS",6,1799,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
35958851,Cost-effectiveness of community diabetes screening: Application of Akaike information criterion in rural communities of Nigeria.,"The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing globally, and this requires several approaches to screening. There are reports of alternative indices for prediction of DM, besides fasting blood glucose (FBG) level. This study, investigated the ability of combination of biochemical and anthropometric parameters and orodental disease indicators (ODIs) to generate models for DM prediction, using Akaike information criterion (AIC) to substantiate health economics of diabetes screening. Four hundred and thirty-three subjects were enrolled in the study in Ndokwa communities, Delta State, Nigeria, and their glycaemic status was determined, using the CardioChek analyser<sup>Â®</sup> and previous data from the Prediabetes and Cardiovascular Complications Study were also used. The cost of screening for diabetes (NGN 300 = $0.72) in a not-for-profit organization/hospital was used as basis to calculate the health economics of number of individuals with DM in 1,000 participants. Data on the subjects' anthropometric, biochemical and ODI parameters were used to generate different models, using R statistical software (version 4.0.0). The different models were evaluated for their AIC values. Lowest AIC was considered as best model. Microsoft Excel software (version 2020) was used in preliminary analysis. The cost of identifying <2 new subjects with hyperglycemia, in 1,000 people was â¥NGN 300,000 ($ 716). A total of 4,125 models were generated. AIC modeling indicates FBG test as the best model (AIC = 4), and the least being combination of random blood sugar + waist circumference + hip circumference (AIC â 34). Models containing ODI parameters had AIC values >34, hence considered as not recommendable. The cost of general screening for diabetes in rural communities may appear high and burdensome in terms of health economics. However, the use of prediction models involving AIC is of value in terms of cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness to the healthcare consumers, which favors health economics.",Frontiers in public health,2022-,"Anyasodor AE, Nwose EU, Bwititi PT, Richards RS",4,2014,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

32268561,Prevalence of Diabetic Retinopathy in Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients in North-East Poland.,"<i>Background and Objectives:</i> The global epidemic of diabetes, especially type 2 (DM2), is related to lifestyle changes, obesity, and the process of population aging. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most serious complication of the eye caused by diabetes. The aim of this research was to assess the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in north-east Poland. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: The eye fundus was assessed on the basis of two-field 50 degrees color fundus photographs that showed the optic nerve and macula in the center after the pupil was dilated with 1% tropicamide. <i>Results</i>: The experimental group included 315 (26%) patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) and 894 (74%) patients with DM2. DM1 patients were diagnosed with DR in 32.58% of cases, with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) in 24.44% of cases, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in 1.59% of cases, diabetic macular edema (DME) in 5.40% of cases, and PDR with DME in 0.95% of cases. DR was found in DM2 patients in 23.04% of cases, NPDR in 17.11% of cases, PDR in 1.01% of cases, DME in 4.81% of cases, and PDR with DME in 0.11% of cases. <i>Conclusions</i>: The presented study is the first Polish study on the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy presenting a large group of patients, and its results could be extrapolated to the whole country. Diabetic retinopathy was found in 25.48% of patients in the whole experimental group. The above results place Poland within the European average, indicating the quality of diabetic care offered in Poland, based on the number of observed complications.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2020-Apr,"Matuszewski W, Baranowska-Jurkun A, Stefanowicz-Rutkowska MM, Modzelewski R, PieczyÅski J, Bandurska-Stankiewicz E",6,1651,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The potential factors influencing medication adherence and how they contribute to health behaviors have not been synthesized to date. This review synthesized qualitative studies that identified factors influencing medication adherence among adults living with diabetes and comorbidity. Twenty-eight findings were extracted and synthesized into four themes: perceived support, lack of knowledge, medication issues, and the importance of routine. The findings highlight the factors that support medication adherence and areas that can be targeted to support and promote medication adherence. The findings also support the potential role of healthcare providers in supporting people living with diabetes and comorbidity to adhere to and maintain medication regimes. Several factors were identified that are amenable to intervention within the clinical practice setting and have the potential to enhance medication adherence and improve health outcomes for people living with diabetes and comorbidities.

38330228,Machine Learning Identifies Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus.,"The presence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular disease, but is often underdiagnosed. To develop machine learning (ML) models for risk assessment of MASLD occurrence in patients with DM. Feature selection determined the discriminative parameters, utilized to classify DM patients as those with and without MASLD. The performance of the multiple logistic regression model was quantified by sensitivity, specificity, and percentage of correctly classified patients, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Decision curve analysis (DCA) assessed the model's net benefit for alternative treatments. We studied 2000 patients with DM (mean age 58.85 Â± 17.37 years; 48% women). Eight parameters: age, body mass index, type of DM, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, platelet count, hyperuricaemia, and treatment with metformin were identified as discriminative. The experiments for 1735 patients show that 744/991 (75.08%) and 586/744 (78.76%) patients with/without MASLD were correctly identified (sensitivity/specificity: 0.75/0.79). The area under ROC (AUC) was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.82-0.86), while DCA showed a higher clinical utility of the model, ranging from 30% to 84% threshold probability. Results for 265 test patients confirm the model's generalizability (sensitivity/specificity: 0.80/0.74; AUC: 0.81 [95% CI, 0.76-0.87]), whereas unsupervised clustering identified high-risk patients.

The study sample comprised 4240 participants from the Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) Study (meanÂ±SD age = 66â¯Â±â¯8). Arterial stiffness was assessed from 5 April 2011-6â¯November 2012 by way of aortic PWV (aPWV) and estimated carotid-femoral PWV (ecfPWV). Incident diabetes/prediabetes was determined by linkage to dispensed prescription and national hospital discharge registers. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the risk of diabetes/prediabetes in relation to chosen arterial stiffness measures both overall and over quartiles. During a meanÂ±SD follow-up of 10.5â¯Â±â¯0.4 years, 470 participants developed diabetes/prediabetes. Following adjustment for potential confounders, aPWV (hazard ratio (HR) per SD increase, 1.40, 95â¯% CI, 1.19-1.64) was associated with the incidence of diabetes. The risk of incident diabetes was, compared to the first quartile, higher in the fourth quartile of aPWV (HR, 1.98, 95â¯%CI, 1.26-3.11)(P<sub>trend</sub>=0.01).

It is unclear what subtype of diabetes mellitus (DM) occurs; however, type 3c diabetes mellitus (T3cDM) is gaining increasing recognition. T3cDM has differing pathophysiology than other subtypes of DM and therefore differing disease course and treatment. Current studies have examined the incidence and prevalence of DM following AP, and meta-analyses have shown around 15% develop DM at 1 year with an increasing proportion developing DM at 5 years. It has been observed that some patients have transient hyperglycemia following AP episode with a subset developing persistent impaired glucose metabolism; however, the exact timeline is not well defined. The data on risk factors for developing DM after AP is limited and mixed; however, it is likely that severity of AP may impact the propensity to develop DM. Screening guidelines have not been established following AP; however, screening 1-year post-event will likely capture a sizable proportion of newly developed DM. The endocrine and exocrine pancreas are closely linked, and studies have found significant overlap in dysfunction of both after AP.

39218351,Smoking and diabetes.,"Smoking increases insulin resistance via multiple mechanisms but is a poorly understood risk factor for onset of type-2 diabetes. It is also associated with impaired beta-cell function in humans, but again the mechanisms are poorly understood. Mechanistic studies of the impact of smoking on carbohydrate metabolism mainly evaluated nicotine as the causal agent, and more rarely other tobacco constituents, making it impossible to conclude that the risk of diabetes is linked to the effects of nicotine alone. Active smoking also has negative impact on glycemic control in both type-1 and type-2 diabetic patients. It increases the risk of all-cause mortality and worsens the chronic complications of diabetes. Impact on microangiopathic complications in type-2 diabetic patients, however, is more controversial. Data on pharmacological and behavioral strategies for smoking cessation used in the general population are more sparse in diabetic patients, despite opportunities with recent therapeutic trials involving varenicline and GLP-1 analogues. It is essential for diabetic patients to stop smoking, and diabetologists must get involved in smoking cessation as they have done for many years in therapeutic education, which can easily include measures to help patients stop smoking.",Annales d'endocrinologie,2024-Dec,"Rouland A, Thuillier P, Al-Salameh A, Benzerouk F, Bahougne T, Tramunt B, Berlin I, Clair C, Thomas D, Le Faou AL, VergÃ¨s B, Durlach V",12,1286,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

38980465,Clinical Outcomes of Rural Patients with Diabetes Treated by ECHO-Trained Providers Versus an Academic Medical Center.,"Despite clinical practice guidelines prioritizing cardiorenal risk reduction, national trends in diabetes outcomes, particularly in rural communities, do not mirror the benefits seen in clinical trials with emerging therapeutics and technologies. Project ECHO supports implementation of guidelines in under-resourced areas through virtual communities of practice, sharing of best practices, and case-based learning. We hypothesized that diabetes outcomes of patients treated by ECHO-trained primary care providers (PCPs) would be similar to those of patients treated by specialists at an academic medical center. Specialists from the University of New Mexico (UNM) launched a weekly diabetes ECHO program to mentor dyads consisting of a PCP and community health worker at ten rural clinics. We compared cardiorenal risk factor changes in patients with diabetes treated by ECHO-trained dyads to patients treated by specialists at the UNM Diabetes Comprehensive Care Center (DCCC). Eligible participants included adults with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes on insulin, or diabetes of either type with A1c > 9%. The primary outcome was change from baseline in A1c in the ECHO and DCCC cohorts. Secondary outcomes included changes in body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, cholesterol, and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR). Compared to the DCCC cohort (n = 151), patients in the ECHO cohort (n = 856) experienced greater A1c reduction (-1.2% vs -0.6%; p = 0.02 for difference in difference). BMI decreased in the Endo ECHO cohort and increased in the DCCC cohort (-0.2 vs. +1.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; p = 0.003 for difference in difference). Diastolic blood pressure declined in the Endo ECHO cohort only. Improvements of similar magnitude were observed in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in both groups.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is among the leading causes of NCD-related deaths worldwide and is a foremost public health problem in Nigeria. As part of National policy, Nigeria has committed to implement the World Health Organization (WHO) Package of Essential Non-communicable Disease interventions for primary care. Implementing the intervention requires the availability of essential elements, including guidelines, trained staff, health management information systems (HMIS), equipment, and medications, in primary healthcare centers (PHCs). This study assessed the availability of the DM component of the WHO package, and the readiness of the health workers in these PHCs to implement a DM screening, evaluation, and management program to inform future adoption and implementation. This cross-sectional formative assessment adapted the WHO Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) tool to survey 30 PHCs selected by multistage sampling for readiness to deliver DM diagnosis and care in Abuja, Nigeria, between August and October 2021. The SARA tool was adapted to focus on DM services and the availability and readiness indicator scores were calculated based on the proportion of PHCs with available DM care services, minimum staff requirement, diagnostic tests, equipment, medications, and national guidelines/protocols for DM care within the defined SARA domain. All 30 PHCs reported the availability of at least two full-time staff (median [interquartile range]â=â5 [4-9]), which were mostly community health extension workers (median [interquartile range])â=â3 [1-4].

35409752,Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes in Poland.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive inherited monogenic disease in Caucasians. As medical technology progresses and the quality of patient care improves, the survival time of patients with CF has increased, which results in more frequent comorbidities such as cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). CFRD is the result of abnormal glucose metabolism characterized primarily by insulin deficiency, exacerbated periodically by insulin resistance. The aim of our study was to analyze the epidemiology of patients with CFRD in Poland on the basis of data collected from six CF treatment centers. Analyses were performed on 1157 CF patients who were treated at one of the six CF care centers. CFRD was diagnosed according to standard criteria. All data including demographics, types of CFTR mutations, CFRD duration, and microorganisms in the sputum were obtained from the patients' medical history. Our study indicates that the prevalence of CFRD in Poland is 12.9%. CFRD was most often diagnosed between the ages of 11 and 20 (60% of patients), while 23% of patients were diagnosed between 21 and 30 years of age. Furthermore, we observed that approximately 3-5% of patients under the age of 10 had CFRD. We found out that the type of mutation did not affect the frequency of CFRD development. Factors that increased the risk of developing CFRD include underweight and chronic <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection. Due to the extended lifespan of CF patients, the number of CFRD patients is currently increasing. We believe that the results of our study may complement information from other studies or may be useful in planning health policy in Poland.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022-Mar,"Rachel M, Biesiadecki M, Galiniak S",3,1678,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The purpose of this comparative review is to identify application areas, direction and provide foundation for future virtual reality tools in diabetes. Features and benefits of each VR diabetes application are compared and discussed, following a thorough review of literature on virtual reality for diabetes using multiple databases. The weaknesses of existing VR applications are discussed and their strengths identified so that these can be carried forward. A novel virtual reality diabetes tool prototype is also developed and presented. This research identifies three major categories where VR is being used in diabetes: education, prevention and treatment. Within diabetes education, there are three target groups: clinicians, adults with diabetes and children with diabetes. Both VR and AR have shown benefits in areas of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Virtual reality and augmented reality in diabetes have demonstrated potential to enhance training of diabetologists and enhance education, prevention and treatment for adults and children with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Future research can continually build on virtual and augmented reality diabetes applications by integrating wide stakeholder inputs and diverse digital platforms. Several areas of VR diabetes are in early stages, with advantages and opportunities. Further VR diabetes innovations are encouraging to enhance training, management and treatment of diabetes.",Journal of diabetes science and technology,2025-May,Vaughan N,1,1548,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

However, in Japan, the implementation rates of DSMES are not known. DSMES implementation rates were calculated using the National Database of claims data, which included nearly all insurance-covered medical procedures. The study enrolled participants who received regular antidiabetic medications between April 2017 and March 2018. The implementation rates of DSMES-related care were calculated by characteristics, visiting medical facilities and prefectures. In 4,465,513 participants receiving antidiabetic medications (men, 57.8%; insulin use, 14.1%), nutrition guidance (5.6%) was the most frequently provided care type. Insulin users and participants visiting Japan Diabetes Society-certified and large medical institutions had higher implementation rates of nutrition guidance. DSMES-related care might not be provided adequately for Japanese people with diabetes.

37149604,Diabetes mellitus-related hospital admissions and prescriptions of antidiabetic agents in England and Wales: an ecological study.,"Around 6.5% of the population in the United Kingdom has been diagnosed with diabetes. It is associated with several long-term consequences and higher hospitalization rates. To examine the profile of hospital admissions related to diabetes mellitus and the prescription rates of antidiabetic medications in England and Wales. This is an ecological study that was conducted for the period between April 1999 and April 2020 using publicly available hospitalisation data in England and Wales. Hospital admission data for patients of all ages was extracted fromÂ Hospital Episode Statistics in EnglandÂ and the Patient Episode Database for Wales. The difference between admission rates in 1999 and 2020, as well as the difference between diabetes mellitus medication prescription rates in 2004 and 2020, were assessed using the Pearson Chi-squared test. A Poisson regression model with robust variance estimation was used to examine the trend in hospital admissions. A total of 1,757,892 diabetes mellitus hospital admissions were recorded in England and Wales during the duration of the study. The hospital admission rate for diabetes mellitus increased by 15.2%. This increase was concomitant with an increase in the antidiabetic medication prescribing rate of 105.9% between 2004 and 2020. Males and those in the age group of 15-59Â years had a higher rate of hospital admission. The most common causes of admissions were type 1 diabetes mellitus related complications, which accounted for 47.1% of all admissions. This research gives an in-depth overview of the hospitalization profile in England and Wales during the previous two decades. In England and Wales, people with all types of diabetes and related problems have been hospitalized at a high rate over the past 20Â years. Male gender and middle age were significant determinants in influencing admission rates. Diabetes mellitus type 1 complications were the leading cause of hospitalizations. We advocate establishing preventative and educational campaigns to promote the best standards of care for individuals with diabetes in order to lower the risk of diabetes-related complications.",BMC endocrine disorders,2023-May,"AbuHammad GAR, Naser AY, Hassouneh LKM",3,2140,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled study to assess the effects of a 1-year intervention. The primary outcome was insufficient adherence to regular PCP attendance for diabetes treatment, defined as failure to visit a PCP within 2 months of an original appointment date. The intervention consisted of mailing patient reminders of their PCP appointments, providing patients with health education aimed at lifestyle modification and benchmarking PCP procedures. Eleven municipal level district medical associations employing 192 PCPs were divided into two subregions for assignment to intervention and control clusters, with 971 and 1,265 patients assigned to the intervention and control groups, respectively. Primary outcome data were available for 2,200 patients. The intervention reduced insufficient adherence to regular PCP appointments by 63% (hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.58). In conclusion, a triple-faceted intervention program consisting of health education, appointment reminders, and physician benchmarking may decrease the risk of incomplete adherence to regular PCP appointments by diabetes patients.",Scientific reports,2020-Feb,"Noda M, Hayashino Y, Yamazaki K, Suzuki H, Goto A, Kato M, Izumi K, Kobayashi M",8,1381,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

However, in vitro studies and animal models do not always translate to the human disease, perhaps illustrated by the failure of many drug candidates in the clinical phase. Non-invasive biomedical imaging techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) offer tools for direct visualization and quantification of molecular processes in humans. Developments in this area potentially enable longitudinal in vivo studies of receptors and processes involved in diabetes guiding drug development and diagnosis in the near future.

32592917,Postpartum lifestyle modifications for women with gestational diabetes: A qualitative study.,"The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus increased to 8% in France in 2012, and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes after receiving a gestational diabetes diagnosis increases 7-fold. Education delivered during pregnancy aims to reduce this risk by reminding women to maintain dietary and lifestyle modifications after delivery. The primary objective of this study was to describe and analyze the feelings and daily lifestyle changes, including physical activity and dietary changes, among women who experienced gestational diabetes and the roles played by their general practitioners during follow-up. We conducted a qualitative study examining women's attitudes during the 6-12 months postpartum, after receiving a gestational diabetes diagnosis and associated education. All women participated in semi-structured, individual, telephone-based interviews. Out of 47 patients contacted, we interviewed 16 women. All interviewed women modified their behaviors, at least slightly, and described changes that included more balanced diets and the incorporation of mild physical activity. Lack of time, lack of awareness regarding the long-term risk of developing type 2 diabetes, resistance to long-term dietary changes, and cultural habits were identified as the primary barriers to long-term lifestyle modifications, whereas family support was found to be beneficial. The reported interactions between each woman and her physician appeared to be weak. Our study showed that educational attitudes and preventive interventions must be reinforced, especially during the long-term, and not only during the immediate postpartum period. Raising awareness among primary care physicians regarding the need to provide continuous education for this high-risk population appears to be necessary.","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",2020-Sep,"Krompa K, Sebbah S, Baudry C, Cosson E, Bihan H",5,1791,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
34016607,Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults (LADA) Is Likely to Represent a Mixed Population of Autoimmune (Type 1) and Nonautoimmune (Type 2) Diabetes.,"Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is typically defined as a new diabetes diagnosis after 35 years of age, presenting with clinical features of type 2 diabetes, in whom a type 1 diabetes-associated islet autoantibody is detected. Identifying autoimmune diabetes is important since the prognosis and optimal therapy differ. However, the existing LADA definition identifies a group with clinical and genetic features intermediate between typical type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is unclear whether this is due to <i>1</i>) true autoimmune diabetes with a milder phenotype at older onset ages that initially appears similar to type 2 diabetes but later requires insulin, <i>2</i>) a disease syndrome where the pathophysiologies of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are both present in each patient, or <i>3</i>) a heterogeneous group resulting from difficulties in classification. Herein, we suggest that difficulties in classification are a major component resulting from defining LADA using a diagnostic test-islet autoantibody measurement-with imperfect specificity applied in low-prevalence populations. This yields a heterogeneous group of true positives (autoimmune type 1 diabetes) and false positives (nonautoimmune type 2 diabetes). For clinicians, this means that islet autoantibody testing should not be undertaken in patients who do not have clinical features suggestive of autoimmune diabetes: in an adult without clinical features of type 1 diabetes, it is likely that a single positive antibody will represent a false-positive result. This is in contrast to patients with features suggestive of type 1 diabetes, where false-positive results will be rare. For researchers, this means that current definitions of LADA are not appropriate for the study of autoimmune diabetes in later life. Approaches that increase test specificity, or prior likelihood of autoimmune diabetes, are needed to avoid inclusion of participants who have nonautoimmune (type 2) diabetes. Improved classification will allow improved assignment of prognosis and therapy as well as an improved cohort in which to analyze and better understand the detailed pathophysiological components acting at onset and during disease progression in late-onset autoimmune diabetes.",Diabetes care,2021-Jun,"Jones AG, McDonald TJ, Shields BM, Hagopian W, Hattersley AT",5,2251,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening all adults ages 40 to 70 years with overweight or obesity for abnormal blood glucose, and screening for gestational diabetes in pregnant women after 24 weeks. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screening all patients older than 45 years for prediabetes and diabetes, and screening earlier for patients with risk factors. Screening in younger patients is based on risk factors. The diagnostic criteria for prediabetes and diabetes require two abnormal test results from the same sample or from two separate samples, in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia or symptomatic hyperglycemia.

Using the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) model for improvement, four rapid plan-do-study-act cycles primarily implemented different tests of change over eight weeks using a streamlined mnemonic - the LLaVES (lifestyle, laboratory tests, vaccination, examination, social/psychosocial) bundle for screening and case management of patients with diabetes. Secondary to the LLaVES bundle, tests of change were also conducted for clinic team members and patients. Team member engagement utilized a best-practice toolkit for effective communication. Patient engagement implemented validated models to evaluate knowledge of diabetes and stage of change. Data were analyzed using run charts to evaluate the impact of interventions on outcomes. Overall compliance was measured as the diabetes management compliance rate (DMCR), composed of LLaVES implementation, team engagement, and patient engagement scores. The diabetes management compliance rate increased by 72.2%, from a baseline of 49% to 84.4% in eight weeks. Team engagement increased from 76.6% to 92% while patient engagement increased from 70.4% to 87.4%.

This narrative review examines the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management and identifies areas of future research to address the challenge posed by CAN. We conducted a comprehensive literature search using a range of sources, including the electronic databases PubMed Central, Google Scholar, OVID, and Open Athens, to search for studies on CAN, diabetes mellitus, lifestyle intervention, and cardiovascular risk. We set inclusion criteria to consider review articles or original research published in peer-reviewed journals that examined CAN in diabetes. Epidemiologic data indicate a varied prevalence of CAN in type 1 and 2 diabetes, with prevalences of 17% to 73%) depending on clinical and demographic factors. Indeed, duration of diabetes and hyperglycemia are the strongest risk factors for CAN development in type 1 diabetes. However, in type 2 diabetes, multifactorial risk factors, including obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, are associated with the development of CAN. Insulin resistance, which underpins type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, has a direct role in the pathogenesis of CAN. Lifestyle interventions, including dietary measures and tailored exercise programs, have been beneficial in improving cardiac autonomic function primarily measured through heart rate variability. In addition, weight loss through bariatric surgery also improves heart rate variability and may prevent or reduce CAN progression in people living with obesity and concomitant type 2 diabetes. For optimization in type 2 diabetes, both lifestyle and targeted pharmacologic interventions are required to achieve glycemic/metabolic targets, and weight loss is required to prevent or reverse early CAN or prevent the progression to definite and severe CAN. The focused use of diagnostic testing for CAN, including cardiac autonomic reflex testing in those at high risk of CAN, will enable earlier diagnosis. This testing will allow timely interventions at a reversible stage. Future research should examine targeted early diagnostic testing with subsequent intervention with a combination of lifestyle measures and newer pharmacotherapeutics (eg, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitorsÂ and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists), which have produced significant cardiovascular benefit in diabetes.",Clinical therapeutics,2022-Oct,"Williams S, Raheim SA, Khan MI, Rubab U, Kanagala P, Zhao SS, Marshall A, Brown E, Alam U",9,2497,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

35695412,Impact of COVID-19 therapy on hyperglycemia.,"The goal of this study was to analyze the effect of COVID-19 drugs and biologicals on hyperglycemia. A literature search with key terms, such as ""COVID-19 drugs and hyperglycemia"" and ""COVID-19 vaccines and hyperglycemia,"" was conducted using PubMed through September 2021. The CDC data were referenced for current COVID-19 profile and statistics. The NIH COVID-19 guidelines were referenced for updated treatment recommendations. Micromedex and UpToDate were used for drug and disease information. Current results suggested that corticosteroids (dexamethasone), remdesivir and antivirals (lopinavir and ritonavir) all have the potential to significantly raise blood glucose levels putting patients at elevated risk for severe complications. In contrary, hydroxychloroquine is associated with hypoglycemia, and tocilizumab decreases inflammation which is associated with improving glucose levels. Other anti-cytokine bioactive molecules are correlated with lower blood glucose in patients with and without diabetes mellitus. Ivermectin, used for mild COVID-19 disease, possesses the potential for lowering blood glucose.

We investigated the prevalence of DM, pre-diabetes, undiagnosed and uncontrolled diabetes and its relationship with some associated socioeconomic factors in the Yazd Greater Area in Iran. Yazd Health Study is a longitudinal study conducted to determine the prevalence of non-communicable disease and related risk factors. In a two-step cluster sampling, 10,000 adults aged 20-69âyears (200 clusters) were selected. In the recruitment phase, DM was considered if the patients had been either diagnosed DM by a physician or had fasting blood glucoseââ¥â126âmg/dL. Chi square test was used for categorical variables to evaluate the differences and logistic regression model was applied to determine the predictors of diabetes.. P-value <â0.05 considered statistically significant. Of the 9965 individuals recruited, the crude self-reported prevalence of DM was 14.1% (95% CI: 13.4-14.7). The prevalence was higher in women than men (15.6 vs.12.4%), significantly. The age-standardized prevalence of DM was 8%. The prevalence was 14.9% in Yazd local people and 8.6% in those residents migrated from other provinces (Pâ<â0.0001). We showed a significant association between DM prevalence and age, education, marital status, unemployment, insurance status, and positive family history (Pâ<â0.0001). The prevalence of DM diagnosed by phycisians was 16.1% in participants (age-standardized prevalence: 8.3%). The subset analysis showed that 4.8% of patients were not aware of their disease. The prevalence of pre-diabetes was 25.8%. Of those with diabetes, 58.3% were not adequately controlled, which is not statistically significant with socio-economic status. The current study showed a high prevalence of DM in Yazd Greater Area which is closely related to some socio-demographic factors. The high prevalence of pre-diabetes is alarming. Effective strategies for DM prevention should be introduced. The majority of people with diabetes are aware, but half of them are not controlled. The ineffective care plan currently in use, should be reviewed. Patients needs to be encouraged to improve their lifestyle.

DKD is found to occur in approximately 40% of patients with type 2 diabetes and 30% of patients with type 1 diabetes. However, research on the effects of antihyperglycemic agents on the renal outcomes of these patients is still in its infancy. The current review explores glycemic management in patients with DKD, focusing on the challenges faced as well as the clinical considerations of antihyperglycemic agents in this population. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using EMBASE, Web of Science, and PubMed databases. This review was completed by the end of March 2023, and the following keywords were used for the search: diabetic nephropathy, diabetic kidney disease, safety, efficacy, and antihyperglycemic therapies. The several concerns about the use of antihyperglycemic agents in treating diabetes in patients with DKD highlight the need for substantial efforts in educating both patients and healthcare practitioners in this regard. In addition, it is suggested that patients receive individualized treatments, considering the potential long-term benefits of each agent; this would entail prospectively modifying doses in line with the stage of DKD to prevent the progression of renal damage. As some classes of agents offer better renoprotective effects for patients with DKD, it would be wise for nephrologists and endocrinologists to collaborate to offer an antihyperglycemic regime for patients with DKD who are at a high risk of further progression. Further study is needed on the beneficial renal effects of specific classes of agents; more knowledge of their mechanisms and renoprotective effects may contribute to the development of novel treatments for patients with DKD.",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,2023-Dec,"Jairoun AA, Ping CC, Ibrahim B",3,1864,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Hospitalisations were categorised by cause as: decompensated heart failure; other cardiovascular; infection or other non-cardiovascular. Rates of hospitalisation and burden of hospitalisation (percentage of follow-up time in hospital) were compared in people with and without DM. After a mean follow-up of 4.0 years, 1568 hospitalisations occurred in the entire cohort. DM (present in 32% [<i>n</i>=224]) was associated with a higher rate (mean 1.07 vs 0.78 per 100 patient-years; <i>p</i><0.001) and burden (3.4 vs 2.2% of follow-up time; <i>p</i><0.001) of hospitalisation.

Hyperglycemia is associated with poor outcomes, and stability of glucose levels is an important factor in preoperative management. Diabetes presents a particular challenge since patients are often on multiple medications encompassing glycemic management and cardiovascular therapies. A PubMed search of published data and reviews on preoperative approaches in diabetes was conducted. Consensus opinion drives most of the guidelines and recommendations for management of diabetes in surgical patients. Pathophysiology is often complex with varying levels of glucose and surgical stress. Establishing well-controlled diabetes prior to surgical intervention should be standard practice in non-emergent procedures. We review the best practices for implementing preoperative assessment, with diabetes with a focus on diabetes medications. The management of a patient preoperatively varies by region and country. Institutions differ in approaches to preoperative evaluation and the establishment of consistent approaches would provide a platform for monitoring patient outcomes.

34922848,Relation between diabetes related distress and glycemic control: The mediating effect of adherence to treatment.,"Diabetes related distress (DRD) is a negative emotional reaction to stresses associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) and its management. This study estimated the burden of DRD and self-reported adherence to treatment (SRAT) among patients with DM and investigated their relationship with glycemic control. A cross sectional study of consented 157 diabetics was conducted using the17-item Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS). It measures distress at four subscales: Emotional Burden (EB), Physician-related (PD), Regimen-related (RD) and Interpersonal Distress (ID). SRAT was assessed using Morisky's scale. Glycemic control was assessed using the most recent HbA1c results. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used for adjustment of confounders and bootstrap Confidence Interval was used to test for the occurrence of mediating effect. Average age was 44.5 Â± 16.0 years, 65% were females, 79% had type 2 DM and nearly 55% has had DM for more than 7 years and the average HbA1c was 8.9 Â± 2.2%. Clinically significant DRD was reported by 37% of the participants, EB and RD in 40.8%, PD in 46.5%, and ID among 32.5%. Younger patients showed higher level of stress compared to older participants and patients with type 1 DM showed higher level of stress in all DRD domains. Only 46% of patients were defined as having satisfactory SRAT and improvement of SRAT significantly enhanced the glycemic control (r = -0.32, p < 0.01). DRD and low SRAT negatively correlated with HbA1c; increasing the DRD by one point may increase the HbA1c on average by 0.41 (C.I. 0.02-0.80) and will indirectly raise the HbA1c by 0.24 (C.I. 0.04-0.47) through the mediating effect of low SRAT. DRD and low SRAT are commonly reported among DM patients and both are indirectly correlated. The mediating effect of low SRAT highlights the clinical role of DRD and clarifies the process by which distress affect the outcome of DM management.",Primary care diabetes,2022-Apr,"Fayed A, AlRadini F, Alzuhairi RM, Aljuhani AE, Alrashid HR, Alwazae MM, Alghamdi NR",7,1912,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

IR is involved in the progression of disease conditions such as steatosis and NASH, as well as hepatic fibrosis progression. The mechanisms underlying these processes involve genetic factors, hepatic fat accumulation, alterations in energy metabolism, and inflammatory signals derived from various cell types including immune cells. In NASH-associated fibrosis, the principal cell type responsible for extracellular matrix production is the hepatic stellate cell (HSC). HSC activation by IR involves ""direct"" and ""indirect"" pathways.

Baseline characteristics were comparable, albeit women in the PDM group arrived at medical attention significantly later, 55% after 15Â weeks gestation. Women with PDM needed significantly less treatment to achieve glycemic control and glycated hemoglobin remained lower throughout pregnancy. Maternal and fetal outcomes were similar between groups, although significantly higher rates of macrosomia and neonatal jaundice were observed in the T2DM group. The lack of clear guidelines causes a delay in the first prenatal visit of women with PDM. Comparable pregnancy outcomes may tip the balance toward acceptance of early treatment.

39137085,Towards Personalized AI-Based Diabetes Therapy: A Review.,"Insulin pumps and other smart devices have recently made significant advancements in the treatment of diabetes, a disorder that affects people all over the world. The development of medical AI has been influenced by AI methods designed to help physicians make diagnoses, choose a course of therapy, and predict outcomes. In this article, we thoroughly analyse how AI is being used to enhance and personalize diabetes treatment. The search turned up 77 original research papers, from which we've selected the most crucial information regarding the learning models employed, the data typology, the deployment stage, and the application domains. We identified two key trends, enabled mostly by AI: patient-based therapy personalization and therapeutic algorithm optimization. In the meanwhile, we point out various shortcomings in the existing literature, like a lack of multimodal database analysis or a lack of interpretability. The rapid improvements in AI and the expansion of the amount of data already available offer the possibility to overcome these difficulties shortly and enable a wider deployment of this technology in clinical settings.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2024-Nov,"Campanella S, Paragliola G, Cherubini V, Pierleoni P, Palma L",5,1146,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been developed to improve therapeutic outcomes due to their ease of engineering, surface functionalization, and therapeutic properties. In this review, we summarize the different synthesis methods of MOFs and conduct a comprehensive review of the latest research progress of MOFs in the treatment of diabetes and its wounds. State-of-the-art in vivo oral hypoglycemic strategies and the in vitro diagnosis of diabetes are enumerated and different antimicrobial strategies (including physical contact, oxidative stress, photothermal, and related ions or ligands) and provascular strategies for the treatment of diabetic wounds are compared. It focuses on the connections and differences between different applications of MOFs as well as possible directions for improvement.

When pregnancy is affected by diabetes, both mother and infant are at increased risk for multiple adverse outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach to care before, during, and after pregnancy is effective in reducing these risks. The PubMed database was searched for English language studies and guidelines relating to diabetes in pregnancy. The following search terms were used alone and in combination: diabetes, pregnancy, gestational diabetes, GDM, prepregnancy, and preconception. A date restriction was not applied. Results were reviewed by the authors and selected for inclusion based on relevance to the topic. Additional articles were identified by manually searching reference lists of included articles. Using data from this search we herein summarize the evidence relating to pathophysiology and management of diabetes in pregnancy. We discuss areas of controversy including the method and timing of diagnosis of GDM, and choice of pharmacologic agents to treat hyperglycemia during pregnancy.

Pre-existing type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Women with type 1 (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (T2DM) diagnosed prior to pregnancy are classified as having pre-existing diabetes mellitus (DM). The prevalence of hyperglycemia in pregnancy has been estimated at 17% globally and 5.4% in Europe, differences existing among racial and ethnic groups, following the prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Only a minority (approximately 15%) of the cases of diabetes during pregnancy represent women with pre-existing diabetes. Because of the rising prevalence of obesity and limited screening for diabetes in young women, there has been, globally, an increase in the diagnosis of previously unknown overt diabetes early in pregnancy; these women should be treated as women with pre-existing diabetes, as they may already have unrecognized complications (e.g., nephropathy and retinopathy).

35367028,Diabetes in Kidney Transplantation.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common complications after kidney transplantation and is associated with unfavorable outcomes including death. DM can be present before transplant but post-transplant DM (PTDM) refers to diabetes that is diagnosed after solid organ transplantation. Despite its high prevalence, optimal treatment to prevent complications of PTDM is unknown. Medical therapy of pre-existent DM or PTDM after transplant is challenging because of frequent interactions between antidiabetic and immunosuppressive agents. There is also frequent need for medication dose adjustments due to residual kidney disease and a higher risk of medication side effects in patients treated with immunosuppressive agents. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have demonstrated a favorable cardio-renal profile in patients with DM without a transplant and hence hold great promise in this patient population although there is concern about the higher risk of urinary tract infections. The significant gaps in our understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of DM after kidney transplantation need to be urgently addressed.",Advances in chronic kidney disease,2021-Nov,Martinez Cantarin MP,1,1153,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

32369830,Quality performance and associated factors in Swiss diabetes care - A cross-sectional study.,"Quality indicators and pay-for-performance schemes aim to improve processes and outcomes in clinical practice. However, general practitioner and patient characteristics influence quality indicator performance. In Switzerland, no data on the pay-for-performance approach exists and the use of quality indicators has been marginal. The aim of this study was to describe quality indicator performance in diabetes care in Swiss primary care and to analyze associations of practice, general practitioner and patient covariates with quality indicator performance. For this cross-sectional study, we used medical routine data from an electronic medical record database. Data from 71 general practitioners and all their patients with diabetes were included. Starting in July 2018, we retrieved 12-month retrospective data about practice, general practitioner and patient characteristics, laboratory values, comorbidities and co-medication. Based on this data, we assessed quality indicator performance of process and intermediate outcomes for glycated hemoglobin, blood pressure, cholesterol and associations of practice, general practitioner and patient characteristics with individual and cumulative quality indicator performance. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using regression methods. We assessed 3,383 patients with diabetes (57% male, mean age 68.3 years). On average, patients fulfilled 3.56 (standard deviation: 1.89) quality indicators, whereas 17.2% of the patients fulfilled all six quality indicators. On practice and general practitioner level, we found no associations with cumulative quality indicator performance. On patient level, gender (ref = male) (OR: 0.83, CI: 0.78-0.88), number of treating general practitioners (OR: 0.94, CI: 0.91-0.97), number of comorbidities (OR: 1.43, CI: 1.38-1.47) and number of consultations (OR: 1.02, CI: 1.02-1.02) were associated with cumulative quality indicator performance.

A total of 153 patients were included. The prevalence of underdiagnosis was 71.2 % for neuropathy and 59.5 % for peripheral arterial disease. Patients with a high foot risk level had more consultations in PC Nursing for foot-related issues (2022 y 2023; p=<0.001). The number of hospitalization days in 2022 was also higher in patients with a high foot risk. Patients with diagnosed neuropathy consistently utilized healthcare services more frequently than those with undiagnosed or no neuropathy across most categories.

31665258,Differential epigenetic factors in the prediction of cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients.,"Hyperglycaemia can strongly alter the epigenetic signatures in many types of human vascular cells providing persistent perturbations of protein-protein interactions both in micro- and macro-domains. The establishment of these epigenetic changes may precede cardiovascular (CV) complications and help us to predict vascular lesions in diabetic patients. Importantly, these epigenetic marks may be transmitted across several generations (transgenerational effect) and increase the individual risk of disease. Aberrant DNA methylation and imbalance of histone modifications, mainly acetylation and methylation of H3, represent key determinants of vascular lesions and, thus, putative useful biomarkers for prevention and diagnosis of CV risk in diabetics. Moreover, a differential expression of some micro-RNAs (miRNAs), mainly miR-126, may be a useful prognostic biomarker for atherosclerosis development in asymptomatic subjects. Recently, also environmental-induced chemical perturbations in mRNA (epitranscriptome), mainly the N6-methyladenosine, have been associated with obesity and diabetes. Importantly, reversal of epigenetic changes by modulation of lifestyle and use of metformin, statins, fenofibrate, and apabetalone may offer useful therapeutic options to prevent or delay CV events in diabetics increasing the opportunity for personalized therapy. Network medicine is a promising molecular-bioinformatic approach to identify the signalling pathways underlying the pathogenesis of CV lesions in diabetic patients. Moreover, machine learning tools combined with tomography are advancing the individualized assessment of CV risk in these patients. We remark the need for combining epigenetics and advanced bioinformatic platforms to improve the prediction of vascular lesions in diabetics increasing the opportunity for CV precision medicine.",European heart journal.

37863813,Copper and Diabetes: Current Research and Prospect.,"Copper is an essential trace metal for normal cellular functions; a lack of copper is reported to impair the function of important copper-binding enzymes, while excess copper could lead to cell death. Numerous studies have shown an association between dietary copper consumption or plasma copper levels and the incidence of diabetes/diabetes complications. And experimental studies have revealed multiple signaling pathways that are triggered by copper shortages or copper overload in diabetic conditions. Moreover, studies show that treated with copper chelators improve vascular function, maintain copper homeostasis, inhibit cuproptosis, and reduce cell toxicity, thereby alleviating diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiomyopathy. However, the mechanisms reported in these studies are inconsistent or even contradictory. This review summarizes the precise and tight regulation of copper homeostasis processes, and discusses the latest progress in the association of diabetes and dietary copper/plasma copper.

32874422,Imminent risk of COVID-19 in diabetes mellitus and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus patients.,"Diabetes mellitus is a non-infectious disease and has affected about 425 million adults globally and nearly 15.9 million of them reside in Africa. Moreover, the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus is very high in Africa and approximates to around 62%. Nearly 75% of the total deaths due to diabetes are in individuals lesser than 60 years of age. The multifaceted disease of diabetes mellitus produces chronic complications such as, neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, microangiopathy etc. These patients of diabetes mellitus are more susceptible to infections due to compromised immune system. Hence these patients of diabetes mellitus and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 infections. The dual impact of pathophysiology of COVID-19 infections in diabetes mellitus may increase morbidity and mortality in these patients. Hence there is need of health awareness in diabetics as well in the high-risk group for diabetes such as persons with hypertension and obesity. The scarcity of health resources, shortage of trained medical personnel and disease burden of infectious and non-infectious diseases has laid a heavy impact on the economy in Africa and this has been further strained due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The practice of preventive measures by the risk group of Undiagnosed Diabetes Mellitus patients will prevent them from getting infected by COVID-19 and at the same time decrease mortality rates and hence the undiscovered group that is the patients of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus needs to be vigilant regarding safe preventive practices.",The Pan African medical journal,2020-,"John JE, John NA",2,1601,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

All patients with T1DM or T2DM in secondary care (<i>n</i> = 5571) or tertiary care (<i>n</i> = 2001) were included. Statistical analyses were performed using linear mixed models. Diabetes duration increased in both patients with T1DM and T2DM in secondary care and tertiary care (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Patients in secondary care consistently showed good glycaemic control, while patients in tertiary care showed inadequate glycaemic control.

31876542,Diabetic Kidney Disease: Past and Present.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) afflicting humans has been recognized as a disease for >3000 years. However, very little was known about its etiology and pathogenesis until about a century ago when increasing knowledge about anatomy and physiology of the human body gradually led to our understanding that the hormone insulin produced by the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas plays a crucial role in the metabolism of glucose and maintaining the blood sugar level within a normal range. DM is caused by inadequate insulin production (type 1) or insulin resistance (type 2). For thousands of years, DM has been considered as a disease of the kidney; however, with the understanding of the pathogenesis of DM, it became clear that diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a complication and not a cause of DM. DKD is associated with increased matrix expansion that manifests morphologically as a diffuse or nodular expansion of the mesangium and diffuse thickening of the glomerular and tubular basement membranes. Hyperglycemia plays a crucial role in the development of pathologic changes within the kidney. Once established, DKD usually undergoes a slow but relentless progression to end-stage renal disease. However, recent studies have shown that its progression can be slowed or even reversed by strict control of hyperglycemia. Morphologically, DKD may resemble several other glomerular diseases that must be ruled out before a definitive diagnosis. Patients with DM may also develop nondiabetic glomerular or interstitial diseases with or without DKD.

Univariate and multivariate regression-based analyses were conducted to determine association of various risk factors and PTDM in the two cohorts, as well as differences in glucometrics and insulin use across time points. There was a higher incidence of PTDM among liver versus kidney transplant recipients (30% vs. 19%) at 1-year post-transplant. Liver transplant recipients demonstrated a 337% higher odds association to PTDM (OR 3.37, 95% CI (1.38-8.25), p<0.01). 1-month FBG was higher in kidney patients (135 mg/dL vs 104 mg/dL; p < .01), while 1-month insulin use was higher in liver patients (61% vs 27%, p < .01). Age, BMI, insulin use, and inpatient FBG were also significantly associated with differential PTDM risk. Kidney and liver transplant patients have different PTDM risk profiles, both in terms of absolute PTDM risk as well as time course of risk.

It is increasingly recognized that glycemic variability (GV), referring to oscillations in blood glucose levels and representing either short-term or long-term GV, is involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications and has emerged as a possible independent risk factor for them. In this review, we summarize the metrics and measurement of GV in clinical practice, as well as comprehensively elaborate the role and related mechanisms of GV in diabetic macrovascular and microvascular complications, aiming to provide the mechanism-based therapeutic strategies for clinicians to manage diabetes mellitus.",Cardiovascular diabetology,2021-Jan,"Sun B, Luo Z, Zhou J",3,722,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
37355725,"Cascade of diabetes care in Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal: identifying gaps in the screening, diagnosis, treatment and control continuum.","Diabetes has become a major cause of morbidity and mortality in South Asia. Using the data from the three STEPwise approach to Surveillance (STEPS) surveys conducted in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal during 2018-2019, this study tried to quantify the gaps in diabetes screening, awareness, treatment, and control in these three South Asian countries. Diabetes care cascade was constructed by decomposing the population with diabetes (diabetes prevalence) in each country into five mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories: (1) unscreened and undiagnosed, (2) screened but undiagnosed, (3) diagnosed but untreated, (4) treated but uncontrolled, (5) treated and controlled. In Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal, among the participants with diabetes, 14.7%, 35.7%, and 4.9% of the participants were treated and controlled, suggesting that 85.3%, 64.3%, and 95.1% of the diabetic population had unmet need for care, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to explore factors associated with awareness of the diabetes diagnosis. Common influencing factors for awareness of the diabetes diagnosis for Bangladesh and Nepal were living in urban areas [Bangladesh-adjusted odd ratio (AOR):2.1; confidence interval (CI):1.2, 3.6, Nepal-AOR:6.2; CI:1.9, 19.9].",Scientific reports,2023-Jun,"Islam MT, Bruce M, Alam K",3,1273,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Patients with diabetes (nâ=â15; 73.3% type 2) and their medical providers (nâ=â11) participated in qualitative interviews. Thematic content analysis was used to categorize results. Participants believed that mental health was important to address within comprehensive diabetes care. Patients expressed positive or neutral opinions about psychosocial screening. Providers had mixed reactions; many thought that screening would be too time-consuming. Both groups emphasized that screening must include referral procedures to direct patients to mental health services. Patients and providers interviewed in this study viewed psychosocial screening as compatible with diabetes care.

37473935,Efficacy and Safety of Pitavastatin in Patients with Impaired Glucose Tolerance: An Updated Review.,"This review provides an updated overview of the efficacy and safety of pitavastatin in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). IGT is a prediabetic state characterized by elevated blood glucose levels that do not meet the criteria for diabetes. The review explores the potential benefits of pitavastatin in reducing cardiovascular risk and improving lipid profiles in individuals with IGT. It also examines the glycemic effects of pitavastatin, including its impact on fasting blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, and beta-cell function. The review highlights the need for individualized treatment approaches, taking into account the patient's overall cardiovascular risk profile and glycemic control needs. While pitavastatin has shown modest improvements in glycemic control, it is not a substitute for lifestyle modifications or standard antidiabetic medications. Future directions for research include long-term follow-up studies, mechanistic investigations, and comparative analyses to further understand the glycemic effects of pitavastatin in IGT. Overall, this narrative review provides valuable insights for healthcare professionals involved in the management of individuals with IGT, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive approach to reduce cardiovascular risk and optimize glycemic control.",Current problems in cardiology,2023-Nov,"Arsh H, Ali A, Khenhrani RR, Simran F, Dino U, Tamang S, Manoj F, Bai S, Bai M, Panjwani GR, Kumar D, Rani D, Partab F, Malik J",14,1323,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
34166426,Machine learning-based glucose prediction with use of continuous glucose and physical activity monitoring data: The Maastricht Study.,"Closed-loop insulin delivery systems, which integrate continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and algorithms that continuously guide insulin dosing, have been shown to improve glycaemic control. The ability to predict future glucose values can further optimize such devices. In this study, we used machine learning to train models in predicting future glucose levels based on prior CGM and accelerometry data. We used data from The Maastricht Study, an observational population-based cohort that comprises individuals with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes. We included individuals who underwent >48h of CGM (n = 851), most of whom (n = 540) simultaneously wore an accelerometer to assess physical activity. A random subset of individuals was used to train models in predicting glucose levels at 15- and 60-minute intervals based on either CGM data or both CGM and accelerometer data. In the remaining individuals, model performance was evaluated with root-mean-square error (RMSE), Spearman's correlation coefficient (rho) and surveillance error grid. For a proof-of-concept translation, CGM-based prediction models were optimized and validated with the use of data from individuals with type 1 diabetes (OhioT1DM Dataset, n = 6). Models trained with CGM data were able to accurately predict glucose values at 15 (RMSE: 0.19mmol/L; rho: 0.96) and 60 minutes (RMSE: 0.59mmol/L, rho: 0.72). Model performance was comparable in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Incorporation of accelerometer data only slightly improved prediction. The error grid results indicated that model predictions were clinically safe (15 min: >99%, 60 min >98%). Our prediction models translated well to individuals with type 1 diabetes, which is reflected by high accuracy (RMSEs for 15 and 60 minutes of 0.43 and 1.73 mmol/L, respectively) and clinical safety (15 min: >99%, 60 min: >91%). Machine learning-based models are able to accurately and safely predict glucose values at 15- and 60-minute intervals based on CGM data only.

32359350,Prognostic importance of visit-to-visit blood pressure variability for micro- and macrovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes: The Rio de Janeiro Type 2 Diabetes Cohort Study.,"The prognostic importance of an increased visit-to-visit blood pressure variability (BP-VVV) for the future development of micro- and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes has been scarcely investigated and is largely unsettled. We aimed to evaluate it in a prospective long-term follow-up study with 632 individuals with type 2 diabetes. BP-VVV parameters (systolic and diastolic standard deviations [SD] and variation coefficients) were measured during the first 24-months. Multivariate Cox analysis, adjusted for risk factors and mean BP levels, examined the associations between BP-VVV and the occurrence of microvascular (retinopathy, microalbuminuria, renal function deterioration, peripheral neuropathy) and macrovascular complications (total cardiovascular events [CVEs], major adverse CVEs [MACE] and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality). Improvement in risk discrimination was assessed by the C-statistic and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) index. Over a median follow-up of 11.3Â years, 162 patients had a CVE (132 MACE), and 212 patients died (95 from cardiovascular diseases); 153 newly-developed or worsened diabetic retinopathy, 193 achieved the renal composite outcome (121 newly-developed microalbuminuria and 95 deteriorated renal function), and 171 newly-developed or worsened peripheral neuropathy. Systolic BP-VVV was an independent predictor of MACE (hazard ratio: 1.25, 95% CI 1.03-1.51 for a 1-SD increase in 24-month SD), but not of total CVEs, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and of any microvascular outcome. However, no BP-VVV parameter significantly improved cardiovascular risk discrimination (increase in C-statistic 0.001, relative IDI 0.9%). Systolic BP-VVV was an independent predictor of MACE, but it did not improve cardiovascular risk stratification. The goal of anti-hypertensive treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes shall remain in controlling mean BP levels, not on decreasing their visit-to-visit variability.",Cardiovascular diabetology,2020-May,"Cardoso CRL, Leite NC, Salles GF",3,1987,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The relationship between new DM diagnosis and cardiovascular risk remains unclear to date. We performed post hoc analysis using the data of participants from the Prevention of Cardiovascular events in iSchemic Stroke patients with high risk of cerebral hemOrrhage (PICASSO) trial. Newly diagnosed DM was defined as HbA1c ofââ¥â6.5% without known DM history. The outcome was the incidence of composite cardiovascular events, including stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic), myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death.

At study termination after three years, there was a significantly less of an increase in insulin resistance in LI compared with the CAU group. The aim of this extended follow-up was to investigate whether positive results concerning metabolic variables remained five years after study termination. All participants from the original study were contacted for a new follow-up with an oral glucose tolerance test, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure and blood samples. Questionnaires about lifestyle were completed. A total of 69 of the original 123 participants were examined, and personal data for another five participants were collected from the medical charts (n = 74). The LI group showed a decrease in diastolic blood pressure (-4 mmHg, CI 95% 0.8-6.8, p = 0.014) and body weight (-3 kg, CI 95% 1.2-4.9, p = 0.002) since base-line. Weight loss in the LI group was significantly greater compared with weight loss in the CAU group (-3 kg, CI 0.1-5.9, p = 0.044). Insulin resistance markers and incident T2DM were similar among the groups.

38060094,The Emerging Role of Prediabetes and Its Management: Focus on L-Arginine and a Survey in Clinical Practice.,"The worldwide impressive growth of metabolic disorders observed in the last decades, especially type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, has generated great interest in the potential benefits of early identification and management of patients at risk. In this view, prediabetes represents a high-risk condition for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases, and an ideal target to intercept patients before they develop type 2 diabetes gaining a prominent role even in international guidelines. For prediabetic individuals, lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of diabetes prevention, with evidence of about 50% relative risk reduction. Accumulating data also show potential benefits from pharmacotherapy. In this context, the only available data pertain to metformin as a pharmaceutical drug and vitamin D and L-arginine as nutraceuticals. L-arginine appears to be a very interesting tool in the clinical management of patients with pre-diabetes. In this review we summarize the current knowledge on the role of L-arginine in prediabetes as a potentially useful preventive strategy against the progression to type 2 diabetes, with a particular focus on the underlying molecular mechanisms and the past and ongoing trials. In this article we also report the interesting data about the perception of the prediabetic condition and its therapeutic management in the clinical practice in Italy.

The study included a total of 15,000 participants aged 20Â years or older; 10,000 were from rural agricultural areas and 5000 were from rural desert areas in Egypt. The prevalence of DM and impaired fasting glucose for each group was recorded, participants were interviewed, medical history was obtained, physical examinations were performed, and fasting plasma glucose was used for diagnosis of DM and IFG using American Diabetes Association criteria. The prevalence of DM was 12.7% in agricultural areas and 4.7% in desert areas. The prevalence of newly diagnosed cases was 15.8% and 9.9% in agricultural and desert areas, respectively. The prevalence of IFG was 11.14% in agricultural and 8.04% in desert areas. These results suggest that living in a rural area makes patients at a higher risk of developing DM (ORâ=â2.968 CI (2.570-3.428) pâ<â0.001) and IFG (ORâ=â1.43, CI (1.272-1.616), pâ<â0.001).

Furthermore, diabetic nephropathy (DN), a common complication in DM, is strongly associated with LV longitudinal myocardial function in T2DM patients, but its association with type 1 DM (T1DM) has not been fully investigated. We studied 125 asymptomatic T1DM patients with preserved LVEF, and 75 age-, gender-, LVEF-matched non-diabetic healthy controls. Two-dimensional speckle-tracking strain LV was used to assess longitudinal myocardial function as global longitudinal strain (GLS). GLS of T1DM patients was significantly lower than that of normal controls (19.7âÂ±â3.6% vs. 20.6âÂ±â1.8%, Pâ=â0.049).

Food insecurity, or the inability to consistently obtain nutritious food, disproportionately affects socioeconomically disadvantaged households, as well as those with chronic diseases including diabetes mellitus (DM). This review article explores the literature over the past 10âyears pertaining to the complex relationship between food insecurity, social determinants of health, and chronic disease with an emphasis on diabetes and glycemic control. Those with diabetes and food insecurity together have been shown to have worse glycemic control compared to those who are food secure, but it remains unclear exactly how food insecurity affects glycemic control. Prior interventional studies have targeted aspects of food insecurity in patients with diabetes but have reported variable outcomes with respect to improvement in glycemic control despite effectively reducing rates of food insecurity. Additionally, few data exist regarding long-term outcomes and diabetes-related complications in this population. It is likely that many factors at both the community and individual levels impact glycemic control outcomes in the setting of food insecurity. Further studies are needed to better understand these factors and to create multifaceted targets for future interventional studies aimed at improving glycemic control in this population.",Journal of diabetes,2020-Mar,"Flint KL, Davis GM, Umpierrez GE",3,1507,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The FPP implementation increased the screening (ATTâ=â36%, 95% CI: (27%, 45%), P-valueâ<â0.001) and the control of hypertension (ATTâ=â26%, 95% CI: (1%, 52%), P-valueâ=â0.03) based on 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines that these results were in keeping with JNC7. There was no causal effect in other indexes, such as prevalence, awareness, and treatment. The DM screening (ATTâ=â20%, 95% CI: (6%, 34%), P-valueâ=â0.004) and awareness (ATTâ=â14%, 95% CI: (1%, 27%), P-valueâ=â0.042) were significantly increased among FPP administered region. However, the treatment of HTN decreased (ATTâ=â-32%, 95% CI: (-59%, -5%), P-valueâ=â0.012). This study has identified some limitations related to the FPP in managing HTN and DM, and presented solutions to solve them in two general categories.

37069711,Review on <i>In-vitro</i> Techniques and <i>In-vivo</i> Animals Models for Screening Diabetes and Diabetic Complications.,"Diabetes mellitus is a type of metabolic disorders. Various pharmaceutical interventions and animal models have been used to investigate the genetic, environmental, and etiological aspects of diabetes and its effects. In recent years for the development of ant-diabetic remedies, numerous novel genetically modified animals, pharmaceutical substances, medical techniques, viruses, and hormones have been developed to screen diabetic complications. A unique disease-treating drug with new properties is still being sought after. The current review tried to include all published models and cutting-edge techniques. Experimental induction of diabetes mellitus in animal models and <i>in vitro </i> methods are essential for advancing our knowledge, a thorough grasp of pathophysiology, and the creation of novel therapeutics. Animal models and <i>in vitro</i> techniques are necessary to develop innovative diabetic medications. New approaches and additional animal models are required for diabetes research to advance. This is particularly true for models produced <i>via</i> dietary modifications, which have various macronutrient compositions. In this article, we review the rodent models of diet-induced diabetic peripheral neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic nephropathy and critically compare the key characteristics of these micro-vascular complications in humans and the diagnostic criteria with the parameters used in preclinical research using rodent models, taking into consideration the potential need for factors that can accelerate or aggravate these conditions.",Current diabetes reviews,2024-,"Shivam, Kumar S, Gupta AK",3,1585,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
37055265,"Prevalence, clinical features and complications of common forms of Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) seen at a tertiary diabetes centre in south India.","Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is a form of monogenic diabetes caused by mutations in single genes, affecting adolescents or young adults. MODY is frequently misdiagnosed as type 1 diabetes (T1). Though several studies from India have reported on the genetic aspects of MODY, the clinical profile, complications and treatments given have not been reported so far, nor compared with T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D). To determine the prevalence, clinical features, and complications of common forms of genetically proven MODY seen at a tertiary diabetes centre in South India and compare them with matched individuals with T1D and T2D. Five hundred and thirty individuals identified as 'possible MODY' based on clinical criteria, underwent genetic testing for MODY. Diagnosis of MODY was confirmed based on pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants found using Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) and American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) criteria. The clinical profile of MODY was compared with individuals with type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes, matched for duration of diabetes. Retinopathy was diagnosed by retinal photography; nephropathy by urinary albumin excretion >Â 30Â Âµg/mg of creatinine and neuropathy by vibration perception threshold >Â 20Â v on biothesiometry. Fifty-eight patients were confirmed to have MODY (10.9%). HNF1A-MODY (nÂ =Â 25) was the most common subtype followed by HNF4A-MODY (nÂ =Â 11), ABCC8-MODY (nÂ =Â 11), GCK-MODY (nÂ =Â 6) and HNF1B-MODY (nÂ =Â 5). For comparison of clinical profile, only the three 'actionable' subtypes - defined as those who may respond to sulphonylureas, namely, HNF1A, HNF4A and ABCC8-MODY, were included. Age at onset of diabetes was lower among HNF4A-MODY and HNF1A-MODY than ABCC8-MODY, T1D and T2D. Prevalence of retinopathy and nephropathy was higher among the three MODY subtypes taken together (nÂ =Â 47) as compared to T1D (nÂ =Â 86) and T2D (nÂ =Â 86). This is one of the first reports of MODY subtypes from India based on ACMG and gnomAD criteria. The high prevalence of retinopathy and nephropathy in MODY points to the need for earlier diagnosis and better control of diabetes in individuals with MODY.",Primary care diabetes,2023-Aug,"Aarthy R, Aston-Mourney K, Amutha A, Mikocka-Walus A, Anjana RM, Unnikrishnan R, Jebarani S, Venkatesan U, Gopi S, Radha V, Mohan V",11,2175,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

38928130,Targeting Protein Kinases to Protect Beta-Cell Function and Survival in Diabetes.,"The prevalence of diabetes is increasing worldwide. Massive death of pancreatic beta-cells causes type 1 diabetes. Progressive loss of beta-cell function and mass characterizes type 2 diabetes. To date, none of the available antidiabetic drugs promotes the maintenance of a functional mass of endogenous beta-cells, revealing an unmet medical need. Dysfunction and apoptotic death of beta-cells occur, in particular, through the activation of intracellular protein kinases. In recent years, protein kinases have become highly studied targets of the pharmaceutical industry for drug development. A number of drugs that inhibit protein kinases have been approved for the treatment of cancers. The question of whether safe drugs that inhibit protein kinase activity can be developed and used to protect the function and survival of beta-cells in diabetes is still unresolved. This review presents arguments suggesting that several protein kinases in beta-cells may represent targets of interest for the development of drugs to treat diabetes.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024-Jun,Dalle S,1,1039,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

We aimed to evaluate the relationship between dietary and physical activity-based lifestyle intervention and cancer outcomes among prediabetes and T2D populations. We searched for randomized controlled trials with at least 24 months of lifestyle interventions in prediabetes or T2D populations. Data were extracted by pairs of reviewers and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Descriptive syntheses were performed, and the risk of bias was assessed. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using a pairwise meta-analysis with both a random-effects model and a general linear mixed model (GLMM). Certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework, and trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted to assess if current information is enough for definitive conclusions. Subgroup analysis was performed by glycemic status. Six clinical trials were included. Among 12 841 participants, the combined RR for cancer mortality comparing lifestyle interventions with usual care was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.81-1.10 using GLMM and 0.82-1.09 using random-effects model). Most studies had a low risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence was moderate. TSA showed that the cumulative Z curve reached futility boundary while total number did not reach detection boundary. Based on the limited data available, dietary and physical activity-based lifestyle interventions had no superiority to usual care on reducing cancer risk in populations with prediabetes and T2D.

The molecular mechanism involves the sensing of glucose flux by the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, which leads to the adjustment of cellular metabolism to protect against changes in the environment of each organ through O-GlcNAcylation. More recently, not only glucose, but also fluxes of amino acids and fatty acids have been reported to induce O-GlcNAcylation, affecting multiple cellular processes. In this review, we discuss how O-GlcNAcylation maintains homeostasis in organs that are affected by diabetes mellitus: skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver and pancreatic Î²-cells. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of O-GlcNAcylation in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications.

Self-management training and education of diabetes are critical in diabetes care and management. It is essential that patients with diabetes must have a comprehensive understanding of the nature of the disease, risk factors, complications, and possible treatment modalities to attenuate the complications. Over the last few years, DM in Saudi Arabia has been rapidly growing at an alarming rate. It has affected around one-fifth of the adult population, and by 2030, the numbers are predicted to rise further and exceed more than double the present number. An estimated tenfold increase has been reported over the past three decades in Saudi Arabia. However, there has not been much research focusing on understanding the knowledge and awareness of DM in Saudi Arabia as compared to developed nations. This review aims to present an overview of the current knowledge and awareness level of DM among the population of Saudi Arabia through an extensive review of the currently available literature.

31676569,CTRP13 Preserves Endothelial Function by Targeting GTP Cyclohydrolase 1 in Diabetes.,"Endothelial dysfunction plays a crucial role in the progress of diabetic vasculopathy. C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein 13 (CTRP13) is a secreted adipokine that can ameliorate atherosclerosis and vascular calcification. However, the role of CTRP13 in regulating endothelial function in diabetes has yet to be explored. In this study, CTRP13 treatment improved endothelium-dependent relaxation in the aortae and mesenteric arteries of both <i>db/db</i> mice and streptozotocin-injected mice. CTRP13 supplement also rescued the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation ex vivo in the <i>db/db</i> mouse aortae and in high glucose (HG)-treated mouse aortae. Additionally, CTRP13 treatment reduced reactive oxygen species overproduction and improved nitric oxide (NO) production and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) coupling in the aortae of diabetic mice and in HG-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Mechanistically, CTRP13 could increase GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) expression and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) levels to ameliorate eNOS coupling. More importantly, CTRP13 rescued HG-induced inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) activity. Increased PKA activity enhanced phosphorylation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î± and its recruitment to the GCH1 promoter, thus activating GCH1 transcription and, ultimately, endothelial relaxation. Together, these results suggest that CTRP13 preserves endothelial function in diabetic mice by regulating GCH1/BH4 axis-dependent eNOS coupling, suggesting the therapeutic potential of CTRP13 against diabetic vasculopathy.",Diabetes,2020-Jan,"Wang C, Chao Y, Xu W, Liang M, Deng S, Zhang D, Huang K",7,1593,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

In this cross-sectional study, complications of diabetes, including coronary artery disease (CAD), retinopathy, neuropathy and diabetic kidney disease (DKD), were evaluated in 1867 participants with T2D. Additionally, baseline characteristics of the individuals, including anthropometric measurements, metabolic parameters and the use of dyslipidaemia drugs and antihyperglycaemic agents, were assessed. Gender differences in complications were examined using the chi-squared test. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to investigate the relationship between gender and T2D complications, with and without adjusting for the characteristics of the studied population. In the studied population, 62.1% had at least one complication, and complications were 33.5% for DKD, 29.6% for CAD, 22.9% for neuropathy and 19.1% for retinopathy. The prevalence of CAD and neuropathy was higher in men. However, DKD and retinopathy were more prevalent among women. Odds ratios of experiencing any complication, CAD and retinopathy in men compared with women were 1.57 (95% CI: 1.27-2.03), 2.27 (95% CI: 1.72-2.99) and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.52-0.98), respectively, after adjusting for demographic factors, anthropometric measures, metabolic parameters and the consumption of dyslipidaemia drugs and antihyperglycaemic agents. The prevalence of diabetes complications was significantly higher in men with diabetes, highlighting the need for better treatment adherence. CAD was associated with the male gender, whereas retinopathy was associated with the female gender. Men and women with diabetes should be monitored closely for CAD and retinopathy, respectively, regardless of their age, diabetes duration, anthropometric measures, laboratory findings and medications.","Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism",2024-May,"Mokhtarpour K, Yadegar A, Mohammadi F, Aghayan SN, Seyedi SA, Rabizadeh S, Esteghamati A, Nakhjavani M",8,1939,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

An evaluation of the role of heredity for the development of diabetic retinopathy may help adjusting control intervals in screening program to each patient's individual risk profile.<b>Methods:</b> Survival analysis was used to study whether family history of diabetes among men and women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes together with the degree of heredity could be added as risk factors to improve the prediction of the risk for developing proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and diabetic macular edema (DME). The study was conducted on data from 12,281 patients followed in the Aarhus area, Denmark, from 1 January 2003 to 1 July 2019.<b>Results:</b> The risk for developing PDR was significantly reduced 2-11âyears after known onset of diabetes in the presence of female family members with type 1 diabetes, and the risk for developing DME significantly increased 4-24âyears after onset of diabetes in the presence of family members with type 2 diabetes of any sex. These hereditary factors were independent of other studied risk factors such as previous cataract surgery, age of onset of diabetes, metabolic regulation and blood pressure.<b>Conclusions:</b> The presence of family members with diabetes affects the risk for developing vision threatening diabetic retinopathy and affects the risk for developing PDR and DME differently. This evidence may help individualizing the control intervals in screening programmes for diabetic retinopathy.",Current eye research,2022-Sep,Bek T,1,1650,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
32616274,Language Matters - A Diabetes Canada Consensus Statement.,"Language reflects and shapes our thoughts, feelings, behaviours and experiences and can have a profound impact on the lives of people with and at risk for diabetes. Inappropriate language has a negative impact on self-efficacy, well-being and confidence of people living with diabetes, can seriously undermine experiences with health-care providers and, more broadly, can contribute to diabetes stigma. To date, Diabetes Canada has had no formal position to facilitate positive and affirming attitudes towards diabetes, which is reflected by the use of more appropriate language around diabetes. This consensus statement was developed by Diabetes Canada, by a working group comprised of health-care professionals and lived experience subject matter experts (LESME: patient partners) and validated by volunteers from Diabetes Canada's Professional Section and Diabetes Action Canada's Patient Circles. The principles outlined in this document will be valuable in three broad domains: 1) Diabetes Canada's internal and external communications, 2) increasing public awareness of diabetes and reduction of stigma around diabetes and 3) enhancing the health, wellness and self-efficacy of persons living with diabetes. A major strategy to effect change in this third domain will be to disseminate these concepts broadly among all current (and future) health-care professionals to help integrate positive and supportive attitudes in everyday clinical practice.",Canadian journal of diabetes,2020-Jul,"Banasiak K, Cleary D, Bajurny V, Barbieri P, Nagpal S, Sorensen M, Tabiou N, Witteman H, Senior P",9,1454,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Despite the Indonesian Government's ongoing effort to impose regulation for collaborative TB-DM management, the involvement of private primary care providers (PPCs) has not been considered before the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to capture the PPCs' existing practices and explore their challenges, opportunities, and potential roles in the collaborative TB-DM services and control. A descriptive qualitative research design was used to collect data. Two Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 13 healthcare workers (HCWs) from different private clinics and eight private/solo general practitioners (GPs) from Yogyakarta City, Indonesia. We triangulated these data with data from FGDs of HCWs community health centers (CHCs) and in-depth interviews of three regional health regulators, five hospitals staff members, and a representative of national health insurance. The discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and subjected to thematic analysis. PPCs have not been initiated into the implementation of the collaborative TB-DM programme. The themes identified in this study were health system-related barriers, knowledge and perception of HCWs, lack of implementation of bi-directional screening, and needs of multisector role. The potential roles identified for PPCs include involvement in health promotion, bi-directional screening, patient referral, and data reporting according to the TB-DM programme indicators. However, more thorough improvement of PPCs' capacity and logistic supplies are needed to provide comprehensive TB treatment. Although PPCs' involvement in implementing collaborative TB-DM services has yet to be considered, their potential role should not be neglected. Therefore, it is essential to increase their involvement by enhancing their capacity and improving the Public-Private Mix. PPCs' engagement should be initiated and maintained to ensure the sustainability of the programme.",BMC health services research,2022-Feb,"Arini M, Sugiyo D, Permana I",3,2044,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

However, there is limited collaboration and referrals between these two groups of health professionals. To investigate whether diabetic providers are addressing the importance of oral care in the management of diabetes and whether dental care providers are advising their patients with diabetes about the importance of glycaemic control. Descriptive statistics was used to report data collected from 720 patients with diabetes using a closed-end questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis revealed the factors significantly impacting whether participants received advice from healthcare providers. The majority of participants did not receive advice from either diabetes (84%) or dental (75%) care providers regarding the reciprocal nature of diabetes and periodontitis. The factors significantly affecting receiving advice from diabetes care providers were place of residence (pÂ =Â 0.003), self-reported type of diabetes (pÂ =Â 0.000) receiving advice from dental care providers (pÂ =Â 0.000); from dental care providers - education (pÂ =Â 0.020), place of residence (pÂ =Â 0.004), the number of years since diagnosis of diabetes (pÂ =Â 0.002), frequency of dental visits (pÂ =Â 0.000) and receiving advice from diabetes care providers (pÂ =Â 0.000).

Investigating the risk factors for cardiocerebrovascular disease (CCVD) will guide strategies for reducing CCVD in patients with PA. We retrospectively included 729 PA patients without DM and conducted oral glucose tolerance tests. We found that 15.0% of PA patients had newly diagnosed DM. The DM prevalence increased with elevated aldosterone levels [ORâ=â3.20 (1.77, 5.78), P valueâ<â0.001]. The rate of CCVD in newly diagnosed diabetic PA patients was higher than that in nondiabetic PA patients at diagnosis (11.9% vs. 5.0%, Pâ=â0.005). Furthermore, multivariate logistic analysis revealed that HT duration [1.055 (1.002,1.111), Pâ=â0.041] and newly diagnosed DM [2.600 (1.072,6.303), Pâ=â0.034] were significantly associated with CCVD in PA patients. The prevalence of newly diagnosed DM in PA patients was higher than that in the general population. Aldosterone level was an independent risk factor for DM not for CCVD. CCVD was correlated with longer HT duration and newly diagnosed DM. Therefore, it is crucial to screen DM at the diagnosis in PA patients.",Endocrine,2022-Sep,"Zhang C, Jiang Y, Su T, Jiang L, Zhou W, Zhong X, Wu L, Wang W",8,1204,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

We used data from the nationwide survey ""Disease knowledge and information needs-Diabetes mellitus 2017"", which included a total of 1396 participants diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (diabetes; n = 394 DSME-participants, n = 1002 DSME-never-participants). Analyses used weighted logistic or multinominal regression analyses with bivariate and multivariable approaches. Participants were more likely to attend DSME if they had a medium (OR 1.82 [95%CI 1.21-2.73]),or high (OR 2.04 [95%CI 1.30-3.21]) level of education, had type 1 diabetes (OR 2.46 [1.24-4.90]) and insulin treatment (OR 1.96 [95%CI 1.33-2.90]). Participants were less likely to attend DSME if they lived in East Germany (OR 0.57 [95%CI 0.39-0.83]), had diabetes for >2 to 5 years (OR 0.52 [95%CI 0.31-0.88] compared to >5 years), did not agree that diabetes is a lifelong disease (OR 0.30 [95%CI 0.15-0.62], had never been encouraged by their physician to attend DSME (OR 0.19 [95%CI 0.13-0.27]) and were not familiar with disease management programs (OR 0.67 [95%CI 0.47-0.96]).

We describe our initial approach to selecting a national DKA prevention strategy, to be implemented by the Canadian Pediatric Endocrine Group DKA Prevention Working Group, informed by a framework for behavior change interventions. Existing interventions were identified from a systematic review and our own gray literature search. We then characterized interventions using the Behavior Change Wheel, a framework to inform and drive behavior change, and matched interventions to behavioral targets, audiences, and identified barriers and facilitators. Feedback from the CPEG DKA prevention working group was incorporated into the intervention plan. We identified 27 interventions. Our proposed target behaviors are: (1) prompt recognition of symptoms of diabetes in children; (2) urgent attendance to medical care with a request for an office-based test for diabetes; and (3) rapid confirmation of diagnosis and urgent consultation with pediatric diabetes experts. We initially identified four possible intervention functions including education, training, environment restructuring, and enablement. Feedback from the working group favored education intervention functions including symptom recognition messages targeting parents, caregivers, teachers, and providers and messages about how to make a rapid diagnosis and need for urgent referral targeting providers. The Behavior Change Wheel has been used successfully in selecting interventions in other clinical areas.

Macrophages are crucial effector cells that play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of diabetic wounds, through their polarization into distinct functional phenotypes. The field of epigenetics has emerged as a rapidly advancing research area, as this phenomenon has the potential to markedly affect gene expression, cellular differentiation, tissue development and susceptibility to disease. Understanding epigenetic mechanisms is crucial to further exploring disease pathogenesis. A growing body of scientific evidence has highlighted the pivotal role of epigenetics in the regulation of macrophage phenotypes. Various epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modification and nonâcoding RNAs, are involved in the modulation of macrophage phenotype differentiation in response to the various environmental stimuli present in diabetic wounds. The present review provided an overview of the various changes that take place in macrophage phenotypes and functions within diabetic wounds and discussed the emerging role of epigenetic modifications in terms of regulating macrophage plasticity in diabetic wounds.

37274323,A provider survey of cystic fibrosis related diabetes screening and management practices at North American CF centers.,"Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Guidelines recommend annual screening for cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). However, screening rates remain consistently low. We conducted surveys of 1) US CF center directors and 2) Endocrinologists affiliated with the CFF-sponsored EnVision program to characterize CFRD screening practices, describe provider perceived barriers to screening, and identify strategies for improving screening. The surveys queried OGTT protocols, alternate screening strategies, and perceived barriers to screening. CF center characteristics and procedures for coordinating OGTTs were compared between centers achieving â¥50% versus <50% OGTT completion. Endocrinologists received additional questions regarding OGTT interpretation and management. The survey response rate was 18% (51/290) from CF Centers and 63% (25/40) from Endocrinologists. The majority (57%) of CF centers utilized 2 OGTT timepoints (0,120 min). The majority (72%) of Endocrinologists utilized 3 timepoints (0,60,120 min). Four percent of CF centers and 8% of Endocrinologists utilized other timepoints. Forty-nine percent of CF centers reported â¥50% OGTT completion in the past year. Completion of â¥50% OGTT was 5 times more likely when patient reminders were consistently provided (p = 0.017). Both CF Centers and Endocrinologists employed alternative screening strategies including HbA1c (64%, 92%), fasting plasma glucose (49%, 67%), continuous glucose monitoring (30%, 58%), and home fingerstick monitoring (55%, 50%). OGTT is the gold standard screening method for CFRD, but completion rates remain suboptimal, practice variation exists, and many providers utilize alternate screening strategies. Systematic reminders may improve completion rates.

This study aimed to assess the worldwide prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. We systematically searched electronic databases for relevant studies published from inception to 01 January 2022. Selected studies reported the prevalence of DR among patients with newly diagnosed T2DM, specifying the case definition used. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to derive the pooled prevalence. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were used to investigate variations in the prevalence estimates in terms of available variables. Data from 77 studies including 99,847 patients with newly diagnosed T2DM were included from 26 countries. The pooled prevalence of DR among patients with newly diagnosed T2DM was 13.1% (95% CI, 11.1%-15.1%; I<sup>2</sup> Â =Â 97.0%). DR was higher in clinic-based samples compared with community-based samples (15.0%, 95% CIÂ =Â 12.4%-17.8% vs. 11.5%, 95% CIÂ =Â 8.9%-14.5%; pÂ =Â 0.05; I<sup>2</sup> Â =Â 97.0%) and was higher in countries in the WHO African 19.2% (95% CI, 14.6%-24.3%; I<sup>2</sup> Â =Â 76.0%), South-East Asia 15.4% (95% CI, 10.0%-21.6%; I<sup>2</sup> Â =Â 79.1%), and European 15.0% (95% CI, 11.2%-19.2%; I<sup>2</sup> Â =Â 82.0%) regions.

We examined whether SIM implementation between 2013 and 2017 was associated with diagnosed diabetes prevalence or with hospitalization or 30-day readmission rate among diagnosed adults. The quasiexperimental design compared study outcomes before and after the SIM initiative in 12 SIM states versus five comparison states using difference-in-differences (DiD) regression models of 21,055,714 hospitalizations for adults age â¥18 years diagnosed with diabetes in 889 counties from 2010 to 2017 across the 17 states. For readmission analyses, comparative interrupted time series (CITS) models included 11,812,993 hospitalizations from a subset of nine states. Diagnosed diabetes prevalence changes were not significantly different between SIM states and comparison states. Hospitalization rates were inconsistent across models, with DiD estimates ranging from -5.34 to -0.37 and from -13.16 to 0.92, respectively. CITS results indicate that SIM states had greater increases in odds of 30-day readmission during SIM implementation compared with comparison states (round 1: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.07; 95% CI 1.04, 1.11; P < 0.001; round 2: AOR 1.06; 95% CI 1.03, 1.10; P = 0.001). The SIM initiative was not sufficiently focused to have a population-level effect on diabetes detection or management.

32156282,Health-related quality of life and associated factors among patients with diabetes mellitus at the University of Gondar referral hospital.,"Diabetes mellitus, which has a wide range of effects on the physical, social and psychological aspects of the well-being of a person, is a common and challenging chronic disease that causes a significant rate of morbidity and mortality. However, studies in our country, by and large, focused on the impact of the disease in terms of mortality and morbidity alone. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and associated factors of diabetic patients at the University of Gondar referral hospital, Ethiopia. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted at the University of Gondar referral hospital from April to May 2017. A generic World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to measure the HRQOL. The data were analyzed by Stata version 12. Multiple Linear Regression analysis with P-value 0.05 was used to measure the degree of association between HRQOL and independent variables. A total of 408 patients with Diabetes Mellitus were included in the study. The HRQOL scores for physical, psychological, social and environmental domains were 50.9, 54.5, 55.8 and 47.3, respectively. Diabetes-related complications had a significant association with all except the psychological domain. Higher HRQOL was associated with exercising, following the recommended diet, foot care, sensible drinking and the absence of co-morbidities. However, old age, unemployment and being single and widower had a significant association with lower HRQOL. The environmental and physical domains of HRQOL scores were the lowest compared to the social and psychological domains. Old age and living inÂ rural areaÂ had a significant association with a lower HRQOL, whereas the absence of diabetes-related complications, exercising, general diet and foot care had a significant association with better HRQOL of patients. Therefore, strong advice on the recommended lifestyle is important, and old patients and rural dwellers should get due attention. In addition, the prevention of diabetes-related complications is important to improve the patient HRQOL which is an important outcome measurement from the patient's perspective related to the impact of the disease. Therefore, including HRQOL assessment as part of routine management is necessary.",Health and quality of life outcomes,2020-Mar,"Aschalew AY, Yitayal M, Minyihun A",3,2317,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

33709795,Feasibility of Spotlight Consultations Tool in Routine Care: Real-World Evidence.,"Burnout in people with diabetes and healthcare professionals (HCPs) is at an all-time high. Spotlight AQ, a novel ""smart"" adaptive patient questionnaire, is designed to improve consultations by rapidly identifying patient priorities and presenting these in the context of best-practice care pathways to aid consultations. We aimed to determine Spotlight AQ's feasibility in routine care. The Spotlight prototype tool was trialed at three centers: two UK primary care centers and one US specialist center (June-September 2020). Participants with type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) completed the questionnaire prior to their routine consultations. Results were immediately available and formed the basis of the clinical discussion and decision-making within the clinic visit. A convenience sample of 49 adults took part, <i>n</i>=31 T1D, (<i>n</i>=18 female); and <i>n</i>=18 T2D (<i>n</i>=10 male, <i>n</i>=4 female, <i>n</i>=4 gender unreported). Each identified two priority concerns. ""Psychological burden of diabetes"" was the most common priority concern (T1D <i>n =</i> 27, 87.1%) followed by ""gaining more skills about particular aspects of diabetes"" (T1D <i>n</i>=19, 61.3%), ""improving support around me"" (<i>n</i>=8, 25.8%) and ""diabetes-related treatment issues"" (<i>n</i>=8, 25.8%). Burden of diabetes was widespread as was lack of confidence around self-management. Similarly, psychological burden of diabetes was the primary concern for participants with T2D (<i>n</i>=18,100%) followed by ""gaining more skills about aspects of diabetes"" (<i>n</i>=7, 38.9%), ""improving support around me"" (<i>n</i>=7, 38.9%) and ""diabetes-related treatment issues"" (<i>n</i>=4; 22.2%).

35272434,Development of Various Diabetes Prediction Models Using Machine Learning Techniques.,"There are many models for predicting diabetes mellitus (DM), but their clinical implication remains vague. Therefore, we aimed to create various DM prediction models using easily accessible health screening test parameters. Two sets of variables were used to develop eight DM prediction models. One set comprised 62 easily accessible examination results of commonly used variables from a tertiary university hospital. The second set comprised 27 of the 62 variables included in the national routine health checkups. Gradient boosting and random forest algorithms were used to develop the models. Internal validation was performed using the stratified 10-fold cross-validation method. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) for the 62-variable DM model making 12-month predictions for subjects without diabetes was the largest (0.928) among those of the eight DM prediction models. The ROC-AUC dropped by more than 0.04 when training with the simplified 27-variable set but still showed fairly good performance with ROC-AUCs between 0.842 and 0.880. The accuracy was up to 11.5% higher (from 0.807 to 0.714) when fasting glucose was included. We created easily applicable diabetes prediction models that deliver good performance using parameters commonly assessed during tertiary university hospital and national routine health checkups. We plan to perform prospective external validation, hoping that the developed DM prediction models will be widely used in clinical practice.",Diabetes & metabolism journal,2022-Jul,"Shin J, Kim J, Lee C, Yoon JY, Kim S, Song S, Kim HS",7,1507,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
35936377,Analysis and Recognition of Clinical Features of Diabetes Based on Convolutional Neural Network.,"Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic noncommunicable disease, the main manifestation of which is the long-term high blood sugar level in patients due to metabolic disorders. However, due to excessive reliance on the clinical experience of ophthalmologists, our diagnosis takes a long time, and it is prone to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. In recent years, with the development of deep learning, its application in the auxiliary diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy has become possible. How to use the powerful feature extraction ability of deep learning algorithm to realize the mining of massive medical data is of great significance. Therefore, under the action of computer-aided technology, this paper processes and analyzes the retinal images of the fundus through traditional image processing and convolutional neural network-related methods, so as to achieve the role of assisting clinical treatment. Based on the admission records of diabetic patients after data analysis and feature processing, this paper uses an improved convolutional neural network algorithm to establish a model for predicting changes in diabetic conditions. The model can assist doctors to judge the patient's treatment effect by using it based on the case records of inpatient diagnosis and treatment and to predict the risk of readmission of inpatients after discharge. It also can help to judge the effectiveness of the treatment plan. The results of the study show that the model proposed in this paper has a lower probability of misjudging patients with poor recovery as good recovery, and the prediction is more accurate.",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2022-,"Wang R, Li P, Yang Z",3,1610,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
32535090,Gestational diabetes and progression to type two diabetes mellitus: missed opportunities of follow up and prevention?,"The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is increasing. Having a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a potent risk factor for the later development of T2DM. To explore the characteristics of women diagnosed with GDM in a single centre and their follow up for progression to T2DM. A retrospective cohort study using anonymised data of one hundred and fifty four (154) women with GDM receiving maternity care at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (OUHFT) in 2010 and their follow up until 2018. The prevalence of GDM in women delivering in Oxfordshire in 2010 was 3.4%. 70% of pregnant women were overweight or obese (with 51% being obese) at booking. Gestational weight gain (GWG) was excessive in 29% of women, when compared to Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines. Almost a quarter of women (23.4%) had no follow up after delivery. Over a median follow up of 3.5 years (range 0-8 years) nearly one in six (16.9%) of the total cohort (22% of those tested) went on to develop T2DM. 74% of women with GDM were multiparous, and 65% of nulliparous women were tested compared to 81% of multiparous women. There was a significant difference between multiparous women (53.8%) compared to nulliparous women (46.2%) developing T2DM (p=0.01). There was no significant difference in BMI (p=0.866) or GWG (p=0.83) in women who progressed to T2DM versus those who did not. The risk of T2DM after GDM is substantial however, follow up rates of this population is poor. Subsequent screening of women with GDM and their management crosses secondary and primary care with scope for improvement in counselling of women of the importance of annual reviews, in data collection and follow up in both obstetrics and general practice. The implementation of a recall system, an education programme for general practitioners and/or a registry of women diagnosed with GDM could be useful to identify those at high risk of developing T2DM as well as providing a platform for the potential development of interventions to prevent progression to T2DM after GDM.",Primary care diabetes,2020-Dec,"Walker E, Flannery O, Mackillop L",3,2079,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

With increased use, an increased number of usability evaluations are performed to assure that the applications function as intended. In this review the goal was to determine what usability methods are currently used in the evaluation of mobile health applications for diabetes and how these are used. A literature review was conducted to identify applicable studies in the databases ACM Digital Library, Cinahl and Pubmed between the years 2015 and 2020. After the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, 32 articles remained that were included in the final review. Most of the studies included one established usability engineering method such as an expert-based and/or user-based method or a validated questionnaire/instrument. Some also included a combination of these. Others used methods of their own design; commonly questionnaires and interviews either on their own or in combination.

33153226,Role of Phosphodiesterase in the Biology and Pathology of Diabetes.,"Glucose metabolism is the initiator of a large number of molecular secretory processes in Î² cells. Cyclic nucleotides as a second messenger are the main physiological regulators of these processes and are functionally divided into compartments in pancreatic cells. Their intracellular concentration is limited by hydrolysis led by one or more phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes. Literature data confirmed multiple expressions of PDEs subtypes, but the specific roles of each in pancreatic Î²-cell function, particularly in humans, are still unclear. Isoforms present in the pancreas are also found in various tissues of the body. Normoglycemia and its strict control are supported by the appropriate release of insulin from the pancreas and the action of insulin in peripheral tissues, including processes related to homeostasis, the regulation of which is based on the PDE- cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway. The challenge in developing a therapeutic solution based on GSIS (glucose-stimulated insulin secretion) enhancers targeted at PDEs is the selective inhibition of their activity only within Î² cells. Undeniably, PDEs inhibitors have therapeutic potential, but some of them are burdened with certain adverse effects. Therefore, the chance to use knowledge in this field for diabetes treatment has been postulated for a long time.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020-Nov,"Kilanowska A, ZiÃ³Åkowska A",2,1337,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

An audit in a primary care office found that fewer than 50% of patients with DM received an annual ocular examination. The aim of this project was to increase timely annual ocular examinations among patients with type 2 DM to 85% within 90 days. The model for improvement with 4 Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles was implemented in a rapid cycle format as well as changes in an electronic medical record (EMR) checklist and referral processes. Interventions included team huddles and trainings, the Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists checklist with additional information about DR, an EMR checklist, and a logbook referral tracking process changes. Of the patients referred during the project, 87% completed the ocular appointment, and the rate for patients with DM having annual ocular examinations increased from 48% to 86% meeting the current guideline of the American Diabetes Association.

Data collection included demographics, age at diagnosis, number of visits to the primary care clinic during the month prior the diagnosis, relevance to diabetes and outcome of those visits and the presence of ketoacidosis at diagnosis. We examined the relationship between the rate of ketoacidosis at diagnosis and the number of visits in the clinic, and to the demographic characteristics. Of 159 patients, 115 visited their clinic in the month prior to diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. The rate of ketoacidosis at diagnosis was similar between those who visited the clinic and those who did not (37.4% compared to 38.6%). There was no difference in ketoacidosis rates between the different ethnic and socio-economic groups.

A retrospective pre- and post-intervention study was conducted at a university-based family medicine clinic. A pharmacist-driven protocol was implemented which involved the creation of an algorithm recommending specific diabetes medications in patients with ASCVD. An in-service presentation reviewing the algorithm and process for referral of eligible patients to an appointment with a clinical pharmacist was delivered to providers. Clinical pharmacist appointments focus was on improving diabetes management and initiating cardiovascular risk-reducing medications if appropriate. A total of 234 patients were screened, and 108 met inclusion criteria. Upon completion of patient outreach, 34% were scheduled with a pharmacist. Forty-three percent of patients (16 of 37) attended the appointment. Of those, 31% were initiated on an evidence-based regimen indicated for diabetes and ASCVD. In comparing pre- to post-implementation of the pharmacist-driven protocol, the rate of guideline-concordant prescribing increased by 48% (3.8% to 5.6%). Implementation of a pharmacist-driven protocol can increase guideline-concordant prescribing.

This remains true despite initiation of renal replacement therapy. As such, we were interested in identifying any potential differences in access durability and postoperative outcomes in diabetic patients who receive arteriovenous fistulas versus grafts for hemodialysis. Diabetic patients undergoing their first arteriovenous (AV) access creation surgery in the Vascular Quality Initiative from January 2011 to January 2022 were included in our study. After exclusions, the study included two groups: those receiving AV fistulas and those receiving AV grafts for hemodialysis. Demographic characteristics were summarized and compared between these two groups using chi-square analysis or unpaired <i>t</i>-test. After propensity score matching was conducted, the effect of procedure type on functional patency, along with secondary outcomes including wound infection were assessed using chi-square analysis. A total of 20,159 diabetic patients who used their hemodialysis access were included in our study; 16,205 received AV fistulas while 3954 received AV grafts. Patients receiving AV grafts were more likely to be older, female, and have higher pre-operative catheter usage. After propensity score matching, patients who received AV grafts had a shorter time-to-use their conduit (50 vs 166âdays, <i>p</i>â<â0.0001), however, patients who received AV fistulas were more likely to have longer functional patency use for hemodialysis when compared to those who received AV grafts (mean survival time: 3.3 vs 2.9âyears, <i>p</i>â<â0.0001). These results were consistent between diabetics with insulin-dependent or insulin-independent diabetes.

Diabetic patients are classified in to three risk groups (very high risk, moderate risk and low risk) based on specific patient characteristics. The physician should estimate the effect of fast on the patient, whether he will be able to fast or not, and the patient will estimate his ability and endurance to fast. The mode of Pre-Ramadan diabetes patient education could be group sessions or one to one consultation. Patient education should include information on risks, glucose monitoring, nutrition, exercise and medication adjustment. Studies have shown that pre-Ramadan counseling reduces the incidence of hypoglycaemia. Altering the drug dosage, dietary counseling and patient education, together with regular blood glucose monitoring enables the patients to fast without major complications.

37620935,Machine learning profiles of cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes mellitus: the Silesia Diabetes-Heart Project.,"As cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death for patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), we aimed to find important factors that predict cardiovascular (CV) risk using a machine learning (ML) approach. We performed a single center, observational study in a cohort of 238 DM patients (mean ageâÂ±âSD 52.15âÂ±â17.27Â years, 54% female) as a part of the Silesia Diabetes-Heart Project. Having gathered patients' medical history, demographic data, laboratory test results, results from the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (assessing diabetic peripheral neuropathy) and Ewing's battery examination (determining the presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy), we managed use a ML approach to predict the occurrence of overt CVD on the basis of five most discriminative predictors with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86 (95% CI 0.80-0.91). Those features included the presence of past or current foot ulceration, age, the treatment with beta-blocker (BB) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi). On the basis of the aforementioned parameters, unsupervised clustering identified different CV risk groups. The highest CV risk was determined for the eldest patients treated in large extent with ACEi but not BB and having current foot ulceration, and for slightly younger individuals treated extensively with both above-mentioned drugs, with relatively small percentage of diabetic ulceration. Using a ML approach in a prospective cohort of patients with DM, we identified important factors that predicted CV risk. If a patient was treated with ACEi or BB, is older and has/had a foot ulcer, this strongly predicts that he/she is at high risk of having overt CVD.",Cardiovascular diabetology,2023-Aug,"Kwiendacz H, Wijata AM, Nalepa J, PiaÅnik J, Kulpa J, Herba M, Boczek S, Kegler K, Hendel M, Irlik K, Gumprecht J, Lip GYH, Nabrdalik K",13,1722,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
35122284,Does metformin affect outcomes in COVID-19 patients with new or pre-existing diabetes mellitus? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health emergency and patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are disproportionately affected, exhibiting more severe outcomes. Recent studies have shown that metformin is associated with improved outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and DM and may be a potential candidate for drug repurposing. We aimed to investigate the effects of metformin on outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and DM. Databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, Clinicaltrials.gov and Cochrane library) were searched up to 10 April 2021 for studies reporting data on metformin use in COVID-19 patients with DM. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Certainty of evidence was rated using the GRADE approach. The primary outcome was mortality reported as odds ratio (OR). A random-effects meta-analysis was carried out on both unadjusted and adjusted ORs. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020221842. In total, 2â916â231 patients from 32 cohort studies were included in the quantitative and qualitative synthesis. The meta-analysis showed that metformin was significantly associated with lower mortality in COVID-19 patients with DM in both unadjusted (OR 0.61 [95% confidence interval: 0.53-0.71], PÂ <â.00001, I<sup>2</sup> Â =â70%) and adjusted (OR 0.78 [95% confidence interval: 0.69-0.88], PÂ <â.00001, I<sup>2</sup> Â =â67%) models. Poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients with DM can be attributed to inadequate glycaemic control and weakened immune responses. Metformin has multiple effects that can improve outcomes in patients with DM and our findings highlight a possible role of its use. However, robust randomised trials are needed to thoroughly assess its use.",British journal of clinical pharmacology,2022-Jun,"Ganesh A, Randall MD",2,1715,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
34773673,Diabetes management in the face of adversity: Experiences of asylum-seekers in Belgian reception centres.,"Diabetes poses a heavy burden on patients due to its progressive and chronic nature; it requires continuous management to promote a high-quality and long life. Disease management is especially challenging in emergency settings. We examined how displaced people with diabetes experienced managing their illness before and throughout the process of fleeing their home communities and seeking resettlement in Europe. We designed an interview instrument with closed- and open-ended questions about diabetes diagnosis and management before fleeing the home country, during migration, stays in transit countries and reception in the European Union. We interviewed 20 asylum-seekers living in Belgian reception centres with diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Primary topics emerging from interviews were availability, accessibility, and quality. Belgium was described as a setting with high availability, accessibility and quality of diabetes management components (medication, tools, care) compared with other settings before and during migration. Even in Belgium, maintaining a healthy diet as an asylum-seeker was difficult. Other concerns such as safety, other health issues and the asylum request itself often outweighed diabetes management. Displaced people in non-Western countries need attention for nutrition and diabetes medicine, so aid agencies should consider providing for those needs. For people seeking asylum in the West and living in temporary facilities, care should be paid to the dietary options available for those with diabetes. For irregular migrants, diabetes can be deadly, and resources should be made available for their basic diabetes needs, even if they are not eligible for regular health services.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2022-Apr,"Van Hemelrijck WMJ, Vandenheede H, Argeseanu Cunningham S",3,1716,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
35604792,Reduced Rate of Acute Diabetes Events with Flash Glucose Monitoring Is Sustained for 2 Years After Initiation: Extended Outcomes from the RELIEF Study.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> The RELIEF study has previously shown a fall in the rate of acute diabetes events (ADEs) in people living with type 1 diabetes (PwDT1) or people living with type 2 diabetes (PwDT2) in the 12 months after initiation of flash glucose monitoring (FLASH) in France. The 2-year follow-up has provided new insights on the frequency of ADEs, including severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), during use of FLASH. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The RELIEF study included 31,446 PwDT1 and 41,027 PwDT2 with a first delivery of FreeStyle Libre (FSL) between August 1 and December 31, 2017. Hospitalizations for DKA, severe hypoglycemia, diabetes-related coma, and hyperglycemia were recorded for the 12 months before and 24 months after FSL initiation. Persistence of the FSL system use was estimated through a Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Change in usual blood glucose monitoring was estimated through acquisition of blood glucose test strips. <b><i>Results:</i></b> In the 2 years after FSL initiation, hospitalizations for ADEs were reduced by 49% and by 48% in PwDT1 or PwDT2, respectively, driven by reductions in DKA. After 2 years, 88% of patients persisted with the system and estimated mean consumption of blood glucose test strips had fallen after 2 years by -82% and by -84% in type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Use of FSL consistently reduces the rates of hospitalization for ADEs, mainly DKA, 2 years after initiation, confirming this is not a transitory effect. Use of FSL also results in a clear and progressive drop in use of blood glucose test strips over the 2-year period.",Diabetes technology & therapeutics,2022-Sep,"Riveline JP, Roussel R, Vicaut E, de Pouvourville G, Detournay B, Emery C, Levrat-Guillen F, Guerci B",8,1673,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
35397604,Hospital treatment costs associated with incident complications in patients with type 2 diabetes-real-world study based on electronic patient information systems.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications cause a significant public health and economic challenge. To enable the optimal resource allocation across different prevention and treatment policies for the management of T2D-related complications, detailed cost estimates related to the complications of T2D are needed. Therefore, the objective of the study was to provide reliable and sufficiently detailed real-world estimates of costs associated with different T2D complications in a Finnish university hospital setting. A cohort of T2D patients living in the catchment area of a university hospital during 2012 and 2016 was identified from the comprehensive national FinDM diabetes database for longitudinal assessment of T2D associated complication treatment costs. Data on patient-level events were extracted from the FinDM data and complemented with all accountable services and related detailed costing data gathered from the university hospital's electronic patient information systems by using unique personal identity codes. Patients were screened for their first diagnoses of complications using the same national quality registry definitions as in the FinDM database. Multivariable gamma regression model with a log link function was applied to study the association between baseline factors and complication costs. In addition, an interactive online tool was developed to create predicted costs for complication costs with selected baseline factors. A total of 27 255 prevalent and incident patients with T2D were identified from the national FinDM register. Finally, a total of 16Â 148 complication episodes for 7 895 patients were included in the cost analyses. The mean estimated one-year hospital treatment costs of T2D-related complication varied from 6 184 to 24 507 euros per complication. Regression analyses showed that coexisting conditions are significantly associated with initial and recurrent complication costs. The study shows updated Finnish cost estimates and their main cost drivers for T2D-related complications treated in the university hospital setting. The results of our study highlight the significance of guideline implementation, effective preventive treatments for T2D, as well as the importance of treatment adherence to avoid these costly complications.",BMC health services research,2022-Apr,"Sund R, Peltonen T, LehtimÃ¤ki AV, Martikainen J",4,2292,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
32580888,Educational inequalities in the prevalence and outcomes of diabetes in the Emilian Longitudinal Study.,"Studies carried out in Italy in the last decades reported an effect modification in the association between socioeconomic position and diabetes outcomes, and the disease integrated care approach has been suggested as an explanatory factor. Whether this is true in Emilia-Romagna region in recent years is unknown and the aim of this study is to describe the role of educational level both on diabetes prevalence and health outcomes among the adult population with and without diabetes enrolled in the Emilian Longitudinal Study. Inequalities in diabetes prevalence were evaluated through standardised estimates and prevalence ratios by educational level and inequalities in outcomes through standardised hospitalisation and mortality ratios and rate ratios by educational level. The lower the education the greater the diabetes prevalence; such differences were larger among women and younger age groups. Diabetes conferred a higher risk of hospitalisation and mortality; those outcomes also presented a social gradient with the less educated bearing the higher risk. However, educational differences were slightly stronger among the disease-free subjects, especially in the case of mortality. In both genders, inequalities tended to disappear with age. This study confirms that diabetes increases the risk of unfavourable outcomes, but does not increase social inequalities in outcomes as might be expected. Similarly to what has been previously shown, it is likely that the protective effect of diabetes on the negative health effects of the low social position is attributable to the disease integrated care approach.","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2020-Aug,"Bartolini L, Caranci N, Gnavi R, Di Girolamo C",4,1620,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

33606663,Differences between transient neonatal diabetes mellitus subtypes can guide diagnosis and therapy.,"Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is caused by activating mutations in ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes (KATP/TNDM) or by chromosome 6q24 abnormalities (6q24/TNDM). We wanted to assess whether these different genetic aetiologies result in distinct clinical features. Retrospective analysis of the Italian data set of patients with TNDM. Clinical features and treatment of 22 KATP/TNDM patients and 12 6q24/TNDM patients were compared. Fourteen KATP/TNDM probands had a carrier parent with abnormal glucose values, four patients with 6q24 showed macroglossia and/or umbilical hernia. Median age at diabetes onset and birth weight were lower in patients with 6q24 (1 week; -2.27 SD) than those with KATP mutations (4.0 weeks; -1.04 SD) (P = 0.009 and P = 0.007, respectively). Median time to remission was longer in KATP/TNDM than 6q24/TNDM (21.5 weeks vs 12 weeks) (P = 0.002). Two KATP/TNDM patients entered diabetes remission without pharmacological therapy. A proband with the ABCC8/L225P variant previously associated with permanent neonatal diabetes entered 7-year long remission after 1 year of sulfonylurea therapy. Seven diabetic individuals with KATP mutations were successfully treated with sulfonylurea monotherapy; four cases with relapsing 6q24/TNDM were treated with insulin, metformin or combination therapy. If TNDM is suspected, KATP genes should be analyzed first with the exception of patients with macroglossia and/or umbilical hernia. Remission of diabetes without pharmacological therapy should not preclude genetic analysis. Early treatment with sulfonylurea may induce long-lasting remission of diabetes in patients with KATP mutations associated with PNDM.

39344692,Neonatal diabetes mellitus around the world: Update 2024.,"Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), defined as diabetes with an onset during the first 6âmonths of life, is a rare form of monogenic diabetes. The initial publications on this condition began appearing in the second half of the 1990s and quite surprisingly, the search for new NDM genes is still ongoing with great vigor. Between 2018 and early 2024, six brand new NDM-genes have been discovered (CNOT1, FICD, ONECUT1, PDIA6, YIPF5, ZNF808) and three genes known to cause different diseases were identified as NDM-genes (EIF2B1, NARS2, KCNMA1). In addition, NDM cases carrying mutations in three other genes known to give rise to diabetes during childhood have been also identified (AGPAT2, BSCL2, PIK3R1). As a consequence, the list of NDM genes now exceeds 40. This genetic heterogeneity translates into many different mechanism(s) of disease that are being investigated with state-of-the-art methodologies, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and human embryonic stem cells (hESC) manipulated with the CRISPR technique of genome editing. This diversity in genetic causes and the pathophysiology of diabetes dictate the need for a variety of therapeutic approaches.

This study aims to identify the medical expenses of patients with diabetes in different regions of China and examine the differences in inpatient medical expenses and the impacts of them on these patients. This study is a longitudinal analysis of medical expenses for inpatients with diabetes for different years; horizontal analysis of medical expenses among different regions; and literature review. Data were derived from China's Medical Insurance Department database. We selected inpatients with diabetes in the eastern, central, and western regions of China for the period 2013-2015 and randomly selected data through systematic sampling. Among the 4150 patients with diabetes considered in this study, the patients' medical expenses were found to differ significantly across regions, years, ages, medical insurance types, medical institution levels, total medical expenses, medical insurance fund payments, and out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses. In addition, there were significant differences in total medical expenses for male and female patients. Furthermore, medical insurance type, patients' age, medical institution level, and year significantly influenced total medical expenses. Inpatients with diabetes in different regions exhibited significant differences in total medical expenses, medical insurance fund payments, and OOP expenses. China should invest more in chronic disease treatment in its central and western regions, narrow the regional differences in medical expenses, and endeavor to ensure equity in the availability and cost of medical services. Moreover, patients with diabetes must be encouraged to access primary care to reduce their medical expenses.",Public health,2020-Aug,"Zhang X, Yang S, Zhang X",3,1853,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

37448463,Optimizing strategies to identify high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.,"The success of diabetes prevention based on early treatment depends on high-quality screening. This study compared the diagnostic properties of currently recommended screening strategies against alternative score-based rules to identify those at high risk of developing diabetes. The study used data from ELSA-Brasil, a contemporary cohort followed up for a mean (standard deviation) of 7.4 (0.54) years, to develop risk functions with logistic regression to predict incident diabetes based on socioeconomic, lifestyle, clinical, and laboratory variables. We compared the predictive capacity of these functions against traditional pre-diabetes cutoffs of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h plasma glucose (2hPG), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) alone or combined with recommended screening questionnaires. Presenting FPG > 100 mg/dl predicted 76.6% of future cases of diabetes in the cohort at the cost of labeling 40.6% of the sample as high risk. If FPG testing was performed only in those with a positive American Diabetes Association (ADA) questionnaire, labeling was reduced to 12.2%, but only 33% of future cases were identified. Scores using continuously expressed clinical and laboratory variables produced a better balance between detecting more cases and labeling fewer false positives. They consistently outperformed strategies based on categorical cutoffs. For example, a score composed of both clinical and laboratory data, calibrated to detect a risk of future diabetes â¥20%, predicted 54% of future diabetes cases, labeled only 15.3% as high risk, and, compared to the FPG â¥ 100 mg/dl strategy, nearly doubled the probability of future diabetes among screen positives.

This two-center study aims to analyse diabetic patients' WTP for obtaining a specific preventive treatment package to reduce severe diabetic complications and determine the factors that impact this value. This cross-sectional research included 557 diabetics from two cities in Iran. The WTP for a preventative package minimising major diabetes complications (cardiovascular, renal, ocular, and diabetic foot) by 50% and 100% was tested using eight scenarios. The Diabetes Attitude Scoring Questionnaire (DAS-3) was used to examine patient attitudes toward diabetes. To determine WTP, a two-stage hurdle method was used. The level of significance was fixed to 0.05. Around 80% of 557 people interviewed (mean age 47.54) stated they wanted to pay for a diabetes prevention package. This package's WTP varied from 169.4 to $374.5 depending on the complication and degree of risk reduction. The largest value diabetic patients willing to pay for preventative packages that reduce the chance of blindness was reported, while the lowest cost was stated for the diabetic foot. WTP is influenced by wealth, location of study, marital status, and attitude toward special training, but not by the type of diabetes, inpatient or outpatient setting, or the complications diabetes patients are impacted by. Patients' diabetes attitudes were mainly negative. The score of the attitude of patients towards diabetes was generally suboptimal. Most diabetic patients were willing to pay for a preventive package and this value was not affected by the type of diabetes and its severity. Our research found that diabetic individuals are willing to pay the most for a preventative package that reduces the chance of blindness, and the least for diabetic foot care.

34352986,Management of Cardiovascular Risk in Perimenopausal Women with Diabetes.,"Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of mortality in women and men with diabetes. Due to age and worsening of risk factors over the menopausal transition, risk of coronary heart disease events increases in postmenopausal women with diabetes. Randomized studies have conflicted regarding the beneficial impact of estrogen therapy upon intermediate cardiovascular disease markers and events. Therefore, estrogen therapy is not currently recommended for indications other than symptom management. However, for women at low risk of adverse events, estrogen therapy can be used to minimize menopausal symptoms. The risk of adverse events can be estimated using risk engines for the calculation of cardiovascular risk and breast cancer risk in conjunction with screening tools such as mammography. Use of estrogen therapy, statins, and anti-platelet agents can be guided by such calculators particularly for younger women with diabetes. Risk management remains focused upon lifestyle behaviors and achieving optimal levels of cardiovascular risk factors, including lipids, glucose, and blood pressure.

32558488,PPAR-Î± Agonist Fenofibrate Ameliorates Oxidative Stress in Testicular Tissue of Diabetic Rats.,"Oxidative stress has the potential to induce impotence, especially in diabetic patients. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-Î±) agonists can potentiate antioxidants in a wide variety of tissues. However, no available evidence exists showing a direct antioxidant effect on testicular tissue in the setting of diabetes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether PPAR-Î± agonists can act directly to protect testicular tissue from oxidative damage. Male Wistar rats (180-200 g) were randomly allocated into four groups: normal control (N), normal treated (NF), diabetic (D), and diabetic treated (DF) (n = 6 for each group). Diabetes was induced by a single intravenous injection of streptozotocin STZ (40 mg/kg). Two treatment groups (diabetic and nondiabetic) were treated with fenofibrate daily for 8 weeks (80 mg/kg orally). At the end of 8 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and blood and testicular tissue samples collected. Nitrate, malondialdehyde, and glutathione levels, and the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes were evaluated. The data were analyzed via two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with P < 0.05 taken as significant. Diabetes significantly augmented free radicals, as attested by an increase in nitrate levels in testicular tissue, reduced activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes, and enhanced malondialdehyde content. These changes lead to oxidative stress in testicular tissues. Treatment with fenofibrate in the diabetic group improved oxidative stress by potentiation of antioxidant elements and a reduction in nitrate and malondialdehyde production. Diabetes has a potent effect in promoting the development of oxidative damage in testicular tissue. The PPAR-a agonist fenofibrate improves the redox state and may prevent oxidative stress in the setting of diabetes-induced oxidative stress.",Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression,2020-,"Yaribeygi H, Mohammadi MT, Jamialahmadi T, Sahebkar A",4,1883,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
37862970,"Decrypting the circular RNAs does a favor for us: Understanding, diagnosing and treating diabetes mellitus and its complications.","Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel type of single-stranded noncoding RNAs with a covalently closed loop structure, are generated in a circular conformation via non-canonical splicing or back-splicing events. Functionally, circRNAs have been elucidated to soak up microRNAs (miRNAs) and RNA binding proteins (RBPs), serve as protein scaffolds, maintain mRNA stability, and regulate gene transcription and translation. Notably, circRNAs are strongly implicated in the regulation of Î²-cell functions, insulin resistance, adipocyte functions, inflammation as well as oxidative stress via acting as miRNA sponges and RBP sponges. Basic and clinical studies have demonstrated that aberrant alterations of circRNAs expressions are strongly associated with the initiation and progression of diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications. Here in this review, we present a summary of the biogenesis, transportation, degradation and functions of circRNAs, and highlight the recent findings on circRNAs and their action mechanisms in DM and its complications. Overall, this review should contribute greatly to our understanding of circRNAs in DM pathogenesis, offering insights into the further perspectives of circRNAs for DM diagnosis and therapy.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2023-Dec,"Li Z, Ren Y, Lv Z, Li M, Li Y, Fan X, Xiong Y, Qian L",8,1236,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
38719663,Relationship between fibrosis-4 score and microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most prevalent chronic liver disease globally and is linked to augmented susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular disease, and microvascular complications inherent to DM, such as nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) scoring system, a noninvasive tool, is useful for predicting the extent of liver fibrosis across diverse pathologies. This study aimed to assess the potential predictive role of FIB-4 scores in microvascular complications associated with diabetes. The medical records of patients with type 2 DM admitted to our endocrinology clinic between February 2019 and December 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Parameters including demographic attributes, fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, thrombocyte levels, and microvascular complications were recorded. The FIB-4 score was computed, and patients were categorized based on these scores (<1.3 andÂ â¥Â 1.3). The analysis included 312 patients with a median age of 60 (50-68Â years); 39.7Â % were men. The median duration of diabetes was 10Â years (5-20Â years), and the median FIB-4 score was 0.93 (0.63-1.34). Neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy were observed in 50.6Â %, 31.4Â %, and 34Â % of the patients, respectively. Although the FIB-4 score did not differ significantly between patients with and without neuropathy or retinopathy, patients with nephropathy exhibited higher FIB-4 scores. Notably, patients with FIB-4 scoresÂ â¥Â 1.3 demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of nephropathy. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that higher FIB-4 scores were significantly associated with an increased risk of nephropathy. The FIB-4 score is a cost-effective and straightforward tool with potential applicability in predicting nephropathy in individuals with type 2 DM.",Arab journal of gastroenterology : the official publication of the Pan-Arab Association of Gastroenterology,2024-Aug,"Erdogan BT, Tam AA, Baser H, Cuhaci Seyrek FN, Polat SB, Ersoy R, Topaloglu O, Cakir B",8,1893,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

All patients who had received a diagnosis of HF at UmeÃ¥ University Hospital between 2010 and 2019 were identified and data were extracted from patient files according to a prespecified protocol containing parameters for clinical characteristics, including echocardiogram results, comorbidities, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values. Patients' HF phenotype was determined using the latest available echocardiogram. The number of patients with previous DM diagnosis was assessed. Patients without a previous diagnosis of DM were classified as non-DM, pre-diabetes or probable DM according to FPG and HbA1c levels using WHO criteria. In total, 2326 patients (59% male, mean age 76Â±13 years) with HF and at least one echocardiogram were assessed. Of these, 617 (27%) patients had a previous diagnosis of DM. Of the 1709 patients without a previous diagnosis of DM, 1092 (67%) patients had either an FPG or HbA1c recorded, of which 441 (41%) met criteria for pre-diabetes and 97 (9%) met criteria for probable diabetes, corresponding to 19% and 4% of the entire cohort, respectively. Patients with HF and diabetes were more often treated with diuretics and beta blockers compared with non-DM patients (64% vs 42%, p<0.001âand 88% vs 83%, p<0.001, respectively). There was no difference in DM treatment between HF phenotypes. DM and pre-diabetes are common in this HF population with 50% of patients having either known DM, probable DM or pre-diabetes.

Using nationally available data and existing clinical and demographic information from members participating in cardiometabolic V1C programs, a microsimulation approach was used to estimate potential reduction in onset of disease sequelae and associated gross savings (ie, excluding the cost of V1C programs) in health care costs. Members of each program were propensity matched to similar records in the combined 2012-2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey files based on age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and diagnosis status of diabetes and/or hypertension. V1C program-attributed changes in clinical outcomes combined with baseline biometric levels and other risk factors were used as inputs to model disease onset and related gross health care costs. Across the V1C programs, sustained improvements in weight loss, hemoglobin A1c, and blood pressure levels were estimated to reduce incidence of modeled disease sequelae by 2% to 10% over the 5 years following enrollment. As a result of sustained improvement in biometrics and reduced disease onset, the estimated gross savings in medical expenditures across the programs would be $892 to $1342 after 1 year, and cumulative estimated gross medical savings would be $2963 to $4346 after 3 years and $5221 to $7756 after 5 years. In addition, high program engagement was associated with greater health and economic benefits.

35414826,Advanced Glycation End Product Blocker Drugs Have a Great Potential to Prevent Diabetic Cardiomyopathy in an Animal Model of Diabetes Mellitus Type-2.,"Sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) is a product of the sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) enzyme. Increased S1P can lead to tissue fibrosis that is also one of the pathways for developing diabetic cardiomyopathy. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) increase S1P in cells. The study is aimed at using aminoguanidine (AG) as an AGEs blocker drug to prevent diabetic cardiomyopathy. <i>Materials and methods.</i> 210 rats were enrolled in the study. Diabetes mellitus type-2 was induced, and rats were divided into AG treated diabetic and nondiabetic groups. The heart histology was assessed with Masson's trichrome and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Cardiac function was measured with transthoracic echocardiography. S1P level and SphK1 gene expression were measured by western-blot and RT-qPCR, respectively. Results showed that S1P level increases in diabetes, and its augmentation in cardiac tissue with K6PC-5 leads to cardiac fibrosis. 50 and 200âmg/kg of AG prevented cardiac fibrosis, but 100âmg/kg had no significant preventive effect. AG suppressed the SphK1 gene expression and reduced the fibrotic effect of S1P. AG preserved cardiac function by keeping ejection fraction and fractional shortening within the normal range in diabetic rats. AG has a suppressor effect on SphK1 gene expression besides its AGEs blocker role. AG is a potential drug to use in diabetic patients for preventing the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Other drugs that have AGEs or S1P blocker effects are a good choice for diabetic cardiomyopathy prevention.",Cardiovascular therapeutics,2022-,"Heydari AH, Fathi M, Heydari S, Heidari ME",4,1538,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

34319011,Emerging Targets in Type 2 Diabetes and Diabetic Complications.,"Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic, chronic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and elevated blood glucose levels. Although a large drug portfolio exists to keep the blood glucose levels under control, these medications are not without side effects. More importantly, once diagnosed diabetes is rarely reversible. Dysfunctions in the kidney, retina, cardiovascular system, neurons, and liver represent the common complications of diabetes, which again lack effective therapies that can reverse organ injury. Overall, the molecular mechanisms of how type 2 diabetes develops and leads to irreparable organ damage remain elusive. This review particularly focuses on novel targets that may play role in pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Further research on these targets may eventually pave the way to novel therapies for the treatment-or even the prevention-of type 2 diabetes along with its complications.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2021-Sep,"Demir S, Nawroth PP, Herzig S, Ekim ÃstÃ¼nel B",4,908,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

This was a cross-sectional analysis of participants with diabetes and poor glycemic control in an ongoing trial (n = 353). We compared the prevalence of unmet needs, self-care behaviors, and diabetes outcomes in successive cohorts of enrollees surveyed pre-pandemic (prior to March 11, 2020, n = 182), in the early stages of the pandemic (May-September, 2020, n = 75), and later (September 2020-January 2021, n = 96) stratified by income and gender. Adjusted multivariable regression models were used to examine trends. More participants with low income reported food insecurity (70% vs. 83%, p < 0.05) and needs related to access to blood glucose supplies (19% vs. 67%, p < 0.05) during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels. In adjusted models among people with low incomes, the odds of housing insecurity increased among participants during the early pandemic months compared with participants pre-pandemic (OR 20.2 [95% CI 2.8-145.2], p < 0.01). A1c levels were better among participants later in the pandemic than those pre-pandemic (Î² = -1.1 [95% CI -1.8 to -0.4], p < 0.01), but systolic blood pressure control was substantially worse (Î² = 11.5 [95% CI 4.2-18.8, p < 0.001).

This study was based on the 1999-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database and included 6,891 patients with DM for cross-sectional analysis. Multivariate adjusted models and restricted cubic spline (RCS) models were employed to assess the association between the insulin resistance index and the risk of DN. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the impact of different population characteristics. The results indicated that higher quartiles of METS-IR, TyG, TG/HDL, and TyG-BMI were associated with a significantly increased risk of DN. After adjusting for multiple covariates, including gender, age, and race, the associations between these indices and the risk of DN remained significant, with corresponding odds ratios (ORs) of 1.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29-1.76), 2.06 (95% CI: 1.77-2.40), 1.61 (95% CI: 1.38-1.88), and 1.57 (95% CI: 1.35-1.84), with all P-values less than 0.001. RCS analysis indicated a nonlinear relationship between these indices and the risk of DN. The TyG index exhibited a highly consistent association with the risk of DN in all models. Non-insulin-based insulin resistance indices are significantly associated with the risk of DN. The TyG index is a superior tool for assessing the risk of DN. These indices can assist in identifying patients at risk of DN, thereby enabling the implementation of more effective preventive and therapeutic strategies.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,"Zhang F, Han Y, Mao Y, Li W",4,1642,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Data from 175,628 individuals with diabetes in the Health Improvement Network were used to assess the risk of STDR across Townsend Deprivation Index quantiles using Cox proportional hazard regression. Among individuals with T1D, the risk of STDR was three times higher (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.67, 95% CI 1.05-7.78) in the most deprived quintile compared with the least deprived quintile. In T2D, the most deprived quintile had a 28% higher risk (aHR 1.28; 95% CI 1.15-1.43) than the least deprived quintile. Increasing socioeconomic deprivation is associated with a higher risk of developing STDR in people with diabetes.

32250529,Using RWE research to extend clinical trials in diabetes: An example with implications for the future.,"Although randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) are seen as the gold standard for evidence in clinical medicine, a number of considerations are increasing the use of real-world data (RWD) to generate evidence. A series of methodological challenges must be overcome in order for such real-world evidence (RWE) to gain acceptance. In diabetes, RWE faces some particular issues that have limited its development. As the natural history of diabetes progresses, patients' disease changes over time and treatments will be modified as a result. This evolving disease and treatment pattern requires application of methods that account for such changes over time. Research developing RWE in diabetes and other conditions has sometimes been subject to important biases, and researchers should be aware of, and take steps to mitigate potential for bias in order to enhance the evidence produced. We review a RWE study that replicated and extended evidence provided by a RCT regarding the effects of weekly exenatide relative to basal insulin (glargine or detemir) to illustrate a potential application of RWE. This study observed a 0.7% decrease in HbA1C for weekly exenatide relative to a 0.5% decrease in HbA1C for the comparator along with a 2 kg weight loss for weekly exenatide relative to a 0.25âkg weight gain, effects that were close to those from the RCT. Further, the RWE study was able to extend results to patient populations that were not well represented in the RCT. Despite numerous challenges, RWE can be used to complement evidence from RCTs.","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2020-Apr,"Seeger JD, Nunes A, Loughlin AM",3,1546,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

This is a qualitative study employing focus groups and inductive thematic analysis involving 18 older adults with diabetes between the ages of 60 and 88, living in their own homes within an Australian city. Focus groups were recruited on a sequential basis and progressively analysed using an inductive process until data saturation was reached. Focus groups were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim for thematic analysis. Three key themes were generated: autonomy, individualised dietary management and the food service system. Older adults speculated that they would want a collaborative approach to maintain their health in ageing and to self-manage their diabetes while feasible. Participants wanted autonomy over food choices, flexible meal timings and quality meals. There was a significant anxiety that aged care staff and existing food service systems in RAC could not support these preferences. Community-dwelling older adults with diabetes would highly value aged care services that facilitated autonomy, individualised nutrition support and flexibility, but feared this will not be feasible. The introduction of new diabetes and RAC guidelines may require an implementation plan to include the full food service system, from staff education to meal preparation, ordering and service.",Australasian journal on ageing,2022-Sep,"Farrer O, Miller M, Yaxley A, Walton K",4,1632,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Two independent reviewers were involved in screening of titles and abstracts, selection of studies, and methodological quality assessment. Seven SRs were included in the study. Three of them included only randomized controlled trials, while the rest involved other study designs. Educational interventions by clinical pharmacists within the healthcare team were the most common types of interventions reported across all SRs. Pharmacist's interventions compared to usual care resulted in favorable significant improvements in hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>), fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, body mass index, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein and triglycerides in more than 50% of the SRs. Improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> was the mostly reported clinical outcome of pharmacist intervention in the literature (reported in six SRs). Pharmacist's interventions led to significant cost-saving ($8-$85,000 per person per year), cost-utility, and cost-benefit (benefit-to-cost ratio range from 1:1 to 8.5:1) versus usual care. Pharmacist's interventions improved patients' quality of life (QoL) in three SRs; however, no conclusion can be drawn due to the use of diverse QoL assessment tools. Most SRs support the benefit of pharmacist care on diabetes-related clinical, humanistic, and economic outcomes in primary care settings. Improvements in diabetes outcomes can significantly reduce the burden of diabetes on healthcare system. Hence, the incorporation of pharmacists into multidisciplinary diabetes care teams is beneficial and should be strongly considered by clinicians and health policymakers.",Primary care diabetes,2020-Oct,"Abdulrhim S, Sankaralingam S, Ibrahim MIM, Awaisu A",4,2201,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
34070096,Attitude of Physicians towards Periodontal Disease and Diabetes Mellitus Screening in Dental Clinics in Thailand.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the top causes of death in many places of the world. Diagnosing DM in the early stage is necessary to avoid severe cases and death. To evaluate the knowledge of association between DM and periodontal disease (PD) among Thai physicians and assess their attitudes towards DM screening in dental clinics in Thailand. Online survey of currently practicing physicians in Thailand was conducted on voluntary basis using the newly developed questionnaire. We received 403 responses that are statistically sufficient to represent the entire population of currently practicing physicians in Thailand. A total of 97.3% of all responses indicate that Thai physicians have knowledge about the association between DM and PD. More than 90% know that DM has an effect on PD; however, 70% know about the effect of untreated PD in DM patients. Most of physicians think that DM screening in dental clinics is important (79.1%) and are ready to accept referred cases for definite DM diagnosis from a dentist (84.1%). The concerned issues among the participants were the accuracy of the test results in DM screening (73%) and ability of a dentist to perform the screening (71.5%). The majority of participating physicians have adequate knowledge about the bidirectional relationship between DM and PD. They have a positive attitude towards DM screening in dental setting. The collaboration between physicians and dental professionals should be established to reduce the number of undiagnosed DM patients and enhance the medical care of DM patients.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021-May,"Panakhup M, Lertpanomwan I, Pajonklaew C, Arayapisit T, Yuma S, Pujarern P, Champirat T, Buranachad N, Fuangtharnthip P, Tantipoj C",10,1561,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Prevalence of diabetic nephropathy, and retinopathy, in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is declining, but it is not known if this is true also for diabetic neuropathy. To investigate the relationship between large fibre diabetic neuropathy and other diabetic complications. Neuropathy, defined here as large fibre neuropathy, was assessed by measuring vibration perception thresholds at four different frequencies on the sole of the foot, using a standard VibroSense Meter and/or neuropathic symptoms, in 599 individuals with T1DM. Retinopathy status was graded using the International Clinical Disease Severity Scale. Grade of albuminuria and previous history of any macrovascular complications were registered. Diabetic individuals without retinopathy had similar vibration thresholds as age- and gender-matched control participants without diabetes, whereas those without microalbuminuria had higher thresholds than controls. Two individuals out of 599 (0.3%) had microalbuminuria, but not retinopathy or neuropathy, and 12/134 (9%) without retinopathy had signs of neuropathy. Totally 119/536 (22%) of the patients without microalbuminuria had neuropathy. Vibration thresholds increased with the rising severity of retinopathy and grade of albuminuria. In a multinomial logistic regression analysis, neuropathy was associated with retinopathy (OR 2.96 [1.35-6.49], p=0.007), nephropathy (OR 6.25 [3.21-12.15]; p=6.7Ã10-8) and macrovascular disease (OR 2.72 [1.50-4.93], p=0.001). Despite recent changes in the incidence of diabetic complications, the onset of large fibre neuropathy follows that of retinopathy but precedes the onset of nephropathy in T1DM.","Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association",2023-Apr,"Lindholm E, Ekman L, Elgzyri T, Lindholm B, LÃ¶ndahl M, Dahlin L",6,1713,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

More than 80% of the displaced population lives in lower- and middle-income countries, which also host 81% of the global population living with diabetes. Most crises are protracted, often lasting decades, and humanitarian aid organizations are providing long-term primary care to both the local and displaced populations. Humanitarian crises are extremely varied in nature and occur in contexts that are diverse and dynamic. The scope of providing diabetes care varies depending on the phase of the crisis. This paper describes key challenges and possible solutions to improving diabetes care in crisis settings. It focuses on (1) ensuring a reliable supply of life preserving medications and diagnostics, (2) restoring and maintaining access to health care, and (3) adapting service design to the context.

In addition to being a leading cost of kidney failure, diabetes causes a host of secondary hyperglycemic-related complications including gastroparesis and orthostatic hypotension. While pancreas transplantation has been established as an effective treatment for diabetes, providing long-term normoglycemia in recipients, the secondary complications of diabetes mellitus persist complicating the post-operative course of an otherwise successful pancreas transplantation. This review describes the mechanismÂ and impact of diabetic gastroparesis and orthostatic hypotension in the post-operative course of pancreas transplant patients and analyzes the various treatment modalities, based on current data and extensive experience at our institution, to treat these respective complications.

This study included 174,546 patients. The relationship between introducing chronic disease management in a region and the self-awareness of disease status was analyzed using a generalized estimating equation model. Poisson regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of policy adoption on medication adherence and risk-reduction behavior in patients with hypertension and diabetes. Finally, we used a difference-in-differences model to assess the net effectiveness of policies. Overall, regions with policies implemented showed more condition awareness and drug adherence than those without; however, this was only significant in regions where patients and physicians were incentivized. Risk-reduction behavior for patients with diabetes was higher in regions with policies implemented than in those without. The policy had a net effect of significantly and non-significantly increasing disease awareness and medication adherence, respectively. Chronic disease management policies at the primary care level that incentivized both patients and physicians improved patient self-management. However, the effects on patients with diabetes and hypertension differed.

38812811,Combination therapy is it in the future for successfully treating peripheral diabetic neuropathy?,"In 2022, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 11.3% of the United States population, 37.3 million people, had diabetes and 38% of the population had prediabetes. A large American study conducted in 2021 and supported by many other studies, concluded that about 47% of diabetes patients have peripheral neuropathy and that diabetic neuropathy was present in 7.5% of patients at the time of diabetes diagnosis. In subjects deemed to be pre-diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance there was a wide range of prevalence estimates (interquartile range (IQR): 6%-34%), but most studies (72%) reported a prevalence of peripheral neuropathy â¥10%. There is no recognized treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) other than good blood glucose control. Good glycemic control slows progression of DPN in patients with type 1 diabetes but for patients with type 2 diabetes it is less effective. With obesity and type 2 diabetes at epidemic levels the need of a treatment for DPN could not be more important. In this article I will first present background information on the ""primary"" mechanisms shown from pre-clinical studies to contribute to DPN and then discuss mono- and combination therapies that have demonstrated efficacy in animal studies and may have success when translated to human subjects. I like to compare the challenge of finding an effective treatment for DPN to the ongoing work being done to treat hypertension. Combination therapy is the recognized approach used to normalize blood pressure often requiring two, three or more drugs in addition to lifestyle modification to achieve the desired outcome. Hypertension, like DPN, is a progressive disease caused by multiple mechanisms. Therefore, it seems likely as well as logical that combination therapy combined with lifestyle adjustments will be required to successfully treat DPN.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,Yorek M,1,1872,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
31794280,Cognitive impairment with diabetes mellitus and metabolic disease: innovative insights with the mechanistic target of rapamycin and circadian clock gene pathways.,"<b>Introduction</b>: Dementia is the 7th leading cause of death that imposes a significant financial and service burden on the global population. Presently, only symptomatic care exists for cognitive loss, such as Alzheimer's disease.<b>Areas covered</b>: Given the advancing age of the global population, it becomes imperative to develop innovative therapeutic strategies for cognitive loss. New studies provide insight to the association of cognitive loss with metabolic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Diabetes mellitus is increasing in incidence throughout the world and affects 350 million individuals. Treatment strategies identifying novel pathways that oversee metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders offer exciting prospects to treat dementia. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and circadian clock gene pathways that include AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), Wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1), erythropoietin (EPO), and silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 <i>(Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) (SIRT1) provide novel strategies to treat cognitive loss that has its basis in metabolic cellular dysfunction.

37504117,Wearable Insulin Biosensors for Diabetes Management: Advances and Challenges.,"We present a critical review of the current progress in wearable insulin biosensors. For over 40 years, glucose biosensors have been used for diabetes management. Measurement of blood glucose is an indirect method for calculating the insulin administration dosage, which is critical for insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Research and development efforts aiming towards continuous-insulin-monitoring biosensors in combination with existing glucose biosensors are expected to offer a more accurate estimation of insulin sensitivity, regulate insulin dosage and facilitate progress towards development of a reliable artificial pancreas, as an ultimate goal in diabetes management and personalised medicine. Conventional laboratory analytical techniques for insulin detection are expensive and time-consuming and lack a real-time monitoring capability. On the other hand, biosensors offer point-of-care testing, continuous monitoring, miniaturisation, high specificity and sensitivity, rapid response time, ease of use and low costs. Current research, future developments and challenges in insulin biosensor technology are reviewed and assessed. Different insulin biosensor categories such as aptamer-based, molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-based, label-free and other types are presented among the latest developments in the field. This multidisciplinary field requires engagement between scientists, engineers, clinicians and industry for addressing the challenges for a commercial, reliable, real-time-monitoring wearable insulin biosensor.",Biosensors,2023-Jul,"Psoma SD, Kanthou C",2,1545,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The management of these patients is not easy and can lead to severe complications such as cerebral venous thrombosis. We present the case of a 21-month-old boy admitted for consciousness disorders revealing a hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state on a new-onset type 1 diabetes and who developed cerebral venous thrombosis. Emergency physicians should be aware of HHS in order to start the appropriate treatment as early as possible and to monitor the potential associated acute complications. This case highlights the importance of decreasing very gradually the osmolarity in order to avoid cerebral complications. Cerebral venous thrombosis in HHS paediatric patients is rarely described, and it is important to recognize that not all episodes of acute neurological deterioration in HHS or diabetic ketoacidosis are caused by cerebral oedema.","Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism",2023-Mar,"Injeyan M, Baron S, Lauzier B, Gaillard-Le Roux B, Denis M",5,1075,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

39546942,'Online boundary-work': How people with diabetes negotiate what counts as legitimate knowledge in Facebook peer support groups.,"People with chronic conditions such as diabetes use social media to interact with peers. While these online interactions allow them to exchange advice and gain insight into how others cope with their condition, concerns about 'misinformation' being shared are persistently raised, especially among medical professionals. Rather than assessing whether information shared on social media is 'correct' from a clinical perspective, we explore how people with diabetes negotiate what counts as legitimate knowledge as they interact in Facebook groups. Empirically, we draw on a six-month observation of interactions in two Danish Facebook groups for people with type 1 and 2 diabetes, including a data sample of 300 posts and 7797 comments. Observations were carried out in 2021. Guided by the concept of boundary-work (Gieryn, 1983), we analyse how members of the Facebook groups demarcate legitimate knowledge from what they deem illegitimate, enacted as they scrutinise peer advice and knowledge claims. We refer to this ongoing process as 'online boundary-work' and draw out three distinct negotiations, specifying how group members (a) recognise sharing of personal experiences as useful but do not necessarily accept them as valid forms of self-management advice, (b) support each other in evaluating medical issues but delegate certain treatment decisions and responsibility to professionals and (c) do not necessarily agree on the most accurate answer but mobilise scientific or professionally managed sources to legitimise or question claims. Our work contributes to the science and technology studies (STS) literature on how social media facilitates a collective space for people with chronic conditions to 'diagnose' issues in daily self-management and reflect on solutions, especially through sharing personal experiences. By demonstrating how these activities involve an ongoing, collective task of negotiating what counts as legitimate knowledge, we elucidate the effort people with diabetes put into upholding peer support groups as digital spaces for solidarity and knowledge useful to daily self-management. However, as we highlight, online boundary-work does not necessarily result in consensus, prevent certain types of advice from being shared or guarantee that answers are considered useful to members or 'correct' from a clinical perspective.",Social science & medicine (1982),2024-Dec,"KjÃ¦rulff EM, NexÃ¸ MA, Papoutsi C, Langstrup H",4,2359,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

38714097,Incremental Healthcare Costs of Diabetes Mellitus in a Middle-Income Country Using Administrative Healthcare Data.,"To estimate the incremental medical cost of diabetes mellitus using information from administrative databases in Colombia. We carried out a retrospective cohort study with administrative health databases from Colombian population affiliated in the contributory health insurance scheme. We used an operative definition to select the cohort with diabetes. Incremental cost and cost ratio of diabetes were estimated using an inverse probability weighting of treatment approach to find the causal effect of having the disease. Weights were calculated by a propensity score method using a Random Forest model. The flexibility of this machine learning algorithm allows to have a better specification and bias reduction. Additionally, we reported incremental costs and cost ratios with confidence intervals using bootstrapping and analyzed costs by age groups and complications associated with diabetes. The estimated prevalence of diabetes was 2834 per 100 000 cases, in 2018. The group with diabetes was comprised 634 015 people and the control group 1 524 808. The calculated annual direct medical cost was $860, for which the incremental cost was $493 and the cost ratio 2.34. The incremental annual cost for some type of complication ranges from $1239 to $2043, renal complication being the most expensive. Incremental cost by age groups ranges from $347 to $878, being higher in younger people.

However, information on foot screening practices among Canadians with diabetes remains sparse. Therefore, we sought to synthesize available data on the frequency and approach to diabetic foot screening across Canada. We conducted a scoping review by searching MEDLINE and Embase databases, alongside a grey literature search, for both English- and French-language reports. Data on patients' demographics, setting as well as the frequency of and approach to foot screening were abstracted. Title and abstract screening, full-text review and data abstraction were conducted in duplicate, with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer.

35993472,A Strategic Investigation on Diabetic Nephropathy; Its Conceptual Model and clinical Manifestations: A Review.,"Diabetes is a major health issue, and its complications can lead to various health problems. Nephropathy has been recognised since the 1930s, when Kimmelstiel and Wilson first reported the characteristic nodular glomerulosclerosis lesions in diabetic kidneys. Diabetic nephropathy (DN), commonly known as diabetic kidney disease, is a condition in which people with diabetes have excessive quantities of urine albumin excretion, diabetic glomerular lesions, and a reduction in their glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Type 1 diabetes (autoimmune -cell destruction and absolute insulin insufficiency), type 2 diabetes (relative insulin deficit and resistance), and others are the three forms of diabetes (e.g., pancreatic disease). Diabetes nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal failure worldwide. Much research has been conducted in both basic science and clinical therapies to enhance the understanding of the mechanism of diabetic nephropathy and expand available therapeutics. Diabetic nephropathy prevention continues to rely on screening for microalbuminuria and treating hyperglycemia. However, several studies suggest that managing diabetic kidney disease is more challenging. Despite comparable hyperglycemic management, some studies suggest that the incidence of renal problems varies by patient. As a result, there has been a great deal of interest in studying the inherent renal protective effects of various antihyperglycemic drugs. This study aims to provide information about the diabetic kidney disease conceptual model, pathogenesis, screening, and diagnosis. It will also address the treatment and prevention of diabetic nephropathy, focusing on comparing the mechanisms, safety profiles, and efficacy of different antihyperglycemic medications.",Current diabetes reviews,2023-,"Wal P, Tyagi S, Pal RS, Yadav A, Jaiswal R",5,1802,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus were searched from inception to September 2023 to identify eligible studies. Observational studies that reported the determinants of and barriers to diabetes care among SMI patients were considered. A narrative synthesis of review results was performed to gather evidence. Recommendations were framed in the context of this evidence. Of the 8727 non-duplicate records, only 10 studies that met the inclusion criteria were considered for this review. Of these, four were cohort, two were case-control, and four were cross-sectional in design. All 10 studies were observed to have robust methodologies. Diabetes measures examined in these studies included not only the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures (HbA1c, retinopathy, nephropathy, and blood pressure), but also lipid, foot, and BMI. Factors contributing to inadequate diabetes care can be attributed to the healthcare system, healthcare providers, and at the patient-level. Currently, there is lack of evidence on determinants of quality diabetes care among SMI patients. Further, adequately powered long term follow-up studies are needed to understand the impact of diabetes care on their clinical outcomes.",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2024-Oct,"Prathiksha AS, Shantaram PM, Rashid M, Poojari PG, Nair S, Acharya LD, Thunga G",7,1534,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
35759735,The Diabetes Prevention Gap And Opportunities To Increase Participation In Effective Interventions.,"To understand the current state of prediabetes burden and treatment in the US, we examined recent trends in prediabetes prevalence, testing, and access to preventive resources. We estimated 13.5Â percent prevalence of diagnosed prediabetes in the overall US adult population, using national survey data. Although prediabetes prevalence increased by 4.8Â percentage points from 2010 to 2020, access to preventive resources remained low. The most effective intervention for diabetes prevention, known as the National Diabetes Prevention Program, remained woefully undersupplied and underused. There are only 2,098 National Diabetes Prevention Program-recognized providers nationally, and only 3Â percent of adults with prediabetes have participated in the program. We suggest three actions to augment prevention efforts: increase payment for prevention interventions to avoid supply distortions, improve data integration and patient follow-up, and extend coverage and broaden access for preventive interventions. These actions, which would require policy-level changes, could lower the barriers to prevention.",Health affairs (Project Hope),2022-Jul,"Alva ML, Chakkalakal RJ, Moin T, Galaviz KI",4,1104,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
39501153,Endothelial dysfunction in prediabetes and diabetes mellitus in patients with normal coronary arteries.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global health issue associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Endothelial dysfunction is a known precursor to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, and its role in the pathogenesis of DM complications is well-documented. There is limited information in the evaluation of endothelial function in prediabetic patients using flow-mediated dilation (FMD), and studies have not excluded patients with known atherosclerosis or coronary artery disease. Thus, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the endothelial functions using FMD from the brachial artery of DM and prediabetes patients who had normal coronary arteries. This study included 73 participants: 25 with DM, 25 with prediabetes, and 23 normoglycemic controls, all with normal coronary arteries on angiography. FMD measurements were conducted following established protocols, and statistical analysis was performed using standard methods to compare FMD levels among groups. The groups were comparable in clinical and demographic characteristics, except for fasting plasma glucose levels. Significant differences in FMD levels were observed: 10.1% in the DM group, 16.5% in the prediabetes group, and 14.8% in the control group (Pâ=â0.004). Diabetic patients had significantly lower FMD levels than both prediabetic and normoglycemic individuals. No significant difference in FMD was found between prediabetic and control groups. Diabetic patients exhibited significant endothelial dysfunction compared to normoglycemic individuals, while prediabetic patients did not show similar dysfunction. These findings suggest a window of opportunity in the prediabetic stage for early intervention to prevent advanced endothelial dysfunction. ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN15351014. Registry date: 23/09/2024.

A cross-sectional descriptive study employing an online survey of 107 adults with type 1 diabetes and 110 adults with type 2 diabetes. A semantic differential scale was used to examine feeling states associated with negative diabetes language. Descriptive statistics including means, standard deviations, and frequencies were calculated for all study variables. For each target word, frequencies of participants who endorsed a positive, neutral, or negative affective response on the sematic differential scale are reported. People with diabetes reported feeling blamed, misunderstood, hopeless, judged, not motivated, and not trusting in response to ""noncompliant,"" ""unmotivated,"" ""in denial,"" ""preventable,"" ""failed,"" ""should,"" ""uncontrolled,"" ""what did you do wrong,"" and ""you could end up blind or on dialysis.""

38526612,A muscarinic receptor antagonist reverses multiple indices of diabetic peripheral neuropathy: preclinical and clinical studies using oxybutynin.,"Preclinical studies indicate that diverse muscarinic receptor antagonists, acting via the M<sub>1</sub> sub-type, promote neuritogenesis from sensory neurons in vitro and prevent and/or reverse both structural and functional indices of neuropathy in rodent models of diabetes. We sought to translate this as a potential therapeutic approach against structural and functional indices of diabetic neuropathy using oxybutynin, a muscarinic antagonist approved for clinical use against overactive bladder. Studies were performed using sensory neurons maintained in vitro, rodent models of typeÂ 1 or type 2 diabetes and human subjects with type 2 diabetes and confirmed neuropathy. Oxybutynin promoted significant neurite outgrowth in sensory neuron cultures derived from adult normal rats and STZ-diabetic mice, with maximal efficacy in the 1-100Â nmol/l range. This was accompanied by a significantly enhanced mitochondrial energetic profile as reflected by increased basal and maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity. Systemic (3-10Â mg/kg/day s.c.) and topical (3% gel daily) oxybutynin reversed paw heat hypoalgesia in the STZ and db/db mouse models of diabetes and reversed paw tactile allodynia in STZ-diabetic rats. Loss of nerve profiles in the skin and cornea of db/db mice was also prevented by daily topical delivery of 3% oxybutynin for 8Â weeks. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled interventional trial was performed in subjects with type 2 diabetes and established peripheral neuropathy. Subjects received daily topical treatment with 3% oxybutynin gel or placebo for 6Â months. The a priori designated primary endpoint, significant change in intra-epidermal nerve fibre density (IENFD) in skin biopsies taken before and after 20Â weeks of treatments, was met by oxybutynin but not placebo. Secondary endpoints showing significant improvement with oxybutynin treatment included scores on clinical neuropathy, pain and quality of life scales. This proof-of-concept study indicates that muscarinic antagonists suitable for long-term use may offer a novel therapeutic opportunity for treatment of diabetic neuropathy.

Integrated care for TB/DM is still in the early phase in the country and can be considerably enhanced by understanding and addressing the challenges identified from stakeholders' perspectives. This study explored the challenges and opportunities at individual, health system and policy level for integrated care of TB/DM comorbidities in India. We used an outlier case study approach and conducted stakeholder interviews and focus group discussions with relevant program personnel including field staff and program managers of TB and DM control programs as well as officials of partners in Indian states, Kerala and Bihar. The integrated management requires strengthening the laboratory diagnosis and drug management components of the two individual programs for TB and DM. Focused training and sensitization of healthcare workers in public and private sector across all levels is essential. A district level management unit that coordinates the two vertical programs with a horizontal integration at the primary care level is the way forward.

33121986,Implicating the effect of ketogenic diet as a preventive measure to obesity and diabetes mellitus.,"Obesity and diabetes are the two major metabolic complications linked with bad eating habits and the sedentary (lazy) lifestyle. In the worst-case situation, metabolic problems are a causative factor for numerous other conditions. There is also an increased demand to control the emergence of such diseases. Dietary and lifestyle improvements contribute to their leadership at an elevated level. The present review, therefore, recommends the use of the ketogenic diet (KD) in obesity and diabetes treatment. The KD involves a diet that replaces glucose sugar with ketone bodies and is effective in numerous diseases, such as metabolic disorders, epileptic seizures, autosomal dominant polycystic disease of the kidney, cancers, peripheral neuropathy, and skeletal muscle atrophy. A lot of high profile pathways are available for KD action, including sustaining the metabolic actions on glucose sugar, suppressing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, altering homeostasis of the systemic ketone bodies, contributing to lowering diabetic hyperketonemia, and others. The KD regulates the level of glucose sugar and insulin and can thus claim to be an effective diabetes approach.

A narrative review.,"To summarize the history, development and efficacy of diabetes self-management education on glycaemic control and mental health in adults and children or adolescents with type 1 diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes. A further aim was to review the status of implementation of diabetes self-management education into routine care and outline current gaps in implementation and research. We searched PubMed and Google scholar for German- and English-language articles regarding diabetes self-management education, glycaemic control and mental health, and restricted this search to meta-analyses. Diabetes education has evolved from a compliance- and knowledge-oriented approach to an empowerment- and self-management-oriented approach. Diabetes self-management education seems to have a greater impact on glycaemic outcomes than on mental healthÂ outcomes, but the latter are rarely assessed. Technological development and digitalization can provide chances and challenges for diabetes self-management education. Digital solutions show promising results and great potential for improving the efficacy of diabetes self-management education further and providing ongoing support. The implementation of diabetes self-management education into routine clinical care frequently remains a challenge.

The major challenging issue in diabetes management is the prevention of various complications that remain the leading cause of diabetes-related mortality. Moreover, the limited long-term durability of monotherapy and undesirable side effects of currently used anti-diabetic drugs underlie the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. Phytochemicals represent a rich source of plant-derived molecules that are of pivotal importance to the identification of compounds with therapeutic potential. In this review, we aim to discuss recent advances in the identification of a large array of phytochemicals with immense potential in the management of diabetes and its complications. Given that metabolic inflammation has been established as a key pathophysiological event that drives the progression of diabetes, we focus on the protective effects of representative phytochemicals in metabolic inflammation.

37963648,Patient-reported outcome measures in diabetes outpatient care: a scoping review.,"Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are increasingly used in clinical diabetes care to increase patient involvement and improve healthcare services. The objectives were to identify instruments used to measure PROs in outpatient diabetes clinics and to investigate the use of these PRO measures alongside the experiences of patients and healthcare personnel in a clinical setting. A scoping review was conducted according to the framework of Arksey and O'Malley with scoping searches of Cinahl, EMBASE, Medline and Health and Psychosocial Instruments. Studies reporting on adults with diabetes in a clinical setting where the PRO measure response directly affected patient care were eligible for inclusion. In total, 35â197 citations were identified, of which 7 reports presenting 4 different PRO measures were included in the review. All four of the included items measured psychosocial aspects of diabetes, and three included elements of the Problem Areas in Diabetes scale. All the patients were satisfied with the use of PRO measures in clinical care, whereas the level of satisfaction among healthcare personnel with PRO measures varied within and among studies. The limited number of eligible studies in this review suggests that research on PRO measures for diabetes outpatient care is scarce. Patients welcome the opportunity to express their concerns through the systematic collection of PRO measures, and some healthcare personnel value the broader insight that PRO measures provide into the impact of diabetes on patients' lives. However, the heterogeneity among services and among patients challenges the implementation of PRO measures.

Treating DFUs with surgical procedures such as synthetic or biological skin grafts or skin substitutes has several limitations, where none of the currently available skin substitutes is ideal. OVID/Medline and PubMed databases were searched using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) or Title/Abstract words (""diabetic foot ulcers"", ""skin substitutes"", and ""nanofibers""), to identify published research studies on DFUs and nanofibers. Electrospinning nanotechnology is being used in the biomedical field to produce polymeric nanofibers impregnated with drugs for wound healing, burns and diabetic ulcers. Those nanofibers also enable seeding of cells into them and culturing them inÂ vitro to synthesize tissue-like structures. Knowing the advantages of generating patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and organoids in three-dimension (3D), including skin organoids, it is worth mingling these technologies to develop tissue-engineered biological skin substitutes.

36792169,"Knowledge, attitude, and practice toward pre-diabetes among the public, patients with pre-diabetes and healthcare professionals: a systematic review.","The prevalence of pre-diabetes is increasing globally, affecting an estimated 552 million people by 2030. While lifestyle interventions are the first line of defense against progression toward diabetes, information on barriers toward pre-diabetes management and how to overcome these barriers are scarce. This systematic review describes the publics' and healthcare professionals' knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) toward pre-diabetes and determines the barriers toward pre-diabetes management. A systematic search for studies examining KAP towards pre-diabetes was conducted in six databases from inception to September 2022. Studies that quantitatively assessed at least two KAP elements using questionnaires were included. The quality of studies was assessed using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Barriers and enablers were identified and mapped onto the Capability, Motivation, and Behaviour model to identify factors that influence behavior change. Twenty-one articles that surveyed 8876 participants were included in this review. Most of the reviews (n=13) were directed to healthcare professionals. Overall, positive attitudes toward diabetes prevention efforts were observed, although there were still knowledge deficits and poor behavior toward pre-diabetes management. Barriers and enablers were detected at patients (eg, goals and intention), healthcare professionals (eg, clinical judgement) and system (eg, access and resources) levels. The use of different survey instruments to assess KAP prevented a head-to-head comparison between studies. Most studies conducted among patients were from middle-income countries, while among healthcare professionals (HCPs) were from high-income countries, which may produce some biasness. Nevertheless, the development of pre-diabetes intervention should focus on: (1) increasing knowledge on pre-diabetes and its management; (2) imparting practical skills to manage pre-diabetes; (3) providing resources for lifestyle management; (4) improving the accessibility of lifestyle management programs; and (5) other HCPs and human support to pre-diabetes management.",BMJ open diabetes research & care,2023-Feb,"Teoh KW, Ng CM, Chong CW, Bell JS, Cheong WL, Lee SWH",6,2171,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
38065628,Post-transplant diabetes mellitus: Findings in nutritional status and body composition.,"Weight gain and changes in body composition are associated with the onset of diabetes after kidney transplantation, and detailing these changes can help prevent this situation. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation and changes in the nutritional status and body composition in patients with diabetes one year from surgery. This survey was a single-center, prospective cohort study. Twenty-nine patients over 18 years old who underwent isolated kidney transplantation, without diabetes, were included and followed up for one year. At hospital discharge after transplantation and one year later, anthropometric (weight, height and abdominal circumference), body composition (electrical bioimpedance), routine biochemical and dietary intake assessments were performed. Most of the patients were male (75%), and the mean age was 48.0Â±11.8 years old. In the first-year post-surgery 27.6% of patients had DM and the diagnosis was made, on average, 4 months after transplantation. The group with diabetes had, from the beginning to the end of the study, greater weight and body fat, especially abdominal fat. The non-diabetic group, after one year, showed an increase in phase angle, body weight and body masses, more pronounced of fat-free mass, when compared with fat mass gain. Both groups showed weight gain, but in the non-diabetic group these changes can be interpreted as an improvement in the nutritional profile. Metabolic abnormalities associated with immunosuppression and eating habits, combination that maintains increased the risk for diabetes for long time, keeping this group with priority in nutritional care.","Endocrinologia, diabetes y nutricion",2023-Dec,"Pereira Barretto L, Moreira Gomes P, Rossin Guidorizzi N, Moyses Neto M, Almeida Romao E, Garcia Chiarello P",6,1672,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

This review is timely and relevant because it allows an update for the early and correct classification of glucose abnormalities in cystic fibrosis and because it favours an appropriate therapeutic approach. Confirm that Oral Glucose Tolerance Test is still the diagnostic gold standard despite the advent of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems; this latter is spreading very rapidly, however, to date, there is still no strong evidence to hypothesize the use of CGM for diagnostic purposes. CGM has indeed proven to be very useful in managing and guiding CFRD therapy. Tailored and personalized insulin therapy is still the recommended therapy for children and adolescents with CFRD, although nutritional intervention and oral hypoglycaemic treatment are equally important and efficacious. Finally CFTR modulators have allowed the increase of the life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients and have proven effective not only in improving the pulmonary function and the nutritional status but also the glucose control.",Current opinion in pediatrics,2023-Aug,"Schiaffini R, Pampanini V",2,1300,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

This study aimed to explore perceptions of healthcare providers across Europe concerning 1) the impact of covid-19 on delivery of diabetes care; 2) impact of changes in diabetes care on experienced workload; 3) experiences with video consultation in diabetes care. Cross-sectional survey among healthcare providers in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Turkey, Ukraine and Sweden, with a focus on primary care. The survey was completed by 180 healthcare providers. During the COVID-19 pandemic 57.1% of respondents provided less diabetes care and 72.8% observed a negative impact on people with diabetes. More than half of respondents (61.9%) expressed worries to some extent about getting overloaded by work. Although the vast majority considered their work meaningful (85.6%). Almost half of healthcare providers (49.4%) thought that after the pandemic video-consultation could be blended with face-to-face contact. Less diabetes care was delivered and a negative impact on people with diabetes was observed by healthcare providers. Despite healthcare providers' feeling overloaded, mental wellbeing seemed unaffected. Video consultations were seen as having potential. Given the remaining covid-19 risks and from the interest of proactive management of people with diabetes, these findings urge for further exploration of incorporating video consultation in diabetes care.",Primary care diabetes,2023-Apr,"Van Grondelle SE, Van Bruggen S, Rauh SP, Van der Zwan M, Cebrian A, Seidu S, Rutten GEHM, Vos HMM, Numans ME, Vos RC",10,1431,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The reported incidence of NODAT varies from 14 to 37% in renal transplant recipients worldwide; however, NODAT is yet to be studied in the Irish renal transplant population. Primary aims of this project were to estimate the incidence, to determine associated risk factors and to assess the long-term consequences of NODAT on graft survival and patient survival in the Irish renal transplant population. Retrospective data collection of 415 renal transplant recipients over a 12-year period was performed to record presence of NODAT, patient characteristics and perioperative management. Preoperative screening was reviewed in a subgroup of patients to determine concordance with the International Consensus Guidelines. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier survival functions estimating NODAT detection over time, graft and patient survival. Risk factor association was determined using Cox proportional-hazards models. NODAT incidence was 10.2% in the first 5Â years of post-transplant. Risk factors for developing NODAT were recipient age and body weight. Risk of NODAT was highest in the first year of post-transplant and conferred decreased patient survival; however, it did not significantly affect graft survival. Only seven patients of a subgroup of 21 patients who developed NODAT had preoperative testing for diabetes. NODAT incidence in the Irish renal transplant population is slightly below international figures.

The presence of a comorbidity was associated with increased specialist claims for type 1 diabetes (IRR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.03-1.10]) and decreased claims for type 2 diabetes (IRR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.67-0.87]). Pooling diagnosis groups and adjusted for covariates, each additional specialist claim was associated with increased odds of a claim with a diabetes care and education specialist (odds ratio [OR], 1.31 [95% CI, 1.25-1.36]), dietitian (OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.09-1.19]), and behavioral health clinician (OR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.12-1.20]). For acute care claims, each additional specialist claim was associated with increased odds of admission (OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.11-1.24]) but not for emergency claims (OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.98-1.82]). This cross-sectional study found that youths with type 2 diabetes were significantly less likely to have specialist claims despite insurance coverage, indicating other barriers to care, which may include medical complexity.

35728217,Establishing a database of patients with diabetes and an interest in research participation.,"To establish interest in medical research and student training, based on demographics of those attending public-funded diabetes services and types of research. Patients who attended the Auckland Diabetes Centre (ADC) between July 2018 and July 2019 were invited via text message (SMS) to register their interest in being contacted for future health research projects and medical training. Consenting adults were enrolled in the Auckland Diabetes Centre Volunteer Database (ADCVD) and sent a survey on the acceptability of various types of research and factors influencing participation. Relationships between ADCVD enrolment and other variables were determined using Fisher's exact test. Qualitative data were coded to generate key themes using an inductive approach. Of 2,884 patients contacted, 527 were enrolled in the ADCVD (response rate: 18.3%); and of these, 176 completed surveys (response rate: 33.3%). Most respondents were NZ European (n=92, 52.3%), male (n=125, 70.6%), and from the least deprived areas (n=35, 19.9%). The type of research did not affect interest.

32097907,Recent Epidemiological Status of Ocular and Other Major Complications Related to Diabetes Mellitus in Japan.,"To investigate the epidemiological status of diabetes mellitus (DM)-related complications in Japan. The subjects were 3.11 million Japanese individuals who were registered in the Japanese claim database between 2005 and 2014. Subjects with a diagnosis associated with codes related to DM and/or DM-related complications as classified by the International Classification of Diseases version 10 and those who were prescribed any therapeutic agents for DM were considered to have DM. The status of ocular, renal, and neural complications was investigated. A total of 66,923 patients with DM were included. The prevalence of subjects with DM was 3.8% in 2005 and 4.2% in 2014. The most frequent complication was diabetic retinopathy (23.6%, 95% CI: 21.7-25.5%), followed by diabetic nephropathy (14.8%, 95% CI: 14.0-15.6%) and diabetic neuropathy (4.9%, 95% CI: 4.5-5.3%). Among the subjects with ocular complications, 1.8% had proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 1.1% had diabetic macular edema (DME), 0.3% had neovascular glaucoma, and 1.5% had vitreous hemorrhage. Only DME significantly increased during the study period. The frequencies of the ocular and neural complications significantly decreased, while that of renal complications significantly increased during the study period. Ocular complications were the most common DM-related major complications in Japan. Notably, DME significantly increased in recent years.",Ophthalmologica. Journal international d'ophtalmologie.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between GV metrics and the risk of developing DPN. Nine studies totaling 3,649 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. A significant association was found between increased GV, as indicated by metrics including standard deviation (SD) with OR and 95% CI of 2.58 (1.45-4.57), mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) with OR and 95% CI of 1.90 (1.01-3.58), mean of daily difference (MODD) with OR and 95% CI of 2.88 (2.17-3.81) and the incidence of DPN. Our findings support a link between higher GV and an increased risk of DPN in patients with diabetes. These findings highlight the potential of GV metrics as indicators for the development of DPN, advocating for their inclusion in diabetes management strategies to potentially mitigate neuropathy risk. Longitudinal studies with longer observation periods and larger sample sizes are necessary to validate these associations across diverse populations.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,2024-Jul,"Jia Y, Long D, Yang Y, Wang Q, Wu Q, Zhang Q",6,1264,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

This is a cross-sectional study, with data from a representative sample of the Brazilian population, taken from the National Health Survey(PNS 2014/2015). Outcomes were defined based on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements, self-reported DM diagnosis, and use of hypoglycemic agents or insulin. The proportion of DM awareness, treatment, and control was estimated according to sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, and access to health services, and their respective 95% confidence intervals. DM prevalence in the Brazilian population was of 8.6% (95%CI: 7.8-9.3): 68.2% (95%CI: 63.9-72.3) were aware of their diagnosis, 92.2% (95%CI: 88.6-94.7) of those who were aware were undergoing drug treatments, and, of these, 35.8% (95%CI: 30.5-41.6) had controlled HbA1c levels. The proportions of DM awareness, control, and treatment were lower in men aged 18 to 39 years, individuals with low education, without health insurance, and beneficiaries of the Bolsa FamÃ­lia program. Approximately one in ten Brazilians has DM. A little more than half of this population is aware of their diagnosis, a condition measured by HbA1c dosage and clinical diagnosis.

The study included 40 DM and 38 non-DM patients. The DM status, HbA1c levels, baseline fasting blood glucose (FBG) level, and post-injection 1-, 7-, 15-, and 21-day FBG levels were evaluated retrospectively. The FBG levels were significantly higher 1 and 7 day after the glucocorticoid injection as compared with the baseline levels (P = 0.001 and <0.001, respectively). The increase was greatest in DM patients and then returned to baseline levels 15-day post-injection. In terms of the mean difference in post-injection and baseline FBG levels, the increase on day 1 was statistically significantly greater in the DM group as compared with that in the non-DM group (P = 0.01). Linear regression model showed that only the baseline FBG level predicted the glucose level 1-day post-treatment (Î² = 0.839, P < 0.01). Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections can safely be administered as a treatment for adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder in patients with well-controlled DM. Baseline FBG levels may predict peak blood glucose levels in patients with well-controlled DM. We recommend that DM patients with adhesive capsulitis should undergo frequent monitoring of blood glucose in the 2 week following intraarticular glucocorticoid injection treatment.",Nigerian journal of clinical practice,2021-Feb,"Akin-Takmaz S, Babaoglu G, BaÅar H, BaltacÄ± B",4,1505,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
36604111,<i>TXNIP</i> DNA methylation is associated with glycemic control over 28 years in type 1 diabetes: findings from the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC) study.,"DNA methylation (DNAme) has been cross-sectionally associated with type 2 diabetes and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in the general population. However, longitudinal data and data in type 1 diabetes are currently very limited. Thus, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in an observational type 1 diabetes cohort to identify loci with DNAme associated with concurrent and future HbA1cs, as well as other clinical risk factors, over 28 years. Whole blood DNAme in 683 597 CpGs was analyzed in the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications study of childhood onset (<17 years) type 1 diabetes (n=411). An EWAS of DNAme beta values and concurrent HbA1c was performed using linear models adjusted for diabetes duration, sex, pack years of smoking, estimated cell type composition variables, and technical/batch covariates. A longitudinal EWAS of subsequent repeated HbA1c measures was performed using mixed models. We further identified methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) for significant CpGs and conducted a Mendelian randomization. DNAme at cg19693031 (Chr 1, <i>Thioredoxin-Interacting Protein</i> (<i>TXNIP</i>)) and cg21534330 (Chr 17, <i>Casein Kinase 1 Isoform Delta</i>) was significantly inversely associated with concurrent HbA1c. In longitudinal analyses, hypomethylation of cg19693031 was associated with consistently higher HbA1c over 28 years, and with higher triglycerides, pulse rate, and albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) independently of HbA1c. We further identified 34 meQTLs in <i>SLC2A1/SLC2A1-AS1</i> significantly associated with cg19693031 DNAme. Our results extend prior findings that <i>TXNIP</i> hypomethylation relates to worse glycemic control in type 1 diabetes by demonstrating the association persists over the long term. Additionally, the associations with triglycerides, pulse rate, and ACR suggest <i>TXNIP</i> DNAme could play a role in vascular damage independent of HbA1c. These findings strengthen potential for interventions targeting TXNIP to improve glycemic control in type 1 diabetes through its role in <i>SLC2A1</i>/glucose transporter 1-mediated glucose regulation.",BMJ open diabetes research & care,2023-Jan,"Miller RG, Mychaleckyj JC, Onengut-Gumuscu S, Orchard TJ, Costacou T",5,2135,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
32613289,Importance of Identifying Novel Biomarkers of Microvascular Damage in Type 1 Diabetes.,"Microvascular complications of type 1 diabetes, which primarily include diabetic kidney disease, retinopathy, and neuropathy, are characterized by damage to the microvasculature of the kidney, retina, and neurons. The pathogenesis of these complications is multifactorial, and several pathways are implicated. These complications are often silent during their early stages, and once symptoms develop, there might be little to be done to cure them. Thus, there is a strong need for novel biomarkers to identify individuals at risk of microvascular complications at an early stage and guide the implementation of new therapeutic options for preventing their development and progression. Recent advancements in proteomics, metabolomics, and other 'omics' have led to the identification of several potential biomarkers of microvascular complications. However, biomarker discovery has met several challenges and, up to now, there are no new biomarkers that have been implemented into clinical practice. This highlights the need for further work in this area to move towards better diagnostic and prognostic approaches.",Molecular diagnosis & therapy,2020-Oct,Marcovecchio ML,1,1113,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
33957141,Interdisciplinary assessment and diagnostic algorithm: The role of the diabetologist.,"In recent years, many studies have revealed the importance of heart failure (HF) development in type 2 diabetes (T2D), which increases the morbidity and mortality during the course of diabetes. In this context, it became important to emphasize the role of both cardiologists and diabetologists in the early diagnosis and further adequate treatment of HF in T2D. While HF appears in two major forms, with reduced or preserved ejection fraction (EF), namely HFrEF and HFpEF, it became important to define the optimal approach to the diagnostics. Regarding HFrEF, the role of cardiological methods remained dominant, while the complexity of early diagnosis requires nowadays more active participation of diabetologists. The absence of abundant symptoms and echocardiographic findings imposed the need for the use of risk markers based on metabolic variables and low-grade inflammation parameters. Following that unmet need, numerous studies have defined the possible relationship between metabolic variables in diabetes and the risk for HF. Moreover, attempts have been made to integrate biochemical and clinical parameters into risk score engines and some of them gave promising results. However, the follow-up studies in T2D subjects are needed to determine the clinical relevance of these new approaches.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,2021-Jun,Lalic NM,1,1304,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
32634859,Histological validation of a type 1 diabetes clinical diagnostic model for classification of diabetes.,"Misclassification of diabetes is common due to an overlap in the clinical features of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Combined diagnostic models incorporating clinical and biomarker information have recently been developed that can aid classification, but they have not been validated using pancreatic pathology. We evaluated a clinical diagnostic model against histologically defined type 1 diabetes. We classified cases from the Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) biobank as type 1 (nÂ =Â 111) or non-type 1 (nÂ =Â 42) diabetes using histopathology. Type 1 diabetes was defined by lobular loss of insulin-containing islets along with multiple insulin-deficient islets. We assessed the discriminative performance of previously described type 1 diabetes diagnostic models, based on clinical features (age at diagnosis, BMI) and biomarker data [autoantibodies, type 1 diabetes genetic risk score (T1D-GRS)], and singular features for identifying type 1 diabetes by the area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic (AUC-ROC). Diagnostic models validated well against histologically defined type 1 diabetes. The model combining clinical features, islet autoantibodies and T1D-GRS was strongly discriminative of type 1 diabetes, and performed better than clinical features alone (AUC-ROC 0.97 vs. 0.95; PÂ =Â 0.03). Histological classification of type 1 diabetes was concordant with serum C-peptide [median <Â 17Â pmol/l (limit of detection) vs. 1037Â pmol/l in non-type 1 diabetes; PÂ <Â 0.0001]. Our study provides robust histological evidence that a clinical diagnostic model, combining clinical features and biomarkers, could improve diabetes classification. Our study also provides reassurance that a C-peptide-based definition of type 1 diabetes is an appropriate surrogate outcome that can be used in large clinical studies where histological definition is impossible.

Understanding their experiences is essential for developing effective diabetes care interventions. The study employed a qualitative narrative inquiry. Participants were identified at a diabetes clinic at a tertiary-level healthcare facility. Ten participants from the rural areas attending the diabetes clinic were purposively selected. Data were collected through in-depth interviews in the privacy of the homes of the study participants and analysis was done using the Riessman approach to thematic narrative analysis. In this study, the following four themes emerged: (1) the long pathway to a diagnosis of diabetes; (2) Poverty-related hardships and diabetic clinic attendance; (3) The impact of health worker attitudes and behavior on diabetes care; and (4) Low resources and their impact on self-management. Rural-based patients living with diabetes encounter enormous challenges as they access diabetes care. One of the challenges is delayed diagnosis of diabetes. There is a need to introduce point-of-care (POC) testing to improve diabetes diagnosis. In addition, there is a need to strengthen awareness campaigns among the population so that people are well informed about the signs and symptoms of diabetes to promote early diagnosis.

34987478,The Role of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells-Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles in Diabetes and Its Chronic Complications.,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are applied in regenerative medicine of several tissues and organs nowadays by virtue of their self-renewal capabilities, multiple differentiation capacity, potent immunomodulatory properties, and their ability to be favourably cultured and manipulated. With the continuous development of ""cell-free therapy"" research, MSC-derived small extracellular vesicles (MSC-sEVs) have increasingly become a research hotspot in the treatment of various diseases. Small extracellular vesicles (SEVs) are membrane vesicles with diameters of 30 to 150 nm that mediate signal transduction between adjacent or distal cells or organs by delivering non-coding RNA, protein, and DNA. The contents and effects of sEVs vary depending on the properties of the originating cell. In recent years, MSC-sEVs have been found to play an important role in the occurrence and development of diabetes mellitus as a new way of communication between cells. Diabetes mellitus is a common metabolic disease in clinic. Its complications of the heart, brain, kidney, eyes, and peripheral nerves are a serious threat to human health and has been a hot issue for clinicians. MSC-sEVs could be applied to repair or prevent damage from the complications of diabetes mellitus through anti-inflammatory effects, reduction of endoplasmic reticulum-related protein stress, polarization of M2 macrophages, and increasing autophagy. Therefore, we highly recommend that MSC-sEVs-based therapies to treat diabetes mellitus and its chronic complication be further explored. The analysis of the role and molecular mechanisms of MSC-sEVs in diabetes and its related complications will provide new idea and insights for the prevention and treatment of diabetes.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2021-,"Li FX, Lin X, Xu F, Shan SK, Guo B, Lei LM, Zheng MH, Wang Y, Xu QS, Yuan LQ",10,1742,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Regular users of analgesics included those using prescription analgesics â¥Â 15 days per month at least 6 times over 2 years after the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (baseline). The effectiveness of analgesics in patients with diabetes was evaluated using metformin adherence and three models: model 1 was adjusted for age and sex; model 2 was further adjusted for body mass index (BMI), exercise, cholesterol, hypertension, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI); and model 3 was further adjusted for analgesics. Based on stringent extraction criteria, the sample had a cancer incidence of 4.6%. The hazard ratios of models 1 and 2 were 0.830 and 0.865, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for all variables, including acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen, was 0.871 (model 3). Regular use of analgesics by patients with diabetes decreased their risk of subsequent cancer development in this large national cohort.

38265639,Yoga or Mindfulness on Diabetes: Scoping Review for Theoretical Experimental Framework.,"About one in 11 adults worldwide suffers from diabetic disease with constantly increasing prevalence; from the 529 million patients registered in 2021, the number of people with diabetes was predicted to rise to approximately 1.31 billion in 2050. In Italy, 5.9% of the population is diabetic, with a higher prevalence with increasing age and in the South of the country. Yoga and Mindfulness could represent a valid support for the care of diabetic subjects especially in a stressful caring context such as the Covid-19 pandemic. A scoping review was conducted to achieve the goals of the study. Yoga or Mindfulness interventions on diabetic subjects were specifically analyzed and qualitative-quantitative data collected in the selected randomized controlled trials were extensive for possible meta-analysis. The review was conducted by two independent practitioners and a third one was consulted in case of conflict. The PRISMA method was used for both the selection and reporting of the studies to be included. Specific PICOS and search strategies have been developed on PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO databases. Included in the review were: randomised controlled trials, full dissertation articles and papers in English with a time limit on May 31, 2022.

39425096,Altered RBC deformability in diabetes: clinical characteristics and RBC pathophysiology.,"Reduced red blood cell deformability (RBCD) is associated with diabetic vascular complications, but early pathophysiological RBC changes and predictive demographic and clinical factors in populations with diabetes are unclear. An understanding of early diabetes-specific RBC changes associated with impaired RBCD is essential in investigating mechanisms that predispose to diabetic vascular complications. We conducted an outpatient cross-sectional study of participants in a well-controlled diabetes cohort (N81) and nondiabetic controls (N78) at the National Institutes of Health. First, between-group differences in RBCD measures were assessed with shear stress-gradient ektacytometry. Differences in structural RBC parameters were assessed using osmotic gradient ektacytometry and NaCl osmotic fragility. Functional RBC changes were assessed using hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation: p50. All shear-stress gradient RBCD measures were significantly altered in the diabetes cohort vs. nondiabetic controls, even after adjustment for confounding covariates (pâ<â0.001). Adjusted for diabetes-status and demographic factors, significant predictors of reduced RBCD included older age, Black race, male gender, hyperglycemia, and vascular complications (all pâ<â0.05). Reduced RBCD was also associated with aberrant osmotic-gradient parameters, with a left-shift on osmotic gradient profile indicative of dehydrated RBCs in diabetes. A structure-function relationship was observed with reduced RBCD associated with reduced osmotic fragility (Pâ<â0.001) and increased hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation (Pâ<â0.01). Findings suggest impaired RBCD incurs similar demographic and clinical risk factors as diabetic vascular disease, with early pathophysiological RBC changes indicative of disordered RBC hydration in diabetes. Findings provide strong evidence for disordered oxygen release as a functional consequence of reduced RBCD.

A total of 11,441 participants aged 50-60 years from the Health and Retirement Study with at least 2 self-reported BMI records were included. Individual BMI trajectories representing average BMI changes per year were generated using multilevel modeling. Adjusted risk ratios (ARRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. Associations between BMI trajectories and diabetes risk in participants with different genetic risks were estimated for 5,720 participants of European ancestry. BMI trajectories were significantly associated with diabetes risk in older age (slowly increasing vs. stable: ARR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.54; rapidly increasing vs. stable: ARR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.25, 1.79).

This pilot study used a randomized controlled trial design with mixed-methods evaluation and was conducted in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, a southern state of India. All the 120 patients newly diagnosed with TB from 10 participating villages were screened for DM and associated cardiovascular risk factors. Non-physician health workers were trained to follow-up patients for a period of 8 months to encourage treatment adherence, monitor treatment response including blood glucose levels and provide lifestyle advice. The intervention was well-accepted by the providers and patients. However, there were no statistically significant variations observed for mean blood glucose levels (mean [SD]: 5.3 [-23.3 to 33.8]) of patients for both intervention and control group participants in this feasibility study. Awareness about diabetes and tuberculosis comorbidity and cardiovascular risk increased among the non-physician health workers in the intervention arm of the study. The co-management of TB-DM is acceptable to both the health providers and patients. With appropriate training, availability of infrastructure and planned intervention implementation, it is feasible to co-manage TB-DM within the existing primary health care system in India.",Frontiers in public health,2022-,"Joshi R, Behera D, Di Tanna GL, Ameer MA, Yakubu K, Praveen D",6,1935,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

This is a descriptive study with a clinical assessment element. Data were collected using a number of validated psychometric questionnaires that assess the participant's foot self care behavior, acceptance of Illness, symptoms and neuropathy. The study included 246 patients diagnosed with type 2 DM attending a designated family health center in Konya, Turkey. In the present study, there was a significant difference between DFSBS scores and gender and whether the patients resided in urban or rural areas (p < 0.05). A significant difference between AIS score and gender, educational status, social security, place of residence, and economic status of the participants was observed (p < 0.05). According to the results of regression analysis, gender, frequency of physician control visit (monthly), and foot care training predicted the DFSBS score, whereas gender, education, economic status, presence of other non-infectious diseases, hospitalization in the previous year, and OTNS results predicted the AIS score. Furthermore, the AIS and OTNS scores predicted the MNSI-Q score. In the family health centers, individuals who are at risk must be initially identified and efforts should be made to prevent complications and increase illness acceptance.",Primary care diabetes,2020-Oct,"Åahin S, Cingil D",2,1515,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
33431598,Service user and community clinician design of a partially virtual diabetic service improves access to care and education and reduces amputation incidence.,"Design of an integrated diabetes service based on needs of service users (persons living with diabetes) and community clinicians in a semirural low-income health district of the UK. One hundred and eighty-five service users engaged through public meetings, questionnaires and focus groups. General practice staff contributed views through workshops and questionnaires. Analysis of feedback indicated service user needs for better access to education, dietary advice and foot care. General practice staff endorsed these views and requested regular access to secondary care in the community. Seven hundred persons registered with diabetes attended eight well-being events in the community. From 2017 virtual practice multidisciplinary patient reviews, virtual referral of foot cases and non-face-to-face helplines were developed. A National Health Service (NHS) approved 'App' and web-based personalized education support for those recently diagnosed with diabetes was introduced. Engagement in education for those recently diagnosed with diabetes increased from 5% to 71%. Weight and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels before and 6 months after starting the program were 99.4Â±25 and 95.5Â±24.2 kg and 59.3Â±16 and 54.8Â±12.9 mmol/mol, respectively, p=0.00003 and 0.003. Of those engaging at well-being events, 44 had missed regular follow-up. One hundred and seventy-five cases were reviewed virtually with practice staff by the secondary care team avoiding referral to the hospital diabetic clinic. One hundred and seventy-six referrals were made to the virtual multidisciplinary diabetic foot team clinic. Major amputation incidence declined from 13 to 3 major procedures/10 000 per annum and minor amputation from 26 to 18/10 000. Percentage bed day occupancy by persons with diabetes fell significantly in the district general hospital. Integrated community-based diabetes care delivery has been achieved with partially virtual reviews.

36012395,Fast Tacrolimus Metabolism Does Not Promote Post-Transplant Diabetes Mellitus after Kidney Transplantation.,"Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) after kidney transplantation induced by tacrolimus is an important issue. Fast tacrolimus metabolism, which can be estimated by concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratio, is associated with increased nephrotoxicity and unfavorable outcomes after kidney transplantation. Herein, we elucidate whether fast tacrolimus metabolism also increases the risk for PTDM. Data from 596 non-diabetic patients treated with tacrolimus-based immunosuppression at the time of kidney transplantation between 2007 and 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. The median follow-up time after kidney transplantation was 4.7 years (IQR 4.2 years). Our analysis was complemented by experimental modeling of fast and slow tacrolimus metabolism kinetics in cultured insulin-producing pancreatic cells (INS-1 cells). During the follow-up period, 117 (19.6%) patients developed PTDM. Of all patients, 210 (35.2%) were classified as fast metabolizers (C/D ratio < 1.05 ng/mL Ã 1/mg). Fast tacrolimus metabolizers did not have a higher incidence of PTDM than slow tacrolimus metabolizers (p = 0.496). Consistent with this, insulin secretion and the viability of tacrolimus-treated INS-1 cells exposed to 12 h of tacrolimus concentrations analogous to the serum profiles of fast or slow tacrolimus metabolizers or to continuous exposure did not differ (p = 0.286). In conclusion, fast tacrolimus metabolism is not associated with increased incidence of PTDM after kidney transplantation, either in vitro or in vivo. A short period of incubation of INS-1 cells with tacrolimus using different concentration profiles led to comparable effects on cell viability and insulin secretion in vitro. Consistent with this, in our patient, collective fast Tac metabolizers did not show a higher PTDM incidence compared to slow metabolizers.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022-Aug,"Jehn U, Wiedmer N, Boeckel GR, PavenstÃ¤dt H, ThÃ¶lking G, Reuter S",6,1827,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
37269942,The effect of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy in type II diabetes mellitus patients: A clinical trial.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most threatening complications of diabetes and a leading cause of visual loss in working-age population. Although exercise is beneficial in diabetes, previous studies have showed contradictory and inconclusive results on how it effects DR. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In this before-after clinical trial, 40 patients with diabetic retinopathy were enrolled by convenient sampling method in Shahid Labbafinejad Hospital in Tehran during 2021-2022. Before the intervention, central macular thickness (CMT, microns) measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fasting blood sugar (FBS, mg/dl) were obtained. Then, patients took part in a 12-week moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (3 sessions per week, each session 45Â min). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 26.0. Out of 40 examined patients, 21 (52.5Â %) were male and 19 (47.5Â %) were female. The mean age of the patients was 50.8Â years. The mean rank of FBS (mg/dl) significantly decreased from 21.12 before the exercise to 8.75 after the exercise (pÂ <Â 0.001). Also, the mean rank of CMT (microns) showed a significant decrease from 21.11 before the intervention to 16.20 after the exercise (pÂ <Â 0.001). There was a significant positive correlation between patients' age and FBS (mg/dl) before (rhoÂ =Â 0.457, pÂ =Â 0.003) and after (rhoÂ =Â 0.365, pÂ =Â 0.021) the intervention. Also, a significant positive correlation was found between patients' age and CMT (microns) before (rhoÂ =Â 0.525, pÂ =Â 0.001) and after (rhoÂ =Â 0.461, pÂ =Â 0.003) moderate exercise.

33248440,Microvascular Benefits of New Antidiabetic Agents: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis of Kidney Outcomes.,"Diabetic kidney disease affects nearly one-third of US adults with prevalent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The use of new antidiabetic medications in the prevention and treatment of diabetic kidney disease is a growing area of research interest. We sought to characterize the risk of developing a composite kidney outcome among patients receiving a new antidiabetic medication of the SGLT-2i, GLP-1ra, and DPP-4i drug classes. We conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE to identify randomized trials observing kidney safety endpoints associated with the use of new antidiabetic medications. Two independent reviewers selected the 7 eligible studies for analysis. Included studies were published between January 2013 and March 2020, conducted with adult participantss, published full-text in English, and observed composite kidney outcomes. A network meta-analysis was conducted within a Bayesian framework using a fixed-effects model with uninformative priors. A qualitative assessment of transitivity was conducted to ensure similar distribution of potential modifiers across studies. Included studies were generally comparable in mean age, glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and mean duration of T2DM at baseline. Compared with placebo, dapagliflozin was associated with the greatest reduction in risk of developing the composite kidney outcome (hazard ratio 0.53; 95% credible interval, 0.43-0.66) followed by empagliflozin, canagliflozin, semaglutide, and liraglutide. Linagliptin did not show a significant reduction in risk of the outcome. This analysis was limited by the scarcity of data for kidney safety endpoints in large, randomized clinical trials. Although the heterogeneity statistic was low, there are slight differences in study design and baseline demographic characteristics across trials.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2021-Mar,"Cha AS, Chen Y, Fazioli K, Rivara MB, Devine EB",5,1821,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
35046015,Diabetic hand: prevalence and incidence of diabetic hand problems using data from 1.1 million inhabitants in southern Sweden.,"'The diabetic hand' has traditionally referred to hand complications due to diabetes mellitus (DM), including trigger finger (TF) and Dupuytren's disease (DD). Recent publications have also proposed DM as a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), ulnar nerve entrapment (UNE), and possibly osteoarthritis (OA) of the first carpometacarpal (CMC-1) joint. This study aimed to explore prevalence and incidence of diabetic hand complications among the population in southern Sweden. Approximately 1.1 million inhabitants in the region of SkÃ¥ne aged â¥18 years, whereof 50 000 with DM, were included. Data on incident CTS, UNE, TF, DD, and OA of the CMC-1 joint between 2004 and 2019 were collected from the SkÃ¥ne Healthcare Register and cross-linked with the National Diabetes Register. Prevalences on December 31, 2019 and 10-year incidence ratios were calculated for type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and the population without DM, stratified for sex. Prevalence ratios and incidence rate ratios with 95% CIs were used for group comparisons. The prevalences of all five studied diagnoses were higher in both men and women with T1D and T2D (p<0.01) and both T1D and T2D had more concomitant prevalent diagnoses (p<0.0001). The 10-year incidence rates of all diagnoses were higher among T1D and T2D (p<0.0001), except OA of the CMC-1 joint in men with T1D (p=0.055). CTS, UNE, and possibly also OA of the CMC-1 joint should be included together with TF and DD when referring to 'the diabetic hand'. The incidence of hand disorders was up to eight times higher among T1D, and both T1D and T2D had more concomitant prevalent diagnoses compared with the population without DM. Future studies should elucidate the pathophysiology behind diabetic hand complications to enable development of effective preventive measures in patients with diabetes.",BMJ open diabetes research & care,2022-Jan,"Rydberg M, Zimmerman M, GottsÃ¤ter A, Svensson AM, Eeg-Olofsson K, Dahlin LB",6,1855,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

37506409,Clinical evaluation of painful diabetes peripheral neuropathy in type 2 diabetes patients: Lessons from expatriates in the United Arab Emirates.,"The high prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) in the United Arab Emirates makes it imperative to screen and manage diabetes peripheral neuropathy (DPN) as a priority. Considering the high number of expats from different ethnicity a more thorough approach is necessary. Unfortunately, there are very few studies addressing this issue. The study uses the chi-square test to investigate the dependence of the progression of DNP on ethnic origin. The study uses Pearson Correlation to find the association between three prevalent scales used for the measurement of painful diabetes peripheral neuropathy. Student t-test was used further to investigate the significance of the association. With a p-value (0.004) and p-value (0.015), the study concludes that DPN risk is dependent on the ethnic origin of the residents. The study further found that there is a significant association between three scales for measuring painful diabetes peripheral neuropathy (pDNP), Douleur Neuropathique en 4 questions (DN4), Neurological Symptoms Score (NSS), and Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANNS). The p-value for all pairwise comparisons for the strength of association between scales was found significant at the level of significance 0.05. The study concludes that the risk of DNP is high in Arab-origin residents in UAE and the reasons behind the finding need to be empirically tested to customize its management. The study further finds a significant association between the score of the three scales used for measuring pDNP.",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2023-Sep,"Hazari A, Mishra V, Agouris I",3,1535,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
34913986,Diabetic kidney disease in children and adolescents: an update.,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), previously encountered predominantly in adult patients, is rapidly gaining center stage as a childhood morbidity and one that pediatric nephrologists are likely to encounter with increasing frequency. This is in large part due to the obesity epidemic and the consequent rise in type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, as well as the more aggressive diabetes phenotype in today's youth with more rapid Î²-cell decline and faster development and progression of diabetes-related complications along with lower responsiveness to the treatments used in adults. DKD, an end-organ complication of diabetes, is at the very least a marker of, and more likely a predisposing factor for, the development of adverse cardiovascular outcomes and premature mortality in children with diabetes. On an optimistic note, several new therapeutic approaches are now available for the management of diabetes in adults, such as GLP1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and DPP4 inhibitors, that have also been shown to have a favorable impact on cardiorenal outcomes. Also promising is the success of very low-energy diets in inducing remission of diabetes in adults. However, the addition of these pharmacological and dietary approaches to the management toolbox of diabetes and DKD in children and adolescents awaits thorough assessment of their safety and efficacy in this population. This review outlines the scope of diabetes and DKD, and new developments that may favorably impact the management of children and young adults with diabetes and DKD.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2022-Nov,"Lopez LN, Wang W, Loomba L, Afkarian M, Butani L",5,1566,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Participants in the Kailuan study cohort who were â¥20 years old, participated in follow-up assessments and underwent baPWV measurements in 2010-2011, 2012-2013, and 2014-2015 were studied. The participants were allocated to four groups according to their PP and baPWV status, each categorized as high or normal, according to age-specific and sex-specific median values. Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore the individual and combined effects of PP and baPWV on the incidence of diabetes mellitus. There were 18â619 participants who were followed for 4.27Â±1.91 years. A total of 877 new cases of diabetes were identified, and the incidence density was 11.03/1000 per year. Using the normal PP and normal baPWV group as the reference group, the multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95% CIs for diabetes mellitus in the high PP and high baPWV groups were 1.08 (0.93 to 1.25) and 1.64 (1.41 to 1.90), respectively.

We assessed the diagnostic performance of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA<sub>1c</sub> as alternatives to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)-derived 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG) using sensitivity and specificity in 263 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) from a clinical trial. Between visits at 6, 12, and 24âmonths after transplantation, 28%-31% of patients switched glycemic category (normal glucose tolerance [NGT], IGT/IFG, PTDM). Correlations of FPG and HbA<sub>1c</sub> against 2hPG were lower at 6Â months (rÂ =Â 0.59 [FPG against 2hPG]; rÂ =Â 0.45 [HbA<sub>1c</sub> against 2hPG]) vs. 24âmonths (rÂ =Â 0.73 [FPG against 2hPG]; rÂ =Â 0.74 [HbA<sub>1c</sub> against 2hPG]). Up to 69% of 2hPG-defined PTDM cases were missed by conventional HbA<sub>1c</sub> and FPG thresholds. For prediabetes, concordance of FPG and HbA<sub>1c</sub> with 2hPG ranged from 6%-9%. In conclusion, in our well-defined randomized trial cohort, one-third of KTRs switched glycemic category over 2âyears and although the correlations of FPG and HbA<sub>1c</sub> with 2hPG improved with time, their diagnostic concordance was poor for PTDM and, especially, prediabetes.

The disease is characterized by Î²-cell failure and slow progression to insulin dependence. Early diagnosis is significant in limiting disease progression. C-peptide levels and autoantibodies against Î²-cells are the most critical diagnostic biomarkers in LADA. The review aims to provide an overview of the biomarkers used to diagnose LADA, and the following treatment approaches. We have summarized LADA's pathophysiology and the autoantibodies involved in the condition, diagnostic approaches, and challenges. There are clear shortcomings concerning the feasibility of autoantibody testing. Finally, we have explored the treatment strategies involved in the management of LADA. In conclusion, the usual management includes treatment with metformin and the addition of low doses of insulin. Newer oral hypoglycaemic agents, such as GLP-1RA and DPP-4 inhibitors, have been brought into use. Since the disease is not entirely understood at the research level and in clinical practice, we hope to encourage further research in this field to assess its prevalence.

Data from the NHIS-HEALS cohort between 2002 and 2015 were longitudinally analyzed. Subjects were divided into three groups: metformin non-users with diabetes mellitus (DM), metformin users with DM, and no DM group. CRC was defined using the ICD-10 code (C18.0-C20.0) at the time of admission. Cox proportional hazard regression models were adopted after stepwise adjustment for confounders to investigate the association between metformin usage and colorectal cancer risk.

The objective of this systematic review was to explore the level of diabetes risk perception among individuals with and without apparent risk for diabetes, and to consider the effect of environmental factors on the level of diabetes risk perception. This systematic review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The literature search was carried out through PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Original articles written in English and published between 2013 and 2023 were considered. Study quality was appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Narrative synthesis was undertaken due to methodological heterogeneity in the included studies. A total of 13 cross-sectional studies, two randomized controlled trials, two cohort studies, two mixed methods studies and one quasi-experiment with a control group were included. An overall low level of diabetes risk perception was reported particularly in those without apparent risk for diabetes. The 20 included studies reported widely varied measures for calculating diabetes risk perception. The influence of environmental factors on the risk perception of diabetes was highlighted. The use of study-specific and non-validated measures in the included studies weakens the authors' ability to compare across studies. The role of language and publication bias within this systematic review should be acknowledged as we included only English-language studies published in peer-reviewed journals. Another limitation is the exclusion of dimensions of risk perception such as optimistic bias as search terms. The overall low risk perception of diabetes calls for urgent need of public health interventions to increase the risk perception of diabetes. In the future, researchers should ensure the validity and reliability of the measures being used. The influence of environmental factors on the diabetes risk perception indicates that diabetes preventive interventions targeting environmental factors may be effective in increasing the risk perception of diabetes.",PloS one,2024-,"Jane Ling MY, Ahmad N, Noor Aizuddin A, Ja'afar MH",4,2163,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

This exploratory online survey aimed to ascertain the issues on the road for grey nomads with diabetes and their experiences of self-management of their diabetes whilst in rural and remote regions of Australia. Following ethical approval and piloting, an online survey was distributed through social media sites used by grey nomads and those with diabetes. From the closed and open-ended responses from travelers with diabetes in rural and remote areas, the demographics of this cohort were explored, as well as their self-management of diabetes. A total of 103 grey nomads with diabetes responded and 81 completed all survey questions. There was wide variation in the respondents' answers in regard to their self-management including their preparation for travel; their knowledge of diabetes and accessing health-care services; their management of illness; and their experiences whilst travelling including the effects of COVID-19. It was identified that there was a need for an increase in preparation prior to travel, and several important checks were identified for this planning specific to rural and remote areas of Australia, including the expectations of health services in these regions. A pretravel checklist for travellers with diabetes is recommended to contribute to better self-management of grey nomads with diabetes on the road in order to alleviate the issues identified.",Australasian journal on ageing,2023-Jun,"De Bellis A, McCloud C, Abigail W, Hill P, Giles J, Apolloni M, Gregoric C",7,1576,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
35201556,The Impact of Diet on Bone and Fracture Risk in Diabetes.,"The purpose of this review is to summarize the recently published scientific evidence on the effects of diet on diabetes and skeletal health. The impact of diet on overall health has been a growing topic of interest among researchers. An inappropriate eating habit is a relatively modified risk factor for diabetes in adults. Parallel with the significant increase in the incidence of diabetes mellitus worldwide, many studies have shown the benefits of lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise for people with, or at risk of developing, diabetes. In the last years, accumulating evidence suggests that diabetes is a risk factor for bone fragility. As lifestyle intervention represents an effective option for diabetes management and treatment, there is potential for an effect on bone health. Healthy lifestyle is critical to prevent bone fragility. However, more studies are needed to fully understand the impact of diet and weight loss on fracture risk in diabetics.",Current osteoporosis reports,2022-Feb,"Faraj M, Napoli N",2,981,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
35041752,A Clinical Update on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) traditionally refers to abnormal glucose tolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. GDM has long been associated with obstetric and neonatal complications primarily relating to higher infant birthweight and is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for future maternal and offspring cardiometabolic disease. The prevalence of GDM continues to rise internationally due to epidemiological factors including the increase in background rates of obesity in women of reproductive age and rising maternal age and the implementation of the revised International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups' criteria and diagnostic procedures for GDM. The current lack of international consensus for the diagnosis of GDM reflects its complex historical evolution and pragmatic antenatal resource considerations given GDM is now 1 of the most common complications of pregnancy. Regardless, the contemporary clinical approach to GDM should be informed not only by its short-term complications but also by its longer term prognosis. Recent data demonstrate the effect of early in utero exposure to maternal hyperglycemia, with evidence for fetal overgrowth present prior to the traditional diagnosis of GDM from 24 weeks' gestation, as well as the durable adverse impact of maternal hyperglycemia on child and adolescent metabolism. The major contribution of GDM to the global epidemic of intergenerational cardiometabolic disease highlights the importance of identifying GDM as an early risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, broadening the prevailing clinical approach to address longer term maternal and offspring complications following a diagnosis of GDM.",Endocrine reviews,2022-Sep,"Sweeting A, Wong J, Murphy HR, Ross GP",4,1735,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

The intervention group included patients with diabetes who participated in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing during their initial dental screening appointment. The participants whose HbA1c value was â¤ 9.0% were expedited into the scheduling queue for the next comprehensive examination appointment. Health literacy was assessed regarding patients' understanding of the connection between oral health and diabetes. The mean number of days between screening and treatment plan development was decreased by 38.4%. Of the participants in the intervention group with an HbA1c value â¤ 9.0%, 44% rated their understanding of the connection between diabetes and gum disease as ""poor"", whereas 86% of the patients who were ineligible due to an HbA1c value â¥ 9.1% rated their understanding as ""very good"" or ""excellent"". Patients with diabetes will continue to benefit from this quality improvement project to minimize barriers to dental care and improve overall health outcomes as this intervention is adopted as a permanent practice change. The need has been highlighted for comprehensive education in practice settings concerning medical and dental collaboration, and patient awareness of the interrelationship between diabetes mellitus and oral disease. An increase in oral examinations, assessment of routine oral health behaviors, and referral to dental providers from the primary care setting is warranted.",Journal of dental education,2022-Oct,"Baxter M, Hardin-Fanning F, Witt C",3,1644,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
39375857,Individualized treatment of diabetes mellitus in older adults.,"The population of older adults with diabetes mellitus is growing but heterogeneous. Because geriatric syndromes, comorbidity or multimorbidity, the complexity of glucose dynamics, and socioeconomic conditions are associated with the risk of severe hypoglycemia and mortality, these factors should be considered in individualized diabetes treatment. Because cognitive impairment and frailty have similar etiologies and risk factors, a common strategy can be implemented to address them through optimal glycemic control, management of vascular risk factors, diet, exercise, social participation, and support. To prevent frailty or sarcopenia, optimal energy intake, adequate protein and vitamin intake, and resistance or multi-component exercise are recommended. For hypoglycemic drug therapy, it is important to reduce hypoglycemia, to use sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, taking into account the benefits for cardiovascular disease and the risk of adverse effects, and to simplify treatment to address poor adherence. Glycemic control goals for older adults with diabetes should be set according to three categories, based on cognitive function and activities of daily living, using the Dementia Assessment Sheet for Community-based Integrated Care System 8-items. This categorization can be used to determine treatment strategies for diabetes when combined with the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA). Based on the CGA, frailty prevention, treatment simplification, and social participation or services should be implemented for patients in Category II and above. Measures against hypoglycemia and for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease should also be promoted. Treatment based on categorization and CGA by multidisciplinary professionals would be an individualized treatment for older adults with diabetes.

34177051,SCREENING FOR DIABETIC RETINOPATHY - A TWELVE-MONTH REVIEW.,"The purpose is to provide a twelve-month database review of screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR). A total of 1428 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients screened in 2017 were analyzed in a retrospective study. Retinal photographs were reviewed by an ophthalmologist for the presence and stage of DR, as well as for additional nondiabetic findings. The following grading categories of DR were used: without DR, mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR), moderate NPDR, severe non-proliferative NPDR, proliferative DR (PDR), clinically significant macular edema (CSME) and ungradable finding. Severe NPDR, PDR and CSME were classified as vision-threatening DR. Out of 1428 DM patients, 27 were diagnosed with type 1 DM and 1401 with type 2 DM, 353 of them had newly diagnosed type 2 DM. Without DR category was recorded in 85.2% of all eyes screened, 2.8% were ungradable, and 12% showed varying stages of DR. Vision-threatening DR was found in 2.8% and additional nondiabetic findings in 5.2% of all screened eyes. In the group of newly diagnosed type 2 DM, 92.5% of screened eyes were without DR, 3.1% were ungradable and 4.3% showed varying stages of DR. In the group of newly diagnosed type 2 DM, vision-threatening DR was recorded in 0.1% and additional nondiabetic finding in 5.7% of the eyes screened.

36197636,Progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus induced by overnutrition.,"Prediabetes has developed into a global pandemic, its prevalence increasing year by year. Although lifestyle changes are advocated as the basis for prediabetes treatment, some patients fail to choose or adhere to appropriate interventions. The basis for selecting an appropriate intervention is determining the stage and cause of the disease. In this review, we aimed to examine the various types and disease processes of prediabetes caused by overnutrition, the present review supporting the hypothesis that overnutrition-induced hyperinsulinemia precedes insulin resistance (IR) and independently causes Î²-cell dysfunction. Tissue insulin resistance is the main feature of prediabetes with the crosstalk between tissues promoting the formation of systemic insulin resistance. Finally, both Î²-cell dysfunction induced by hyperinsulinemia or IR and reduced Î²-cell mass can lead to abnormal insulin secretion and contribute to development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Hence, overnutrition can cause multiple prediabetes phenotypes resulting in development of T2DM through different trajectories. Future diagnosis and treatment should therefore more carefully consider the disease phenotype and stage of development in patients with prediabetes to reduce the incidence of T2DM.","Hormones (Athens, Greece)",2022-Dec,"Zhang Y, Shen T, Wang S",3,1282,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
38486325,Screening for Coronary Artery Disease in Asymptomatic Pilots with Diabetes Mellitus.,"<b>INTRODUCTION:</b> Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a cause of death in 75% of patients with diabetes. Its often asymptomatic nature delays diagnosis. In aeronautics, it can cause in-flight incapacitation, beyond which it represents a major fear for the medical expert. Screening for CAD is still a topical subject with the advent of new cardiovascular (CV) risk biomarkers and more effective screening tests. We report the experience of the Aeromedical Expertise Center of Rabat in this screening of diabetic pilots, with a recommendations review.<b>METHODS:</b> A prospective study over 1âyr included diabetic pilots who benefited from systematic screening for CAD after a CV risk stratification. Coronary angiography is performed if a screening test is positive. Subsequent follow-up is carried out in consultation with the attending physician with regular evaluation in our center.<b>RESULTS:</b> There were 38 pilots included in our study. The average age was 55 Â± 4.19âyr and about 73% had a high CV risk. CAD was detected in 4 cases (10.52%) who had abnormal resting electrocardiograms and required revascularization with the placement of active stents. Approximately 75% of pilots with CAD returned to fly through a waiver with restrictions.<b>DISCUSSION:</b> Screening for coronary disease in diabetics is controversial, and current recommendations are not unanimous. In our study, the screening did not identify coronary diabetic pilots who could benefit from bypass surgery. Nevertheless, coronary disease was diagnosed, justifying grounding to preserve flight safety, which is an absolute priority in aviation medicine.<b>Zerrik M, Moumen A, El Ghazi M, Smiress FB, Iloughmane Z, El M'hadi C, Chemsi M. <i>Screening for coronary artery disease in asymptomatic pilot with diabetes mellitus</i>.

31934549,Diabetes: What Challenges Lie Ahead for Vietnam?,"Economic development and social environment changes influence disease patterns ranging from infectious diseases to noncommunicable diseases, and diabetes is one of the seven causes leading to death and disability in Vietnam. The purpose of this research is to present an overview of the challenges related to diabetes prevention in Vietnam and to find effective ways for the prevention and control of diabetes, as well as to improve the quality of life among diabetes patients. The literature review was conducted using a variety of databases, such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Vietnamese data sources, and papers published in the Vietnamese language. For the searches, we used keywords such as ""Diabetes,"" ""Prevention,"" and ""Prevalence of Diabetes."" With the increasing prevalence of diabetes, there are approximately 5.76 million people with diabetes currently living in Vietnam. The age-adjusted comparative prevalence of diabetes in the population of Vietnam was approximately 6% in 2017. This review suggests that the government needs to establish social security and policy programs aimed at reducing social risk factors and the burden of healthcare costs for diabetes treatment in older people. In addition, attention should be paid to the management and control of diabetes-related diseases, with an emphasis on new techniques for early diagnosis and treatment.

31584372,A Molecular Approach on the Protective Effects of Mangiferin Against Diabetes and Diabetes-related Complications.,"Diabetes and its related complications are now a global health problem without an effective therapeutic approach. There are many herbal medicines which have attracted much attention as potential therapeutic agents in the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications due to their multiple targets. The aim of this study is to review available knowledge of mangiferin focusing on its mode of action. Mangiferin was extensively reviewed for its antidiabetic activity using online database like Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar as well as some offline textbooks. A critical discussion based on the mechanism of action and the future perspectives is also given in the present manuscript. Mangiferin is a natural C-glucoside and mainly obtained from its primary source, the leaves of mango tree (Mangifera indica L.). Therapeutic and preventive properties of mangiferin include antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antiallergic, neuroprotective, and cognition-enhancing effects. It dissolves well in water, so it can be easily extracted into infusions and decoctions and hence, a number of researches have been made on the therapeutic effect of this molecule. Recently, mangiferin has been proved to be an effective remedy in diabetes and diabetes-related complications. It is a beneficial natural compound for type 2 diabetes mellitus as it improves insulin sensitivity, modulates lipid profile and reverts adipokine levels to normal. This study concludes that mangiferin has the potential to treat diabetes and it can be developed as a therapeutic agent for diabetes and the complications caused by diabetes.",Current diabetes reviews,2020-,"Aswal S, Kumar A, Chauhan A, Semwal RB, Kumar A, Semwal DK",6,1624,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

36872136,Reducing Sitting Time in Type 1 Diabetes: Considerations and Implications.,"Sedentary behaviours are ubiquitous in modern society, with Western populations spending approximately 50% of their waking hours in low levels of energy expenditure. This behaviour is associated with cardiometabolic derangements and increased morbidity and mortality. In individuals living with or at risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), ""breaking up"" sedentariness by interrupting prolonged periods of sitting has been shown to acutely improve glucose management and cardiometabolic risk factors related to diabetes complications. As such, current guidelines recommend interrupting prolonged periods of sitting with short, frequent activity breaks. However, the evidence underpinning these recommendations remains preliminary and is focussed on those with or at risk of developing T2D, with little information regarding whether and how reducing sedentariness may be effective and safe in those living with type 1 diabetes (T1D).

It remains unknown, however, whether and how multiple diabetes complications co-occur with cognitive dysfunction, particularly in youth-onset diabetes. Using data from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study cohort, a prospective longitudinal cohort, we examined clustering of complications and their underlying clinical factors with performance on cognitive tests in young adults with youth-onset T1D or T2D. Cognition was assessed via the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery. The main cognitive variables were age-corrected scores for composite fluid cognition and associated cognitive subdomains. Diabetes complications included retinopathy, microalbuminuria, and peripheral neuropathy (PN). Lipids, systolic blood pressure (SBP), hemoglobin A1c, and other clinical factors were included in the analyses. Clustering was applied separately to each group (T1D=646; T2D=165). A three-cluster(C) solution was identified for each diabetes type. Mean values and frequencies of all factors were compared between resulting clusters. The average age-corrected score for composite fluid cognition differed significantly across clusters for each group (p<0.001). People with T1D and the lowest average fluid cognition scores had the highest frequency of self-reporting at least one episode of hypoglycemia in the year preceding cognitive testing and the highest prevalence of PN. Persons with T2D and the lowest average fluid cognition scores had the highest SBP, the highest central systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and highest prevalence of PN.

39213491,"Etiopathogenesis and Management of Prameha Poorvaroopa (Prediabetes), Prameha and Madhumeha (Diabetes Mellitus): An Ancient Perspective.","Prameha was identified in 1552 BCE as a Maharoga (major disease), one of the eight grave diseases of Ancient medical history. Initial days of recognition labeled Prameha as a rich man's disease, as found prevalent among people of higher socio-economic background. This fact was thereby linked with the diagnosis of diabetes and the invention of iron in the Iron Age, as wealthy part of the population who initiated consumption of newly harvested rice and wheat were found majorly diagnosed. Gradually, with the knowledge sought from Rigveda, Atharvaveda, Ayurveda, and Samhitas, the causes and types were identified, and further search conducted in Ayurveda resulted in denominating Prameha based on the body constitution and predominant dosha with its etiology in lifestyle and dietary factors, which, in the current scenario is known as diabetes mellitus. The objective of the current review is to find out and collate the information sought from published ancient literature on the origin and classification of Prameha with etiological factors. Articles published between 1982 and 2021 in scientific domain was searched using several keywords in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Google, to find treatment approaches adopted by ancient medics to manage Prameha, Madhumeha, and Prameha Poorvaroopa. Classical literature was reviewed to understand the traditional approaches applied in the context of scientific interpretations. Content of this scriptural review was derived mainly from Rigveda, Atharvaveda, Ayurveda, Sushrutha Samhita, Charaka Samhita, Bhela Samhita, Harita Samhita, and Papillad Samhita. The finding of this study brings hope for further studies evidencing advantages in adopting the ancient wisdom while devising a strategy for the management of Prameha from a modern perspective.",Advances in mind-body medicine,2024-,"Kurian J, Bilagi A, Deo G",3,1796,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
34784864,An Insight into the Polymeric Nanoparticles Applications in Diabetes Diagnosis and Treatment.,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a type of chronic metabolic disease that has affected millions of people worldwide and is known with a defect in the amount of insulin secretion, insulin functions, or both. This deficiency leads to an increase in the amounts of glucose, which could be accompanied by long-term damages to other organs such as eyes, kidneys, heart, and nervous system. Thus, introducing an appropriate approach for diagnosis and treatment of different types of DM is the aim of several researches. By the emergence of nanotechnology and its application in medicine, new approaches were presented for these purposes. The object of this review article is to introduce different types of polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs), as one of the most important classes of nanoparticles, for diabetic management. To achieve this goal, at first, some of the conventional therapeutic and diagnostic methods of DM will be reviewed. Then, different types of PNPs, in two forms of natural and synthetic polymers with different properties, as a new method for DM treatment and diagnosis will be introduced. In the next section, the transport mechanisms of these types of nano-carriers across the epithelium, via paracellular and transcellular pathways will be explained. Finally, the clinical use of PNPs in the treatment and diagnosis of DM will be summarized. Based on the results of this literature review, PNPs could be considered one of the most promising methods for DM management.",Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,2023-,"Dehghani P, Rad ME, Zarepour A, Sivakumar PM, Zarrabi A",5,1474,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
33279099,Psychobiology of Appetite and Food Reward in Adults with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes: Is there a Role for Exercise?,"Hyperglycemia is the defining feature of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and results from deficient insulin production, impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake or both. It is now well established that hyperglycemia results in profound metabolic complications, but the effect of diabetes and its associated metabolic effects on homeostatic and hedonic appetite control has received less attention. Inappropriate food choices and excess food intake might promote weight gain, further exacerbating the metabolic consequences of T1D and T2D. The need to control blood glucose through diet, physical activity and/or medication as a consequence of impaired insulin secretion and/or sensitivity adds a further level of physiological and behavioural complexity to the processes underlying food choice and appetite control. Alterations in appetite-related processes have been noted in people with T2D, but the effect of T1D on appetite is largely unexplored. Peripheral neuroendocrine signalling appears disrupted in people with T2D, and brain regions involved in the central modulation of appetite might display central insulin resistance. However, it is difficult to isolate the consequences of T2D from those of obesity. Health-care policy advocates the use of physical activity as a means of preventing and treating T2D via the promotion of weight loss and its independent influence on insulin sensitivity. Exercise-induced perturbations to energy balance can elicit biological and behavioural compensation that attenuates weight loss, and diabetes pathophysiology might alter the strength of such compensation. However, the effect of exercise on appetite in people living with diabetes has yet to be fully explored.",Canadian journal of diabetes,2020-Dec,"Hopkins M, Beaulieu K, Finlayson G",3,1730,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
39170741,Polyunsaturated fatty acids and diabetic microvascular complications: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies and clinical trials have implicated polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in potentially safeguarding against diabetic microvascular complication. Nonetheless, the causal nature of these relationships remains ambiguous due to conflicting findings across studies. This research employs Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the causal impact of PUFAs on diabetic microvascular complications. We identified instrumental variables for PUFAs, specifically omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, using the UK Biobank data. Outcome data regarding diabetic microvascular complications were sourced from the FinnGen Study. Our analysis covered microvascular outcomes in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, namely diabetic neuropathy (DN), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). An inverse MR analysis was conducted to examine the effect of diabetic microvascular complications on PUFAs. Sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the robustness of the results. Finally, a multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis was conducted to determine whether PUFAs have a direct influence on diabetic microvascular complications. The study indicates that elevated levels of genetically predicted omega-6 fatty acids substantially reduce the risk of DN in type 2 diabetes (odds ratio (OR): 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.47-0.82, <i>p</i> = 0.001). A protective effect against DR in type 2 diabetes is also suggested (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.62-0.92, <i>p</i> = 0.005). MVMR analysis confirmed the stability of these results after adjusting for potential confounding factors. No significant effects of omega-6 fatty acids were observed on DKD in type 2 diabetes or on any complications in type 1 diabetes. By contrast, omega-3 fatty acids showed no significant causal links with any of the diabetic microvascular complications assessed. Our MR analysis reveals a causal link between omega-6 fatty acids and certain diabetic microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes, potentially providing novel insights for further mechanistic and clinical investigations into diabetic microvascular complications.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,"Liu B, Liu R, Gu Y, Shen X, Zhou J, Luo C",6,2118,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
34157754,Prevalence and risk factors of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus among gastroenterological patients: a HbA1c-based single center experience - Prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in gastroenterological patients.,"Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for microvascular disease, leading to chronic kidney injury or cardiovascular disease, but there is a tremendous proportion of patients worldwide who suffer from undiagnosed diabetes. Until now, little is known about the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in gastroenterology inpatients. To improve detection of undiagnosed diabetes, a routine screening procedure for gastroenterology inpatients, based on hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurement, was established. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the implemented diabetes screening. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed according to the guideline of the German Diabetes Association in patients with an HbA<sub>1c</sub> of â¥6.5% anld/or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) â¥126 mg/dL. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for undiagnosed diabetes. Within a 3-month period, 606 patients were eligible for a diabetes screening. Pre-existing diabetes was documented in 120 patients (19.8 %), undiagnosed diabetes was found in 24 (3.9%), and 162 patients (26.7%) met the definition for prediabetes. Steroid medication use, age, and liver cirrhosis due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) were identified as risk factors for undiagnosed diabetes. The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in gastroenterology inpatients is markedly elevated in comparison to the general population, and a substantial number of inpatients are in a prediabetic status, underlining the need for diabetes screening. In addition to previously described risk factors of patient age and steroid medication use, we identified PSC-related liver cirrhosis (but not liver cirrhosis due to another etiology) as an independent risk factor for undiagnosed diabetes.",Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie,2022-Sep,"FrÃ¼ndt T, SchrÃ¶der N, HÃ¶lzemer A, Pinnschmidt H, de Heer J, Behrends BC, Renne T, Lautenbach A, Lohse AW, Schrader J",10,1818,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

This is a retrospective study, with data collected from December 2014 of patients with hypertension and/or diabetes from 13 Primary Healthcare units located in the Southern region of Sao Paulo (SP, Brazil). Patients were compared by sex, diagnosis and cardiovascular risk using student t test, one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis and Ï2 tests. We evaluated 28,496 patients aged 20 years to 79 years (mean of 57.8 years). Most of patients were women (63.2%) and aged 50 years old or older (74.2%). The participation in the Programa RemÃ©dio em Casa (Medicine at Home Program) was higher among women (12.7%), and the proportions of hypertension, diabetes and both diseases were 68.0%, 7.9% and 24.1%, respectively. Patients with hypertension and diabetes had higher participation in Medicine at Home Program (13.3%), and those with diabetes only had higher participation in Programa de Automonitoramento GlicÃªmico (Self-Monitoring Glucose Program) (20.0%). The proportions of low, moderate, and high cardiovascular risk were 33.0%, 15.5%, and 51.5%, respectively. The sample of this study consisted of patients who were mostly women, aged 50 years or older and diagnosed with hypertension. Almost a quarter of patients also had diabetes and approximately one third and half of them were classified as low and high cardiovascular risk.","Einstein (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",2020-,"Sarno F, Bittencourt CAG, Oliveira SA",3,1483,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Autoantibody analysis can be used to detect the 7-12% of people with diabetes that is phenotypic of type 2 diabetes but is, in fact, latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), which may be regarded as a variant of type 1 diabetes. This may help to explain why some individuals with type 2 diabetes do not go into remission after reducing their weight, while others do, and why remission sometimes ends earlier than expected.

32006343,Targeting Glycoproteins as a therapeutic strategy for diabetes mellitus and its complications.,"Glycoproteins are organic compounds formed from proteins and carbohydrates, which are found in many parts of the living systems including the cell membranes. Furthermore, impaired metabolism of glycoprotein components plays the main role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of glycoprotein levels in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. All relevant papers in the English language were compiled by searching electronic databases, including Scopus, PubMed and Cochrane library. The keywords of glycoprotein, diabetes mellitus, glycan, glycosylation, and inhibitor were searched until January 2019. Glycoproteins are pivotal elements in the regulation of cell proliferation, growth, maturation and signaling pathways. Moreover, they are involved in drug binding, drug transportation, efflux of chemicals and stability of therapeutic proteins. These functions, structure, composition, linkages, biosynthesis, significance and biological effects are discussed as related to their use as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its complications. The findings revealed several chemical and natural compounds have significant beneficial effects on glycoprotein metabolism. The comprehension of glycoprotein structure and functions are very essential and inevitable to enhance the knowledge of glycoengineering for glycoprotein-based therapeutics as may be required for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its associated complications.

39541789,Diabetes and the associated complications: The role of antioxidants in diabetes therapy and care.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). Poorly managed diabetes can lead to complications affecting multiple organ systems. Antioxidants play a crucial role in reducing oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), primarily triggered by uncontrolled high blood sugar levels in diabetes. Antioxidants like vitamin C, E, selenium, and alpha-lipoic acid, when used as supplements, have shown promise in reducing oxidative stress markers and improving antioxidant status in laboratory and animal studies and diabetic patients. Antioxidant supplementation may help reduce the risk of diabetic complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, antioxidants also have anti-inflammatory properties, which could be beneficial in reducing inflammation associated with diabetes. Antioxidant supplementation has been shown to enhance endothelial function, insulin sensitivity, and glucose metabolism, thereby aiding in glycemic control and overall diabetic management. Combining antioxidants with certain medications may have therapeutic benefits, such as effectively neutralizing free radicals and enhancing the regulation of antioxidant defense systems. This review presents an update on diabetes, the sources of free radical generation, the body's natural defense mechanisms, the clinical evidence regarding using antioxidants in managing diabetic complications, and the potential new therapeutic approaches. Overall, antioxidant supplementation may offer some benefits in managing diabetic complications. However, further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of action, determine the optimal supplementation, explore potential interactions with other medications, and conduct long-term studies to establish the possible use of antioxidants for optimal benefits in diabetes care.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2024-Dec,"Dilworth L, Stennett D, Facey A, Omoruyi F, Mohansingh S, Omoruyi FO",6,1919,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
33524646,Negative pressure wound therapy in grade 1 and 2 diabetic foot ulcers: A randomized controlled study.,"Foot ulcers are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality among diabetics in India. Early diagnosis and timely management is vital in preventing the progression of the disease which may require amputation. Conventional methods take a long time for healing. This study aims to compare negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) and conventional saline dressings in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) healing. This prospective randomized study was conducted in 45 patients with grade 1 and 2 DFUs. 22 patients in group A received NPWT and 23 patients in group B received saline dressings. The formation of granulation tissue, reduction in ulcer size, duration of hospital stay and time for complete healing of wounds were assessed. The formation of granulation tissue (91.14 vs 52.61%, pÂ <Â 0.001) and reduction in ulcer size (40.78 vs 21.18%, pÂ =Â 0.008) at 14 days was significantly more in group A.

Hence, to quantify and compare the attributable burden of key modifiable risk factors associated with increased Blood Glucose (BG) among Indian states and districts. The study used the National Family Health Survey (2015-16) data to estimate Population Attributable Risk (PAR) for increased BG (>140Â mg/dl) among men aged 15-54 years in 640 districts of 36 States/Union Territories (UTs), India. We have considered three key modifiable factors such as high Body Mass Index (BMI), use of tobacco and alcohol. Population Attributable Risk techniques were employed to address the attributable burden of increased blood glucose due to modifiable risk factors. Substantial variations were found in the burden of increased BG due to high BMI, alcohol and tobacco use in India. The overall burden of increased BG due to high BMI, tobacco and alcohol in India was 28.5%, 2.1% and 6.4%, respectively. Regional variations in BG were found in high BMI, tobacco and alcohol consumption groups. The high burden of increased BG related to the above key modifiable risk factors mostly seen in North-Eastern' districts due to alcohol, Southern and Northern' districts was due to high BMI. However, the higher burden due to tobacco was reported in Central, Eastern and North-Eastern' districts. Three modifiable risk factors are contributing significantly to increased BG among men. Since there are regional differences in their contributions, state/district, specific targeted interventions may be necessary to control increased BG among men in India.",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2021-,"Biradar RA, Singh DP, Prasad JB",3,1618,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Health check-up participants who underwent 3 sequential health examinations during 2012-2016 and were followed up from 2017 to 2021 were enrolled and categorized into two subcohorts: (a) progression from normoglycaemia to prediabetes subcohort (nÂ =Â 9373) and (b) progression from prediabetes to diabetes subcohort (nÂ =Â 4563). Cumulative TyG (cumTyG) and TyG variability from Exams 1-3 were the exposures of interest in our study. The outcomes were newly incident prediabetes or diabetes. In the prediabetes development subcohort, 2,074 participants developed prediabetes over a 2.42-year follow-up. Higher cumTyG (HR, 2.02; 95Â % CI, 1.70-2.41), but not greater TyG variability alone, was significantly associated with increased prediabetes risk. In the diabetes development subcohort, 379 participants developed diabetes over a 3.0-year follow-up. Higher cumTyG (HR, 3.54; 95Â % CI, 2.29-5.46), but not greater TyG variability alone, was significantly associated with increased diabetes risk.

This study aimed to clarify the relationship of fQRS with diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Japanese patients. Approximately 702 individuals who had a routine health checkup at the Hokuriku Health Service Association (Toyama, Japan) in October 2014 were enrolled and categorized into one of the following four groups based on MetS and diabetes mellitus status: with diabetes mellitus (+) MetS+ (164 participants); diabetes mellitus+ without MetS (Mets-; 103 participants); diabetes mellitus- MetS+ (133 participants); and diabetes mellitus- MetS- (302 participants). fQRS was assessed using the results of electrocardiography. The prevalence of fQRS was statistically higher in patients with diabetes mellitus+ MetS+ (37%) and diabetes mellitus+ MetS- (35%), than those with diabetes mellitus- MetS+ (14%) or diabetes mellitus- MetS- (10%; PÂ <Â 0.0001). Significant differences were observed between the fQRS(+) and fQRS(-) groups for age, sex, waist circumference, heart rate, hypertension, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, MetS and diabetes mellitus.

39205040,Analyzing Diabetes Detection and Classification: A Bibliometric Review (2000-2023).,"Bibliometric analysis is a rigorous method to analyze significant quantities of bibliometric data to assess their impact on a particular field. This study used bibliometric analysis to investigate the academic research on diabetes detection and classification from 2000 to 2023. The PRISMA 2020 framework was followed to identify, filter, and select relevant papers. This study used the Web of Science database to determine relevant publications concerning diabetes detection and classification using the keywords ""diabetes detection"", ""diabetes classification"", and ""diabetes detection and classification"". A total of 863 publications were selected for analysis. The research applied two bibliometric techniques: performance analysis and science mapping. Various bibliometric parameters, including publication analysis, trend analysis, citation analysis, and networking analysis, were used to assess the performance of these articles. The analysis findings showed that India, China, and the United States are the top three countries with the highest number of publications and citations on diabetes detection and classification. The most frequently used keywords are machine learning, diabetic retinopathy, and deep learning. Additionally, the study identified ""classification"", ""diagnosis"", and ""validation"" as the prevailing topics for diabetes identification.

34057150,Circular RNAs in cancer and diabetes.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNA molecules formed by the back splicing process. Compared to linear mRNA molecules they are more stable. CircRNA acts as miRNA sponges, regulates translation, epigenetic alterations, etc. However, the most significant aspect of circRNAs has been its role in regulating the hallmark of cancer and diabetes mellitus. Several circRNAs are extensively expressed in individuals with cancer and diabetics. Dysregulated expression of various circRNAs plays a crucial part in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the present review, we present the current understanding of cricRNAs biogenesis, regulatory mechanisms, reviews of recent findings and circRNA as potential biomarker.",Journal of genetics,2021-,"Hatibaruah A, Rahman M, Agarwala S, Singh SA, Shi J, Gupta S, Paul P",7,734,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
38569944,Recommendations for management of diabetes and its complications during Hajj (Muslim Pilgrimage) - 2024 update.,"Hajj is an obligatory duty for all healthy adult Muslims once in the lifetime subjected to the ability. Considering the 10.5Â % global prevalence of diabetes coupled with the numbers of Muslims performing the Hajj, â¼ 1.8 million in 2023, it is estimated that Muslims with diabetes performing Hajj may exceed 340,000 this year. During Hajj the pattern and amount of their meal, fluid intake and physical activity are markedly altered. Many people with diabetes insist on doing the Hajj duty, thereby creating a medical challenge for themselves and their health care providers. It is therefore important that medical professionals be aware of the potential risks that may be associated with Hajj. People with diabetes may face many health hazards during Hajj including but not limited to the killer triad which might occur during Hajj: Hypoglycemia, Foot injury and Infections. Many precautions should be taken to prevent and treat these potentially serious complications.

32398868,Genetics of diabetes mellitus and diabetes complications.,"Diabetes is one of the fastest growing diseases worldwide, projected to affect 693 million adults by 2045. Devastating macrovascular complications (cardiovascular disease) and microvascular complications (such as diabetic kidney disease, diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy) lead to increased mortality, blindness, kidney failure and an overall decreased quality of life in individuals with diabetes. Clinical risk factors and glycaemic control alone cannot predict the development of vascular complications; numerous genetic studies have demonstrated a clear genetic component to both diabetes and its complications. Early research aimed at identifying genetic determinants of diabetes complications relied on familial linkage analysis suited to strong-effect loci, candidate gene studies prone to false positives, and underpowered genome-wide association studies limited by sample size. The explosion of new genomic datasets, both in terms of biobanks and aggregation of worldwide cohorts, has more than doubled the number of genetic discoveries for both diabetes and diabetes complications. We focus herein on genetic discoveries for diabetes and diabetes complications, empowered primarily through genome-wide association studies, and emphasize the gaps in research for taking genomic discovery to the next level.",Nature reviews.

36856742,"Circulating AFABP, FGF21, and PEDF Levels as Prognostic Biomarkers of Sight-threatening Diabetic Retinopathy.","Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (AFABP), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) are 3 diabetes-related biomarkers whose circulating levels had been shown to associate with nephropathy progression in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. Here, we evaluated and compared their prospective associations with the development of sight-threatening DR (STDR), another important diabetic microvascular complication. Baseline serum AFABP, PEDF, and FGF21 levels were measured in 4760 Chinese individuals with type 2 diabetes and without STDR at baseline. The associations of these biomarkers with incident STDR were analyzed using Cox regression analysis. Among these 4760 participants (mean diabetes duration of 11 years and â¥ 50% with nonproliferative DR at baseline), 172 participants developed STDR over a median follow-up of 8.8 years. Participants with incident STDR had comparable baseline serum FGF21 levels but significantly higher baseline serum AFABP and PEDF levels (both P < .001) than those without. However, in multivariable Cox regression analysis, only serum AFABP remained independently associated with incident STDR (hazard ratio 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05-1.55; P = .013). The addition of serum AFABP to a clinical model of conventional STDR risk factors including diabetes duration, glycemic control, albuminuria, and baseline DR status significantly improved the c statistics (P < .001), net reclassification index (P = .0027), and integrated discrimination index (P = .033) in predicting incident STDR among participants without DR or with mild DR at baseline. Among the 3 diabetes-related biomarkers, serum AFABP level appeared to be a more clinically useful biomarker for predicting incident STDR in type 2 diabetes.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2023-Aug,"Lee CH, Lui DT, Cheung CY, Fong CH, Yuen MM, Woo YC, Chow WS, Wong IY, Xu A, Lam KS",10,1773,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
34951710,Assessment of glycaemic status in adult hospital patients for the detection of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus: A systematic review.,"In-hospital blood glucose testing is commonplace, particularly in acute care. In-hospital screening for hyperglycaemia may present a valuable opportunity for early diabetes diagnosis by identifying at-risk individuals. This systematic review investigates the extent to which random blood glucose testing in acute and inpatient hospital settings predicts undiagnosed diabetes. Two databases were systematically searched for studies in which adult patients received an in-hospital random blood glucose test, followed by a diagnostic HbA1c test. The primary outcome was the proportion of hyperglycaemic individuals diagnosed with diabetes by HbA1c. A total of 3245 unique citations were identified, and 12 were eligible for inclusion. Ten different blood glucose thresholds, ranging from 5.5 to 11.1Â mmol/L, were used to detect hyperglycaemia, indicating that there is no consistent clinical definition for hyperglycaemia. The proportion of participants with hyperglycaemia in each study ranged from 3.3% to 62.1%, with a median (Q<sub>1</sub> , Q<sub>3</sub> )Â of 34.5% (5.95%, 61.1%). The proportion of hyperglycaemic participants found to have a diabetes-range HbA1c varied from 4.1% to 90%, with a median (Q<sub>1</sub> , Q<sub>3</sub> ) of 18.9% (11.5%, 61.1%). Meta-analysis was not possible due to substantial heterogeneity between study protocols. All studies consistently identified a proportion of hyperglycaemic hospital patients as having a diabetes-range HbA1c, showing that in-hospital blood glucose screening can facilitate diabetes diagnosis. The proportion of hyperglycaemic participants with undiagnosed diabetes varied substantially, indicating a need for further research and consistency in defining in-hospital hyperglycaemia. This may aid the development of a standardised screening protocol to identify people with possible undiagnosed diabetes.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2022-Apr,"Thornton-Swan TD, Armitage LC, Curtis AM, Farmer AJ",4,1865,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22
35385161,RNA-binding proteins in diabetic microangiopathy.,"As the most common complication of diabetes, the diabetic microangiopathy characterizes diabetic retinopathy (DR) and nephropathy (DN). Diabetic microangiopathy has always been a serious clinical problem. A wide variety of nucleic acid interacting factors called the RNA binding proteins (RBPS) take part in several crucial cellular processes. Over the past decade, studies have shown that RBPs have crucial part in both malignant tumors and diabetes, especially in diabetic microangiopathy. This review examined the research history of RBPS in DR and DN. We reviewed the literature and found that RBPS is potentially useful as therapeutic targets, diagnostic markers, or predict disease progression. HuR acts as a vital therapeutic targeting protein in diabetic microangiopathy. IGF2BP2, P311, TTP, YBX1, and MBNL1 have a potential role in the treatment of DN.",Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,2022-May,"Tu C, Wang L, Wei L",3,861,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

This study examines whether the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services State Innovation Models initiative, through payment and delivery system reforms, accelerates the diagnosis of social risk factors among hospitalized adults with diabetes. Encounter-level data were from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases (2010-2015, N=5,040,456). Difference-in-difference logistic regression estimated the extent to which hospitalized adults with diabetes in 4 State Innovation Models states (Arkansas, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Vermont) had increased odds of having a social risk factor diagnosed with an ICD-9 V code compared with hospitalized adults with diabetes in 4 comparison states (Arizona, Georgia, New Jersey, and New Mexico) 2 years after implementation. Data were analyzed between June and December 2019. Adults with diabetes who were hospitalized in State Innovation Models states had a 30% greater increase in the odds of having a V code documented after implementation than adults with diabetes who were hospitalized in comparison states (AOR=1.29, 95% CI=1.07, 1.56). However, V code use remained infrequent, with only 2.05% of encounters, on average, having any V codes on record in State Innovation Models states after implementation. The State Innovation Models initiative slightly but significantly improved the diagnosis of social risks among hospitalized adults with diabetes. State-led delivery system and payment reform may help support movement of hospitals toward better recognition and management of social determinants of health.",American journal of preventive medicine,2020-Oct,"Phillips AZ, Brewster AL, Kyalwazi MJ, Rodriguez HP",4,1774,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

In recent years, the research on the relationship between DM and VC is also deepening. Hypoxia, as one of the pathogenic factors of many disease models, is also closely related to the occurrence of DM and VC. There are some studies on the role of hypoxia in the pathogenesis of DM and VC respectively, but no one has made an in-depth summary of the systematic connection between hypoxia, DM and VC. Therefore, what we want to review in this article are the relationship between DM, VC and hypoxia, respectively, as well as the role of hypoxia in the development of DM and VC, which has little concern but is a novel and potentially target that may provide some new ideas for the prevention and treatment of DM, VC, especially diabetic VC.",Cellular signalling,2022-Mar,"Sun XJ, Liu NF",2,870,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Over the years, it has been noted that kidney biopsies in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are revealing lesions other than DGS because of the changing natural history of diabetic kidney disease. A retrospective study of all kidney biopsies in T2DM patients over a three-year period submitted to the Pathology Departments of Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad, and Yashoda Hospitals, Secunderabad, India, was analyzed. The clinical data were analyzed for the type of biopsy lesions and the clinical predictors of nondiabetic renal pathology in these biopsies. The result of this study was compared with another study published by one of the authors in 2006. A total of 1029 biopsies were obtained from the records. Pure DGS was seen in 341 (33.1%) and nondiabetic renal lesions were seen in 482 (46.8%) biopsies. The most common histological lesion in the isolated nondiabetic renal disease group was interstitial nephritis (acute and chronic). Incidence of minimal change disease and membranous nephropathy is significantly less in the current cohort. The factors which were predictive of isolated nondiabetic lesions were short duration of diabetes and renal failure (unexplained/rapid deterioration). 66.9% of biopsies show nondiabetic-renal lesion histopathology in T2DM patients. This offers the clinician an opportunity to consider specific treatment wherever possible.","Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",2021-,"Kumar R, Anandh U, Gowrishankar S, Gupta K, Jadhav S",5,1496,diabetes,2025-10-19 21:43:22

Recognising these gaps, we introduced a new diabetes care model for people with advanced CKD in renal satellite units.This paper aims to evaluate this new diabetes model care. We conducted a prospective audit of a new integrated diabetes kidney care model. Data were presented as meanâÂ±âSD or counts/percentages, and pre- and post-intervention differences were assessed using paired samples t-tests. A total of 291 individuals with diabetes and advanced CKD stages 4 or 5, or undergoing haemodialysis, were included. The mean age was 68.5 (Â±13.0) years, 58.4% were males. Nearly half of the cohort had four or more long-term conditions, while two-thirds experienced mild/severe frailty. Only 6% were receiving ongoing diabetes care from secondary care diabetes specialist services. For patients with CKD not receiving dialysis, comparing pre- and post-intervention, there were improvements in HbA1c (-13.0âmmol/mol, pâ<â0.001), SBP (-13.7âmm Hg, pâ<â0.0001), and weight (-2.9âkg, pâ<â0.0001). Furthermore, there was an increase in guideline-directed therapies, with notable usage of SGLT2i (62.9%) and GLP1-RA (28.4%), while access to diabetes technology increased to 89%.
