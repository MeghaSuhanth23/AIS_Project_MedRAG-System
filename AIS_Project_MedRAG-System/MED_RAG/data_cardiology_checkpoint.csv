32370835,Artificial Intelligence in Cardiology: Present and Future.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a nontechnical, popular term that refers to machine learning of various types but most often to deep neural networks. Cardiology is at the forefront of AI in medicine. For this review, we searched PubMed and MEDLINE databases with no date restriction using search terms related to AI and cardiology. Articles were selected for inclusion on the basis of relevance. We highlight the major achievements in recent years in nearly all areas of cardiology and underscore the mounting evidence suggesting how AI will take center stage in the field. Artificial intelligence requires a close collaboration among computer scientists, clinical investigators, clinicians, and other users in order to identify the most relevant problems to be solved. Best practices in the generation and implementation of AI include the selection of ideal data sources, taking into account common challenges during the interpretation, validation, and generalizability of findings, and addressing safety and ethical concerns before final implementation. The future of AI in cardiology and in medicine in general is bright as the collaboration between investigators and clinicians continues to excel.",Mayo Clinic proceedings,2020-May,"Lopez-Jimenez F, Attia Z, Arruda-Olson AM, Carter R, Chareonthaitawee P, Jouni H, Kapa S, Lerman A, Luong C, Medina-Inojosa JR, Noseworthy PA, Pellikka PA, Redfield MM, Roger VL, Sandhu GS, Senecal C, Friedman PA",17,1201,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
34338485,Machine learning for cardiology.,"This paper reviews recent cardiology literature and reports how artificial intelligence tools (specifically, machine learning techniques) are being used by physicians in the field. Each technique is introduced with enough details to allow the understanding of how it works and its intent, but without delving into details that do not add immediate benefits and require expertise in the field. We specifically focus on the principal Machine learning based risk scores used in cardiovascular research. After introducing them and summarizing their assumptions and biases, we discuss their merits and shortcomings. We report on how frequently they are adopted in the field and suggest why this is the case based on our expertise in machine learning. We complete the analysis by reviewing how corresponding statistical approaches compare with them. Finally, we discuss the main open issues in applying machine learning tools to cardiology tasks, also drafting possible future directions. Despite the growing interest in these tools, we argue that there are many still underutilized techniques: while neural networks are slowly being incorporated in cardiovascular research, other important techniques such as semi-supervised learning and federated learning are still underutilized. The former would allow practitioners to harness the information contained in large datasets that are only partially labeled, while the latter would foster collaboration between institutions allowing building larger and better models.",Minerva cardiology and angiology,2022-Feb,"Arfat Y, Mittone G, Esposito R, Cantalupo B, DE Ferrari GM, Aldinucci M",6,1510,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
32216916,Evaluation for Heart Transplantation and LVAD Implantation: JACC Council Perspectives.,"Timely referrals for transplantation and left ventricular assist device implantation play a key role in favorable outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure. Nonetheless, evaluation usually occurs at advanced heart failure centers and is obscured from referring physicians. The purposes of this review are to explain the decision-making process for candidacy for advanced therapies and to describe the potential impact of the new organ allocation algorithm on center decision making. The document first addresses the signs of advanced heart failure, specifically focusing on the importance of the syndrome of low cardiac output as a key feature of advanced heart failure, and then summarizes the evaluation as a 3-step process addressing the following questions: 1) Is transplantation or durable assist device placement indicated? 2) Are there contraindications to either intervention? 3) How can one choose between transplantation and left ventricular assist device implantation if advanced therapies are indicated and not contraindicated?",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2020-Mar,"Guglin M, Zucker MJ, Borlaug BA, Breen E, Cleveland J, Johnson MR, Panjrath GS, Patel JK, Starling RC, Bozkurt B",10,1046,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

39127953,2024 Update to the 2020 ACC/AHA Clinical Performance and Quality Measures for Adults With Heart Failure: A Report of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Joint Committee on Performance Measures.,"This document describes performance measures for heart failure that are appropriate for public reporting or pay-for-performance programs and is meant to serve as a focused update of the ""2020 ACC/AHA Clinical Performance and Quality Measures for Adults With Heart Failure: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Performance Measures."" The new performance measures are taken from the ""2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines"" and are selected from the strongest recommendations (Class 1 or Class 3). In contrast, quality measures may not have as much evidence base and generally comprise metrics that might be useful for clinicians and health care organizations for quality improvement but are not yet appropriate for public reporting or pay-for-performance programs. New performance measures include optimal blood pressure control in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and the use of guideline-directed medical therapy in hospitalized patients. New quality measures include the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction, the optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy prior to intervention for chronic secondary severe mitral regurgitation, continuation of guideline-directed medical therapy for patients with heart failure with improved ejection fraction, identifying both known risks for cardiovascular disease and social determinants of health, patient-centered counseling regarding contraception and pregnancy risks for individuals with cardiomyopathy, and the need for a monoclonal protein screen to exclude light chain amyloidosis when interpreting a bone scintigraphy scan assessing for transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis.",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2024-Sep,"Kittleson MM, Breathett K, Ziaeian B, Aguilar D, Blumer V, Bozkurt B, Diekemper RL, Dorsch MP, Heidenreich PA, Jurgens CY, Khazanie P, Koromia GA, Van Spall HGC",13,2066,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

34895982,Artificial intelligence and cardiology: Current status and perspective.,"The development of artificial intelligence (AI) began in the mid-20th century but has been rapidly accelerating in the past decade. Reflecting the development of digital health over the past few years, this trend is also seen in medicine. The field of cardiovascular medicine uses a wide variety and a large amount of biosignals, so there are many situations where AI can contribute. The development of AI is in progress for all aspects of the healthcare system, including the prevention, screening, and treatment of diseases and the prediction of the prognosis. AI is expected to be used to provide specialist-level medical care, even in a situation where medical resources are scarce. However, like other medical devices, the concept and mechanism of AI must be fully understood when used; otherwise, it may be used inappropriately, resulting in detriment to the patient. Therefore, it is important to understand what we need to know as a cardiologist handling AI. This review introduces the basics and principles of AI, then shows how far the current development of AI has come, and finally gives a brief introduction of how to start the AI development for those who want to develop their own AI.",Journal of cardiology,2022-Mar,"Nakamura T, Sasano T",2,1199,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

39298665,2024 updated European Heart Rhythm Association core curriculum for physicians and allied professionals: a statement of the European Heart Rhythm Association of the European Society of Cardiology.,"Heart rhythm management is a continuously evolving sub-speciality of cardiology. Every year, many physicians and allied professionals (APs) start and complete their training in cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) or electrophysiology (EP) across the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) member countries. While this training ideally ends with an EHRA certification, the description of the learning pathway (what, how, when, and where) through an EHRA core curriculum is also a prerequisite for a successful training. The first EHRA core curriculum for physicians was published in 2009. Due to the huge developments in the field of EP and device therapy, this document needed updating. In addition, a certification process for APs has been introduced, as well as a recertification process and accreditation of EHRA recognized training centres. Learning pathways are more individualized now, with Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) to monitor learning progression of trainees. The 2024 updated EHRA core curriculum for physicians and APs describes, for both CIED and EP, the syllabus, OSATS, training programme and certification, and recertification for physicians and APs and stresses the importance of continued medical education after certification. In addition, requirements for accreditation of training centres and trainers are given. Finally, suggested reading lists for CIED and EP are attached as online supplements.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",2024-Nov,"Trines SA, Moore P, Burri H, Gonçalves Nunes S, Massoullié G, Merino JL, Paton MF, Porta-Sánchez A, Sommer P, Steven D, Whittaker-Axon S, Yorgun H, Arribas F, Claude Deharo J, Steffel J, Wolpert C",16,1463,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Despite the recent frenzy and uptick in AI research over the past decade, the integration of AI into medical practice is in its early stages. Cardiology stands to benefit due to its many diagnostic modalities and diverse treatments. AI methods have been applied to various domains within cardiology: imaging, electrocardiography, wearable devices, risk prediction, and disease classification. While many AI-based approaches have been developed that perform equal to or better than the state-of-the-art, few prospective randomized studies have evaluated their use.

32284113,Nuclear Cardiology in Asia.,"Nuclear cardiology for patients with ischemic heart disease and cardiac failure is expanding in Asia, although quite heterogeneously. In Asia, Israel showed the highest utilization with more than 1000 scans/100,000 inhabitants a year followed by Korea, Japan, UAE, Turkey, Australia (250-999 scans/100,000). Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, Lebanon, Iran, and Pakistan practiced 60-99 scans/100,000. Most of South East Asian countries, China, India, and Bangladesh practiced 1-50 scans/100,000 per year. Countries in Central Asia, Mongolia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Lao, Myanmar, Nepal, and Bhutan showed limited use or no nuclear cardiology practice. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in Asia was characterized by more frequent use of <sup>201</sup>Tl, less use of weight-based <sup>99m</sup>Tc dosing, and a trend toward a lower rate of stress-only imaging. Accordingly, the effective dose in nuclear cardiology practices was higher than those of the rest of the world. <sup>99</sup>Mo-<sup>99m</sup>Tc generators are available in most countries, relying mainly on the global supply chain because there is little supply chain beyond countries within the region. In practice, the threshold values of left ventricular ejection fraction, end-systolic volume, and end-diastolic volume between normal and pathologic states were set based on the regional normal database in China and Japan because these values were dependent on age, gender, and body weight. The purpose of the MPI SPECT study was to evaluate myocardial ischemia in symptomatic patients with chest pain, effects of percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass-graft, and cardiac function in patients with chronic heart failure. The ability of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-based MPI for predicting hard cardiac events was confirmed in Asian inhabitants with low risk of ischemic heart disease. Human resource development of nuclear medicine professional and public awareness of nuclear medicine is key issues to promote nuclear cardiology in Asia. International organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and academic organizations in the region such as Asia Oceania Federation of Nuclear Medicine and Biology, Asia Regional Cooperative Council for Nuclear Medicine, East Asia Nuclear Medicine Association, and Arab Society of Nuclear Medicine have an important role in addition to national Societies of Nuclear Medicine in each country and region.",Seminars in nuclear medicine,2020-May,"Hatazawa J, Sabih D, Li Y, Pradhan PK, Paez D",5,2425,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

A structured and approved questionnaire was circulated to national delegates of Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology in 33 European countries. Delegates from 30 countries (91%) responded. Paediatric cardiology was not recognised as a distinct speciality by the respective ministry of Health in seven countries (23%). Twenty countries (67%) have formally accredited paediatric cardiology training programmes, seven (23%) have substantial informal (not accredited or certified) training, and three (10%) have very limited or no programme. Twenty-two countries have a curriculum. Twelve countries have a national training director. There was one paediatric cardiology centre per 2.66 million population (range 0.87-9.64 million), one cardiac surgical centre per 4.73 million population (range 1.63-10.72 million), and one training centre per 4.29 million population (range 1.63-10.72 million population). The median number of paediatric cardiology fellows per training programme was 4 (range 1-17), and duration of training was 3 years (range 2-5 years). An exit examination in paediatric cardiology was conducted in 16 countries (53%) and certification provided by 20 countries (67%). Paediatric cardiologist number is affected by gross domestic product (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.41). Training varies markedly across European countries. Although formal fellowship programmes exist in many countries, several countries have informal training or no training. Only a minority of countries provide both exit examination and certification.

34987062,Diagnostic reasoning in cardiovascular medicine.,"Research in cognitive psychology shows that expert clinicians make a medical diagnosis through a two step process of hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing. Experts generate a list of possible diagnoses quickly and intuitively, drawing on previous experience. Experts remember specific examples of various disease categories as exemplars, which enables rapid access to diagnostic possibilities and gives them an intuitive sense of the base rates of various diagnoses. After generating diagnostic hypotheses, clinicians then test the hypotheses and subjectively estimate the probability of each diagnostic possibility by using a heuristic called anchoring and adjusting. Although both novices and experts use this two step diagnostic process, experts distinguish themselves as better diagnosticians through their ability to mobilize experiential knowledge in a manner that is content specific. Experience is clearly the best teacher, but some educational strategies have been shown to modestly improve diagnostic accuracy. Increased knowledge about the cognitive psychology of the diagnostic process and the pitfalls inherent in the process may inform clinical teachers and help learners and clinicians to improve the accuracy of diagnostic reasoning.

35165744,PATIENT AND STAFF DOSES FOR VARIOUS INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY AND CARDIOLOGY EXAMINATIONS IN TURKEY.,"This study aims to determine the radiation doses of patients and staff during different interventional radiology and cardiology examinations. Dose measurements for interventional radiology examinations were performed in Ibn-i Sina Hospital of Ankara University using Siemens Artis-Zee medical imaging system. Patient dose measurement was carried out for interventional cardiology examinations in Cardiology Department of TOBB-ETU University, Medical Faculty Hospital using Philips Allura Centron interventional X-ray system. Patient doses were obtained in terms of kerma area product (KAP) and cumulative air kerma (CAK) from KAP meter attached to the angiography system. Performance tests of the angiography system were performed before patient dose measurements. Staff dose measurements were carried out with thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLD-100) placed in certain areas on the staff. Patient dose measurements were performed for 15 different interventional radiology examinations on a total of 431 patients and for four different cardiology examinations on a total of 299 patients. Monte Carlo based PCXMC 2.0 program was used to calculate patient effective doses. Lower extremity arteriography was the most common examination with a mean KAP value of 30 Gy cm2 and mean effective dose value of 1.2 mSv for total number of 194 patients. Mean KAP values calculated for coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention, electrophysiological procedures and radiofrequency cardiac ablation examinations were 62.8, 162.8, 16.7 and 70.6 Gy cm2, respectively. Radiologist, nurse and technician effective dose normalised to the unit KAP of patient dose were 0.15, 0.11 and 0.14 μSv Gy-1 cm-2. Similarly, cardiologist, nurse and technician effective dose normalised to the unit KAP of patient dose were 0.22, 0.15 and 0.09 μSv Gy-1 cm-2.

35171443,Artificial Intelligence to Improve Risk Prediction with Nuclear Cardiac Studies.,"As machine learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) continues to revolutionize the way in which we analyze data, the field of nuclear cardiology provides fertile ground for the implementation of these complex analytics. This review summarizes and discusses the principles regarding nuclear cardiology techniques and AI, and the current evidence regarding its performance and contribution to the improvement of risk prediction in cardiovascular disease. There is a growing body of evidence on the experimentation with and implementation of machine learning-based AI on nuclear cardiology studies both concerning SPECT and PET technology for the improvement of risk-of-disease (classification of disease) and risk-of-events (prediction of adverse events) estimations. These publications still report objective divergence in methods either utilizing statistical machine learning approaches or deep learning with varying architectures, dataset sizes, and performance.

35908002,Application of Medical Knowledge Graphs in Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine: A Brief Literature Review.,"A knowledge graph is defined as a collection of interlinked descriptions of concepts, relationships, entities and events. Medical knowledge graphs have been the most recent advances in technology, therapy and medicine. Nowadays, a number of specific uses and applications rely on knowledge graphs. The application of the knowledge graph, another form of artificial intelligence (AI) in cardiology and cardiovascular medicine, is a new concept, and only a few studies have been carried out on this particular aspect. In this brief literature review, the use and importance of disease-specific knowledge graphs in exploring various aspects of Kawasaki disease were described. A vision of individualized knowledge graphs (iKGs) in cardiovascular medicine was also discussed. Such iKGs would be based on a modern informatics platform of exchange and inquiry that could comprehensively integrate biologic knowledge with medical histories and health outcomes of individual patients. This could transform how clinicians and scientists discover, communicate and apply new knowledge. In addition, we also described how a study based on the comprehensive longitudinal evaluation of dietary factors associated with acute myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease used a knowledge graph to show the dietary factors associated with cardiovascular diseases in Nurses' Health Study data. To conclude, in this fast-developing world, medical knowledge graphs have emerged as attractive methods of data storage and hypothesis generation. They could be a major and effective tool in cardiology and cardiovascular medicine and play an important role in reaching effective clinical decisions during treatment and management of patients in the cardiology department.",Advances in therapy,2022-Sep,"Wang H, Zu Q, Lu M, Chen R, Yang Z, Gao Y, Ding J",7,1757,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Key studies from the 2024 ESC Congress highlight advances in (CVD) management. Apolipoprotein A-1 infusions reduced risk in acute myocardial infarction patients with high LDL cholesterol. Plozasiran cut triglycerides and apolipoprotein C-III levels, lowering pancreatitis risk. A 14-year study linked smoking among youth to cardiac abnormalities. Baseline hsCRP, LDL-C, and Lp(a) were strong predictors of 30-year outcomes in women. Alternative LDL-lowering strategies matched high-intensity statins in effectiveness of LDL-C lowering and reduced diabetes risk. Early combination lipid lowering therapy improved outcomes post-myocardial infarction. Nordic and Mediterranean diets were linked to lower atherosclerotic CVD risk. The findings from the 2024 ESC Congress highlight significant advancements in CVD prevention, including novel lipid-lowering therapies, biomarker-based risk prediction, and lifestyle interventions.

Training-specific fears have been described in paediatric cardiology fellows but also have not been studied at multiple time points. This study aimed to measure burnout, training-specific fears, and professional fulfilment in paediatric cardiology fellows with the attention to time of year and year-of-training. This survey-based study included the Professional Fulfillment Index and the Impact of Events Scale as well as an investigator-designed Fellow Fears Questionnaire. Surveys were distributed at three-time points during the academic year to paediatric cardiology fellows at a large Midwestern training programme. Fellow self-reported gender and year-of-training were collected. Descriptive analyses were performed. 10/17 (59%) of fellows completed all surveys; 60% were female, 40% in the first-year class, 40% in the second-year class, and 20% in the third-year class. At least half of the fellows reported burnout at each survey time point, with lower mean professional fulfilment scores. The second-year class, who rotate primarily in the cardiac ICU, had higher proportions of burnout than the other two classes. At least half of fellows reported that they ""often"" or ""always"" worried about not having enough clinical knowledge or skills and about work-life balance. Paediatric cardiology fellows exhibit high proportions of burnout and training-specific fears.

Such pre-existing and developing cardiovascular diseases pose some of the greatest risks of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Addressing the complex cardiovascular needs of these patients has become increasingly important, resulting in an imperative for an intersecting discipline: cardio-oncology. Over the past decade, there has been a remarkable rise of cardio-oncology clinics and service lines. This development, however, has occurred in a vacuum of standard practice and training guidelines, although these are being actively pursued.

33843546,Medical education and training within congenital cardiology: current global status and future directions in a post COVID-19 world.,"Despite enormous strides in our field with respect to patient care, there has been surprisingly limited dialogue on how to train and educate the next generation of congenital cardiologists. This paper reviews the current status of training and evolving developments in medical education pertinent to congenital cardiology. The adoption of competency-based medical education has been lauded as a robust framework for contemporary medical education over the last two decades. However, inconsistencies in frameworks across different jurisdictions remain, and bridging gaps between competency frameworks and clinical practice has proved challenging. Entrustable professional activities have been proposed as a solution, but integration of such activities into busy clinical cardiology practices will present its own challenges. Consequently, this pivot towards a more structured approach to medical education necessitates the widespread availability of appropriately trained medical educationalists, a development that will better inform curriculum development, instructional design, and assessment. Differentiation between superficial and deep learning, the vital role of rich formative feedback and coaching, should guide our trainees to become self-regulated learners, capable of critical reasoning yet retaining an awareness of uncertainty and ambiguity. Furthermore, disruptive innovations such as ""technology enhanced learning"" may be leveraged to improve education, especially for trainees from low- and middle-income countries. Each of these initiatives will require resources, widespread advocacy and raised awareness, and publication of supporting data, and so it is especially gratifying that Cardiology in the Young has fostered a progressive approach, agreeing to publish one or two articles in each journal issue in this domain.",Cardiology in the young,2022-Feb,"McMahon CJ, Tretter JT, Redington AN, Bu'Lock F, Zühlke L, Heying R, Mattos S, Krishna Kumar R, Jacobs JP, Windram JD",10,1838,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Yet, the adoption of unexplainable AI systems for cardiovascular imaging still raises significant legal and ethical challenges. We focus in particular on challenges posed by the unexplainable character of deep learning and other forms of sophisticated AI modelling used for cardiovascular imaging by briefly outlining the systems being developed in this space, describing how they work, and considering how they might generate outputs that are not reviewable by physicians or system programmers. We suggest that an unexplainable tendency presents 2 specific ethico-legal concerns: (1) difficulty for health regulators; and (2) confusion about the assignment of liability for error or fault in the use of AI systems.

In cardiology, particularly through electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, AI has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the time needed for diagnosis. This systematic review explores the integration of AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) in ECG analysis, focusing on their impact on predictive diagnostics and treatment support in cardiology. A systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 framework, using four high-impact databases to identify studies from 2014 to -2024. The inclusion criteria included English-language journal articles and research papers that focused on AI applications in cardiology, specifically ECG analysis. Records were screened, duplicates were removed, and final selections were made on the basis of their relevance to AI-ECG integration for cardiac health. The review included 46 studies that met the inclusion criteria, covering diverse AI models such as CNNs, RNNs, and hybrid models. These models were applied to ECG data to detect and predict heart conditions such as arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. These findings indicate that AI-driven ECG analysis improves diagnostic accuracy and provides significant support for early diagnosis and personalized treatment. AI technologies, especially ML and DL, enhance ECG-based cardiology diagnostics by increasing accuracy, reducing diagnosis time, and supporting timely interventions and personalized care. Continued research in this area is essential to refine algorithms and integrate AI tools into clinical practice for improved patient outcomes in cardiology.",International journal of medical informatics,2025-Mar,"Oke OA, Cavus N",2,1741,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

35767021,Simulation Based Mastery Learning of Transesophageal Echocardiography.,"Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) education is part of pediatric cardiology fellow training. Simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) is an efficient and valuable education experience. The aim of this project was to equip trainees with the basic knowledge and skill required to perform a pediatric TEE. The secondary aim was to assess the utility of using SBML for pediatric TEE training. The target group is trainees from pediatric cardiology and cardiac anesthesia who participated in a TEE bootcamp. A baseline knowledge pretest was obtained. The knowledge session consisted of preparation via reading material, viewing recorded lectures and completing an iterative multiple-choice examination, which was repeated until a minimum passing score of 90% was achieved. The skills session involved a review of TEE probe manipulation and image acquisition, followed by rapid cycle deliberate practice using simulation to acquire TEE skills at 3 levels, advancing in complexity from level 1 to level 3. Eight individuals (7 pediatric cardiology fellows at varying training levels and one anesthesia attending) participated in the TEE bootcamp. All reached a minimum knowledge post test score of at least 90% before the skills session. All subjects reached mastery in TEE probe manipulation. All reached mastery in image acquisition for the skill level that they attempted (level 1-8/8, level 2-8/8, level 3-4/4, with 4 participants not attempting level 3). A TEE bootcamp using SBML is a powerful medical education strategy. SBML is a rigorous approach that can be used to achieve high and uniform TEE learning outcomes among trainees of different training levels and backgrounds.",Pediatric cardiology,2023-Mar,"Koenig P, Patel S, Cohen ER, Hauck A, Husain N, McGaghie WC",6,1681,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
37394485,Worldwide variation in cardiovascular magnetic resonance practice models.,"The use of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) for diagnosis and management of a broad range of cardiac and vascular conditions has quickly expanded worldwide. It is essential to understand how CMR is utilized in different regions around the world and the potential practice differences between high-volume and low-volume centers. CMR practitioners and developers from around the world were electronically surveyed by the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) twice, requesting data from 2017. Both surveys were carefully merged, and the data were curated professionally by a data expert using cross-references in key questions and the specific media access control IP address. According to the United Nations classification, responses were analyzed by region and country and interpreted in the context of practice volumes and demography. From 70 countries and regions, 1092 individual responses were included. CMR was performed more often in academic (695/1014, 69%) and hospital settings (522/606, 86%), with adult cardiologists being the primary referring providers (680/818, 83%). Evaluation of cardiomyopathy was the top indication in high-volume and low-volume centers (p = 0.06). High-volume centers were significantly more likely to list evaluation of ischemic heart disease (e.g., stress CMR) as a primary indicator compared to low-volume centers (p < 0.001), while viability assessment was more commonly listed as a primary referral reason in low-volume centers (p = 0.001). Both developed and developing countries noted cost and competing technologies as top barriers to CMR growth. Access to scanners was listed as the most common barrier in developed countries (30% of responders), while lack of training (22% of responders) was the most common barrier in developing countries. This is the most extensive global assessment of CMR practice to date and provides insights from different regions worldwide. We identified CMR as heavily hospital-based, with referral volumes driven primarily by adult cardiology. Indications for CMR utilization varied by center volume. Efforts to improve the adoption and utilization of CMR should include growth beyond the traditional academic, hospital-based location and an emphasis on cardiomyopathy and viability assessment in community centers.",Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,2023-Jul,"Sierra-Galan LM, Estrada-Lopez EES, Ferrari VA, Raman SV, Ferreira VM, Raj V, Joseph E, Schulz-Menger J, Chan CWS, Chen SSM, Cheng Y, De Lara Fernandez J, Terashima M, Albert TSE",14,2311,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
34742860,Beyond Wellness Monitoring: Continuous Multiparameter Remote Automated Monitoring of Patients.,"The pursuit of more efficient patient-friendly health systems and reductions in tertiary health services use has seen enormous growth in the application and study of remote patient monitoring systems for cardiovascular patient care. While there are many consumer-grade products available to monitor patient wellness, the regulation of these technologies varies considerably, with most products having little to no evaluation data. As the science and practice of virtual care continues to evolve, clinicians and researchers can benefit from an understanding of more comprehensive solutions capable of monitoring multiple biophysical parameters (eg, oxygen saturation, heart rate) continuously and simultaneously. These devices, herein referred to as continuous multiparameter remote automated monitoring (CM-RAM) devices, have the potential to revolutionise virtual patient care. Through seamless integration of multiple biophysical signals, CM-RAM technologies can allow for the acquisition of high-volume big data for the development of algorithms to facilitate early detection of negative changes in patient health status and timely clinician response.

37327916,Pediatric Cardiology Condolence Letter Writing: Does a Fellowship Curriculum Impact Practice?,"Condolence letter (CL) writing after the death of a child is an important opportunity for humanism. Pediatric cardiology fellowship training now recognizes the importance of palliative care, but rarely includes CL education, despite its fragile patient population. To address this professionalism gap, a formal CL writing curriculum was created and implemented in a pediatric cardiology fellowship. This study investigated the impact of the curriculum on pediatric cardiology CL writing, and broader CL practices and beliefs. Pediatric cardiology fellows at a high volume urban academic program from 2000 to 2022 were divided into two cohorts (exposure to CL curriculum [2014-2022] vs. no exposure [2000-2013]) and responded by anonymous electronic multiple choice and open ended survey to assess the CL curriculum and describe current CL practices and beliefs. Impact of curriculum elements was determined by ordinal ranking. A 5-point Likert scale was used to report physician behaviors. Chi-square tests of independence were utilized for group comparisons. The overall survey response rate was 59% (63/107). Cardiologists who participated in the curriculum (64%, 35/55) were more likely to report writing CLs (80% vs. 40%; P < 0.01). Impactful curriculum elements included the opportunity for all fellows to contribute to a CL (78%) and identifying a primary fellow to write the CL (66%). A majority (>75%) of curriculum participants agreed that formal teaching increased their frequency, ability, and comfort in writing CLs.

39001698,Current status and future directions in artificial intelligence for nuclear cardiology.,"Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is one of the most commonly ordered cardiac imaging tests. Accurate motion correction, image registration, and reconstruction are critical for high-quality imaging, but this can be technically challenging and has traditionally relied on expert manual processing. With accurate processing, there is a rich variety of clinical, stress, functional, and anatomic data that can be integrated to guide patient management. PubMed and Google Scholar were reviewed for articles related to artificial intelligence in nuclear cardiology published between 2020 and 2024. We will outline the prominent roles for artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to provide motion correction, image registration, and reconstruction. We will review the role for AI in extracting anatomic data for hybrid MPI which is otherwise neglected. Lastly, we will discuss AI methods to integrate the wealth of data to improve disease diagnosis or risk stratification.

Health care efforts across the world have been diverted to tackling the pandemic since early 2020. Hospitals and health care systems have undertaken major restructuring in an effort to deliver health care to an increasing number of patients affected by COVID-19. Although great focus has been placed on treating those individuals suffering from COVID-19, clinicians must simultaneously balance caring for patients who are not actively infected. In anticipation of an exponential increase in COVID-19 cases, health care systems developed strategies to channel available resources to meet the rapidly rising demands of COVID-19. This change was noticed significantly in the field of invasive cardiology as well. Many cardiac catheterization and electrophysiology (EP) laboratories canceled elective procedures to limit the burden on hospital resources and preserve personal protective equipment (PPE). Major societies published guidance statements delineating patient selection for procedures during the exponential phase of the pandemic growth. Patient care was triaged and those waiting for elective procedures were managed with expectant care or noninvasive approaches to preserve hospital resources and personnel.

An understanding of the basics of AI applications, their development, and challenges to their clinical implementation is important for clinicians to fully appreciate the possibilities of AI. Such a foundation would ensure that clinicians have a good grasp and realistic expectations for AI in medicine and prevent discrepancies between the promised and real-world impact. When quantifying the track record for AI applications in cardiology, we found that a substantial number of AI systems are never deployed in clinical practice, although there certainly are many success stories. Successful implementations shared the following: they came from clinical areas where large amount of training data was available; were deployable into a single diagnostic modality; prediction models generally had high performance in external validation; and most were developed as part of collaborations with medical device manufacturers who had substantial experience with implementation of new clinical technology. When looking into the current processes used for developing AI-based systems, we suggest that expanding the analytic framework to address potential deployment and implementation issues at project outset will improve the rate of successful implementation, and will be a necessary next step for AI to achieve its full potential in cardiovascular medicine.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2022-Feb,"Manlhiot C, van den Eynde J, Kutty S, Ross HJ",4,1490,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
36216603,"Representation of Women in Internal Medicine Specialties in North America, the United Kingdom, and Australasia: Cardiology's Outlier Status and the Importance of Diversity.","Decades of research demonstrate the value of workplace diversity. Reports from individual countries show that women are underrepresented in internal medicine workforces. However, large pooled international studies are not available. This study investigates the current representation of women in the internal medicine workforce internationally and identifies specialties in which underrepresentation is evident. Peer-reviewed studies, government reports, and medical association reports were used to determine proportions of specialists and doctors training in internal medical specialties and in comparator surgical specialties. Data were available from Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, the United States, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. A total of 380,263 doctors were studied, including 268,822 practicing specialist physicians (also known as attendings or consultants) and 53,226 doctors in internal medicine specialty training programs (also known as residents, fellows, advanced trainees, or specialist registrar trainees). Among practicing physician specialists, the rate of representation of women was 35% (95,195/268,822, p <0.001). Among trainees, the rate of representation of women was 43% (22,728/53,226, p <0.001). Among physician specialties evaluated, cardiology (15%, 4,152 of 27,328), gastroenterology (20%, 3,765 of 18,893), and respiratory/critical care (24%, 5,255 of 21,870) had the lowest representations of women compared with men (p <0.001 for all). Cardiology and particularly the subspecialty of interventional cardiology were clear outliers as the internal medicine specialties with the lowest representation of women at practicing specialist and trainee levels. In conclusion, this study is the largest international study of women in internal medicine specialties. It found that cardiology, gastroenterology, and respiratory/critical care specialties have the most substantial underrepresentation of women.

Cardiovascular clinician and trainee knowledge and comfort with this topic, and the extent of implementation of an interdisciplinary approach to cardio-obstetrics, are unknown. Methods and Results We aimed to assess the current state of cardio-obstetrics knowledge, practices, and services provided by US cardiovascular clinicians and trainees. A survey developed in conjunction with the American College of Cardiology was circulated to a representative sample of cardiologists (N=311), cardiovascular team members (N=51), and fellows in training (N=139) from June 18, 2020, to July 29, 2020. Knowledge and attitudes about the provision of cardiovascular care to pregnant patients and the prevalence and composition of cardio-obstetrics teams were assessed. The widest knowledge gaps on the care of pregnant compared with nonpregnant patients were reported for medication safety (42%), acute coronary syndromes (39%), aortopathies (40%), and valvular heart disease (30%). Most respondents (76%) lack access to a dedicated cardio-obstetrics team, and only 29% of practicing cardiologists received cardio-obstetrics didactics during training. One third of fellows in training reported seeing pregnant women 0 to 1 time per year, and 12% of fellows in training report formal training in cardio-obstetrics. Conclusions Formalized training in cardio-obstetrics is uncommon, and limited access to multidisciplinary cardio-obstetrics teams and large knowledge gaps exist among cardiovascular clinicians.

TTE is a cost-effective first-line imaging modality to evaluate the cardiac remodeling due to long-term, intense training, previously known as the athlete's heart, and to rule out the presence of conditions at risk of sudden cardiac death, including cardiomyopathies, coronary artery anomalies, congenital, aortic and heart valve diseases. Moreover, TTE is useful for distinguishing physiological cardiac adaptations during intense exercise from pathological behavior due to an underlying CVD. In this expert opinion statement endorsed by the Italian Society of Sports Cardiology, we discussed common clinical scenarios where a TTE is required and conditions falling in the grey zone between the athlete's heart and underlying cardiomyopathies or other CVD.

Despite this, cardiology research commonly comes from affluent regions. This study assessed the authorship trends from LICs/LMICs in cardiology journals listed in PubMed from 2000 to 2022. The World Bank list was used to classify countries. The total number of articles published in the 138 cardiology journals was 529,359. The percentage of articles that included at least one author affiliated with LICs/LMICs institutions was 0.11 % and 2.23 %, respectively. Over the last decade, there has been an increase in the author's representation from LICs/LMICs; however, it is uneven, with some countries experiencing more significant increases (Zambia, Yemen, and Uganda for LICs, and India, Iran, and Lebanon for LMICs). Our findings highlight the inequity of research publication and invite our community to reflect on the need to develop strategies to improve representation from LICs/LMICs.",Current problems in cardiology,2024-Aug,"De Oliveira-Gomes D, Guilliod C, Gebran K, Martinez de Majo A, Lombardo G, Garcia R, Abadi V, Gulati M",8,1036,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
38521708,Artificial Intelligence in Nuclear Cardiology: An Update and Future Trends.,"Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), using either single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET), is one of the most commonly ordered cardiac imaging tests, with prominent clinical roles for disease diagnosis and risk prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI) could potentially play a role in many steps along the typical MPI workflow, from image acquisition through to clinical reporting and risk estimation. AI can be utilized to improve image quality, reducing radiation exposure and image acquisition times. Once images are acquired, AI can help optimize motion correction and image registration during image reconstruction or provide direct image attenuation correction. Utilizing these image sets, AI can segment a number of anatomic features from associated computed tomographic imaging or even generate synthetic attenuation imaging. Lastly, AI may play an important role in disease diagnosis or risk prediction by combining the large number of potentially important clinical, stress, and imaging-related variables. This review will focus on the most recent developments in the field, providing clinicians and researchers with a timely update on the field. Additionally, it will discuss future trends including applications of AI during multiple points of the typical MPI workflow to maximize clinical utility and methods to maximize the information that can be obtained from hybrid imaging.",Seminars in nuclear medicine,2024-Sep,"Miller RJH, Slomka PJ",2,1439,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
33133355,Maintenance of Competence in Cardiovascular Training and Practices: Worth the Effort?,"Americans expect their doctors to have the competence to deliver high-quality care and expect safeguards to be in place that assure their doctors are competent. However, competence requires knowledge, and people have trouble assessing their own knowledge and level of competence. Because external assessment is required, several organizations have taken on the roles of defining and assuring medical competence. For example, professional organizations such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC) have developed consensus documents that define core competencies for cardiologists. External organizations such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) have defined training requirements for cardiologists, and the ABIM has developed a process to certify that physicians maintain their competence, although the process has generated considerable criticism from the profession. Recently, the ACC and ABIM have worked together to make the certification process less onerous and more meaningful.

32646264,Bias and Loss to Follow-Up in Cardiovascular Randomized Trials: A Systematic Review.,"Background Loss to follow-up (LTFU) is common in randomized controlled trials. However, its potential impact on primary outcomes from cardiovascular randomized controlled trials is not known. Methods and Results We conducted a prospective systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42019121959) for randomized controlled trials published in 8 leading journals over 5 years from January 2014 to December 2018. Extent, reporting, and handling of LTFU data were recorded, and the proportion of a trial's primary outcome results that lose statistical significance was calculated after making plausible assumptions for the intervention and control arms. These assumptions could drive differential treatment effects between the groups considering relative event incidence between LTFU participants and those included in the primary outcome. We identified 117 randomized controlled trials of which 91 (78%) trials reported LTFU, 23 (20%) reported no LTFU, and 3 (3%) trials did not report on whether LTFU occurred. The median percentage of study participants lost to follow-up was 2% (interquartile range, 0.33%-5.3%). Only 10 trials (9%) had a low cluster of risk factors for impairment in trial quality. The percentage of trials losing statistical significance varied from 2% when the relative event incidence for LTFU between the randomized groups was 1 for the intervention arm and 1.5 for the control arm to 16% when the relative event incidence was 3 for the intervention arm and 1 for the control arm. Conclusions Almost 1 in 6 (16%) cardiovascular randomized trials published in leading journals may have a change in the primary outcome if plausible assumptions are made about differential event rates of participants lost to follow up. There is scope for improvement arising from LTFU in randomized trials in cardiovascular medicine.

36440543,The development and efficacy of a paediatric cardiology fellowship online preparatory course.,"The transition from residency to paediatric cardiology fellowship is challenging due to the new knowledge and technical skills required. Online learning can be an effective didactic modality that can be widely accessed by trainees. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a paediatric cardiology Fellowship Online Preparatory Course prior to the start of fellowship. The Online Preparatory Course contained 18 online learning modules covering basic concepts in anatomy, auscultation, echocardiography, catheterisation, cardiovascular intensive care, electrophysiology, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and cardiac surgery. Each online learning module included an instructional video with pre-and post-video tests. Participants completed pre- and post-Online Preparatory Course knowledge-based exams and surveys. Pre- and post-Online Preparatory Course survey and knowledge-based examination results were compared via Wilcoxon sign and paired t-tests. 151 incoming paediatric cardiology fellows from programmes across the USA participated in the 3 months prior to starting fellowship training between 2017 and 2019. There was significant improvement between pre- and post-video test scores for all 18 online learning modules. There was also significant improvement between pre- and post-Online Preparatory Course exam scores (PRE 43.6 ± 11% versus POST 60.3 ± 10%, p < 0.001). Comparing pre- and post-Online Preparatory Course surveys, there was a statistically significant improvement in the participants' comfort level in 35 of 36 (97%) assessment areas. Nearly all participants (98%) agreed or strongly agreed that the Online Preparatory Course was a valuable learning experience and helped alleviate some anxieties (77% agreed or strongly agreed) related to starting fellowship. An Online Preparatory Course prior to starting fellowship can provide a foundation of knowledge, decrease anxiety, and serve as an effective educational springboard for paediatric cardiology fellows.",Cardiology in the young,2023-Oct,"Motonaga KS, Sacks L, Olson I, Balasubramanian S, Chen S, Peng L, Feinstein JA, Silverman NH, Hanley FL, Axelrod DM, Krawczeski CD, Arunamata A, Kwiatkowski DM, Ceresnak SR",14,1990,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

39084856,"Cerebral angiography in outpatient endovascular centers: roadmap and lessons learned from interventional radiology, cardiology, and vascular surgery.","A growing proportion of percutaneous procedures are performed in outpatient centers. The shift from hospitals to ambulatory surgery centers and office-based laboratories has been driven by a number of factors, including declining reimbursements, increased patient demand, and competition for hospital resources. This transition has been dominated by the interventional radiology, cardiology, and vascular surgery fields. Cerebral angiography, in contrast, is still performed almost exclusively in a hospital-based setting, despite sharing many features with other endovascular procedures commonly performed in outpatient centers. As interest grows in performing cerebral angiography in outpatient endovascular centers, much can be learned from the decades of experience that our interventional colleagues have in the outpatient setting. In this article we examine the outpatient experience of other interventional fields and apply key principles to evaluate the prospect of outpatient neurointervention. The literature suggests that cerebral angiography can feasibly be performed in an outpatient center in both private and academic settings, as some groups have begun to do. Outpatient endovascular centers have helped to improve the patient experience, liberate inpatient resources, and control costs in other interventional fields, and might offer neurointerventionalists an opportunity to do the same.",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,2024-Jul,"Silva MA, Peterson EC",2,1405,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

The frequency of citation of a particular article is used to gauge its contribution and impact on the clinical world of practice and research. A thorough search of the literature showed a lack of bibliometric analysis on atrial fibrillation (AF). Thereby the main purpose of this study is to pinpoint the trend of the top 100 cited articles on AF. In June 2019, 2 databases, Scopus and Web of Science, were used to acquire the articles published on AF, which belonged to various genres including medicine, medical and interventional cardiology, electrophysiology, and thoracic surgery. The data were thoroughly reviewed and analyzed by 2 reviewers with regards to the number of citations for each article, publications per area, document type, first author name, country of origin, institute of origin, and year of publication. Approval of the Institutional Board Review was not required as we used publically available data retrospectively. The number of citations in the top 100 articles ranged from 622 to 6,641 times with an average citation of 1041.3 per article.

35411842,A multimedia paediatric cardiology assessment tool for medical students and general paediatric trainees: development and validation.,"Understanding how cardiovascular structure and physiology guide management is critically important in paediatric cardiology. However, few validated educational tools are available to assess trainee knowledge. To address this deficit, paediatric cardiologists and fellows from four institutions collaborated to develop a multimedia assessment tool for use with medical students and paediatric residents. This tool was developed in support of a novel 3-dimensional virtual reality curriculum created by our group. Educational domains were identified, and questions were iteratively developed by a group of clinicians from multiple centres to assess understanding of key concepts. To evaluate content validity, content experts completed the assessment and reviewed items, rating item relevance to educational domains using a 4-point Likert scale. An item-level content validity index was calculated for each question, and a scale-level content validity index was calculated for the assessment tool, with scores of ≥0.78 and ≥0.90, respectively, representing excellent content validity. The mean content expert assessment score was 92% (range 88-97%). Two questions yielded ≤50% correct content expert answers. The item-level content validity index for 29 out of 32 questions was ≥0.78, and the scale-level content validity index was 0.92. Qualitative feedback included suggestions for future improvement. Questions with ≤50% content expert agreement and item-level content validity index scores <0.78 were removed, yielding a 27-question assessment tool.

Nevertheless, its adoption and development are challenging. This review aims to provide an overview of current literature pertaining to the implementation of VBHC models used in cardiology, with a focus on cardiac electrophysiology. This scoping review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis for Scoping Reviews. The records included in this publication were relevant documents published in PubMed, Mendeley, and ScienceDirect. The search criteria were publications about VBHC in the field of cardiology and electrophysiology published between 2006 and 2023. The implementation of VBHC models in cardiology and electrophysiology is still in its infant stages. There is a clear need to modify the current organizational structure in order to establish cross-functional teams with the patient at the centre of care. The adoption of new reimbursement schemes is crucial to moving this process forward. The implementation of technologies for data analysis and patient management, among others, poses challenges to the change process. New VBHC models have the potential to improve the care process and patient experience while optimizing the costs. The implementation of this model has been insufficient mainly because it requires substantial changes in the existing infrastructures and local organization, the need to track adherence to guidelines, and the evaluation of the quality of life improvement and patient satisfaction, among others.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",2024-Aug,"Osoro L, Zylla MM, Braunschweig F, Leyva F, Figueras J, Pürerfellner H, Merino JL, Casado-Arroyo R, Boriani G",9,1679,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Gender disparities are striking in interventional cardiology (IC) and electrophysiology (EP) and in leadership. Left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device, as a novel procedure, is a lens into inequities. The purpose of this study was to identify the characteristics and prevalence of women (1) as early WATCHMAN implanters and (2) in related leadership. Data were collected on WATCHMAN implanters and hospitals from January 2017 to December 2018. The gender of physicians in leadership positions was identified via survey as Director of IC, Director of EP, and Chief of Cardiology. The Firth logistic model controlling for covariates modeled the rare event of a woman implanter. Data were obtained for 100% of the cohort. Men comprised 97% of implanters (860/886). No differences in subspecialty or implants by gender were observed. There were 414 hospitals performing WATCHMAN: 24% academic, 97% urban, and most medium/large size (94%). EP made up 61% of implanters. Only 4.8% of hospitals had women in selected leadership roles. Women represented <1% of Directors of IC and only 2.6% of both Directors of EP and Chiefs of Cardiology. Hospitals with a woman in leadership had a 4 times greater odds of a woman implanter (odds ratio 4.24; 95% confidence interval 1.16-15.41; P = .028).

34032156,Core Cardiology Training Symposium (COCATS) Standards and Board Certifications: Implications for Fellows-in-Training Seeking Employment.,"The Core Cardiology Training Symposium (COCATS) standards are recommendations endorsed by the American College of Cardiology to assist cardiology fellowship program training directors in curricular design. In addition to seeking COCATS standards as evidence of proficiency in cardiovascular skills, Fellows-In-Training (FITs) often pursue board certifications to maximize their hiring potential. The costs and barriers with COCATS standards and board certification processes are not insignificant, however the degree to which the job marketplace demands them has not been well characterized. The intent of this investigation study was to estimate the demand for COCATS standards and board certification in cardiology job advertisements. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of job listings on the American College of Cardiology's ""Cardiology Careers"" page, to establish how often advanced COCATS standards and certifications are requested. Of a total of 314 total cardiology job postings (including 133 academic positions), only eight (2.5%) job postings explicitly noted COCATS standards. Aside from American Board of Internal Medicine subspecialty certification, only 8.60% required certification in another cardiology related board certification. Despite the perception that COCATS standards and subspecialty certifications are vital to the cardiology job application process, our analysis suggests that few job postings require them. Concern regarding COCATS standards and subspecialty certification of FITs may be out of proportion to the relevance of these achievements on the current job market.",Evaluation & the health professions,2022-Dec,"Betageri O, Winchester D",2,1603,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
36223091,Professional Preferences and Perceptions of Cardiology Among Internal Medicine Residents: Temporal Trends Over the Past Decade.,"Internal medicine residents' professional development preferences were discordant with their perceptions of cardiology in a survey circulated a decade ago; no contemporary data exist. This information is important for effective recruitment and retention of a highly talented and diverse future cardiology workforce. To identify residents' professional development preferences and cardiology perceptions, in relation to specialty choice, and compare the findings with those from a decade prior. The original survey from the 2010 study was updated and sent to US internal medicine programs. Respondents (ie, internal medicine residents) rated 38 professional development preferences and 20 cardiology perceptions. Data were collected in 2020 and compared with survey results from the prior 2010 study. Multivariable models were created for specialty choice using scaled independent variables dichotomized using the top 2 options; categorical variables were recoded into binary variables for analysis. Multivariable models were used to determine the association of demographic characterisitcs and survey responses with prospective career choice. Responses were examined by total group, by gender, by self-reported consideration of entering cardiology as a profession, and by comparison with a decade prior both as a group and by gender. A total of 840 residents (mean [SD] age, 29.24 [2.82] years; 49.8% male; 55.4% White) completed the survey. The survey incorporated a 5-point Likert scale of 1 (not important) to 5 (extremely important) for some of the questions, with additional questions on demographic characteristics. The most important professional development preferences by descending Likert score were as follows: positive role models (4.56), stimulating career (3.81), and family friendly (3.78). The cardiology perception statements with the highest agreement were as follows: interferes with family life during training (3.93) and having met positive role models or having positive views of cardiovascular disease as a topic (3.85). Multivariable analysis yielded a 22-element model predicting cardiology as career choice. Compared with the 2010 survey, the findings of this survey indicated increased importance of work-life balance components for both male and female residents, with a greater change in male residents. Contemporary residents were more likely than their predecessors to agree with negative perceptions of cardiology. This survey study found that both male and female residents place a high value on support for optimal work-life balance; these preferences have intensified over the past decade and factor into career choice. Negative perceptions of cardiology persist and, in some aspects, are worsening.

34534619,Opening the Black Box: The Promise and Limitations of Explainable Machine Learning in Cardiology.,"Many clinicians remain wary of machine learning because of longstanding concerns about ""black box"" models. ""Black box"" is shorthand for models that are sufficiently complex that they are not straightforwardly interpretable to humans. Lack of interpretability in predictive models can undermine trust in those models, especially in health care, in which so many decisions are- literally-life and death issues. There has been a recent explosion of research in the field of explainable machine learning aimed at addressing these concerns. The promise of explainable machine learning is considerable, but it is important for cardiologists who may encounter these techniques in clinical decision-support tools or novel research papers to have critical understanding of both their strengths and their limitations. This paper reviews key concepts and techniques in the field of explainable machine learning as they apply to cardiology. Key concepts reviewed include interpretability vs explainability and global vs local explanations. Techniques demonstrated include permutation importance, surrogate decision trees, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, and partial dependence plots. We discuss several limitations with explainability techniques, focusing on the how the nature of explanations as approximations may omit important information about how black-box models work and why they make certain predictions. We conclude by proposing a rule of thumb about when it is appropriate to use black- box models with explanations rather than interpretable models.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2022-Feb,"Petch J, Di S, Nelson W",3,1565,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Cardiologists are embracing simulation to master complex techniques in interventional cardiology, to manage crisis situations and unusual complications and to develop medical teamwork. Simulation methods in cardiology include high-fidelity simulators, clinical scenarios, serious games, hybrid simulation and virtual reality. Simulation involves all fields of cardiology: transoesophageal echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, coronary angioplasty and electrophysiology. Beyond purely technical issues, simulation can also enhance communication skills, by using standardized patients, and can improve the management of situations related to the announcement of serious diseases. In this review of recent literature, we present existing simulation modalities, their applications in different fields of cardiology and their advantages and limitations. Finally, we detail the growing role for simulation in the teaching of medical students following the recent legal obligation to use simulation to evaluate medical students in France.",Archives of cardiovascular diseases,2021-Jan,"Pezel T, Coisne A, Bonnet G, Martins RP, Adjedj J, Bière L, Lattuca B, Turpeau S, Popovic B, Ivanes F, Lafitte S, Deharo JC, Bernard A",13,1424,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
38621242,Cardiology: What You May Have Missed in 2023.,"Cardiology and all its subspecialties continue to push the envelope in developing new treatment strategies for a wide variety of diseases. After screening more than 1300 articles, we highlight a selection of important cardiology articles published in 2023. Starting with prevention, we note articles that look at the effect of semaglutide in patients with obesity as well as a first-in-class drug, bempedoic acid, on cardiovascular outcomes. We have also examined new evidence comparing conservative management with invasive management of frail, older patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). In patients with cardiac arrest secondary to NSTEMI, another article examines the rationale for expedited transfer to a cardiac arrest center. The STREAM-2 (Strategic Reperfusion in Elderly Patients Early After Myocardial Infarction) trial builds on looking at half-dose thrombolysis in older populations with STEMI. Emphasis is placed on guideline-directed medical therapy before hospital discharge in those with heart failure. In addition, in patients with stable symptomatic coronary artery disease, initial noninvasive testing using coronary computed tomography angiography may be a viable option compared with invasive strategies. More details have emerged on anticoagulation strategies in those with device-detected atrial fibrillation. Finally, transcatheter approaches to treat both mitral and tricuspid regurgitation have also been included.",Annals of internal medicine,2024-May,"Alfraih A, Tago A, Lacombe M, Kussmaul WG",4,1473,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
37721424,Principles of artificial intelligence and its application in cardiovascular medicine.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a rapidly developing field. Its use can improve diagnosis and therapy in many areas of medicine. Despite this enormous progress, many physicians perceive it as a black box and are skeptical about it. This review will present the basics of machine learning. Different classifications of artificial intelligence, such as supervised versus unsupervised and discriminative versus generative AI, are given. Analogies to human intelligence are discussed as far as algorithms are oriented toward it. In the second step, the most common models like random forest, k-means clustering, convolutional neural network, and transformers will be presented in a way that the underlying idea can be understood. Corresponding medical applications in cardiovascular medicine will be named for all models, respectively. The overview is intended to show that the term artificial intelligence covers a wide range of different concepts. It should help physicians understand the principles of AI to make up one's minds about its application in cardiology. It should also enable them to evaluate results obtained with AI's help critically.",Clinical cardiology,2024-Jan,"Wieneke H, Voigt I",2,1154,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
33444775,"The importance of capillary distribution in supporting muscle function, building on Krogh's seminal ideas.","Krogh's Nobel prize for insightful studies into the physiology of capillaries heralded a revolution in understanding that continues today. The view of passive conduits has been replaced by capillaries recognised as a key element in haemodynamic control, offering both a site where changes in tissue demand are sensed and a driver of integrated vascular responses. In addition, the capillary bed is known to play an important role in metabolic, hormonal and immune homeostasis. Not surprisingly, therefore, microvascular dysfunction is a hallmark of many central and peripheral diseases, leading to widespread morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is growing interest in how best to specifically target this organ-system by means of effective angiotherapies. Underpinning a lot of our current understanding of capillary physiology has been a recognition of functional heterogeneity among different microvascular beds. In addition, there is increasing awareness of the role that spatial heterogeneity plays in determining both physiological and pathological outcomes that has led to an appreciation that quality, rather than just quantity of microvascular supply is important. This has required a re-appraisal of the methods used to determine both the extent and topology of the capillary network, with the benefit of facilitating new ways of exploring dynamic regulation of capillary supply and its potential consequences.","Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

Differing viewpoints exist regarding the optimal pathway for CCC training. Currently, all proposed CCC training pathways involve permutations of individual training years culminating in subspecialty certification across multiple disciplines; however, there are significant disadvantages to these training paradigms. We propose an innovative, pragmatic approach to CCC training through tailored subspecialty training in advanced heart failure and transplant cardiology (AHFTC), using elective time to enrich AHFTC training with skills and experiences necessary to become a highly skilled critical care cardiologist. The completion of this pathway would lead to completion of AHFTC training with a novel designation: distinction in critical care cardiology.",Journal of cardiac failure,2022-Feb,"Carnicelli AP, Blumer V, Genovese L, Gage A, Agarwal R, Lakdawala NK, Bohula E, Katz JN",8,1012,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

The application of AI development is currently in its early stages, nevertheless new technologies have proven to be a promising concept, particularly considering IC showing great impact on patient safety, risk stratification and outcomes during the whole therapeutic process. The primary goal is to achieve the integration of multiple cardiac imaging modalities, establish online decision support systems and platforms based on augmented and/or virtual realities, and finally to create automatic medical systems, providing electronic health data on patients. In a simplified way, two main areas of AI utilization in IC may be distinguished, namely, virtual and physical. Consequently, numerous studies have provided data regarding AI utilization in terms of automated interpretation and analysis from various cardiac modalities, including electrocardiogram, echocardiography, angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography as well as data collected during robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention procedures.

Currently, there is no clear perception about the needs in cardiac electrophysiology and pacing among early-career cardiologists. To address these concerns, the Young Committee of the Italian Association of Arrhythmology and Cardiac Pacing (AIAC) carried out a survey among those under the age of 40 years to obtain detailed information on practical activities and formal lessons during the fellowship in cardiology and their satisfaction and proficiency level at the end of the fellowship. We obtained 334 answers to the survey. In invasive cardiac electrophysiology and pacing, the percentage of participants attending the activity for a longer time (3-6 months) is lower compared with those in noninvasive subspecialties. About 40% of participants did not receive lessons on interventional cardiology, cardiac electrophysiology and pacing. On the contrary, 71% of participants received an adequate number of lessons on clinical arrhythmology. The vast majority of the participants expressed satisfaction for the education received in the echocardiographic, cardiac interventional laboratories and clinical arrhythmology, but about half of the participants were unsatisfied with the education received in cardiac electrophysiology and pacing. In interventional arrhythmology, the majority of the participants declare their lack of proficiency with two peaks for more complex procedures, namely interventional electrophysiology procedures (82%) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) procedures (76%). The present survey among Italian early-career cardiologists suggests that the majority of participants consider themselves not confident in performing cardiac electrophysiology and pacing procedures. Due to the complexity of the treatment for heart rhythm disorders and the long learning curve, structured additional training in cardiac electrophysiology and pacing procedures is required after cardiology fellowship.","Journal of cardiovascular medicine (Hagerstown, Md.)",2021-Oct,"Russo V, Nesti M, Brunacci M, Tola G, Santobuono VE, Dendramis G, Picciolo G, Lucciola MT, D'Onofrio A, Ricci R, de Ponti R",11,2110,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Yet, costs of attending these conferences represent a major barrier, particularly for trainees and participants from low-middle-income countries (LMICs). Our study aimed to analyze the registration fees of major cardiology conferences worldwide. We included conferences organized by international cardiovascular societies and those representing global regions. We did not include individual national or institutional conferences due to inability to systematically identify them. We collected 2024 registration fees from official conference websites, taking 2023 or 2022 fees if unavailable, and categorized them according to career stage and society membership status. Where specified, we chose 'early-bird' fees. All fees were converted to US dollars according to currency exchange rates per the International Monetary Fund on December 4, 2023, or if unavailable, per the last reported US Treasury Data. Other data collected included host country, virtual option availability, and LMIC discounts. 30 (65.2 %) conferences provided discounts for medical students, regardless of membership status, while 1 (2.2 %) provided discounts only for student-members. 36 (78.2 %) conferences offered discounts for residents/fellows, while 2 (4.3 %) offered discounts only for resident/fellow-members. Median fees for students and residents/fellows with membership were $255 and $287 (in US dollars), respectively while median fees for non-members were $303.5 and $397, respectively. 31 (67.4 %) conferences provided discounts for staff- members. Median fees for staff were $701 and $800 for members and non-members, respectively. Only 12 (26.1 %) conferences mentioned a virtual component, with 11 offering discounted registration compared with in-person rates. 7 (15.2 %) conferences had special in-person fees for LMIC-based registrants. 5 offered the same discounted rate regardless of training stage, while 2 offered additional discounts for trainees. We found that conference registration costs were substantial, including for trainees, with only a minority of conferences providing discounted rates for LMICs. Professional societies must reduce registration costs, potentially by implementing a tiered system based on training stage and country of origin.

The personality of J.E. Purkynje caused this field to reach unprecedented peak at the very beginning of its modern history. The development of experimental cardiology after the death of the great scholar was certainly not linear. Just when it seemed to be raising its head, the German occupation came. Its second hopeful awakening was delayed for a long time by forty years of isolation. The significant limitation of foreign contacts gradually led to the loss of hopefully developing contacts, to professional isolation and lagging behind the stormy development of world science.

32278664,Local Diagnostic Reference Levels in Interventional Radiology.,"Interventional cardiology procedures, during which live images are acquired, involve exposure to x-rays. The use of fluoroscopy can cause high radiation doses to patients and operators because of the prolonged duration of x-ray emission. For this reason, special attention and constant vigilance represent challenges for commissions and groups of experts in the field. The purpose of this study is to establish local diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for these procedures, to improve radiological practice, and to optimize radiation doses. This work was carried out in two university hospitals and two private medical facilities in Rabat, the capital of Morocco, during the period 2017-2018. The study concerns 657 interventional cardiology procedures (457 coronary angiography [CA] and 200 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [PTCA]), performed by 11 cardiologists on different installations in 5 catheterization rooms. The data collected for each procedure were patient age, height and weight, dosimeter indicators in terms of dose area product (P<sub>KA</sub>), total air kerma at the reference point (K<sub>ar</sub>), fluoroscopy time (FT), and the number of frames, together with the primary beam parameters as kV and total mAs. The proposed DRLs were set from the 75th percentile of the P<sub>KA</sub> and FT. The mean of P<sub>KA</sub> for CA and PTCA procedures were 29.2 Gy∗cm<sup>2</sup> and 70.4 Gy∗cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, the mean of fluoroscopy time were 4.0 min and 12.17 min for 334 and 685 frames, respectively. Results for the local DRLs were 37.3 and 87.1 Gy cm<sup>2</sup> for P<sub>KA</sub> and 4.48 and 16.15 min for FT, corresponding to CA and PTCA procedures.

37186563,Systematic basic and advanced resuscitation training in medical students and fellows: a proposal from the Working Group on Cardiovascular Urgences and Emergencies of the Italian Society of Cardiology.,"Sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in Europe. High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and guidelines compliance of rescuers have been associated with better outcomes after cardiac arrest. However, wide variability in attempting bystander CPR manoeuvres has been reported. Educational programmes for teaching CPR to medical students and fellows are highly advisable in this context. However, there is no homogeneity regarding the CPR education offered by academic institutions. We surveyed 208 Italian medical students and 162 fellows in cardiology regarding the educational offer and needs in CPR. Among the 11 medical schools surveyed, 8 (73%) offer basic (BLS) courses but only 3 (38%) with formal certification of 'BLS provider', while none offers advanced (ACLS/ALS) courses. Among the 30 specialization schools in cardiology surveyed, 10 (33%) offer a BLS course (6 with formal certification of 'BLS provider'), and 8 (27%) offer an ACLS/ALS course (5 with formal certification).

39506730,Study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial on simulation-based communication training for pediatric cardiology trainees (SIMUL-CHD).,"Effective physician-patient communication is crucial to compassionate healthcare, particularly when conveying life-altering diagnoses such as those associated with congenital heart diseases. Despite its importance, medical practitioners often face challenges in communicating effectively. Because of these gaps, we aim to introduce a simulation-based training protocol to improve pediatric cardiology trainee's communication skills. This study will be conducted in collaboration with associations supporting caregivers of children with congenital heart disease. It strives to demonstrate how specific training programs can efficiently foster humanistic, patient-centered care in standard medical practice. This multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial will be conducted in pediatric cardiac units and simulation centers of across 10 universities in France. The study population comprises pediatric cardiologists in training (including pediatric cardiac fellows or specialist assistants). The SIMUL-CHD intervention will consist of simulation-based training with standardized patients, focusing on improving communication skills for pediatric cardiology trainees during diagnostic counselling. Patients and caregivers have been recruited from a National Patient Association named ""Petit Cœur de Beurre"". The primary outcome is the quality of physicians' communication skills. The evaluation committee, which will review video recordings of the sessions, will be blinded to which participants received simulation-based training (group of interest) and which received theory-based training (control group). Secondary outcomes are the effect of SIMUL-CHD on empathy and anxiety levels in young pediatric cardiologists. Baseline scores pre and post-intervention will be compared, and skill improvement resulting from the intervention measured. Simulation-based training has proven efficacy in teaching technical skills in various scenarios however its application to communication skills in pediatric cardiology remains unexplored. The involvement of experienced parents provides a unique perspective, incorporating their profound understanding of the emotional challenges and specific hurdles faced by families dealing with congenital heart disease. This trial is registered with the OSF registry (registered https://osf.io/ed78q ).",BMC medical education,2024-Nov,"Padovani P, Hauet Q, Lefort B, Chauviré-Drouard A, Letellier M, Bergé M, Marguin G, Titos M, Grain A, Babonneau ML, Michon CC, Trosdorf M, Lejus-Bourdeau C, Lwin N, Picot MC, Amedro P, Baruteau AE",17,2339,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

To evaluate the global needs and potential inequities as it relates to cardiac implantable electronic devices. ARROW (Assessment of Rhythm Resources arOund the World) is an online survey about cardiac implantable electronic devices, sent electronically to physicians within the field of Cardiology, Pediatric Cardiology, Electrophysiology and Pediatric Electrophysiology. ARROW received 42 responders from 28 countries, 50% from low-/middle-income regions. The main differences between low-/middle- and high-income regions include availability of expertise on paediatric electrophysiology (50% versus 93%, p < 00.5) and possibility to perform invasive procedures (35% versus 93%, p < 0.005). Implant of devices in low-income areas relies significantly on patient's resources (71%). The follow-up of the devices is on the hands of paediatric cardiologist/electrophysiologist in higher resources centres (93% versus 50%, p < 0.05). The ARROW survey represents an initial assessment of the geographical characteristics in the field of Pediatric Electrophysiology. The next step is to make this ""state of the art"" more extensive to other aspects of the expertise. The relevance of collecting this data before the World Congress of Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery (WCPCCS) in 2023 in Washington DC was emphasised in order to share the resulting information with the international community and set a plan of action to assist the development of arrhythmia services for children within developing regions of the world.",Cardiology in the young,2022-Dec,"Gonzalez Corcia MC, Cohen MI, Paul T, Skinner JR, Shah M",5,1679,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
32608175,Improving cardiology fellow education of right heart catheterization using a simulation based curriculum.,"Medical procedures are traditionally taught informally at patients' bedside through observation and practice using the adage ""see one, do one, teach one."" This lack of formalized training can cause trainees to be unprepared to perform procedures independently. Simulation based education (SBE) increases competence, reduces complications, and decreases costs. We developed, implemented, and evaluated the efficacy of a right heart catheterization (RHC) SBE curriculum. The RHC curriculum consisted of a pretest, video didactics, deliberate practice, and a posttest. Pre-and posttest skills examinations consisted of a dichotomous 43-item checklist on RHC skills and a 14-item hemodynamic waveform quiz. We enrolled two groups of fellows: 6 first-year, novice cardiology fellows at Northwestern University in their first month of training, and 11 second- and third-year fellows who had completed traditional required, level I training in RHC. We trained the first-year fellows at the beginning of the 2018-2019 year using the SBE curriculum and compared them to the traditionally-trained cardiology fellows who did not complete SBE. The SBE-trained fellows significantly improved RHC skills, hemodynamic knowledge, and confidence from pre- to posttesting. SBE-trained fellows performed similarly to traditionally-trained fellows on simulated RHC skills checklists (88.4% correct vs. 89.2%, p = .84), hemodynamic quizzes (94.0% correct vs. 86.4%, p = .12), and confidence (79.4 vs. 85.9 out of 100, p = .15) despite less clinical experience. A SBE curriculum for RHC allowed novice cardiology fellows to achieve level I skills and knowledge at the beginning of fellowship and can train cardiology fellows before patient contact.",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2021-Feb,"Davidson LJ, Chow KY, Jivan A, Prenner SB, Cohen ER, Schimmel DR, McGaghie WC, Barsuk JH, Wayne DB, Sweis RN",10,1726,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

We use the perspective of a physician who is underrepresented in medicine (URiM), and has chosen to pursue a career in pediatric cardiology, to initiate an analysis of the current path toward pediatric cardiology and the factors in undergraduate and graduate medical education which could currently be optimized to improve diversity in training. We argue that a lack of diversity among physicians leads to worse patient outcomes, and we describe steps to improve representation in the field. In order to improve representation in pediatric cardiology, we must reflect upon our current practices and implement systemic changes within cardiology training program recruitment and retention practices. These changes should include continuous mentorship of URiM trainees interested in cardiology and prioritization of research that investigates social determinants of health which may disproportionally affect minority patients.",Pediatric cardiology,2024-Aug,"Ezeoke OM, Williams J, Ogueri V, Hills BK",4,1036,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
39549830,New horizons in nuclear cardiology: Imaging of peripheral arterial disease.,"Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) is characterized by impairment of blood flow associated with arterial stenosis and frequently coexisting microvascular disease and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Current diagnostic modalities have limited accuracy in early diagnosis, risk stratification, preprocedural assessment, and evaluation of therapy and are focused on the detection of obstructive atherosclerotic disease. Early diagnosis and assessment of both large vessels and microcirculation may improve risk stratification and guide therapeutic interventions. Single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography imaging have been shown to be accurate to detect changes in perfusion in preclinical models and clinical disease, and have the potential to overcome limitations of existing diagnostic modalities, while offering novel information about perfusion, metabolic, and molecular processes. This review provides a comprehensive reassessment of radiotracer-based imaging of PAD in preclinical and clinical studies, emphasizing the challenges that arise due to the complex physiology in the peripheral vasculature. We will also highlight the latest advancements, underscoring emerging artificial intelligence and big data analysis, as well as clinically relevant areas where the field could advance in the next decade.",Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology,2025-Apr,"Callegari S, Mena-Hurtado C, Smolderen KG, Thorn S, Sinusas AJ",5,1381,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

35272659,Developing a curriculum to improve cardiology fellows' training in pregnancy and cardiovascular disease.,"Exposure to pregnant women with cardiovascular disease (CVD) during cardiology fellowship training is limited and without a standard curriculum in the United States. The authors sought to evaluate a dedicated curriculum to teach management of CVD in pregnancy to improve general cardiology fellowship training. The authors developed a dedicated CVD in pregnancy curriculum for the general cardiology fellows at a large academic medical center in the fall of 2019. Fellows' knowledge was assessed via a board-style examination and exposure and attitudes related to the care of pregnant women with CVD were evaluated with a needs assessment questionnaire before and after the curriculum. Of the 17 fellows who participated in the curriculum, 12 completed the needs assessment pre-curriculum and 9 post-curriculum. The mean (SD) number of pregnant women with CVD cared for by each fellow in the inpatient and outpatient settings were 0.75 (1.29) and 0.56 (0.73), respectively. After the curriculum, all fellows reported awareness of available resources to treat pregnant women with CVD, while a majority disagreed that they receive regular exposure to pregnant patients with CVD in their training. The authors observed significant increases in fellows' confidence in their knowledge of normal cardiovascular physiology of pregnancy, physical exam skills, and ability to care for pregnant women with valvular disease and arrhythmias from pre to post-curriculum. A total of 15 fellows completed the board-style exam pre-curriculum and 15 post-curriculum. Fellows' performance on the board-style examination improved slightly from before to after the curriculum (64.0 to 75.3% correct, p = 0.02). A dedicated curriculum improved cardiology fellows' knowledge to recognize and treat CVD in pregnancy and improved confidence in caring for this unique patient population.",BMC medical education,2022-Mar,"Maxner B, Hansra B, Sibai D, Moinul S, Panella L, Jeha J, Fiore C, Dumont T, Lauring J, Aurigemma G, Harrington CM, Kovell LC",12,1862,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Some surveys have been performed in other countries, but in Portugal, the situation is largely unknown. An online survey on perceptions of cardiology and professional preferences was sent to 1371 members of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology, of whom 18.2% completed the survey. We included 219 cardiologists or cardiology trainees, of whom 50.2% were female, with decreasing proportions from younger to older age groups, in which males still predominate. Women are less often married and more frequently childless, particularly those working in an invasive subspecialty, where they represent only 16% of all respondents working in these areas. Men's perception is that women do not choose these areas due to family reasons, radiation concerns and difficult working conditions, but from the female perspective, male dominance, lack of female role models and restricted access are the main barriers. Women consider it is difficult for them to obtain a leadership role, but men do not think the same (75.5% vs. 27.5%). In Portugal, females predominate in younger age groups, suggesting a paradigm change. Women are less frequently married and more frequently childless, particularly women working in invasive subspecialties. Women consider that it is more difficult for them to obtain a leadership role.

34674817,Burnout and Well-Being Among Cardiology Fellowship Program Directors.,"The third annual Cardiovascular Diseases (CV) Fellowship Program Directors (PDs) Survey sought to understand burnout and well-being among CV fellowship PDs. Physician burnout is a common phenomenon. Data on burnout among cardiologists, specifically CV PDs, remain limited. The survey contained 8 questions examining satisfaction, stress, and burnout among CV fellowship PDs. Burnout was defined based on the self-reported presence of ≥1 symptom of burnout, constant feelings of burnout, or complete burnout. Survey response rate was 57%. Most respondents were men (78%) and 54% represented university-based programs. Eighty percent reported satisfaction with their current job as PD, and 96% identified interactions with fellows as a driver of their satisfaction. Forty-five percent reported feeling a great deal of stress from their job. Stress was higher among women PDs, early-career PDs, and PDs of larger and university-based programs. Twenty-one percent reported some symptoms of burnout, and only 36% reported enjoyment without stress or burnout. Rates of enjoyment without stress or burnout were higher among men and late-career PDs, PDs of smaller programs, and PDs of community-based programs. Seventeen percent of PDs reported a high likelihood of resigning in the next year, of which the most common reason was the tasks of PDs were becoming overwhelming. Most CV fellowship PDs are satisfied with their position, but stress and burnout remain common. Women PDs, early-career PDs, and PDs of larger, university-based programs demonstrate more adverse markers of well-being.

38233041,Cardiology researchers' practices and perceived barriers to open science: an international survey.,"Open science is a movement and set of practices to conduct research more transparently. Implementing open science will significantly improve public access and supports equity. It also has the potential to foster innovation and reduce duplication through data and materials sharing. Here, we survey an international group of researchers publishing in cardiovascular journals regarding their perceptions and practices related to open science. We identified the top 100 'Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine' subject category journals from the SCImago journal ranking platform. This is a publicly available portal that draws from Scopus. We then extracted the corresponding author's name and email from all articles published in these journals between 1 March 2021 and 1 March 2022. Participants were sent a purpose-built survey about open science. The survey contained primarily multiple choice and scale-based questions for which we report count data and percentages. For the few text-based responses we conducted thematic content analysis. 198 participants responded to our survey. Participants had a mean response of 6.8 (N=197, SD=1.8) on a 9-point scale with endpoints, not at all familiar (1) and extremely familiar (9), when indicating how familiar they were with open science. When asked about where they obtained open science training, most participants indicated this was done on the job self-initiated while conducting research (n=103, 52%), or that they had no formal training with respect to open science (n=72, 36%). More than half of the participants indicated they would benefit from practical support from their institution on how to perform open science practices (N=106, 54%). A diversity of barriers to each of the open science practices presented to participants were acknowledged. Participants indicated that funding was the most essential incentive to adopt open science. It is clear that policy alone will not lead to the effective implementation of open science.

35291997,An e-learning pediatric cardiology curriculum for Pediatric Postgraduate trainees in Rwanda: implementation and evaluation.,"Access to pediatric sub-specialty training is a critical unmet need in many resource-limited settings. In Rwanda, only two pediatric cardiologists are responsible for the country's clinical care of a population of 12 million, along with the medical education of all pediatric trainees. To strengthen physician training opportunities, we developed an e-learning curriculum in pediatric cardiology. This curriculum aimed to ""flip the classroom"", allowing residents to learn key pediatric cardiology concepts digitally before an in-person session with the specialist, thus efficiently utilizing the specialist for additional case based and bedside teaching. We surveyed Rwandan and US faculty and residents using a modified Delphi approach to identify key topics in pediatric cardiology. Lead authors from Rwanda and the USA collaborated with OPENPediatrics™, a free digital knowledge-sharing platform, to produce ten core topics presented in structured videos spanning 4.5 h. A mixed methods evaluation was completed with Rwandan pediatric residents, including surveys assessing knowledge, utilization, and satisfaction. Qualitative analysis of structured interviews was conducted using NVivo. Among the 43 residents who participated in the OPENPediatrics™ cardiology curriculum, 33 (77%) completed the curriculum assessment. Residents reported using the curriculum for a median of 8 h. Thirty-eight (88%) reported viewing the curriculum on their personal or hospital computer via pre-downloaded materials on a USB flash drive, with another seven (16%) reporting viewing it online. Twenty-seven residents viewed the course during core lecture time (63%). Commonly reported barriers to utilization included lack of time (70%), access to internet (40%) and language (24%). Scores on knowledge assessment improved from 66.2% to 76.7% upon completion of the curriculum (p < 0.001) across all levels of training, with most significant improvement in scores for PGY-1 and PGY-2 residents. Residents reported high satisfaction with the visuals, engaging presentation, and organization of the curriculum. Residents opined the need for expanded training material in cardiac electrocardiogram and echocardiogram and requested for slower narration by foreign presenters. Video-based e-learning via OPENPediatrics™ in a resource-limited setting was effective in improving resident's knowledge in pediatric cardiology with high levels of utilization and satisfaction. Expanding access to digital curriculums for other pediatric sub-specialties may be both an effective and efficient strategy for improving training in settings with limited access to subspecialist faculty.",BMC medical education,2022-Mar,"Rusingiza E, Alizadeh F, Wolbrink T, Mutamba B, Vinci S, Profita EL, Rulisa S, DelSignore L, Solis J, Geggel R, Wilson K",11,2657,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

The section on medical therapy of chronic coronary syndromes patients shows some inconsistency between text and the suggested scheme as well as contradictions with recommendations of regulatory agencies. It is not immediate to appreciate what is good and what is not so good in guidelines, which are often read in a hurry.

Although improved early detection and treatment have increased the survival rates, cardiotoxic treatment and inadequate management of cardiovascular risk factors have resulted in cardiovascular disease (CVD) being one of the leading causes of non-cancer-related death and disability among cancer survivors. International guidelines outline the standards of care for CVD risk surveillance and management. However, Australian cardio-oncology policies and clinical guidelines are limited. There is increasing growth of cardio-oncology research in Australia and support from leading Australian professional bodies and advocacy and research networks, including the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand, the Clinical Oncology Society of Australia, the National Heart Foundation of Australia, and the Australian Cardiovascular Alliance (ACvA). Thus, opportunities to drive multidisciplinary cardio-oncology initiatives are growing, including grant funding, position statements, and novel research to inform new policies. The ACvA has a unique flagship structure that spans the translational research pipeline from drug discovery to implementation science. This article aims to highlight how multidisciplinary cardio-oncology innovations could intersect with the seven ACvA flagships, and to showcase Australian achievements in cardio-oncology thus far. We summarise eight key priority areas for future cardio-oncology research that emerged. These strategies will strengthen cardio-oncology research and care in Australia, and drive new guidelines, policies, and government initiatives to ensure equity in health outcomes for all cardio-oncology patients.","Heart, lung & circulation",2024-May,"Singleton AC, Redfern J, Diaz A, Koczwara B, Nicholls SJ, Negishi K, La Gerche A, Playford D, Conyers R, Cehic DA, Garvey G, Williams TD, Hunt L, Doyle K, Figtree GA, Ngo DTM, Sverdlov AL",17,1768,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

An attempt was made to reach the current cardiology FITs across all programs of the U.S. via email. An anonymous questionnaire was created consisting of 14 questions. Questions posed were regarding factors affecting each participant's interest in or lack of pursuing an EP fellowship. Descriptive statistics of the responses were performed. A total of 26% (35/134) respondents expressed their interest in applying to an EP fellowship. The most common reasons to apply to EP were: Interest in EP, procedural specialty, and work-life balance. Of the 99 respondents that were not applying to EP, the most common reasons not to apply were: Less interest in EP, two-year training duration, and complexity of the specialty. The top reasons for the fellows to believe there is a dearth of EP FITs were: two-year training duration, lack of interest in EP, and the complexity of the specialty. The changes that would encourage EP fellowship interest were: More exposure to EP training during general cardiology fellowship, shortening the EP training duration, and having more information available regarding employment opportunities. The study was able to identify factors responsible for vacancies in EP fellowship positions from the view of current cardiology FITs. Stakeholders at the national level involved in framing policies related to fellowship education would be able to utilize this information to address the shortage of EP FITs and increase recruitment to EP fellowships.",Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE,2022-Aug,"Patel H, Zughaib M, Rajpurohit D, Whitler C, Kalaba F, Bradley C, Zughaib M",7,1746,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
38388330,Competency based medical education in nuclear cardiology: A tale of two axes.,"Across medical specialties, including nuclear cardiology, competency based medical education (CBME) changes the emphasis of learning from a time or experiential emphasis to a proficiency focused approached. Plotted on a learning-curve graph the emphasis on learning has shifted from the duration/ volume-based x-axis to the performance-based y-axis. It has proven difficult to establish y-axis-based standards within nuclear cardiology to assess learning. As such there is a paucity of data to verify current experiential training targets and only recently is data emerging that seeks to find CBME targets by which proficiency (y-axis units) can be evaluated. Initial reports from such CBME-oriented studies indicate that in current nuclear cardiology practice, the number of studies required to achieve competency is dependent upon the chosen measure of competency that is assessed (summed stress score versus % LV ischemia), the case mix, and the modality being learnt (PET versus SPECT). Recent findings have also suggested that prior levels of experiential training may be an underestimation of the number of supervised studies learners need to interpret before they achieve competency. Nuclear cardiology training has adopted the concept of CBME and is progressing toward a more modern approach to trainee assessment. This brief review provides the background, current requirements and insights into new developments in nuclear cardiology training.",Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences,2024-Jun,"Small GR, Chow BJW",2,1453,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

This study evaluated cardiac auscultation skills in veterinary students and compared their abilities to recent veterinary graduates, referral hospital veterinary surgeons and veterinary cardiologists or cardiology residents. In addition it compared their self-predicted quiz scores to their actual scores, evaluating if they could accurately predict their own performance level. A digital recording device was used to record auscultation sounds from 12 different patients with a diagnosis confirmed by a board-certified veterinary cardiologist. The sound files and associated phonocardiograms were uploaded to a video sharing website. A cloud-based online multiple-choice quiz was generated and shared with final year veterinary students, recent veterinary graduates, referral hospital veterinary surgeons and veterinary cardiologists or cardiology residents. There were 128 participants: 51 final year veterinary students, 62 recent veterinary graduates, and 10 referral hospital veterinary surgeons and five veterinary cardiologists or cardiology residents. No difference was found between the cardiac auscultation skills of recent veterinary graduates and final year veterinary students. Veterinary students' self-predicted scores were lower than actual scores. Recent veterinary graduates did not perform better than final year veterinary students in this study, suggesting that auscultation skills do not continue to improve in the first few years after graduation. Efforts should be made to maximise students' learning in cardiac auscultation skills.

39280999,A Vision For the Future of Cardiovascular Medicine Practise in Ghana: Inspiration From the Yale-New Haven Health System.,"The Ghana Physicians and Surgeons Foundation (GPSF) of North America sponsors Ghanaian clinical fellows to undertake an eight-weeklong clinical observation with the Yale University School of Medicine and Yale-New Haven Health (YNHH) annually, through the Residents in Training Educational Stipend (RITES) programme. This offers the opportunity to appreciate new perspectives in clinical care to improve Ghana's healthcare standard. The cardiovascular medicine workforce at the YNHH is heterogenous, with significant reliance on non-doctor cadres of health workers who demonstrate competence. This is contrasted from the Ghanaian system which despite having a poorer physician-patient ratio, is heavily dependent on doctors. Technological advancements are minimal in Ghana, posing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges which are otherwise minimised at the YNHH. A strong patient-centred culture, coupled with a coordinated emergency response system that ensures appropriate timely transfers, culminate in good care and outcomes. Ideas on how the experience can be translated to Ghanaian clinical practise in cardiovascular medicine, after participating in the RITES programme, are shared in this paper with an emphasis on task sharing, strengthening emergency response systems and improving technological sophistication through capacity building, mentorship and improved health financing.",Global heart,2024-,"Asamoah KT, Beasley MH",2,1387,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
39106529,The future of education in Preventive Cardiology: a statement of the European Association of Preventive Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology.,"In recent years, major advances in our understanding of risk factors implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), in available tools for early detection of CVD, and in effective interventions to prevent subclinical or clinically manifest disease, have led to an increasing appreciation of prevention as a major pillar of cardiovascular (CV) medicine. Preventive Cardiology has evolved into a dynamic sub-speciality focused on the promotion of CV health through all stages of life, and on the management of individuals at risk of developing CVD or experiencing recurrent CV events, through interdisciplinary care in different settings. As the level of knowledge, specialized skills, experience, and committed attitudes related to CV prevention has exceeded core cardiology training, the European Association of Preventive Cardiology (EAPC) has placed major emphasis on continuous education and training of physicians and allied professionals involved in CV prevention, with the aim of setting standards for practice and improving quality of care. The EAPC recognizes the need for a comprehensive educational offer across different levels of training (from core cardiology to sub-speciality to expert training) as well as the need for interdisciplinary approaches that will promote synergies among allied professionals involved in CV prevention. This statement by the EAPC aims to highlight current gaps and unmet needs and to describe the framework to help standardize, structure, and deliver comprehensive, up-to-date, interactive, and high-quality education using a combination of traditional and novel educational tools. The document aims to form the basis for ongoing refinements of the EAPC educational offer, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that new evidence in the field will translate to better CV practice and improved outcomes for our patients.",European journal of preventive cardiology,2024-Nov,"Koskinas KC, Wilhelm M, Halle M, Biffi A, Cavarretta E, Davos CH, Frederix I, Gaber MH, Hansen D, Jones JL, Malhotra A, Papadakis M",12,1874,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
34719260,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Cardiovascular Science: Anticipating Problems and Potential Solutions: A Presidential Advisory From the American Heart Association.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had worldwide repercussions for health care and research. In spring 2020, most non-COVID-19 research was halted, hindering research across the spectrum from laboratory-based experimental science to clinical research. Through the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021, biomedical research, including cardiovascular science, only gradually restarted, with many restrictions on onsite activities, limited clinical research participation, and the challenges associated with working from home and caregiver responsibilities. Compounding these impediments, much of the global biomedical research infrastructure was redirected toward vaccine testing and deployment. This redirection of supply chains, personnel, and equipment has additionally hampered restoration of normal research activity. Transition to virtual interactions offset some of these limitations but did not adequately replace the need for scientific exchange and collaboration. Here, we outline key steps to reinvigorate biomedical research, including a call for increased support from the National Institutes of Health. We also call on academic institutions, publishers, reviewers, and supervisors to consider the impact of COVID-19 when assessing productivity, recognizing that the pandemic did not affect all equally. We identify trainees and junior investigators, especially those with caregiving roles, as most at risk of being lost from the biomedical workforce and identify steps to reduce the loss of these key investigators. Although the global pandemic highlighted the power of biomedical science to define, treat, and protect against threats to human health, significant investment in the biomedical workforce is required to maintain and promote well-being.",Circulation,2021-Dec,"McNally EM, Elkind MSV, Benjamin IJ, Chung MK, Dillon GH, Hernandez AF, Ibeh C, Lloyd-Jones DM, McCullough LD, Wold LE, Wright DR, Wu JC",12,1789,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
33314988,Hybrid Organizations in Health Systems: The Corporatization of Malaysia's National Heart Institute.,"Health system reforms across high- and middle-income countries often involve changes to public hospital governance. Corporatization is one such reform, in which public sector hospitals are granted greater functional independence while remaining publicly owned. In theory, this can improve public hospital efficiency, while retaining a public service ethos. However, the extent to which efficiency gains are realized and public purpose is maintained depends on policy choices about governance and payment systems. We present a case study of Malaysia's National Heart Institute (IJN), which was created in 1992 by corporatization of one department in a large public hospital. The aim of the paper is to examine whether IJN has achieved the goals for which it was created, and if so, whether it provides a potential model for further reforms in Malaysia and other similar health systems. Using a combination of document analysis and key informant interviews, we examine key governance, health financing and payment, and equity issues. For governance, we highlight the choice to have IJN owned by and answerable to a Ministry of Finance (MOF) holding company and MOF-appointed board, rather than the Ministry of Health (MOH). On financing and payment, we analyze the implications of IJN's combined role as fee-for-service provider to MOH as well as provider of care to private patients. For equity, we analyze the targeting of IJN care across publicly-referred and private patients. These issues demonstrate unresolved tensions between IJN's objectives and public service goals. As an institutional innovation that has endured for 28 years and grown dramatically in size and revenue, IJN's trajectory offers critical insights on the relevance of the hybrid public-private models for hospitals in Malaysia as well as in other middle-income countries. While IJN appears to have achieved its goal of establishing itself as a commercially viable, publicly owned center of clinical excellence in Malaysia, the value for money and equity of the services it provides to the Ministry of Health remain unclear. IJN is accountable to a small Ministry of Finance holding company, which means that detailed information required to evaluate these critical questions is not published. The case of IJN highlights that corporatization cannot achieve its stated goals of efficiency, innovation, and equity in isolation; rather it must be supported by broader reforms, including of health financing, payment, governance, and transparency, in order to ensure that autonomous hospitals improve quality and provide efficient care in an equitable way.",Health systems and reform,2020-Dec,"Virk A, Croke K, Mohd Yusoff M, Mokhtaruddin K, Abdullah Z, Nadziha Mohd Hanafiah A, Soleha Ramli E, Filzatun Borhan N, Almodovar Diaz Y, Aun YW, Atun R",11,2625,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
37934981,Radiation exposure in interventional cardiology: extremities doses.,"X-rays are widely used in interventional cardiology (IC). Medical staff is exposed to ionising radiations with difficulties to accurately estimate the absorbed dose, on the other hand, it is well known that eye lens and extremities are the most exposed. In most IC units, radiological monitoring is performed by measuring the personal dose equivalent with a dosemeter worn under the operator's apron. The ambient dose equivalent is, usually, also measured. Furthermore, doses to the lens and extremities are often not measured because of the absence or difficulty of wearing the appropriate dosemeters. The main aim of our study is to estimate the extremities doses, of the interventional cardiologists, from the personal dose equivalent, the patient's received doses or to the ambient dose equivalent. For this purpose, we use a radiological monitoring, of four (04) interventional cardiologists, carried out at Algiers hospital. A Monte Carlo calculation is performed for comparison.

In this review we explore novel statistical approaches and methodological considerations for such trials, with a focus on cardiovascular therapies. We discuss the concept of ""small"" sample sizes and their limitations and cover various analytical frameworks, including frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and emphasize their implications for result interpretation and reproducibility. We examine end points such as ""days alive and free specific to disease state,"" which combines mortality and morbidity measures, the win ratio for hierarchical end points, and ordinal scales that capture detailed patient outcomes. These methods potentially increase statistical power and provide more clinically relevant measures compared with traditional binary outcomes; an extensive use of simulations is used to clarify this point. The use of longitudinal ordinal models is presented as a promising method to capture complex patient trajectories over time, offering insights into treatment effects at various disease stages. We also address the potential of adaptive platform trials for rare conditions, allowing for more efficient use of limited patient populations.

To examine female representation within Australia and New Zealand (NZ) among physician specialties and certain comparator surgical specialties with a focus on cardiology as an outlier of workforce gender equality. Data of practising medical specialists, new consultants and trainees were sought from the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, the Medical Council of NZ and the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (2015-2017). The stratified data pertaining to interventional cardiologists were obtained through direct contact with individual hospitals (from 2017 to 2018) and derived from state-based cardiac registries. In Australia and NZ, there were fewer female practising adult medicine physician consultants (n = 8956, 32%, P < 0.001), with gender disparities seen across most physician specialties. Cardiology (15%) was the only physician specialty with <20% representation; gastroenterology (23%), neurology (27%) and respiratory medicine (29%) had <30% female representation at the consultant level. The rates of cardiology (15%) and interventional cardiology (5%) were similar to general surgery (15%) and orthopaedics (4%). Although more than half of physician trainees are female, and most physician specialties are approaching or have equal gender ratios at the trainee level, cardiology (23%) and interventional cardiology (9%) remain significantly underrepresented.

36508019,Applying Practice Analysis to Develop a New Test Content Outline for the Pediatric Cardiology Certification Examination.,"The evolving breadth and complexity of the contemporary pediatric cardiology specialty requires regular, systematic analysis of the practice to ensure that training and certification requirements address the demands of real-world clinical experience. We report the process of the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) for conducting such a practice analysis and revising the test content outline (TCO) for the pediatric cardiology subspecialty certification exam. A panel of 15 pediatric cardiologists conducted seven 2-h virtual meetings, during which they identified 37 unique tasks that represent the work a pediatric cardiologist may reasonably expect to perform within the first 5 years after training. These tasks were grouped into nine performance domains, similar to the entrustable professional activities (EPA), previously endorsed by the ABP in collaboration with the pediatric cardiology education community, and which represent the critical activities of the profession. The panel then enumerated the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform each task. These deliberations resulted in two work products: a practice analysis document (PAD) and subspecialty board TCO based on testable knowledge, skills, and abilities. Survey assessments of the panel's work were then distributed to pediatric cardiology fellowship program directors and to practicing pediatric cardiologists for their input, which largely aligned with the panel's recommendations. Survey responses were considered in the final revisions of the PAD and TCO.

32627666,A Systematic Review of Methods Used for Confounding Adjustment in Observational Economic Evaluations in Cardiology Conducted between 2013 and 2017.,"<b>Background.</b> Observational economic evaluations (i.e., economic evaluations in which treatment allocation is not randomized) are prone to confounding bias. Prior reviews published in 2013 have shown that adjusting for confounding is poorly done, if done at all. Although these reviews raised awareness on the issues, it is unclear if their results improved the methodological quality of future work. We therefore aimed to investigate whether and how confounding was accounted for in recently published observational economic evaluations in the field of cardiology. <b>Methods.</b> We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and PsycInfo databases using a set of Medical Subject Headings and keywords covering topics in ""observational economic evaluations in health within humans"" and ""cardiovascular diseases."" Any study published in either English or French between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2017, addressing our search criteria was eligible for inclusion in our review. Our protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018112391). <b>Results.</b> Forty-two (0.6%) out of 7523 unique citations met our inclusion criteria.

34795366,Comparison of two strategies for managing in-hospital cardiac arrest.,"In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is associated with poor outcomes. There are currently no standards for cardiac arrest teams in terms of member composition and task allocation. Here we aimed to compare two different cardiac arrest team concepts to cover IHCA management in terms of survival and neurological outcomes. This prospective study enrolled 412 patients with IHCA from general medical wards. From May 2014 to April 2016, 228 patients were directly transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for ongoing resuscitation. In the ICU, resuscitation was extended to advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) (Load-and-Go [LaG] group). By May 2016, a dedicated cardiac arrest team provided by the ICU provided ACLS in the ward. After return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), the patients (n = 184) were transferred to the ICU (Stay-and-Treat [SaT] group). Overall, baseline characteristics, aetiologies, and characteristics of cardiac arrest were similar between groups. The time to endotracheal intubation was longer in the LaG group than in the SaT group (6 [5, 8] min versus 4 [2, 5] min, p = 0.001). In the LaG group, 96% of the patients were transferred to the ICU regardless of ROSC achievement. In the SaT group, 83% of patients were transferred to the ICU (p = 0.001). Survival to discharge did not differ between the LaG (33%) and the SaT (35%) groups (p = 0.758). Ultimately, 22% of patients in the LaG group versus 21% in the SaT group were discharged with good neurological outcomes (p = 0.857). In conclusion, we demonstrated that the cardiac arrest team concepts for the management of IHCA did not differ in terms of survival and neurological outcomes.

Materials and Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. ESC and ACC/AHA guidelines published until May 2023 were systematically screened for recommendations related to cardiac MRI. The class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) for cardiac MRI recommendations were compared between the two guidelines and between newer versus older versions of each guideline using χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher exact tests. Results ESC guidelines included 109 recommendations regarding cardiac MRI, and ACC/AHA guidelines included 90 recommendations. The proportion of COR I and LOE B was higher in ACC/AHA versus ESC guidelines (60% [54 of 90] vs 46.8% [51 of 109]; <i>P</i> = .06 and 53% [48 of 90] vs 35.8% [39 of 109], respectively; <i>P</i> = .01). The increase in the number of cardiac MRI recommendations over time was significantly higher in ESC guidelines (from 63 to 109 for ESC vs from 65 to 90 for ACC/AHA; <i>P</i> = .03). The main areas of consensus were found in heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, while the main divergences were in valvular heart disease, arrhythmias, and aortic disease. Conclusion ESC guidelines included more recommendations related to cardiac MRI use, whereas the ACC/AHA recommendations had higher COR and LOE. The number of cardiac MRI recommendations increased significantly over time in both guidelines, indicating the increasing role of cardiac MRI evaluation and management of cardiovascular disease. <b>Keywords:</b> Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, Guideline, European Society of Cardiology, ESC, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, ACC/AHA <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> © RSNA, 2024.",Radiology.

34253795,Influence of heart rate correction formulas on QTc interval stability.,"Monitoring of QTc interval is mandated in different clinical conditions. Nevertheless, intra-subject variability of QTc intervals reduces the clinical utility of QTc monitoring strategies. Since this variability is partly related to QT heart rate correction, 10 different heart rate corrections (Bazett, Fridericia, Dmitrienko, Framingham, Schlamowitz, Hodges, Ashman, Rautaharju, Sarma, and Rabkin) were applied to 452,440 ECG measurements made in 539 healthy volunteers (259 females, mean age 33.3 ± 8.4 years). For each correction formula, the short term (5-min time-points) and long-term (day-time hours) variability of rate corrected QT values (QTc) was investigated together with the comparisons of the QTc values with individually corrected QTcI values obtained by subject-specific modelling of the QT/RR relationship and hysteresis. The results showed that (a) both in terms of short-term and long-term QTc variability, Bazett correction led to QTc values that were more variable than the results of other corrections (p < 0.00001 for all), (b) the QTc variability by Fridericia and Framingham corrections were not systematically different from each other but were lower than the results of other corrections (p-value between 0.033 and < 0.00001), and (c) on average, Bazett QTc values departed from QTcI intervals more than the QTc values of other corrections. The study concludes that (a) previous suggestions that Bazett correction should no longer be used in clinical practice are fully justified, (b) replacing Bazett correction with Fridericia and/or Framingham corrections would improve clinical QTc monitoring, (c) heart rate stability is needed for valid QTc assessment, and (d) development of further QTc corrections for day-to-day use is not warranted.",Scientific reports,2021-Jul,"Andršová I, Hnatkova K, Šišáková M, Toman O, Smetana P, Huster KM, Barthel P, Novotný T, Schmidt G, Malik M",10,1771,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

As social media influence continues to expand, it becomes increasingly important for cardiovascular researchers to employ social media strategies to increase the impact of their research work, for the ultimate goal of improved outcomes for patients living with or at risk for cardiovascular diseases. Altmetrics are novel metrics that track the attention that scholarly outputs are receiving in non-traditional sources such as in the news, blogs, and social media posts. These alternative metrics record research dissemination beyond traditional journal citation indices, while also predicting and even promoting future citations.

35750554,Feasibility and effectiveness of cardiac auscultation training with a cardiology patient simulator for first-year medical students.,"The effectiveness of cardiac auscultation training with a cardiology patient simulator for medical students is still unclear. Starting such training earlier may help students improve their proficiency. We investigated whether cardiac auscultation training using a simulator for first-year students is feasible and effective. A total of 43 first-year medical students (5-12 in each year, 2015-2019) participated in three 1.5-hour extra-curricular classes comprising mini-lectures, facilitated training, two different auscultation tests (the second test closer to clinical setting than the first), and a questionnaire. The test results were compared with those of 556 fourth-year medical students who participated in a compulsory 3-hour cardiac auscultation class in 2016-2019. The accuracy rate of all heart sounds and murmurs was higher in the first-year students than in the fourth-year students in both the first (85.8 vs. 79.4 %, p = 0.001) and second (71.3 vs. 61.2 %, p = 0.02) tests. That of second/third/fourth sounds was also higher in the first-year students than in the fourth-year students in both the first (86.0 vs. 79.7 %, p = 0.01) and second (70.9 vs. 53.9 %, p = 0.002) tests. The accuracy rate of murmurs was higher in the first-year students than in the fourth-year students in the first test (85.5 vs. 78.9 %, p = 0.04), but not in the second test (72.1 vs. 75.7 %, p = 0.58). All the first-year students and 65 % of them agreed that they had received sufficient knowledge and built sufficient skills, respectively. All the first-year students and 93 % of them agreed that they were satisfied with the program, and that the program was suitable for first-year students, respectively. Although training time was different between the two groups and it is possible that only motivated first-year students participated in the program, these results suggest that our cardiac auscultation training is feasible and effective for first-year medical students.",Journal of cardiology,2022-Nov,"Kagaya Y, Tabata M, Arata Y, Kameoka J, Ishii S",5,1971,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Due to the inherent complexity and flexibility of ML algorithms, inconsistencies in the model performance and interpretation may occur. Several review articles have been recently published that introduce the fundamental principles and clinical application of ML for cardiologists. This paper builds on these introductory principles and outlines a more comprehensive list of crucial responsibilities that need to be completed when developing ML models. This paper aims to serve as a scientific foundation to aid investigators, data scientists, authors, editors, and reviewers involved in machine learning research with the intent of uniform reporting of ML investigations. An independent multidisciplinary panel of ML experts, clinicians, and statisticians worked together to review the theoretical rationale underlying 7 sets of requirements that may reduce algorithmic errors and biases. Finally, the paper summarizes a list of reporting items as an itemized checklist that highlights steps for ensuring correct application of ML models and the consistent reporting of model specifications and results.

We followed the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) methodology for the development of QIs. Key domains were identified by constructing a conceptual framework for the delivery of TAVI care. A list of candidate QIs was developed by conducting a systematic review of the literature. A modified Delphi method was then used to select the final set of QIs. Finally, we mapped the QIs to the EuroHeart (European Unified Registries on Heart Care Evaluation and Randomized Trials) data standards for TAVI to ascertain the extent to which the EuroHeart TAVI registry captures information to calculate the QIs. We formed an international group of experts in quality improvement and TAVI, including representatives from the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions, the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging, and the Association of Cardiovascular Nursing and Allied Professions.

Regionalization of ECMO might require the implementation of therapy before and during transfer to the high-volume center. The aim of this international survey was to describe the manner in which interhospital ECMO transport care is organized at experienced centers. Fifteen mobile ECMO centers from nine countries participated in this survey. Seven (47%) of them operated under the ""Hub-and-Spoke"" model. Transport team composition varies from three to nine members, with at least one ECMO specialist (i.e., nurse or perfusionist) participating in all centers, although intensivists and surgeons were present in 69% and 50% of the teams, respectively. All centers responded that the final decision to initiate ECMO is multidisciplinary and made bedside at the referring hospital. Most centers (75%) have a quality control system; all teams practice simulation and water drills. Considering the variability in ECMO transport teams among experienced centers, continuous education, training and quality control within each organization itself are necessary to avoid adverse events and maintain a low mortality rate.

When compared to responses received from physicians at low-volume centers (< 300 annual bypass cases), those at high-volume centers reported more involvement from the neurodevelopmental teams (58% vs. 29%; P = 0.012) and a standardized transition to outpatient care (68% vs. 52%; P = 0.038). While a majority of cardiothoracic surgery and anesthesiology respondents reported multidisciplinary involvement, less than half of cardiology and neonatology supported this statement. The most commonly reported obstacles to multidisciplinary engagement were culture (61.6%) and logistics (47.1%). Having a standardized neonatal cardiac curriculum for neonatal fellows was positively associated with the perception that multidisciplinary collaboration was ""always"" in place (53% vs. 40%; P = 0.09).

Data about feasibly and safety of pediatric ECMO transport are scarce. Our aim is to describe our experience with a pediatric ECMO reach-out program and review pertinent literature. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were collected retrospectively from the charts of all patients cannulated onto ECMO at referring centers and transported to our center from 2003 to 2018. Similar data were recorded for patients who were referred for ECMO support from within the hospital. The cohort included 80 patients cannulated at 17 referring centers. The transport team included a senior pediatric cardiac surgeon and an ECMO specialist. All transfers but one were done by special emergency medical service ambulance. No major complications or deaths occurred during transport, and all patients were stable upon arrival to our unit. Mortality was lower in the ECMO reach-out cohort than in-house patients referred for ECMO support. This is the first study from Israel and one of the largest to date describing a dedicated pediatric ECMO transport program. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation transport appears to be feasible and safe when conducted by a small, highly skilled mobile team. Successful reach-out program requires open communication between the referring physician and the accepting center.

Fluoroscopy has traditionally been the primary imaging modality for catheter ablation, providing real-time visualization of catheter navigation. However, its limitations, such as inadequate soft tissue visualization and exposure to ionizing radiation, have prompted the integration of alternative imaging modalities. Over the years, advancements in imaging techniques have played a pivotal role in enhancing the safety, efficacy, and efficiency of catheter ablation procedures. This manuscript aims to explore the utility of imaging, including electroanatomical mapping, cardiac computed tomography, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and nuclear cardiology exams, in helping electrophysiology procedures. These techniques enable accurate anatomical guidance, identification of critical structures and substrates, and real-time monitoring of complications, ultimately enhancing procedural safety and success rates. Incorporating advanced imaging technologies into routine clinical practice has the potential to further improve clinical outcomes of catheter ablation procedures and pave the way for more personalized and precise ablation therapies in the future.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",2023-Aug,"Berruezo A, Penela D, Jáuregui B, de Asmundis C, Peretto G, Marrouche N, Trayanova N, de Chillou C",8,1303,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

39709014,Is the Time Right for Preventive Cardiology Guidelines on Sedentary Behaviours and Sitting Time?,"In this review sedentary behaviour (SB) is considered beyond its simplistic definition of ""sitting"" and also includes sedentary activities. We explore the definition, physiological characteristics, prevalence, and guidelines of SB, contrasting it with physical activity (PA). The discussion encompasses: (1) the association between SB and mortality, with a specific focus on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes; (2) biological mechanisms that link SB to CV health, additionally differentiating between the effects of acute and chronic sitting; (3) sex and gender differences in SB; and (4) SB as an independent CV risk factor is explored. The review concludes with an examination of the potential beneficial effects of PA on mitigating the detrimental effects of SB and an analysis of evidence that supports the use of break-up strategies in preventive cardiology. This analysis sheds light on the significant deleterious consequences of SB on CV health. It highlights the potential of incorporating strategies to reduce and interrupt prolonged sitting alongside existing guidelines that promote PA.

36123701,Variable exposure to echocardiography core competencies when applying minimum recommended procedural numbers for cardiology fellows in training.,"The American College of Cardiology Core Cardiovascular Training Statement (COCATS) defined echocardiography core competencies and set the minimum recommend number of echocardiograms to perform (150) and interpret (300) for independent practice in echocardiography (level 2 training). Fellows may lack exposure to key pathologies that are relatively infrequent, however, even when achieving an adequate number of studies performed and interpreted. We hypothesized that cardiology fellows would lack exposure to 1 or more cardiac pathologies related to core competencies in COCATS when performing and interpreting the minimum recommend number of studies for level 2 training. We retrospectively reviewed 11,250 reports from consecutive echocardiograms interpreted (7,500) and performed (3,750) by 25 cardiology fellows at a University tertiary referral hospital who graduated between 2015 and 2019. The first 300 echocardiograms interpreted and the first 150 echocardiograms performed by each fellow were included in the analysis. Echocardiography reports were reviewed for cardiac pathologies relating to core competencies defined in COCATS. All 25 fellows lacked exposure to 1 or more cardiac pathologies related to echocardiography core competencies despite meeting COCATS minimum recommended numbers for echocardiograms performed and interpreted. Pathologies for which 1 or more fellows encountered 0 cases despite meeting the minimum recommended numbers for both echocardiograms performed and interpreted included: pericardial constriction (16/25 fellows), aortic dissection (15/25 fellows), pericardial tamponade (4/25 fellows), valvular mass/thrombus (2/25 fellows), prosthetic valve dysfunction (1/25 fellows), and cardiac chamber mass/thrombus (1/25 fellows). Cardiology fellows who completed the minimum recommend number of echocardiograms performed and interpreted for COCATS level 2 training frequently lacked exposure to cardiac pathologies, even in a University tertiary referral hospital setting. These data suggest that fellowship programs should monitor pathology case counts for each fellow in training, in addition to the minimum recommend number of echocardiograms defined by COCATS, to ensure competency for independent practice in echocardiography.",Cardiovascular ultrasound,2022-Sep,"Bierowski MJ, Qureshi U, Ramedani S, Grewal S, Shah R, Park R, Peterson BR",7,2268,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Our aim is to describe and evaluate a visual teaching tool, tomographic plane visualization (ToPlaV) as an adjunct to skills training in pediatric echocardiography image acquisition. This tool incorporates learning theory by applying psychomotor skills that closely emulate the skills used in echocardiography. ToPlaV was used as part of a transthoracic bootcamp for first year cardiology fellows. A qualitative survey was given to trainees to evaluate their perceptions of its usefulness. There was universal agreement among fellow trainees that ToPlaV is a useful training tool. ToPlaV is a simple, low cost, education tool which can complement a simulator and live models. We propose that ToPlaV should be incorporated into early training in echocardiography skills for pediatric cardiology fellows.",Pediatric cardiology,2023-Oct,"Koenig P, Patel S, McGaghie WC",3,870,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
38989848,Assessing GPT-4's Performance in Delivering Medical Advice: Comparative Analysis With Human Experts.,"Accurate medical advice is paramount in ensuring optimal patient care, and misinformation can lead to misguided decisions with potentially detrimental health outcomes. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4 has spurred interest in their potential health care applications, particularly in automated medical consultation. Yet, rigorous investigations comparing their performance to human experts remain sparse. This study aims to compare the medical accuracy of GPT-4 with human experts in providing medical advice using real-world user-generated queries, with a specific focus on cardiology. It also sought to analyze the performance of GPT-4 and human experts in specific question categories, including drug or medication information and preliminary diagnoses. We collected 251 pairs of cardiology-specific questions from general users and answers from human experts via an internet portal. GPT-4 was tasked with generating responses to the same questions. Three independent cardiologists (SL, JHK, and JJC) evaluated the answers provided by both human experts and GPT-4. Using a computer interface, each evaluator compared the pairs and determined which answer was superior, and they quantitatively measured the clarity and complexity of the questions as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of the responses, applying a 3-tiered grading scale (low, medium, and high). Furthermore, a linguistic analysis was conducted to compare the length and vocabulary diversity of the responses using word count and type-token ratio. GPT-4 and human experts displayed comparable efficacy in medical accuracy (""GPT-4 is better"" at 132/251, 52.6% vs ""Human expert is better"" at 119/251, 47.4%). In accuracy level categorization, humans had more high-accuracy responses than GPT-4 (50/237, 21.1% vs 30/238, 12.6%) but also a greater proportion of low-accuracy responses (11/237, 4.6% vs 1/238, 0.4%; P=.001). GPT-4 responses were generally longer and used a less diverse vocabulary than those of human experts, potentially enhancing their comprehensibility for general users (sentence count: mean 10.9, SD 4.2 vs mean 5.9, SD 3.7; P<.001; type-token ratio: mean 0.69, SD 0.07 vs mean 0.79, SD 0.09; P<.001). Nevertheless, human experts outperformed GPT-4 in specific question categories, notably those related to drug or medication information and preliminary diagnoses. These findings highlight the limitations of GPT-4 in providing advice based on clinical experience. GPT-4 has shown promising potential in automated medical consultation, with comparable medical accuracy to human experts. However, challenges remain particularly in the realm of nuanced clinical judgment. Future improvements in LLMs may require the integration of specific clinical reasoning pathways and regulatory oversight for safe use. Further research is needed to understand the full potential of LLMs across various medical specialties and conditions.",JMIR medical education,2024-Jul,"Jo E, Song S, Kim JH, Lim S, Kim JH, Cha JJ, Kim YM, Joo HJ",8,2949,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
32883415,Program Directors Survey on Diversity in Cardiovascular Training Programs.,"Women and minorities are under-represented in cardiovascular disease (CVD) specialties. It remains unknown how characteristics of the CVD learning environment affect diversity and how program directors (PDs) approach these critical issues. The second annual Cardiovascular PD Survey aimed to investigate characteristics of the CVD learning environment that may affect diversity and strategies PDs use to approach these issues. The survey contained 20 questions examining U.S.-based CVD PD perceptions of diversity in CVD and related characteristics of the CVD fellowship learning environment. In total, 58% of PDs completed the survey. Responding programs demonstrated geographic diversity. The majority were university-based or -affiliated. A total of 86% of PDs felt diversity in CVD as a field needs to increase, and 70% agreed that training programs could play a significant role in this. In total, 89% of PDs have attempted to increase diversity in fellowship recruitment. The specific strategies used were associated with PD sex and the presence of under-represented minority trainees in the program. PDs identified lack of qualified candidates and overall culture of cardiology as the 2 most significant barriers to augmenting diversity. A majority of programs have support systems in place for minority fellows or specific gender groups, including procedures to report issues of harassment or an unsafe learning environment. PDs identified shared best practices for recruitment and implicit bias training, among others, as important resources in their efforts to support diversity in CVD training. Diversity is important to CVD PDs. They are striving to increase it in their programs through recruitment and strategies directed toward the fellowship learning environment.

35438211,A deep neural network using audio files for detection of aortic stenosis.,"Although aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease in the western world, many affected patients remain undiagnosed. Auscultation is a readily available screening tool for AS. However, it requires a high level of professional expertise. An AI algorithm can detect AS using audio files with the same accuracy as experienced cardiologists. A deep neural network (DNN) was trained by preprocessed audio files of 100 patients with AS and 100 controls. The DNN's performance was evaluated with a test data set of 40 patients. The primary outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. Results of the DNN were compared with the performance of cardiologists, residents, and medical students. Eighteen percent of patients without AS and 22% of patients with AS showed an additional moderate or severe mitral regurgitation. The DNN showed a sensitivity of 0.90 (0.81-0.99), a specificity of 1, and an F1-score of 0.95 (0.89-1.0) for the detection of AS. In comparison, we calculated an F1-score of 0.94 (0.86-1.0) for cardiologists, 0.88 (0.78-0.98) for residents, and 0.88 (0.78-0.98) for students. The present study shows that deep learning-guided auscultation predicts significant AS with similar accuracy as cardiologists.

A 42-question survey was sent to 80 echocardiography laboratory directors at paediatric cardiology centres with surgical programmes in the United States and Canada. Question domains included transesophageal echocardiography centre characteristics, performance and reporting, equipment use, trainee participation, and quality assurance. Fifty of the 80 centres (62.5%) responded to the survey. Most settings were academic (86.0%) with 42.0% of centres performing > 350 surgical cases/year. The median number of transesophageal echocardiograms performed/cardiologist/year was 50 (26, 73). Pre-operative transesophageal echocardiography was performed in most surgical cases by 91.7% of centres. Transesophageal echocardiography was always performed by most centres following Norwood, Glenn, and Fontan procedures and by < 10% of centres following coarctation repair. Many centres with a written guideline allowed transesophageal echocardiography transducer use at weights below manufacturer recommendations (50.0 and 61.1% for neonatal and paediatric transducers, respectively). Most centres (36/37, 97.3%) with categorical fellowships had rotations which included transesophageal echocardiography participation.

This newly developed hands-on training program is supposed to enable the acquisition of certain skills which are necessary when investigating and treating patients in a catheter laboratory. Based on anonymous CT-scans of pediatric patients' digital 3D heart models with or without cardiac defects were developed and printed three-dimensionally in a flexible material visible under X-ray. Hands-on training courses were offered using models of a healthy heart and the most common congenital heart defects (CHD). An evaluation was performed by quantifying fluoroscopy times (FL-time) and a questionnaire. The acceptance of theoretical and practical contents within the hands-on training was very positive. It was demonstrated that it is possible to master various steps of a diagnostic procedure and an intervention as well as to practice and repeat them independently which significantly reduced FL-time. The participants stated that the hands-on training led to more confidence in interventions on real patients. With the development of a training module using 3D-printed heart models, basic and advanced training in the field of diagnostic cardiac examinations as well as interventional therapies of CHD is possible.

This study employs a prospective cohort design. Internal medicine residents at University at Buffalo participated in monthly ECG didactic sessions over a 7-month period. Residents were invited to complete pre- and post-curriculum questionnaires. Responses were anonymous and participation voluntary. Data collected included basic demographics, career interest, exposure to clinical cardiology, and number of sessions attended. Residents were asked to interpret sixteen unique ECGs, divided evenly among eight common rhythms into both questionnaires. Pre- and post-curriculum cohorts were compared using t-tests and chi-square analyses. Associations between attendance, comfort level in interpretation, and number of correct interpretations were analyzed using Pearson correlations. Multivariate linear regression determined the strongest predictor of the number of correct ECG interpretations. The post-curriculum cohort correctly interpreted a significantly greater percentage of ECGs compared to pre-curriculum cohort (74.5% vs. 60.9%, p < .001). Didactic attendance was significantly associated with comfort level in interpreting ECGs (r = .328, p = .018) and trended towards an increased number of correct interpretations (r = .248, p = .077). Residents who attended three or more sessions demonstrated increased ECG interpretation skills compared to those who attended two or fewer sessions (80.0% vs. 71.1%, p = .048). Number of clinical cardiology rotations attended was significantly associated with correct interpretations (r = .310, p < .001) and was the strongest predictor of accurately interpreting ECGs (β = 0.29, p = .037).

The prevalence of heart failure (HF) in this group exceeds 10%. We assessed changes in clinical characteristics, therapy, and 1-year outcomes over 2 decades in chronic HF outpatients aged ≥ 80 years enrolled in a nationwide cardiology registry. We included 2520 octogenarians with baseline echocardiographic ejection fraction measurements and available 1-year follow-up, who were recruited at 138 HF outpatient clinics (21% of national hospitals with cardiology units), across 3 enrolment periods (1999-2005, 2006-2011, 2012-2018). At recruitment, over the 3 study periods, there was an increase in age, body mass index, ejection fraction, the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, pre-existing hypertension, and atrial fibrillation history. The proportion of patients with preserved ejection fraction rose from 19.4% to 32.7% (P for trend <.0001). Markers of advanced disease became less prevalent. Prescription of beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists increased over time. During the 1-year follow-up, 308 patients died (12.2%) and 360 (14.3%) were admitted for cardiovascular causes; overall, 591 (23.5%) met the combined primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization.

For the study, a set of 88 multiple-choice cardiology exam questions was used. The participating cardiology fellows and selected chatbots were presented with these questions. The evaluation metrics included Top-1 and Top-2 accuracy, assessing the ability of chatbots and fellows to select the correct answer. Among the cardiology fellows, all 36 participants successfully passed the exam with a median accuracy of 98% (IQR 91-99%, range from 78% to 100%). However, the performance of the chatbots varied. Only one chatbot, Jasper quality, achieved the minimum pass rate of 73% correct answers. Most chatbots demonstrated a median Top-1 accuracy of 47% (IQR 44-53%, range from 42% to 73%), while Top-2 accuracy provided a modest improvement, resulting in a median accuracy of 67% (IQR 65-72%, range from 61% to 82%). Even with this advantage, only two chatbots, Jasper quality and ChatGPT plus 4.0, would have passed the exam. Similar results were observed when picture-based questions were excluded from the dataset. Overall, the study suggests that most current language-based chatbots have limitations in accurately solving theoretical medical board exams. In general, currently widely available chatbots fell short of achieving a passing score in a theoretical cardiology board exam. Nevertheless, a few showed promising results.

33992489,The Need for Telemedicine Integration Into Adult Cardiology Training Curricula in Canada.,"COVID-19 brought telemedicine to the forefront of clinical cardiology. We aimed to examine the extent of trainees' involvement in and comfort with telemedicine practices in Canada with the use of a web-based self-administered survey. Eighty-six trainees from 12 training programs completed the survey (65% response rate). Results showed that before COVID-19, 39 trainees (45%) had telemedicine exposure, compared with 67 (78%) after COVID-19 (P < 0.001). However, only 44 trainees (51%) reported being comfortable or very comfortable with the use of telemedicine. Of the 67 trainees who were involved in telemedicine, 4 (6%) had full supervision during virtual visits, 13 (19%) had partial supervision, and 50 (75%) had minimal or no supervision. Importantly, 67 trainees (78%) expressed the need for telemedicine-specific training and 64 (74%) were willing to have their virtual visits recorded for the purpose of evaluation and feedback. Furthermore, 47 (55%) felt strongly or very strongly positive about incorporating telemedicine into their future practice. The main perceived barriers to telemedicine use were concerns about patients' engagement, fear of weakening the patient-physician relationship, and unfamiliarity with telemedicine technology. These barriers, together with training in virtual physical examination skills and medicolegal aspects of telemedicine, are addressed in several established internal medicine telemedicine curricula that could be adapted by cardiology programs. In conclusion, while the degree of telemedicine involvement since COVID-19 was high, the trainees' comfort level with telemedicine practice remains suboptimal likely due to lack of training and inadequate staff supervision. Therefore, a cardiology telemedicine curriculum is needed to ensure that trainees are equipped to embrace telemedicine in cardiovascular clinical care.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2021-Jun,"Almufleh A, Lee C, Tsang MY, Gin K, Tsang TSM, Nair P",6,1873,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
39622018,Instituto y no hospital. La distintiva organización que Ignacio Chávez concibió para combatir integralmente a las enfermedades del corazón en México. En el octogésimo aniversario del Instituto Nacional de Cardiología.,"In 1936, Ignacio Chávez submitted a proposal to the Mexican government for the creation of a cardiology institute. He had studied in Paris, Berlin, and other European cities in 1926. Upon his return to Mexico, he founded the Cardiology Service at the General Hospital in Mexico City, the first of its kind in the country. The National Institute of Cardiology of Mexico was inaugurated on April 18, 1944, becoming one of the first cardiology institutes in the world. Chávez explained the purpose of this new institute: ""We were born with the purpose of studying, researching, and controlling heart diseases."" According to him, the institute should be a place where cardiovascular diseases could be addressed comprehensively, combining clinical practice with research and teaching to provide effective knowledge for patient care and scientific advancement. ""A health center is for the patient, of course; but something more than that is necessary: a great school for doctors, a great laboratory for researchers, and a social instrument of human help,"" he said. This vision was summarized in the words: love and science at the service of the heart. Chávez successfully institutionalized cardiology in Mexico. From its inception, the institute became an internationally recognized center, attracting students from various countries. Alfredo de Micheli noted that under Chávez's influence and example, new institutions emerged in the national medical field and expanded onto the international stage. The institute founded by Chávez became a model for similar institutions on other continents and a driving force in the international cardiology movement. Chávez's legacy was a work of love, intelligence, and culture, dedicated to the heart and the care of humanity.",Archivos de cardiologia de Mexico,2024-Dec,Izaguirre-Ávila R,1,1760,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

A survey was sent via email to all (N = 63) pediatric cardiology training program directors in the United States to evaluate the perceived exercise training needs of pediatric cardiology fellows. The survey consisted of multiple-choice responses as well as a few open-ended responses. A 60% response rate was achieved. 74% of programs did not have a pre-existing exercise core program. This type of training was felt to be important or very important in 84%. A wide variability of time allotted for exercise training exists amongst programs from < 1 week to > 4 weeks, with 2 weeks being most common. There was no consensus on a target number of total exercise tests nor types of tests in which fellows should participate. Preferred methods in training consisted of lectures and online media. Less preferred methods of teaching methods included dedicated reading of a handbook, a dedicated rotation, or live webinars. There was general support to develop exercise training competencies as well as the associated online learning materials with a focus on competency rather than target numbers.

37526495,"Changes of heart: Debating the role of cardiology and cardiac surgery in India, 1948-1968.","In 1950, the leaders of independent India celebrated the contributions that surgeons could make to modernising India. Surgeons, however, faced a difficult choice. Some wanted to invest in generalist surgeons to make basic surgical care available to all Indians. Others wanted to invest in specialists to ensure that India participated in cutting-edge surgical research and care. These debates shaped the emergence of cardiac surgery at two centres: the Christian Medical College in Vellore and the King Edward Memorial Hospital in Bombay. CMC invested in thoracic surgery in the 1940s to offer new treatments for tuberculosis. This gave surgeons the opportunity to explore new techniques of cardiac surgery. Debate quickly emerged about whether investments in cardiology and cardiac surgery made sense. In the end, the specialities were supported in order to attract paying patients. A parallel controversy took place at KEM, where the dean debated the Bombay Municipal Corporation about the role of surgical research at a public hospital. The Rockefeller Foundation influenced both sites, offering financial support if they adopted an American model of full-time faculty clinician-researchers.

Shortages in workforce have led to focus on how to increase clinical capacity. However, a simplistic focus on training clinicians will not fill the gaps in research, policy and implementation, which also need to be addressed at the same time. There are multiple efforts to develop early career capacity across diverse areas at national and international level to address these gaps.

38366821,Device innovation in cardiovascular medicine: a report from the European Society of Cardiology Cardiovascular Round Table.,"Research performed in Europe has driven cardiovascular device innovation. This includes, but is not limited to, percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiac imaging, transcatheter heart valve implantation, and device therapy of cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. An important part of future medical progress involves the evolution of medical technology and the ongoing development of artificial intelligence and machine learning. There is a need to foster an environment conducive to medical technology development and validation so that Europe can continue to play a major role in device innovation while providing high standards of safety. This paper summarizes viewpoints on the topic of device innovation in cardiovascular medicine at the European Society of Cardiology Cardiovascular Round Table, a strategic forum for high-level dialogue to discuss issues related to the future of cardiovascular health in Europe. Devices are developed and improved through an iterative process throughout their lifecycle. Early feasibility studies demonstrate proof of concept and help to optimize the design of a device. If successful, this should ideally be followed by randomized clinical trials comparing novel devices vs. accepted standards of care when available and the collection of post-market real-world evidence through registries. Unfortunately, standardized procedures for feasibility studies across various device categories have not yet been implemented in Europe. Cardiovascular imaging can be used to diagnose and characterize patients for interventions to improve procedural results and to monitor devices long term after implantation. Randomized clinical trials often use cardiac imaging-based inclusion criteria, while less frequently trials randomize patients to compare the diagnostic or prognostic value of different modalities. Applications using machine learning are increasingly important, but specific regulatory standards and pathways remain in development in both Europe and the USA. Standards are also needed for smart devices and digital technologies that support device-driven biomonitoring. Changes in device regulation introduced by the European Union aim to improve clinical evidence, transparency, and safety, but they may impact the speed of innovation, access, and availability. Device development programmes including dialogue on unmet needs and advice on study designs must be driven by a community of physicians, trialists, patients, regulators, payers, and industry to ensure that patients have access to innovative care.",European heart journal,2024-Apr,"Windecker S, Gilard M, Achenbach S, Cribier A, Delgado V, Deych N, Drossart I, Eltchaninoff H, Fraser AG, Goncalves A, Hindricks G, Holborow R, Kappetein AP, Kilmartin J, Kurucova J, Lüscher TF, Mehran R, O'Connor DB, Perkins M, Samset E, von Bardeleben RS, Weidinger F",22,2556,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

34217807,Canadian Cardiovascular Society: Clinical Practice Update on Cardiovascular Management of the Pregnant Patient.,"The number of women of childbearing age with cardiovascular disease (CVD) is growing because of increased survival of children with congenital heart disease. More women are also becoming pregnant at an older age, which is associated with increased rates of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and acquired CVD. Over the past decade the field of cardio-obstetrics has significantly advanced with the development of multidisciplinary cardio-obstetric programs (COPs) to address the increasing burden of CVD in pregnancy. With the introduction of formal COPs, pregnancy outcomes in women with heart disease have improved. COPs provide preconception counselling, antenatal and postpartum cardiac surveillance, and labor and delivery planning. Prepregnancy counselling in a COP should be offered to women with suspected CVD who are of childbearing age. In women who present while pregnant, counselling should be performed in a COP as early as possible in pregnancy. The purpose of counselling is to reduce the risk of pregnancy to the mother and fetus whenever possible. This is done through accurate maternal and fetal risk stratification, optimizing cardiac lesions, reviewing safety of medications in pregnancy, and making a detailed plan for the pregnancy, labor, and delivery. This Clinical Practice Update highlights the COP approach to prepregnancy counselling, risk stratification, and management of commonly encountered cardiac conditions through pregnancy. We highlight ""red flags"" that should trigger a more timely assessment in a COP.

31787326,Reprint of : Transcatheter closure of patent foramen ovale to prevent stroke recurrence in patients with otherwise unexplained ischaemic stroke: Expert consensus of the French Neurovascular Society and the French Society of Cardiology.,"Unlike previous randomized clinical trials (RCTs), recent trials and meta-analyses have shown that transcatheter closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) reduces stroke recurrence risk in young and middle-aged adults with an otherwise unexplained PFO-associated ischaemic stroke. To produce an expert consensus on the role of transcatheter PFO closure and antithrombotic drugs for secondary stroke prevention in patients with PFO-associated ischaemic stroke. Five neurologists and five cardiologists with extensive experience in the relevant field were nominated by the French Neurovascular Society and the French Society of Cardiology to make recommendations based on evidence from RCTs and meta-analyses. The experts recommend that any decision concerning treatment of patients with PFO-associated ischaemic stroke should be taken after neurological and cardiological evaluation, bringing together the necessary neurovascular, echocardiography and interventional cardiology expertise. Transcatheter PFO closure is recommended in patients fulfilling all the following criteria: age 16-60 years; recent (≤6 months) ischaemic stroke; PFO associated with atrial septal aneurysm (>10mm) or with a right-to-left shunt>20 microbubbles or with a diameter≥2mm; PFO felt to be the most likely cause of stroke after thorough aetiological evaluation by a stroke specialist. Long-term oral anticoagulation may be considered in the event of contraindication to or patient refusal of PFO closure, in the absence of a high bleeding risk. After PFO closure, dual anti-platelet therapy with aspirin (75mg/day) and clopidogrel (75mg/day) is recommended for 3 months, followed by monotherapy with aspirin or clopidogrel for≥5 years. Although a big step forward that will benefit many patients has been taken with recent trials, many questions remain unanswered. Pending results from further studies, decision-making regarding management of patients with PFO-associated ischaemic stroke should be based on a close coordination between neurologists/stroke specialists and cardiologists.",Revue neurologique,2020-,"Mas JL, Derex L, Guérin P, Guillon B, Habib G, Juliard JM, Marijon E, Massardier E, Meneveau N, Vuillier F",10,2063,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

To investigate the prescription patterns and appropriateness of aspirin in a real-world clinical setting. Cross-sectional study. The Appropriateness of Aspirin Use in Medical Outpatients: A Multicenter, Observational Study (ASSOS) is a cross-sectional and multicenter study that included 5007 consecutive patients aged 18 or over who presented to 30 different cardiology outpatient clinics from 14 cities throughout Turkey. Only patients using aspirin (80-325 mg) were included. The study population was divided into 2 groups regarding the use of aspirin: primary prevention (PP) group and secondary prevention (SP) group. The indication of aspirin use was evaluated following the 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the 2016 United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPTF) guidelines in the PP group. A total of 5007 patients (mean age 62.15 ± 11.05, 39% female) were enrolled. The PP group included 1132 (22.6%) patients, and the SP group included 3875 (77.4%) patients.

39592164,Heart valve clinics: an expanding role for the clinical scientists - validation of a framework for competency and certification.,"Valvular heart disease (VHD) represents a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide, necessitating specialised care through multidisciplinary valve clinics. However, there is a lack of a standardised training and certification framework for clinical scientists and specialist physiologists (CSSPs) working within specialist valve clinics (SVCs). This study aimed to design, implement and validate a competency framework dedicated to training and certifying valve CSSPs to enhance patient outcomes and establish standardised care. A comprehensive competency framework was developed and implemented, consisting of two levels: Enhanced Valve Clinic Training (EVCT) and Advanced Valve Clinic Training (AVCT). The programme was trialled at Guy's Valve Clinic, London, over a 12-month period. Validation was undertaken through trainee and patient feedback, including multiple-choice questions, clinical skills assessments, and patient satisfaction surveys. Nine CSSPs completed the EVCT and four the AVCT. All participants passed their certification examinations with scores ranging from 80% to 95%. The time to complete each programme averaged 6 months. After certification, clinical queries raised by EVCT trainees averaged 1.2 per session but dropped by 75% to 0.3 per session in the AVCT group, indicating greater confidence and independence in managing cases. Physician review of trainee-led cases led to additional tests or treatment changes in 23% of cases and referrals to physician clinics in 11%. Patient feedback was positive: 95% felt confident in the clinical scientists' knowledge, and 100% were satisfied with the clarity of their care plans and follow-up. The implementation of this training and certification framework demonstrated enhanced clinical outcomes and care delivery in SVCs. By advocating for formal recognition and accreditation of valve clinic training, this framework could serve as a model for national and international standardisation in valve care and clinical training.",Open heart,2024-Nov,"Zhou C, Fekadu J, Hayes A, Aure N, Sivalinganathan M, Bowen L, Campbell B, Subbiah S, Page C, Bennett S, Rajani R, Demetrescu C",12,2008,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

We used 168 questions: 141 text-only and 27 image-based, categorized into four sections mirroring the CBNC exam. Each LLM was presented with the same standardized prompt and applied to each section 30 times to account for stochasticity. Performance over six weeks was assessed for all models except GPT-4o. McNemar's test compared correct response proportions. GPT-4, Gemini, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o correctly answered median percentages of 56.8% (95% confidence interval 55.4% - 58.0%), 40.5% (39.9% - 42.9%), 60.7% (59.5% - 61.3%), and 63.1% (62.5%-64.3%) of questions, respectively.

31302789,Feasibility evaluation of non-invasive cardiac function technology during echocardiography-based cardiac stress testing.,"Evaluation of cardiac function during periods of stress is of key importance for the perioperative setting. Non-invasive hemodynamic monitors provide markers of cardiac function. This pilot study sought to evaluate the ability of a non-invasive hemodynamic monitor to detect cardiac stress during formal stress echocardiography testing. The primary goal was to compare the change in hemodynamic values during the pre/during/post phases of stress echocardiography testing in patients who had results negative versus positive for myocardial ischemia. Adult patients scheduled for outpatient cardiac stress testing were screened. Only patients scheduled for stress-echocardiography testing were consented. Patients with history of arrhythmias were excluded. During the testing, patients wore a cuff-based hemodynamic sensor (Nexfin system, Edwards Lifesciences). Data from the hemodynamic sensor were compared to the findings of the stress study. A total of 37 patients were enrolled, with 31 patients included for analysis. Five patients had stress studies positive for coronary ischemia. Comparison of the hemodynamic variables between patients who had a positive stress study versus negative showed a significant reduction in the percentage change in dP/dt and stroke volume from baseline (p < 0.05).

32332807,Three-Dimensional Rotational Angiography during Catheterization of Congenital Heart Disease - A ten Years' experience at a single center.,"This paper aims to assess the usability and advantages of three-dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA) in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) and its application in the cath lab. Up to now, its use in CHD is not widespread or standardized. We analyzed all patients with CHD who underwent a 3DRA at our facility between January 2010 and May 2019. The 3DRAs were evaluated for radiation exposure, contrast dye consumption, diagnostic utility and image quality. We performed 872 3DRAs. 3DRA was used in 67.1% of the cases for interventional procedures and in 32.9% for diagnostic purposes. Two different acquisition programs were applied. The median dose-area product (DAP) for all 872 rotations was 54.1 µGym<sup>2</sup> (21.7-147.5 µGym<sup>2</sup>) and 1.6 ml/kg (0.9-2.07 ml/kg) of contrast dye was used. Diagnostic utility of the generated 3D-model was rated superior to the native 3D angiography in 94% (819/872). 3DRA is an excellent and save diagnostic and interventional tool. However, 3DRA has not become a standard imaging procedure in pediatric cardiology up to now.

Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of a 3-year quality improvement and patient safety (QI/PS) curriculum that gives fellows both didactic knowledge and first-hand experience with improvement science, and meets Clinical Learning Environment Review (CLER) requirements. Knowledge assessment is obtained through pre- and post-surveys. A secondary measure of success is academic products resulting from fellows' QI/PS work, and future participation in QI/PS efforts. Since 2019, 51 pre-tests and 36 post-tests were completed, showing improvement across all competencies. Fellows have produced one published manuscript, two poster presentations, and two oral presentations describing their improvement work. Additionally, mentoring faculty members have gone on to lead other QI work throughout the division. This longitudinal QI/PS curriculum provides both knowledge and experience in QI/PS work. It also creates opportunities for academic publications and presentations, builds faculty expertise, and most importantly, works to improve multiple aspects of patient care.

39510937,Reprint of: Scientific statement from the French neurovascular and cardiac societies for improved detection of atrial fibrillation after ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the primary cause of ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA). AF is associated with a high risk of recurrence, which can be reduced using optimal prevention strategies, mainly anticoagulant therapy. The availability of effective prophylaxis justifies the need for a significant, coordinated and thorough transdisciplinary effort to screen for AF associated with stroke. A recent French national survey, initiated and supported by the Société française neurovasculaire (SFNV) and the Société française de cardiologie (SFC), revealed many shortcomings, such as the absence or inadequacy of telemetry equipment in more than half of stroke units, insufficient and highly variable access to monitoring tools, delays in performing screening tests, heterogeneous access to advanced or connected ambulatory monitoring techniques, and a lack of dedicated human resources. The present scientific document has been prepared on the initiative of the SFNV and the SFC with the aim of helping to address the current shortcomings and gaps, to promote efficient and cost-effective AF detection, and to improve and, where possible, homogenize the quality of practice in AF screening among stroke units and outpatient post-stroke care networks. The working group, composed of cardiologists and vascular neurologists who are experts in the field and are nominated by their peers, reviewed the literature to propose statements, which were discussed in successive cycles, and maintained, either by consensus or by vote, as appropriate. The text was then submitted to the SFNV and SFC board members for review. This scientific statement document argues for the widespread development of patient pathways to enable the most efficient AF screening after stroke. This assessment should be carried out by a multidisciplinary team, including expert cardiologists and vascular neurologists.",Revue neurologique,2024-Dec,"Gaillard N, Deharo JC, Suissa L, Defaye P, Sibon I, Leclercq C, Alamowitch S, Guidoux C, Cohen A",9,1904,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

A position statement of the Polish Cardiac Society endorsed by Polish Society of Human Genetics and Cardiovascular Patient Communities.,"According to the latest guidelines of European and American medical societies, genetic testing (GT) is essential in cardiovascular diseases for establishing diagnosis, predicting prognosis, enabling initiation of disease-modifying therapy, and preventing sudden cardiac death. The GT result may be relevant for cascade GT in the patient's relatives, for planning his/her profession and physical activity, and for procreative counseling. This position statement has been prepared due to the scarcity of GT in cardiovascular diseases in Poland and the need to expand its availability. We give a concise description of the genetic background of cardiomyopathies, channelopathies, aortopathies, familial hypercholesterolemia, pheochromocytomas, and paragangliomas. The article discusses various aspects of GT in specific populations, such as children or athletes, and also presents prenatal genetic diagnostics. We propose recommendations for GT and counselling, which take into account Polish needs and capabilities. We give an outline of legal regulations, good clinical practice in GT with respect for patient rights, the role of cardiologists and clinical geneticists in GT planning and post-test counseling, and the requirements for laboratories performing genetic tests.

38727825,Assessing the State of Training in Congenital Interventional Cardiology: A Global Survey of Program Directors.,"This study aimed to evaluate the current state of congenital interventional cardiology training worldwide, with a focus on case volumes, competency assessment, and the need for ongoing mentorship during early career stages. A survey was conducted among program directors (PDs) of congenital interventional training programs across the globe. The survey gathered data on training pathways, case volumes, types of procedures performed, trainee competency assessment, and the role of ongoing mentorship. Of the 79 PDs who completed the survey, it was observed that training pathways and case volumes varied significantly, particularly between the United States and other countries. Most PDs reported an annual laboratory case volume of >500 congenital cardiac cases, with most cases being interventional. While trainees demonstrated competency in simple procedures (diagnostic cases, simple ASD closure), complex interventions (such as patent ductus arteriosus closure in premature infants) require ongoing mentorship for graduates. PDs recommended a minimum case volume of 400 total cases for trainees, including 250 interventional cases. In addition to case volumes, assessing trainee competency was deemed important, with clinical reasoning, judgment, skillset, teamwork, and complication management being key areas of evaluation. The study highlights the variability in congenital interventional cardiology training and the need for ongoing mentorship during the early career years. External mentorship programs, facilitated by national and international societies, are proposed to provide critical support for early career interventionalists thus enhancing patient care for congenital heart disease. Ultimately, the findings of this survey may serve as a framework for future training standards and guidelines in this specialized field.",Pediatric cardiology,2025-Apr,"Aggarwal V, Butera G, Boe B, Celebi A, Downing T, Rossi RF, Kenny D, Linsky N, Pan X, Sivakumar K, Whiteside W, Hijazi ZM, Armstrong AK",13,1838,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Differing opinions exist regarding the utility of comprehensive final examinations in veterinary courses. A mixed-methods prospective randomized trial was undertaken with veterinary students (<i>n</i> = 47) in an elective cardiology course. All students received identical content, which was presented through weekly in-class lectures (eight total lessons). They were given access to four different formats of study aids and completed quizzes of content knowledge within 1 week of each lesson. For the cumulative final examination (post-test), students were explicitly instructed to study only for four out of the eight lessons. Students then completed a delayed post-test 3-6 months after completion of the course. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected in the form of in-depth pre- and post-course surveys. Overall, studying a particular lesson for the post-test resulted in higher scores for six out of eight lessons in the post-test (<i>p <</i> .05) but did not result in significantly higher scores for any lesson in the delayed post-test. Time spent studying for individual quizzes, as well as other measures of study habits, decreased significantly throughout the semester. Among study aids, student preference was highest for instructor-provided graphic organizers, and this preference persisted across the semester with a shift away from instructor-provided outlines over time (<i>p</i> = .043). Free-text survey responses showed that students had realistic expectations for the impact of studying for the post-test and appreciated exposure to a variety of study aid formats.

Multicenter survey and results of a comparative study evaluating a new educational approach.,"Learning to interpret electrocardiograms (ECGs) is a crucial objective in medical education. Despite its importance, errors in ECGs interpretation are common, and the optimal teaching methods have not yet been clearly established. To evaluate students' confidence in ECGs analysis and their opinion on current teaching methods, and to assess the effectiveness of a new ECG educational approach. First, we conducted a survey on ECG learning among fourth to sixth-year medical students. Second, a 5-week multicenter comparative study was conducted with fourth-year medical students during their cardiology internship. Two different teaching methods were used, assigned by center. The first group participated in 5-minutes workshops 4 times a week using a ""reversed classroom"" method, supervised by a cardiologist, where students took turns selecting, presenting and discussing ECGs. The control group attended a single 2-hour face-to-face ECG course. All participants completed a 30-minute ECGs analysis test at baseline and after 5 weeks. Out of 401 survey respondents, the confidence levels in ECG interpretation were 3/5 (IQR 2-3) for routine situations and 2/5 (IQR 1-3) for emergency situations. Satisfaction with ECG teaching was low (2/5, IQR 1-3) and 96.3% of respondents favored more extensive ECG training. In the comparative study, 52 students from 3 medical schools were enrolled (control group: n = 27; workshop group: n = 25). Both groups showed significant improvement in exam scores from baseline to 5-week (33/100 ± 12/100 to 44/100 ± 12/100, p < 0.0001 for the control group and 36/100 ± 13/100 to 62/100 ± 12/100, p < 0.0001 for the workshop group). The improvement was significantly greater in the workshop group compared to the control group (+ 26 ± 11 vs. + 11 ± 6, p < 0.001).

What a review of Nobel Prize nominations reveals about scientific trends.,"Since 1901, at least 15 scholars who contributed to cardiovascular research have received a Nobel prize in physiology or medicine. Using the Nobel nomination database (nobelprize.org), which contains 5950 nominations in the accessible period from 1901 to 1953 in physiology or medicine, we listed all international nominees who contributed to cardiovascular research. We subsequently collected nomination letters and jury reports of the prime candidates from the archive of the Nobel Committee in Sweden to identify shortlisted candidates. The five most frequently nominated researchers with cardiovascular connections from 1901 to 1953 were, in descending order, the surgeon René Leriche (1879-1955) (FR) with a total of 79 nominations, the physiologist and 1924 Nobel laureate Willem Einthoven (1860-1927) (NL) (31 nominations), the surgeon Alfred Blalock (1899-1964) (US) (29 nominations), the pharmacologist and 1936 Nobel laureate Otto Loewi (1873-1961) (DE, AT, US) (27 nominations) and the paediatric cardiologist Helen Taussig (1898-1986) (US) (24 nominations). The research of these scholars merely hints at the width of topics brought up by nominators ranging from the physiological and pathological basics to the diagnosis and (surgical) interventions of diseases such as heart malformation or hypertension.

We hypothesized that implementing an explicit 7-week CR curriculum taught in a large-enrollment elective veterinary cardiology course would improve students' awareness of clinical reasoning principles, self-efficacy of CR skills, and application of CR principles in clinical case analyses. A secondary aim was to assess the impact of peer review as a means of providing feedback in a large classroom setting. A mixed method approach was used with veterinary students (<i>N</i> = 78) in a cardiology elective course meeting twice weekly for a half-semester (7 weeks). Course content included a 1-week introduction to CR led by the instructor and 6 weeks of instructor-facilitated, case-based learning. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected, including pre- and post-course surveys, weekly peer reviews for six clinical case assignments, and instructor-graded clinical cases for three case assignments. Students reported improved self-efficacy across all CR skill categories (<i>p</i> < .001) and significant improvement in applied CR skills was demonstrated in both peer- (<i>p</i> < .001) and instructor-graded assignments (<i>p</i> < .001). Peer reviews provided a means for students to reflect on and internalize CR skills, which may play a role in improved self-efficacy. In an elective cardiology course, implementing an explicit CR curriculum resulted in improved student awareness and self-efficacy of CR, as well as improved applied CR skills.",Journal of veterinary medical education,2025-Aug,"Klehm CD, Karabulut-Ilgu A, Tropf MA",3,1555,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
34155081,Implementation of a virtual international cardiology curriculum to address the deficit of cardiovascular education in Haiti: a pilot study.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, conferring a disparate burden on low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Haiti represents a resource-constrained setting, limited by a paucity of resources and trained cardiovascular professionals equipped to address the increasing burden of CVD. Here, we describe the creation of a comprehensive cardiology curriculum delivered through a virtual classroom. The curriculum was created to augment cardiovascular education in LMICs such as Haiti. Over one academic year (May 2019-2020), International Cardiology Curriculum Accessible by Remote Distance Learning-Haiti consisted of biweekly, live-streamed, synchronous didactic lectures, seminars and case presentations broadcasted to 16 internal medicine (IM) residents at Hôpital Universitaire de Mirebalais, one of only four IM training programmes in Haiti. The virtual classroom was created using commercially available videoconferencing and data-sharing platforms. Prelecture and postlecture surveys and an end of the year survey were administered to assess the impact of the curriculum. Participant performance analysis revealed that 80% of the curriculum demonstrated a positive trend in knowledge acquisition postintervention. Based on the end of the year evaluation, 94% of participants reported that the curriculum was educational and relevant to medical practice in Haiti and 100% reported that the curriculum was good to excellent. Additionally, the curriculum was cited as an effective means of maintaining trainee education during the COVID-19 pandemic. This international medical education pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of augmenting cardiology education in LMICs by creating a virtual curriculum made possible by local partnerships, internet access and technology.",BMJ open,2021-Jun,"Haynes NA, Saint-Joy V, Swain J, Ezekwesili A, Vernet FV, Dawson C, Laneau D, Tierney A, Shea JA, Ambrose MS",10,1837,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
32926088,Identifying Recommendations for Stopping or Scaling Back Unnecessary Routine Services in Primary Care.,"Much of health care involves established, routine use of medical services for chronic conditions or prevention. Stopping these services when the evidence changes or if the benefits no longer outweigh the risks is essential. Yet, most guidelines focus on escalating care and provide few explicit recommendations to stop or scale back (ie, deintensify) treatment and testing. To develop a systematic, transparent, and reproducible approach for identifying, specifying, and validating deintensification recommendations associated with routine adult primary care. A focused review of existing guidelines and recommendations was completed to identify and prioritize potential deintensification indications. Then, 2 modified virtual Delphi expert panels examined the synthesized evidence, suggested ways that the candidate recommendations could be improved, and assessed the validity of the recommendations using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Twenty-five physicians from Veterans Affairs and US academic institutions with knowledge in relevant clinical areas (eg, geriatrics, primary care, women's health, cardiology, and endocrinology) served as panel members. Validity of the recommendations, defined as high-quality evidence that deintensification is likely to improve patient outcomes, evidence that intense testing and/or treatment could cause harm in some patients, absence of evidence on the benefit of continued or repeated intense treatment or testing, and evidence that deintensification is consistent with high-quality care. A total of 409 individual recommendations were identified representing 178 unique opportunities to stop or scale back routine services (eg, stopping population-based screening for vitamin D deficiency and decreasing concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines). Thirty-seven recommendations were prioritized and forwarded to the expert panels. Panelists reviewed the evidence and suggested modifications, resulting in 44 recommendations being rated. Overall, 37 recommendations (84%) were considered to be valid, as assessed by the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. In this study, a total of 178 unique opportunities to deintensify routine primary care services were identified, and 37 of these were validated as high-priority deintensification recommendations. To date, this is the first study to develop a model for identifying, specifying, and validating deintensification recommendations that can be implemented and tracked in clinical practice.",JAMA internal medicine,2020-Nov,"Kerr EA, Klamerus ML, Markovitz AA, Sussman JB, Bernstein SJ, Caverly TJ, Chou R, Min L, Saini SD, Lohman SE, Skurla SE, Goodrich DE, Froehlich W, Hofer TP",14,2489,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
39377635,Position statement of Polish Cardiac Society experts on cardiomyopathy.,"Cardiomyopathies (CMs) are a very broad group of diseases, including genetically determined and acquired, and their classification is based on phenotypic characteristics. There is always a need to search for the etiology (often also to try to identify the genetic cause), which may determine the appropriate choice of clinical management. The geographical distribution of genetic variants varies as does the prevalence across populations, ethnic groups, regions, and countries. The most reliable data on the distribution of individual genetic variants come from developed countries. The phenotypic classification includes 5 main types of CM, i.e., dilated CM, hypertrophic, restrictive, arrhythmogenic right ventricular CM, and non-dilated left ventricular (LV) CM. Individual CMs are characterized by a variety of causes and different phenotypic pictures, which affect their presentation, diagnosis, and response to treatment. Within each type of CM, there are both familial and sporadic (acquired) forms. The complex presentation of CM, as well as the limited availability of screening and diagnostic tests, causes CMs to be diagnosed late, often at an advanced stage of the disease. Therapeutic management of CM is strictly determined by its type and clinical picture. Diagnostics include the assessment of symptoms, the results of imaging and genetic tests, as well as morphological, functional, and often histological assessment. This allows for personalized and dedicated clinical management. To optimize thediagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with CMs, an individualized, expert, systemic, coordinated, and often multidisciplinary structure of care is necessary. Hence, it is important to create multidisciplinary teams for CM management. We present examples of existing systemic solutions for the care of CM patients in Europe (France and Spain). Not all of these options are available to patients in our country. This article presents issues related to CM and may be the basis for developing a diagnostic and therapeutic model allowing for earlier detection of CM in Polish patients and their effective treatment.",Kardiologia polska,2024-,"Mizia-Stec K, Burchardt P, Mazurkiewicz Ł, Tajstra M, Wybraniec M, Mitkowski P, Bartuś S, Biernacka EK, Gierlotka M, Sterliński M, Wojakowski W, Witkowski A, Gil RJ, Farkowski M, Szymański P, Tycińska A, Kowalski O, Grzybowski J, Leszek P",19,2129,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Survey results identified key competencies deemed to be inadequately addressed during training and those in which a moderate or significant additional amount of training was desired. These competencies were identified within the 4 main domains of the fellowship: heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, mechanical circulatory support, and heart transplantation. This study highlights key medical-knowledge competencies that are inadequately addressed by current fellowship training in advanced heart failure and transplant cardiology.

38818617,The autonomic nervous system and the origins of neurocardiology.,"Following new concepts by Bichat in the early 19th century, of organic and animal life centered around the ganglionic nervous system, over 100 years of anatomic studies and physiologic experimentation eventually resulted in Gaskell's 1916 book entitled ""The Involuntary Nervous System"" and Langley's 1921 book entitled ""The Autonomic Nervous System."" Neurology and cardiology emerged as specialties of medicine in the early 20th century. Although neurology made several prominent discoveries in neurophysiology during the first half of the 20th century, cardiology developed coronary care units and cardiac catheterization in the 1960s. Programmed electrical stimulation of the heart and noninvasive ambulatory monitoring provided new methodologies to study clinical cardiac arrhythmias. Experimentally, direct cardiac nerve stimulation of sympathetic nerve endings, as well as parasympathetic control of the atrioventricular node, provided the background to new detailed autonomic studies of the heart. Neurocardiology, perhaps initially more directed towards our understanding of sudden cardiac death, ultimately embraced an even significantly more complex scheme of local circuit neurons and near-endless loops of interconnecting neurons in the heart. Intrathoracic extracardiac and intracardiac ganglia have been recharacterized, both anatomically and physiologically, laying the groundwork for potential new therapies of cardiac neuromodulation.",Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology,2024-Aug,Lemery R,1,1450,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

34813876,The Role of Machine Learning in Cardiovascular Pathology.,"Machine learning has seen slow but steady uptake in diagnostic pathology over the past decade to assess digital whole-slide images. Machine learning tools have incredible potential to standardise, and likely even improve, histopathologic diagnoses, but they are not yet widely used in clinical practice. We describe the principles of these tools and technologies and some successful preclinical and pretranslational efforts in cardiovascular pathology, as well as a roadmap for moving forward. In nonhuman animal models, one proof-of-principle application is in rodent progressive cardiomyopathy, which is of particular significance to drug toxicity studies. Basic science successes include screening the quality of differentiated stem cells and characterising cardiomyocyte developmental stages, with potential applications for research and toxicology/drug safety screening using derived or native human pluripotent stem cells differentiated into cardiomyocytes. Translational studies of particular note include those with success in diagnosing the various forms of heart allograft rejection. For fully realising the value of these tools in clinical cardiovascular pathology, we identify 3 essential challenges. First is image quality standardisation to ensure that algorithms can be developed and implemented on robust, consistent data. The second is consensus diagnosis; experts don't always agree, and thus ""truth"" may be difficult to establish, but the algorithms themselves may provide a solution. The third is the need for large-enough data sets to facilitate robust algorithm development, necessitating large cross-institutional shared image databases. The power of histopathology-based machine learning technologies is tremendous, and we outline the next steps needed to capitalise on this power.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2022-Feb,"Glass C, Lafata KJ, Jeck W, Horstmeyer R, Cooke C, Everitt J, Glass M, Dov D, Seidman MA",9,1805,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

While awareness of cardiotoxicity due to cancer disease and/or therapies has greatly increased, much of the attention has focused on myocardial systolic disfunction and heart failure. However, coronary and structural heart disease are also a common issue in cancer patients and encompass the full spectrum of cardiotoxicity. While invasive percutaneous or surgical intervention, either is often needed or considered in cancer patients, limited evidence or guidelines are available for dealing with coronary or structural heart disease. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions consensus document published in 2016 is the most comprehensive document regarding this particular issue, but relevant evidence has emerged since, which render some of its considerations outdated. In addition to that, the recent 2022 ESC Guidelines on Cardio-Oncology only briefly discuss this topic. As a result, the Portuguese Association of Cardiovascular Intervention and the Cardio-Oncology Study Group of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology have partnered to produce a position paper to address the issue of cardiac intervention in cancer patients, focusing on percutaneous techniques.

Propelled by recent advances in technology-catalyzed by COVID-19-and the requirement to adapt age-old methods of both teaching and health care delivery, many aspects, or 'domains', of learning have changed. These include the environments in which FITs work (outpatient clinics, 'on-call' inpatient service) and procedures in which they need clinical competency. Further advances in virtual reality are also changing the way FITs learn and interact. The proliferation of technology into the cardiology curriculum has led to some describing the need for FITs to develop into 'digital cardiologists', namely those who comfortably use digital tools to aid clinical practice, teaching, and training whilst, at the same time, retain the ability for human analysis and nuanced assessment so important to patient-centred training and clinical care.",Current problems in cardiology,2022-Dec,"Vandermolen S, Ricci F, Chahal CAA, Capelli C, Barakat K, Fedorowski A, Westwood M, Patel RS, Petersen SE, Gallina S, Pugliese F, Khanji MY",12,986,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
31880471,Modeling Clinical Processes to Consent Research Donors of Remnant Biospecimens in an Outpatient Cardiology Clinic.,"<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Informed consent for research biospecimen donations is traditionally obtained through a face-to-face interaction with research staff and by signing an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved printed form. Electronic signatures (eSign) are routinely used in the electronic medical record (EMR) for the consenting of clinical services after patients review printed documentation. Our goal was to develop an electronic self-consenting workflow that mimicked clinical services. Specifically, we tested a research consent process for the biobanking of remnant clinical samples that relies solely on clinical resources in a busy outpatient practice. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> The Biorepositories Core Resource (BCR) unit initiated a new enterprise-wide biobanking infrastructure for consenting patients, termed Biospecimen Use for Research-Related Investigations and Translational Objectives (BURRITO). BURRITO is modeled after an established clinical process called Terms and Conditions of Service (TACOS). The TACOS requires patients to annually review printed documentation and self-consent electronically for clinical services. BURRITO also requires patients to review printed documentation and self-consent with eSign to opt-in for remnant biospecimen banking, but patients must complete this process only once. We captured eSign for consents directly into the EMR without research staff. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Patients reviewed the IRB-approved documents and self-consented during their cardiology clinic visit. At checkout, their participation preferences were electronically documented by clinic staff. During a 6-month period, 123 patients agreed to donate. After a review of process, a second 3-month period identified 202 patients agreeing to donate. BURRITO did not require face-to-face interactions with research staff, used a ""no-paper"" eSign for consent, and created discrete fields in the clinical EMR of the patient's preference. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> BURRITO electronically documents informed consent using an EMR functionality and the least amount of clinical and research resources. Our results show promise for developing institutionally adopted processes, which could leverage existing clinical workflows for universal research consenting and scalability.",Biopreservation and biobanking,2020-Apr,"Soares SE, Anderson NR, Solis LJ, López JE",4,2318,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

We translated these codes into discrete medical content areas using a newly developed ""crosswalk tool."" Residents' clinical exposure was enriched in infectious diseases (ID) and cardiovascular disease content at baseline. During the pandemic's surge, ID became the dominant content area. Exposure to other content was dramatically reduced, with clinical diversity repopulating only toward the end of the study period.

ChatGPT, a natural language processing technology developed by OpenAI, is widely used in various industries, including healthcare. The application of ChatGPT in healthcare is still evolving, with studies exploring its potential in clinical decision-making, patient education, workflow optimization, and scientific literature. ChatGPT could be exploited in the medical field to improve patient education and information, thus increasing compliance. ChatGPT could facilitate information exchange on major cardiovascular diseases, provide clinical decision support, and improve patient communication and education. It could assist the clinician in differential diagnosis, suggest appropriate imaging modalities, and optimize treatment plans based on evidence-based guidelines. However, it is unclear whether it will be possible to use ChatGPT for the management of patients who require rapid decisions. Indeed, many drawbacks are associated with the daily use of these technologies in the medical field, such as insufficient expertise in specialized fields and a lack of comprehension of the context in which it works.

38925728,"Lessons for Cardiovascular Clinical Investigators: The Tumultuous 2,500-Year Journey of Physicians Who Ignited Our Fire.","Whereas medical practice stems from Hippocrates, cardiovascular science originates with Aristotle. The Hippocratic philosophy was championed by Galen (129-216 CE), whose advocacy of a tripartite soul found favor in the early Christian Church. In contrast, Aristotle's works were banned as heresy by ecclesiastical authority, only to survive and prosper in the Islamic Golden Age (775-1258 CE). Galen theorized that the circulation consisted of separate venous and arterial systems. Blood was produced in the liver and traveled centrifugally through veins. When arriving in the right ventricle, venous blood passed through tiny pores in the ventricular septum into the left ventricle, where it became aerated by air passing from the lungs through the pulmonary veins to the left side of the heart. Following arrival at distal sites, arterial blood disappeared, being consumed by the tissues, requiring that the liver needed to continually synthesize new blood. The heart was viewed as a sucking organ, and the peripheral pulse was deemed to result from changes in arterial tone, rather than cardiac systole. Galen's framework remained undisputed and dominated medical thought for 1,300 years, but the reintroduction of Aristotelian principles from the Islamic world into Europe (through the efforts of the Toledo School of Translators) were nurtured by the academic freedom and iconoclastic environment uniquely cultivated at the University of Padua, made possible by Venetian rebellion against papal authority. At Padua, the work of Andreas Vesalius, Realdo Colombo, Hieronymus Fabricius ab Acquapendente, and William Harvey (1543-1628) methodically destroyed Galen's model, leading to the modern concept of a closed-ended circulation. Yet, due to political forces, Harvey was ridiculed, as was James Lind, who performed the first prospective controlled trial, involving citrus fruits for scurvy (1747); it took nearly 50 years for his work to be accepted. Even the work of William Withering (1785), the father of cardiovascular pharmacology, was tarnished by professional jealously and the marketing campaign of a pharmaceutical company. Today's cardiovascular investigators should understand that major advances are routinely derided by the medical establishment for political or personal reasons; and it may take decades or centuries for important work to be accepted.",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2024-Jul,Packer M,1,2371,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

The tests were performed in several specific geometries and in addition to eye lens dosemeters the value of a personal dosemeter located at the reference point was also monitored. The value of Hp(3) and Hp(10) was monitored. It is clear from the results that film dosemeters achieve more correct results in most cases.

The referral decision defined by physician reading biosignal-based ECG or CHART report were compared for 550 patients, where its performance is calculated against the ground truth referral decision. The ground truth was established by cardiologist consensus based on all the available measurements and findings including echocardiography (ECHO). The results confirmed that CHART analysis was far more effective than ECG only analysis: CHART reduced false negative rates 15.8% and false positive (FP) rates by 5%, when compared with SOTA ECG devices. General physicians (GP's) using CHART saw their positive diagnosis rate significantly increased, from ~10% to ~26% (260% increase), and the uncertainty rate significantly decreased, from ~31% to ~1.9% (94% decrease). For cardiology, the study showed that in 98% of the cases, the CHART report was found to be a good indicator as to what kind of heart problems can be expected (the 'start-point') in the ECHO examination. The study revealed that GP use of CHART resulted in more accurate referrals for cardiology, resulting in fewer true negative or FP-healthy or mildly abnormal patients not in need of ECHO confirmation. The indirect benefit is the reduction in wait-times and in unnecessary and costly testing in secondary care.

38995217,European Society of Cardiology quality indicators update for the care and outcomes of adults with heart failure. The Heart Failure Association of the ESC.,"To update the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) quality indicators (QIs) for the evaluation of the care and outcomes of adults with heart failure. The Working Group comprised experts in heart failure including members of the ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines Task Force for heart failure, members of the Heart Failure Association, and a patient representative. We followed the ESC methodology for QI development. The 2023 focused guideline update was reviewed to assess the suitability of the recommendations with strongest association with benefit and harm against the ESC criteria for QIs. All the new proposed QIs were individually graded by each panellist via online questionnaires for both validity and feasibility. The existing heart failure QIs also underwent voting to 'keep', 'remove' or 'modify'. Five domains of care for the management of heart failure were identified: (1) structural QIs, (2) patient assessment, (3) initial treatment, (4) therapy optimization, and (5) patient health-related quality of life. In total, 14 'main' and 3 'secondary' QIs were selected across the five domains. This document provides an update of the previously published ESC QIs for heart failure to ensure that these measures are aligned with contemporary evidence. The QIs may be used to quantify adherence to clinical practice as recommended in guidelines to improve the care and outcomes of patients with heart failure.",European journal of heart failure,2024-Sep,"Abdin A, Wilkinson C, Aktaa S, Böhm M, Polovina M, Rosano G, Lainscak M, Lund LH, McDonagh T, Metra M, Adamo M, Mindham R, Piepoli M, Abdelhamid M, Störk S, Tokmakova MP, Seferović P, Coats AJS, Gale CP",19,1418,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

STEEER-AF is a pragmatic trial designed to objectively and robustly determine whether guidelines are adhered to in routine practice and evaluate a targeted educational programme for healthcare professionals. Seventy centres were randomized in six countries (France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and UK; 2022-23). The STEEER-AF centres recruited 1732 patients with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF), with a mean age of 68.9 years (SD 11.7), CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3.2 (SD 1.8), and 647 (37%) women. Eight hundred and forty-three patients (49%) were in AF at enrolment and 760 (44%) in sinus rhythm. Oral anticoagulant therapy was prescribed in 1543 patients (89%), with the majority receiving direct oral anticoagulants (1378; 89%). Previous cardioversion, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, or ablation was recorded in 836 patients (48.3%). Five hundred fifty-one patients (31.8%) were currently receiving an antiarrhythmic drug, and 446 (25.8%) were scheduled to receive a future cardioversion or ablation. The educational programme engaged 195 healthcare professionals across centres randomized to the intervention group, consisting of bespoke interactive online learning and reinforcement activities, supported by national expert trainers. The STEEER-AF trial was successfully deployed across six European countries to investigate guideline adherence in real-world practice and evaluate if a structured educational programme for healthcare professionals can improve patient-level care.

39003654,A Novel Approach to Mentorship in Pediatric Cardiology: A Group for Women.,"Gender disparities for female physicians in academic medicine are longstanding. Female pediatric cardiologists experience inequities in scholarship opportunities, promotion, leadership positions, and compensation. Mentorship groups have been successfully implemented in other subspecialities with promising results. We created a peer mentorship group for female pediatric cardiologists in the Northeast and completed a needs assessment survey of eligible participants. Our goal was to better understand the current challenges and identify resources to overcome these barriers. Our objectives were to (1) describe the creation of a novel mentorship program for female pediatric cardiologists and trainees in the Northeast United States, and (2) report the results of a formal needs assessment survey of all eligible participants. All female pediatric cardiology fellows and practicing pediatric and adult congenital heart disease specialists from 15 academic centers in New England were invited to join a free group with virtual meetings. A formal needs assessment survey was provided electronically to all eligible members. The vast majority of respondents agreed that the Women in Pediatric Cardiology (WIPC) group is a valuable networking and mentorship experience (90%) and would recommend this group to a colleague (95%). Members have witnessed or experienced inequities in a broad range of settings. Common challenges experienced by respondents include dependent care demands, lack of mentorship, inadequate research support, and inequitable clinical responsibilities. Resources suggested to overcome these barriers include mentorship, sponsorship, transparency in compensation, and physician coaching. Mentorship groups have the potential to address many challenges faced by women in medicine.

37625911,Proposed competencies for the performance of cardiovascular computed tomography in pediatric and adult congenital heart disease.,"Cardiovascular computed tomography (CCT) is rated appropriate by published guidelines for the initial evaluation and follow up of congenital heart disease (CHD) and is an essential modality in cardiac imaging programs for patients of all ages. However, no recommended core competencies exist to guide CCT in CHD imaging training pathways, curricula development, or establishment of a more formal educational platform. To fill this gap, a group of experienced congenital cardiac imagers, intentionally inclusive of adult and pediatric cardiologists and radiologists, was formed to propose core competencies fundamental to the expert-level performance of CCT in pediatric acquired and congenital heart disease and adult CHD. The 2020 SCCT Guideline for Training Cardiology and Radiology Trainees as Independent Practitioners (Level II) and Advanced Practitioners (Level III) in Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (1) for adult imaging were used as a framework to define pediatric and CHD-specific competencies. Established competencies will be immediately relevant for advanced cardiac imaging fellowships in both cardiology and radiology training pathways. Proposed future steps include radiology and cardiology society collaboration to establish provider certification levels, training case-volume recommendations, and continuing medical education (CME) requirements for expert-level performance of CCT in pediatric and adult CHD.",Journal of cardiovascular computed tomography,2023-,"Jepson BM, Rigsby CK, Hlavacek AM, Prakash A, Priya S, Barfuss S, Chelliah A, Binka E, Nicol E, Ghoshhajra B, Han BK",11,1430,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
33172590,Adolf Eugen Fick (1829-1901) - The Man Behind the Cardiac Output Equation.,"Adolf Fick was a German physiologist, born in Kassel in 1829, who studied medicine at the University of Marburg and graduated in 1851. He worked first in Zurich and then in Wurzburg. Most of his studies were based on physics and mathematics, and deep analysis, and only later were proven by experiments. Fick's name in physics is associated to the laws of diffusion of solutions, and in medicine to the principle of cardiac output calculation. In 1855, he proposed Fick's laws on gas diffusion. In 1870, he devised Fick's principle, which allows the measurement of cardiac output and calculations of intracardiac shunts from the arteriovenous oxygen difference. The method was later generalized to the Fick principle, according to which the flow of an indicator taken up or released by an organ corresponds to the difference between the indicator flows in the inflow and outflow tracts. Fick invented several devices most of them aimed to improve precision in his physiologic experiments. In 1868, he invented the plethysmograph, for recording the speed of blood in the human artery. In 1888, the tonometer for measuring from outside the hydrostatic pressure inside the eyeball. After 3 decades as Professor in Wurzburg, he retired.

The CICD-LT registry is investigating short- and long-term outcomes and management in patients in European Society of Cardiology (ESC) member countries, in a longitudinal ESC EURObservational Research Programme aimed at improving CCS management. Between 1 May 2015 and 31 July 2018, 9174 patients with previous ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI or coronary revascularisation, or other CCS, were recruited during a routine ambulatory visit or elective revascularisation procedure. Baseline clinical data were recorded and prescribed medications analysed at initial contact and discharge, and according to patient gender and age (<75 vs. ≥75 years). Poorly controlled cardiovascular risk factors, including current smoking (18.5%), obesity (33.9%), diabetes (25.8%), raised low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (73.3%) and persistent hypertension (24.7%), were common across all cohorts. At ambulatory visit or admission, the guidelines-recommended combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, beta-blocker, aspirin, statin and any antiplatelet agent was prescribed to 57.8% of patients with STEMI/NSTEMI. Differences in prescribing rates, including for combination therapies, were observed based on age and gender and persisted after adjustment for demographic factors. Cardiovascular risk factors were common in contemporary CCS patients and secondary prevention prescribing was suboptimal. Patients aged ≥75 years and, to some extent, female patients were less likely to receive guidelines-recommended drug combinations than younger and male patients.

39267595,Are paediatric cardiology textbooks obsolete in the current digital era?,"With the rise of online references, podcasts, webinars, self-test tools, and social media, it is worthwhile to understand whether textbooks continue to provide value in medical education, and to assess the capacity they serve during fellowship training. A prospective mixed-methods study based on surveys that were disseminated to seven paediatric cardiology fellowship programmes around the world. Participants were asked to read an assigned chapter of <i>Anderson's Pediatric Cardiology 4th Edition</i> textbook, followed by the completion of the survey. Open-ended questions included theming and grouping responses as appropriate. The survey was completed by 36 participants. When asked about the content, organisation, and utility of the chapter, responses were generally positive, at greater than 89%. The chapters, overall, were rated relatively easy to read, scoring at 6.91, with standard deviations plus or minus 1.72, on a scale from 1 to 10, with higher values meaning better results. When asked to rank their preferences in where they obtain educational content, textbooks were ranked the second highest, with in-person teaching ranking first. Several themes were identified including the limitations of the use of textbook use, their value, and ways to enhance learning from their reading. There was also a near-unanimous desire for more time to self-learn and read during fellowship. Textbooks are still highly valued by trainees. Many opportunities exist, nonetheless, to improve how they can be organised to deliver information optimally. Future efforts should look towards making them more accessible, and to include more resources for asynchronous learning.",Cardiology in the young,2024-Aug,"Kim ME, Tretter JT, Anderson RH, Spicer DE, Penny DJ, Kumar RK, McMahon CJ",7,1675,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Patients admitted for a first ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the ePARIS registry (n=2757) between 2010 and 2018 were classified by age: <55, 55-65 and >65 years old. Using Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, we evaluated whether patients would have been detected and treated with primary prevention statins before their first STEMI based on the 2021 EAS/ESC guidelines versus 2019 and 2016 guidelines. Eligibility for intensive proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9i) in secondary prevention was also assessed. Following 2021 ESC guidelines, 62.5% of individuals aged <55 years old would have been eligible for statins before their first STEMI, similarly to older age categories. In comparison, only 17% and 18% of young individuals would have been eligible for primary prevention statins prior to their first STEMI with 2016 and 2019 guidelines, compared with group 55-65 years (41% and 35%) and >65 years old (19% and 72%), p<0.01. After their first STEMI, 25% of patients <55 years would be eligible for PCSK9i, compared with 23.2% and 15% in patients aged 55-65 years and >65 years. The 2021 ESC guidelines allowed a much better detection of young individuals before their first STEMI than prior ESC guidelines.

We assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fellow education and echocardiography volumes. Our institutional database was used to examine volumes of transthoracic (TTE), stress (SE), and transesophageal echocardiograms (TEE) from 7/1/2018 to 10/10/2020. Study volumes were compared in three intervals: pre-pandemic (7/1/2018- 3/14/2020), pandemic (3/15/2020-6/13/2020), and pandemic recovery (6/14/2020-10/10/2020). We examined weekly number of TTEs performed or interpreted by cardiology fellows during the study period, and compared these to the two previous academic years. Weekly TTE volume declined by 54% during the pandemic, and increased by 99% during pandemic recovery, (p < 0.05). SE and TEE revealed similar trends. A strong correlation between weekly TTE volume and inpatient admissions was observed during the study period (r<sub>s</sub>=0.67, p < 0.05). Weekly fellow TTE scans declined by 78% during the pandemic, with a 380% increase during pandemic recovery (p < 0.05). Weekly fellow TTE interpretations declined by 56% during the pandemic, with a 76% increase during pandemic recovery (p < 0.05). COVID restrictions between 3/15/2020- 6/14/2020 coincided with a marked decline in TTE, SE, and TEE volumes, with an increase similar to near pre-pandemic volumes during the pandemic recovery period. A similar decline with the onset of COVID restrictions, and increase to pre-restriction volumes thereafter was observed with fellow scans and interpretations, but total academic year fellow training volumes remained depressed. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and rise of multiple variants, training programs may need to adjust fellows' clinical responsibilities so as to support achievement of echocardiography training certification.",BMC medical education,2022-Dec,"Varghese MS, Strom JB, Kannam JP, Fostello SE, Riley MF, Manning WJ",6,1980,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Based on international epidemiological data, around 20,000-40,000 patients are expected to be affected in Austria. Due to the wide variety of clinical and morphological manifestations the diagnosis can be difficult and the disease therefore often goes unrecognized. HCM is associated with a substantial reduction in quality of life and can lead to sudden cardiac death, especially in younger patients. Early and correct diagnosis, including genetic testing, is essential for comprehensive counselling of patients and their families and for effective treatment. The latter is especially true as an effective treatment of outflow tract obstruction has recently become available in the form of a first in class cardiac myosin ATPase inhibitor, as a noninvasive alternative to established septal reduction therapies.

38733027,MEMS Technology in Cardiology: Advancements and Applications in Heart Failure Management Focusing on the CardioMEMS Device.,"Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. It is characterized by various structural and/or functional abnormalities of the heart, resulting in elevated intracardiac pressure and/or inadequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise. These dysfunctions can originate from a variety of conditions, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiomyopathies, heart valve disorders, arrhythmias, and other lifestyle or systemic factors. Identifying the underlying cause is crucial for detecting reversible or treatable forms of HF. Recent epidemiological studies indicate that there has not been an increase in the incidence of the disease. Instead, patients seem to experience a chronic trajectory marked by frequent hospitalizations and stagnant mortality rates. Managing these patients requires a multidisciplinary approach that focuses on preventing disease progression, controlling symptoms, and preventing acute decompensations. In the outpatient setting, patient self-care plays a vital role in achieving these goals. This involves implementing necessary lifestyle changes and promptly recognizing symptoms/signs such as dyspnea, lower limb edema, or unexpected weight gain over a few days, to alert the healthcare team for evaluation of medication adjustments. Traditional methods of HF monitoring, such as symptom assessment and periodic clinic visits, may not capture subtle changes in hemodynamics. Sensor-based technologies offer a promising solution for remote monitoring of HF patients, enabling early detection of fluid overload and optimization of medical therapy. In this review, we provide an overview of the CardioMEMS device, a novel sensor-based system for pulmonary artery pressure monitoring in HF patients. We discuss the technical aspects, clinical evidence, and future directions of CardioMEMS in HF management.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2024-May,"Ciotola F, Pyxaras S, Rittger H, Buia V",4,1926,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

34954110,Multi-level process mining methodology for exploring disease-specific care processes.,"Public healthcare is a complex domain with many actors and highly variable protocols, which makes traditional process mining tools less effective and calls for specialized methods. The objective of the work was to develop a generally applicable process mining methodology to explore care processes related to diseases. The proposed methodology called Process Mining Methodology for Exploring Disease-specific Care Processes (MEDCP) is based on a systematic, step-wise refinement of the raw event logs by using such a multi-level expert taxonomy of events that encapsulates the professional concepts of the analysis. A treatment process is defined according to domain-specific rules to identify the starting (index) and closing events. Concepts from various levels of the taxonomy support the final process definition for an analysis that can deliver meaningful conclusions for domain experts. The applicability of the methodology was demonstrated on two case studies in the cardiological and oncological care domains, in the public health care system in Hungary over a period of ten years. Thanks to the multi-level taxonomy, these studies successfully identified the most important high-level event sequence patterns and some key anomalies in the national care system, such as the significantly different behavior of low-volume vs. high volume care providers in the oncology study or the geographically connected, homogeneous clusters of providers with similar care spectra in the cardiology study. As the case studies showed, the proposed methodology can improve the efficiency of standard process mining methods, and deliver high level conclusions that are easy to interpret by domain experts. System-level insight into health care processes can serve as a basis for the optimisation and long-term planning of the whole care system.",Journal of biomedical informatics,2022-Jan,"Vathy-Fogarassy Á, Vassányi I, Kósa I",3,1835,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

It is structured into 8 chapters, including (i) principles of cancer biology and therapy; (ii) forms and definitions of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity (CTR-CVT); (iii) risk stratification, prevention and monitoring protocols for CTR-CVT; (iv) diagnosis and management of CV disease in patients with cancer; (v) long-term survivorship programmes and cardio-oncology rehabilitation; (vi) multidisciplinary team management of special populations; (vii) organization of cardio-oncology services; (viii) research in cardio-oncology. The core curriculum aims at promoting standardization and harmonization of training and evaluation in cardio-oncology, while it further provides the ground for an ESC certification programme designed to recognize the competencies of certified specialists.",European journal of heart failure,2024-Apr,"López-Fernández T, Farmakis D, Ameri P, Asteggiano R, de Azambuja E, Aznar M, Barac A, Bayes-Genis A, Bax JJ, Bergler-Klein J, Boriani G, Celutkiene J, Coats A, Cohen-Solal A, Córdoba R, Cosyns B, Filippatos G, Fox K, Gulati G, Inciardi RM, Lee G, Mamas MA, Novo G, Plummer C, Psyrri A, Rakisheva A, Suter T, Tini G, Tocchetti CG, Toutouzas K, Wilhelm M, Metra M, Lyon AR, Rosano GMC",34,1439,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

This narrative review summarizes evidence suggesting that the recognition of pulmonary circulation is older than the time of Ibn Nafis. The theory of pulmonary circulation originated in ancient Persia (ad 224-637), was overshadowed by Greek theory from the 11th century, and reestablished by Ibn Nafis in the 13th century. The findings of this review may help contextualize the story of the discovery of pulmonary circulation in ancient Persian and Greek theories before Ibn Nafis.",JAMA cardiology,2022-Jan,Zargaran A,1,616,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
30681399,A Survey of Adult and Pediatric Cardiology Fellows on Training Received in Family Planning Counseling.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> This 2016 study aimed to investigate the training in contraception and preconception counseling received by cardiovascular science fellows. <b><i>Method:</i></b> The authors surveyed current adult and pediatric cardiology fellows in the United States. Questions assessed the availability of family planning counseling training within their training program, current practices of contraception and preconception counseling, and use of available tools for risk stratification of patients. Bivariate logistic regressions were utilized to predict demographic variables associated with survey responses, and associations between hours of training or perceived preparedness and clinical use of training. <b><i>Results:</i></b> There were 101 survey responses. Most participating fellows disagreed that their fellowship training had prepared them to counsel patients on contraception (69%) and preconception planning (62%). Sixty-one percent of participants do not routinely discuss contraception options and 55% do not routinely discuss preconception counseling with reproductive-age female patients at routine visits. Having more than 1 hour of training was predictive of more consistent counseling for both contraception and preconception counseling. Approximately 40% of participants routinely refer patients to an OB/Gyn for contraception or preconception counseling. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> This study highlights the need for increased training in contraceptive and preconception counseling within adult and pediatric cardiology fellowship programs.",Journal of women's health (2002),2020-Feb,"Brown AE, Bradbrook KE, Casey FE",3,1576,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
38866449,Geographic Mapping of Gender Disparities in Authorship of Cardiovascular Literature.,"Women in cardiology experience considerable gender disparities in publications, which hinders their career advancements to higher faculty and senior leadership positions. However, the extent of these disparities across different types of cardiovascular literature is not well understood. We investigated gender differences in authorship across various cardiovascular publications over a decade and examined geographic variations in the representation of women authors. All papers published from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019, in 4 major cardiovascular journals (Journal of the American College of Cardiology, European Heart Journal, Journal of the American Medical Association Cardiology, and Nature Reviews Cardiology) were reviewed. Of the 18,535 papers with 111,562 authors, 20.6% of the authors were women, and 47.7% of the papers had no women authors. Over 10 years, the proportion of women authors remained low (20.7% in 2010 to 21.4% in 2019), with the lowest proportion in editorial papers (14.8%) and the highest in research papers (21.8%). More women as first (34.6%) and last (47.6%) authors were affiliated with institutions in the United States compared with other countries. The proportion of women middle-order authors was higher on papers with women as first authors (29.4% vs 20.5%) or last authors (30.6% vs 21.3%), compared with papers with men as first or last authors, respectively. Over the past decade, the proportion of women authors across all article types in major cardiovascular journals remained low.

38427088,Delivering Serious News in Pediatric Cardiology-A Pilot Program.,"Pediatric cardiology fellows receive limited training on delivering serious news. This is a teachable skill through simulation-based communication. While studies have shown the use of communication courses in pediatrics, there have been none in pediatric cardiology. Pediatric cardiologists recognize the importance of good communication and desire further development of these skills. Based on an internal needs assessment, three cases were developed; fetal hypoplastic left heart syndrome, teenager with new hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and young-adult with Fontan failure. A 4-h simulation course using evidence-based methods to teach delivering serious news was designed, consisting of a didactic session, case demonstration and small group case-based encounters with simulated patients. Trainees completed standardized pre/post-course surveys to assess perception of skill and preparedness. Paired survey responses were compared. Six pediatric cardiology fellows participated. Only 33% had received formal training in delivering serious news and 17% in techniques of responding to patient's emotions. The proportion of participants who felt good about their ability to deliver serious news and deal with a family's emotions increased from 0 to 83%. The proportion of participants who felt prepared to provide serious news about a patient's illness increased from 17 to 67%. Given the small number of participants, results were not statistically significant. All participants felt that the course was valuable in improving communication skills. A formal communication course increased perception of skill and preparedness among trainees. We provide an evidence-based framework and clinical cases for delivering serious news in pediatric cardiology, which is generalizable to other training programs.",Pediatric cardiology,2025-Feb,"Das N, Brown A, Harris TH",3,1803,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

To ensure that simulators provide a realistic surrogate to real procedures they must undergo scientific validation. We aimed to evaluate the 3D-printed simulator SimulHeart® for face and content validity to demonstrate its value as a training tool in interventional cardiology (IC). Health professionals were recruited from sixteen Portuguese IC units. All participants received a 30-minute theoretical introduction, 10-minute demonstration of each task and then performed the intervention on a 3D-printed simulator (SimulHeart®). Finally, a post-training questionnaire focusing on the appearance of the simulation, simulation content, and satisfaction/self-efficacy was administered. We included 56 participants: 16 ""experts"" (general and interventional cardiologists), 26 ""novices"" (cardiology residents), and 14 nurses and allied professionals. On a five-point Likert scale, the overall mean score of face validity was 4.38±0.35 and the overall mean score of content validity was 4.69±0.32. There was no statistically significant difference in the scores provided by ""experts"" and ""novices"". Participants reported a high level of satisfaction/self-efficacy with 60.7% considering it strongly improved their skills. The majority (82.1%) ""agreed"" or ""strongly agreed"" that after the simulation they felt confident to perform the procedure on a patient. The 3D-printed simulator (SimulHeart®) showed excellent face and content validity. 3D simulation may play an important role in future IC training programs.

38837338,The impact of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines and whole exome sequencing on genetic testing in hereditary cardiac diseases.,"In the last decade, an incredible improvement has been made in elucidating the genetic bases of cardiomyopathies. Here we report the impact of either the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines or the use of whole exome sequencing (WES) in terms of a number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) and missed diagnoses in a series of 260 patients affected by inherited cardiac disorders. Samples were analyzed using a targeted gene panel of 128 cardiac-related genes and/or WES in a subset of patients, with a three-tier approach. Analyzing (i) only a subset of genes related to the clinical presentation, strictly following the ESC guidelines, 20.77% positive test were assessed. The incremental diagnostic rate for (ii) the whole gene panel, and (iii) the WES was 4.71% and 11.67%, respectively. The diverse analytical approaches increased the number of VUSs and incidental findings. Indeed, the use of WES highlights that there is a small percentage of syndromic conditions that standard analysis would not have detected. Moreover, the use of targeted sequencing coupled with ""narrow"" analytical approach prevents the detection of variants in actionable genes that could allow for preventive treatment. Our data suggest that genetic testing might aid clinicians in the diagnosis of inheritable cardiac disorders.",Clinical genetics,2024-Oct,"Mio C, Zucco J, Fabbro D, Bregant E, Baldan F, Allegri L, D'Elia AV, Collini V, Imazio M, Damante G, Faletra F",11,1327,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

33755872,Applications of cosinor rhythmometry in pharmacology.,"Study design and data analysis are two important aspects relevant to chronopharmacometrics. Blunders can be avoided by recognizing that most physiological variables are circadian periodic. Both ill health and treatment can affect the amplitude, phase, and/or period of circadian (and other) rhythms, in addition to their mean. The involvement of clock genes in molecular pathways related to important physiological systems underlies the bidirectional relationship often seen between circadian rhythm disruption and disease risk. Circadian rhythm characteristics of marker rhythms interpreted in the light of chronobiologic reference values represent important diagnostic tools. A set of cosinor-related programs is presented. They include the least squares fit of multiple-frequency cosine functions to model the time structure of individual records; a cosinor-based spectral analysis to detect periodic signals; the population-mean cosinor to generalize inferences; the chronobiologic serial section to follow the time course of changing rhythm parameters over time; and parameter tests to assess differences among populations. Relative merits of other available cosinor and non-parametric algorithms are reviewed. Parameter tests to compare individual records and a self-starting cumulative sum (CUSUM) make personalized chronotherapy possible, where the treatment of each patient relies on an N-of-1 design. Methods are illustrated in a few examples relevant to endocrinology, cancer and cardiology. New sensing technology yielding large personal data sets is likely to change the healthcare system. Chronobiologic concepts and methods should become an integral part of these evolving systems.",Journal of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,2021-Jun,Cornelissen G,1,1696,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

To provide comprehensive contemporary information on the access and use of cardiac arrhythmia services in Africa. Data on human resources, drug availability, cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED), and ablation procedures were sought from member countries of Pan African Society of Cardiology. Data were received from 23 out of 31 countries. In most countries, healthcare services are primarily supported by household incomes. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), digoxin, and amiodarone were available in all countries, while the availability of other drugs varied widely. Non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were unequally present in the African markets, while International Normalized Ratio monitoring was challenging. Four countries (18%) did not provide pacemaker implantations while, where available, the implantation and operator rates were 2.79 and 0.772 per million population, respectively. The countries with the highest pacemaker implantation rate/million population in descending order were Tunisia, Mauritius, South Africa, Algeria, and Morocco. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) were performed in 15 (65%) and 12 (52%) countries, respectively. Reconditioned CIED were used in 5 (22%) countries. Electrophysiology was performed in 8 (35%) countries, but complex ablations only in countries from the Maghreb and South Africa. Marked variation in costs of CIED that severely mismatched the gross domestic product per capita was observed in Africa. From the first report, three countries have started performing simple ablations. The access to arrhythmia treatments varied widely in Africa where hundreds of millions of people remain at risk of dying from heart block.

32447058,Identifying Guideline-Practice Gaps to Optimize Evaluation and Management for Patients With Syncope.,"Syncope is a common and complex symptom that requires efficient evaluation to determine the cause. Recent guidelines focus on high-value testing, but a systematic evaluation of their implementation has not been performed. To this end, we used a mixed-methods approach of surveys, chart reviews, and focus groups to understand current practices relating to the diagnosis and management of patients with syncope and to identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of guideline-supported recommendations. Surveys were distributed to 1500 providers in the specialties of hospital medicine, cardiology, emergency medicine, and family medicine, and 175 responses were received. Knowledge of class I and III guideline recommendations were assessed with the use of clinical vignettes, which were answered correctly 60%-80% of the time. Chart reviews focused on patient history and testing for syncope. Per the guidelines, < 50% of charts met criteria for bare minimum history and physical examination. Based on the documentation, 25% of echocardiograms and 90% of neurologic testing obtained would not have been appropriate per the guidelines. Self-reported and actual practice patterns were similar in rates of testing. Our results indicate that there remains a gap between guideline-directed management and actual practice for syncope. Focus groups revealed barriers across multiple levels of care that need to be addressed to improve care.

39313866,Conflicts of interest in clinical practice: lessons learned from cardiovascular medicine.,"Cardiovascular diseases represent a major burden worldwide, and clinical trials are critical to define treatment improvements. Since various conflicts of interest (COIs) may influence trials at multiple levels, cardiovascular research represents a paradigmatic example to analyze their effects and manage them effectively to re-establish the centrality of evidence-based medicine.Despite the manifest role of industry, COIs may differently affect both sponsored and non-sponsored studies in many ways. COIs influence may start from the research question, data collection and adjudication, up to result reporting, including the spin phenomenon. Outcomes and endpoints (especially composite) choice and definitions also represent potential sources for COIs interference. Since large randomized controlled trials significantly influence international guidelines, thus impacting also clinical practice, their critical assessment for COIs is mandatory. Despite specific protocols aimed to mitigate COI influence, even scientific societies and guideline panels may not be totally free from COIs, negatively affecting their accountability and trustworthiness.Shared rules, awareness of COI mechanisms and transparency with external data access may help promoting evidence-based research and mitigate COIs impact.

32838627,Perceptions on Diversity in Cardiology: A Survey of Cardiology Fellowship Training Program Directors.,"Background The lack of diversity in the cardiovascular physician workforce is thought to be an important driver of racial and sex disparities in cardiac care. Cardiology fellowship program directors play a critical role in shaping the cardiology workforce. Methods and Results To assess program directors' perceptions about diversity and barriers to enhancing diversity, the authors conducted a survey of 513 fellowship program directors or associate directors from 193 unique adult cardiology fellowship training programs. The response rate was 21% of all individuals (110/513) representing 57% of US general adult cardiology training programs (110/193). While 69% of respondents endorsed the belief that diversity is a driver of excellence in health care, only 26% could quote 1 to 2 references to support this statement. Sixty-three percent of respondents agreed that ""our program is diverse already so diversity does not need to be increased."" Only 6% of respondents listed diversity as a top 3 priority when creating the cardiovascular fellowship rank list. Conclusions These findings suggest that while program directors generally believe that diversity enhances quality, they are less familiar with the literature that supports that contention and they may not share a unified definition of ""diversity."" This may result in diversity enhancement having a low priority. The authors propose several strategies to engage fellowship training program directors in efforts to diversify cardiology fellowship training programs.",Journal of the American Heart Association,2020-Sep,"Crowley AL, Damp J, Sulistio MS, Berlacher K, Polk DM, Hong RA, Weissman G, Jackson D, Sivaram CA, Arrighi JA, Kates AM, Duvernoy CS, Lewis SJ, Capers Q",14,1526,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Pediatric preventive cardiology programs have independently developed and proliferated to address cardiovascular risk factors in youth, but there is a general lack of clarity on best practices to optimize and sustain desired outcomes. We conducted surveys of pediatric cardiology division directors and pediatric preventive cardiology clinicians across the United States and Canada to describe the current landscape and perspectives on future directions for the field. We summarize the data and conclude with a call to action for various audiences who seek to improve cardiovascular health in youth, reduce the burden of premature cardiovascular disease, and increase healthy longevity. We call on heart centers, hospitals, payers, and policymakers to invest resources in the important work of pediatric preventive cardiology programs. We urge professional societies to advocate for pediatric preventive cardiology and provide opportunities for training and cross-pollination across programs.

Traditional approaches to understanding and treating metabolic dysfunction-associated disorders have been organ-centered, leading to silo-type disease care. However, given the broad impact that systemic metabolic dysfunction has on the human body, approaches that simultaneously involve multiple medical specialists need to be developed and encouraged to optimize patient outcomes.

Part 2: results of the VERIDIC project.,"Optimizing patient exposure in interventional cardiology is key to avoid skin injuries. To establish predictive models of peak skin dose (PSD) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention (CTO), and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedures. A total of 534 PCI, 219 CTO, and 209 TAVI were collected from 12 hospitals in eight European countries. Independent associations between PSD and clinical and technical dose determinants were examined for those procedures using multivariate statistical analysis. A priori and a posteriori predictive models were built using stepwise multiple linear regressions. A fourfold cross-validation was performed, and models' performance was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of determination (R²), and linear correlation coefficient (r). Multivariate analysis proved technical parameters to overweight clinical complexity indices with PSD mainly affected by fluoroscopy time, tube voltage, tube current, distance to detector, and tube angulation for PCI. For CTO, these were body mass index, tube voltage, and fluoroscopy contribution. For TAVI, these parameters were sex, fluoroscopy time, tube voltage, and cine acquisitions. When benchmarking the predictive models, the correlation coefficients were r = 0.45 for the a priori model and r = 0.89 for the a posteriori model for PCI. These were 0.44 and 0.67, respectively, for the CTO a priori and a posteriori models, and 0.58 and 0.74, respectively, for the TAVI a priori and a posteriori models. A priori predictive models can help operators estimate the PSD before performing the intervention while a posteriori models are more accurate estimates and can be useful in the absence of skin dose mapping solutions.","Acta radiologica (Stockholm, Sweden : 1987)",2023-Jan,"Feghali JA, Delépierre J, Belac OC, Dabin J, Deleu M, De Monte F, Dobric M, Gallagher A, Hadid-Beurrier L, Henry P, Hršak H, Kiernan T, Kumar R, Knežević Ž, Maccia C, Majer M, Malchair F, Noble S, Obrad D, Merce MS, Sideris G, Simantirakis G, Spaulding C, Tarantini G, Van Ngoc Ty C",25,1846,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Despite the array of therapeutic avenues in clinical practice, predominantly pharmaceutical and surgical interventions, they often fall short of fully addressing the clinical exigencies of cardiovascular patients. In recent years, nanocarriers have shown great potential in the treatment and diagnose of cardiovascular diseases. They can enhance drug targeting and bioavailability while reducing side effects. Additionally, by improving imaging and detection technologies, they enhance early diagnosis and disease monitoring capabilities. These advancements in technology offer new solutions for precision medicine in cardiovascular diseases, advancing treatment efficacy and disease management. Crafted from biomaterials, metals, or their amalgamations, these nanocarriers approximate the dimensions of biologically active molecules like proteins and DNA. Cardiovascular nanomedicine, in its infancy, has only recently burgeoned. Yet, with continual refinement in nanocarrier architecture, drug delivery mechanisms, and therapeutic outcomes, the potential of nanomedical technologies in clinical contexts becomes increasingly evident.

34924098,Assessment of physician training and prediction of workforce needs in paediatric cardiac intensive care in the United States.,"To assess the training and the future workforce needs of paediatric cardiac critical care faculty. REDCap surveys were sent May-August 2019 to medical directors and faculty at the 120 US centres participating in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database. Faculty and directors were asked about personal training pathway and planned employment changes. Directors were additionally asked for current faculty numbers, expected job openings, presence of training programmes, and numbers of trainees. Predictive modelling of the workforce was performed using respondents' data. Patient volume was projected from US Census data and compared to projected provider availability. Sixty-six per cent (79/120) of directors and 62% (294/477) of contacted faculty responded. Most respondents had training that incorporated critical care medicine with the majority completing training beyond categorical fellowship. Younger respondents and those in dedicated cardiac ICUs were more significantly likely to have advanced training or dual fellowships in cardiology and critical care medicine. An estimated 49-63 faculty enter the workforce annually from various training pathways. Based on modelling, these faculty will likely fill current and projected open positions over the next 5 years. Paediatric cardiac critical care training has evolved, such that the majority of faculty now have dual fellowship or advanced training. The projected number of incoming faculty will likely fill open positions within the next 5 years.

35940166,Setting up regional diagnostic reference levels for pediatric interventional cardiology in Latin America and the Caribbean countries: preliminary results and identified challenges.,"The goal of the present study was to propose a set of preliminary regional diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for pediatric interventional cardiology (IC) procedures in Latin America and the Caribbean countries, classified by age and weight groups. The study was conducted in the framework of the Optimization of Protection in Pediatric Interventional Radiology in Latin America and the Caribbean program coordinated by the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The first step of the program was focused on pediatric IC. Dose data from diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were collected between December 2020 and December 2021. Regional DRLs were set as the third quartile of patient dose data (kerma area product) collected in 18 hospitals from 10 countries in an initial sample of 968 procedures. DRLs were set for four age bands and five weight ranges. The values obtained for the four age bands (<1 yr, 1 to <5 yr, 5 to <10 yr and 10 to <16 yr) were 2.9, 6.1, 8.8 and 14.4 Gy cm<sup>2</sup>for diagnostic procedures, and 4.0, 5.0, 10.0 and 38.1 Gy cm<sup>2</sup>for therapeutic procedures, respectively. The values obtained for the five weight bands (<5 kg, 5 to <15 kg, 15 to <30 kg, 30 to <50 kg and 50 to <80 kg) were 3.0, 4.5, 8.1, 9.2 and 26.8 Gy cm<sup>2</sup>for diagnostic procedures and 3.7, 4,3, 7.3, 16.1 and 53.4 Gy cm<sup>2</sup>for therapeutic procedures, respectively. While initial data were collected manually as patient dose management systems (DMSs) were not available in most of the hospitals involved in the program, a centralized automatic DMS for the collection and management of patient dose indicators has now been introduced and is envisaged to increase the sample size.

34338183,2021 PACES expert consensus statement on the indications and management of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices in pediatric patients.,"In view of the increasing complexity of both cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) and patients in the current era, practice guidelines, by necessity, have become increasingly specific. This document is an expert consensus statement that has been developed to update and further delineate indications and management of CIEDs in pediatric patients, defined as ≤21 years of age, and is intended to focus primarily on the indications for CIEDs in the setting of specific disease categories. The document also highlights variations between previously published adult and pediatric CIED recommendations and provides rationale for underlying important differences. The document addresses some of the deterrents to CIED access in low- and middle-income countries and strategies to circumvent them. The document sections were divided up and drafted by the writing committee members according to their expertise. The recommendations represent the consensus opinion of the entire writing committee, graded by class of recommendation and level of evidence. Several questions addressed in this document either do not lend themselves to clinical trials or are rare disease entities, and in these instances recommendations are based on consensus expert opinion. Furthermore, specific recommendations, even when supported by substantial data, do not replace the need for clinical judgment and patient-specific decision-making. The recommendations were opened for public comment to Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES) members and underwent external review by the scientific and clinical document committee of the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), the science advisory and coordinating committee of the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and the Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology (AEPC). The document received endorsement by all the collaborators and the Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS), the Indian Heart Rhythm Society (IHRS), and the Latin American Heart Rhythm Society (LAHRS).

31865443,Fears and Stressors of Trainees Starting Fellowship in Pediatric Cardiology.,"Post-graduate training for physicians involves a high level of stress. High stress during training has the potential to cause burnout, a well-studied phenomenon in medical trainees. Burnout has previously been shown to increase the risk of mental health problems and medical error in trainees. Little research has been done on the impact of stress on new fellows in general and pediatric cardiology fellows in particular; understanding common sources of stress offers the opportunity to design targeted interventions to support trainee wellness. New trainees in Boston Children's Hospital's Pediatric Cardiology Fellowship program were asked to answer to the following question at the beginning of their training: ""What are you afraid of in the coming year?"" A qualitative content analysis was done on their anonymous responses. Responses were coded and analyzed for common themes. The overall analysis found that 83% of fellows reported fear of ""fellowship/career responsibilities."" The second most common theme was ""failure/disappointment"" (78%) followed by ""personal life"" (74%), ""emotional exhaustion"" (61%); least common was ""new hospital environment"" (37%). The most common individual fear was ""increased clinical responsibility"" reported by 65% of the new fellows, while 62% reported fears of ""imposter syndrome,"" and 58% about ""burnout."" We found that fellows commonly report fears about both clinical and personal responsibilities, similar to stressors found in studies on residency. It is important for pediatric cardiology fellowships to develop early and specific interventions designed to assist fellows in managing both their new clinical responsibilities and their other stressors.",Pediatric cardiology,2020-Apr,"Brown DW, Binney G, Gauthier Z, Blume ED",4,1696,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
39287714,The Role of Nursing in the Delivery of Cardio-Oncology.,"Nurses are the ""heart of patient care"" and in the forefront of the health care delivery for cardio-oncology patients. Nurses play a critical central role in maximizing longitudinal health of cancer patients and survivors through the prevention of cardiovascular complications throughout the patient's cancer care journey. Nurses function in a variety of roles such as nurse clinicians, advanced practice nurses (APNs)or nurse practitioners (NPs), patient educators, managers, nurse navigators or nurse researchers. The role of nurses, particularly the advanced practice nurses as key members in delivering cardio-oncology care is evolving. However, despite the rapidly increasing growth of cardio oncology programs globally, a pivotal need remains to develop and provide formalized training programs for nurses, NPs and APNs. At present, no formal academic cardio-oncology nurse training program or certification exists. There is clearly more work to be done on the role of nurses in cardio-oncology care. As cardio-oncology evolves to become a key specialty with dedicated services being established across the globe, the role of the nurse in delivering this service is critical and a concerted collaborative approach between the two distinct specialties of cardiology and oncology needs to ensure the nursing workforce is educationally prepared and confident to treat and manage cardio-oncology patients.",Current treatment options in oncology,2024-Oct,"Fadol A, Nodzon L, Lee G",3,1406,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
34015465,Improving Online ECG Interpretation Through Self-Generation of Diagnoses During Practice: A Randomized Study.,"Although electrocardiography (ECG) is a fundamental skill for most physicians, trainees have poor diagnostic performance when interpreting ECGs. In this study, we examine a strategy to improve learning ECG interpretation: self-generation of diagnoses during online practice. We randomly assigned medical students and residents to one of 2 ECG interpretation training formats: multiple-choice (MCQ) or self-generation (SG) format, where participants free-text type their diagnosis aided by an autocomplete feature. The training phase consisted of 30 ECGs, after which participants completed an immediate post test and delayed post test (3-4 weeks later). Forty-eight participants completed the training module, 45 completed the immediate post test, and 27 completed the delayed post test. Participants assigned to the SG format scored higher on the immediate post test compared with those who practiced with the MCQ format, with a large effect size (78% vs 57%; d = 0.94; P = 0.02). There was a trend favouring SG on the delayed post test, with a moderate effect size (67% vs 56%; d = 0.65; P = 0.09). However, only 60% of participants completed the delayed post test, which hindered the detection of a statistically significant difference. The SG group made the correct primary diagnosis at a faster rate (32 vs 56 seconds; P < 0.001) but had a lower detection of secondary diagnoses (22 vs 42%; P = 0.007). Practicing ECG interpretation using self-generation of diagnoses improved immediate post test performance and fluency.

The technology enables personalized simulations of clinical scenarios, prediction of disease risk, and strategies for clinical trial augmentation. Current applications of cardiovascular digital twins have integrated multi-modal data into mechanistic and statistical models to build physiologically accurate cardiac replicas to enhance disease phenotyping, enrich diagnostic workflows, and optimize procedural planning. Digital twin technology is rapidly evolving in the setting of newly available data modalities and advances in generative artificial intelligence, enabling dynamic and comprehensive simulations unique to an individual. These twins fuse physiologic, environmental, and healthcare data into machine learning and generative models to build real-time patient predictions that can model interactions with the clinical environment to accelerate personalized patient care. This review summarizes digital twins in cardiovascular medicine and their potential future applications by incorporating new personalized data modalities. It examines the technical advances in deep learning and generative artificial intelligence that broaden the scope and predictive power of digital twins. Finally, it highlights the individual and societal challenges as well as ethical considerations that are essential to realizing the future vision of incorporating cardiology digital twins into personalized cardiovascular care.",European heart journal,2024-Dec,"Thangaraj PM, Benson SH, Oikonomou EK, Asselbergs FW, Khera R",5,1591,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
33179179,Online Learning and Echocardiography Boot Camp: Innovative Learning Platforms Promoting Blended Learning and Competency in Pediatric Echocardiography.,"Mastering pediatric echocardiography (PE) requires a substantial knowledge base of echo theory and congenital heart disease (CHD), along with technical proficiency. Online self-directed learning has become increasingly utilized among medical trainees to promote competency within medical subspecialties. We sought to evaluate the impact of online learning combined with lecture-based and hands-on teaching on the acquisition of PE knowledge and confidence in pediatric cardiology and pediatric critical care fellows. We prospectively enrolled 124 learners from 2016 to 2019. These included 40 incoming cardiology and critical care fellows at Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) as well as 84 national and international participants recruited from our online echo education website. All participants completed online learning modules through our website ( www.pedecho.org ), which covers pediatric echo physics, Doppler, technique, normal anatomy, atrial septal defects, and ventricular septal defects. TCH cardiology and critical care fellows subsequently participated in an Echo Boot Camp (BC), a 3-day training program with hands-on workshops and didactic lectures. Knowledge was assessed using an 80-question pre and post-test multiple choice exams. The online learning group demonstrated improvement in exam scores following online learning (PRE 49.1 ± 15.3 vs. POST 67.8 ± 17%; p ≤ 0.01). Echo Boot Camp fellows were noted to have further incremental improvement in test scores following BC (PRE 48% ± 13% vs. POST MODULE 68.6% ± 15% vs. POST BC 75.7% ± 13%; p ≤ 0.01). Self-assessment regarding confidence in context areas showed a substantial gain in self perceived interpretive confidence across all groups as well as procedural confidence in BC participants. Online learning significantly promotes the acquisition of echocardiography knowledge. Additional lecture-based and hands-on teaching in the form of an Echo Boot Camp can further enhance knowledge and interpretative skills.

36974343,Handheld ultrasound in cardiology: Current perspective.,"The advantages of ultrasonography do not need to be discussed. It is suitable for use in diverse clinical settings and environments by operators with different backgrounds. Recent technological advances have led not only to the enhancement of the diagnostic capabilities of stationary ultrasound systems but also to miniaturization, which in turn led to the introduction of smartphone-sized handheld ultrasound devices (HUDs), designed to be used at bedside to improve and extend the scope of physical examination. Although diagnostic capabilities of HUDs are expanding, according to guidelines, they cannot be perceived as a tool suitable for performing full echocardiographic examination. However, their ultraportability made them essential for the bedside assessment, with the particular emphasis on the bedside focus cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS)-goal-oriented, limited echocardiographic screening. Clinically relevant cardiological targets suggested for HUDs include the assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function and size, assessment of other cardiac chambers, identification of gross valvular abnormalities, and detection of the pathological masses within the heart cavities. Handheld ultrasound devices may be also helpful in identifying pleural effusion or subpleural consolidations; furthermore, brief ultrasonographic assessment of ""lung comets"" enables the estimation of the level of congestion. Ultrasound screening for certain vascular abnormalities also appears promising. The limitations of HUDs are rather obvious and caution is needed to distinguish the role of HUD-based bedside-limited scan from comprehensive stationary echocardiography. It appears that the right approach is to treat them as complementary tools proving their capabilities in diverse clinical scenarios.",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,2023-Mar,"Filipiak-Strzecka D, Lipiec P, Kasprzak JD",3,1799,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

30903598,Factors associated with refusal or acceptance of older patients (≥ 65 years) to provide consent to participate in clinical research in cardiology: a qualitative study.,"Clinical research is an essential step in the successful translation of knowledge from basic research into concrete clinical applications, yet many people are reluctant to provide consent when actually approached to actively participate in clinical trials. We investigated the factors that influence older patient's (≥ 65 years) decisions to accept or refuse to participate in a prospective randomized clinical trial in secondary prevention after acute coronary syndrome. Qualitative approach based on individual semi-structured interviews with patients who were approached for consent to participate in a currently ongoing clinical trial was adopted. Patients were interviewed after the consent process (8 accepted; 8 refused the trial). Interviews were analysed using grounded theory methodology. Sixteen patients aged ≥ 65 years participated. The main concept to emerge from these interviews is that the actual trial itself does not appear to be the primary determinant in the decision to participate in clinical research. Rather, patients' decisions to participate (or not) in clinical research appear to be primarily determined by their capacity to deal with the current health event that has disrupted their life, and by their available mental and physical resources. Older patients display varying levels of engagement in their own health, ranging from low engagement with high trust in the medical profession, to high engagement mirrored by distrust of the medical profession. Structural conditions, such as personal benefit from trial participation, or logistic barriers to participation, seem to affect both accepters and refusers in the same manner.",Aging clinical and experimental research,2020-Jan,"Ecarnot F, Meunier-Beillard N, Quenot JP, Meneveau N",4,1660,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Traditional social media has been used extensively by cardiologists for several years and now extends to the entire care team including trainees, advanced practitioners, nurses and technologists. Numerous challenges include concerns about patient privacy and security, lack of peer-review and organization, and chances of propagating misinformation. More recently, newer networking platforms have emerged within cardiology to overcome several of the limitations of traditional social media. Additionally, mobile applications have emerged as an educational tool that provides clinicians with easy access to the latest information including guidelines, consensus documents, risk estimators and treatment algorithms. These point-of-care learning and decision-making tools are especially relevant and impactful in a procedural field like interventional cardiology. While professional societies are major drivers of these emerging platforms, there are also other stakeholders including educational institutions and the medical device industry. In this review article, we examine the role of traditional social media and describe newer networking platforms as well as mobile applications applicable to interventional cardiology with a discussion about their relative advantages and disadvantages.",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2024-Dec,"Bharadwaj AS, Cader FA, Goldsweig AM, Kini A, Sharma S, Gluckman TJ, O'Leary J, Cohen D, Cigarroa JE, Alasnag M",10,1568,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Despite this, dissemination into widespread routine clinical practice has been slow, largely restricted to large academic centers and urban settings. The reasons of this are multifactorial, but one of the most impactful of these reasons is undeniably reimbursement. Currently, there is marked discrepancy between the costs of performing cardiac CT and the renumeration provided for this. Until this is addressed, cardiac CT will not reach its potential for the benefit of patients. It is for this reason that the SCCT continues to dedicate significant efforts to represent the need of the cardiology and radiology communities in bringing about changes in policy and billing. Significant momentum has been gained in recent years with the engagement of both congress and Medicare in moving towards a system of payment that recognizes the time and expertise required to acquire high quality cardiac CT.

32405641,EAPCI Position Statement on Invasive Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to healthcare worldwide. The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment. The transmission of the disease poses a risk to both patients and healthcare workers. The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions. This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe. Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge. Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described. In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries.

To identify which clinical and technical parameters affect patient exposure and peak skin dose (PSD) and to establish dose reference levels (DRL) per clinical complexity level in IC procedures. Validation and Estimation of Radiation skin Dose in Interventional Cardiology (VERIDIC) project analyzed prospectively collected patient data from eight European countries and 12 hospitals where percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), chronic total occlusion PCI (CTO), and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedures were performed. A total of 62 clinical complexity parameters and 31 technical parameters were collected, univariate regressions were performed to identify those parameters affecting patient exposure and define DRL accordingly. Patient exposure as well as clinical and technical parameters were collected for a total of 534 PCI, 219 CTO, and 209 TAVI. For PCI procedures, body mass index (BMI), number of stents ≥2, and total stent length >28 mm were the most prominent clinical parameters, which increased the PSD value. For CTO, these were total stent length >57 mm, BMI, and previous anterograde or retrograde technique that failed in the same session. For TAVI, these were male sex, BMI, and number of diseased vessels. DRL values for Kerma-area product (<i>P</i><sub>KA</sub>), air kerma at patient entrance reference point (<i>K<sub>a,r</sub></i>), fluoroscopy time (FT), and PSD were stratified, respectively, for 14 clinical parameters in PCI, 10 in CTO, and four in TAVI.

38506540,"Interventional Imaging Systems in Radiology, Cardiology, and Urology: Energy Consumption, Carbon Emissions, and Electricity Costs.","<b>BACKGROUND.</b> The energy demand of interventional imaging systems has historically been estimated using manufacturer-provided specifications rather than directly measured. <b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to investigate the energy consumption of interventional imaging systems and estimate potential savings in the carbon emissions and electricity costs of such systems through hypothetical operational adjustments. <b>METHODS.</b> An interventional radiology suite, neurointerventional suite, radiology fluoroscopy unit, two cardiology laboratories, and two urology fluoroscopy units were equipped with power sensors. Power measurement logs were extracted for a single 4-week period for each radiology and cardiology system (all between June 1, 2022, and November 28, 2022) and for the 2-week period from July 31, 2023, to August 13, 2023, for each urology system. Power statuses, procedure time stamps, and fluoroscopy times were extracted from various sources. System activity was divided into off, idle (no patient in room), active (patient in room for procedure), and net-imaging (active fluoroscopic image acquisition) states. Projected annual energy consumption was calculated. Potential annual savings in carbon emissions and electricity costs through hypothetical operational adjustments were estimated using published values for Switzerland. <b>RESULTS.</b> Across the seven systems, the mean power draw was 0.3-1.1, 0.7-7.4, 0.9-7.6, and 1.9-12.5 kW in the off, idle, active, and net-imaging states, respectively. Across systems, the off state, in comparison with the idle state, showed a decrease in the mean power draw of 0.2-6.9 kW (relative decrease, 22.2-93.2%). The systems had a combined projected annual energy consumption of 115,684 kWh (range, 3646-26,576 kWh per system). The systems' combined projected energy consumption occurring outside the net-imaging state accounted for 93.3% (107,978/115,684 kWh) of projected total energy consumption (range, 89.2-99.4% per system). A hypothetical operational adjustment whereby all systems would be switched from the idle state to the off state overnight and on weekends (versus being operated in idle mode 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) would yield the following potential annual savings: for energy consumption, 144,640 kWh; for carbon emissions, 18.6 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent; and for electricity costs, US$37,896. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Interventional imaging systems are energy intensive, having high consumption outside of image acquisition periods. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT.</b> Strategic operational adjustments (e.g., powering down idle systems) can substantially decrease the carbon emissions and electricity costs of interventional imaging systems.",AJR.

34864692,The impact of neonatologist performed echocardiography in an Italian neonatal unit.,"The main goal of neonatologist performed echocardiography is to timely assess hemodynamic changes in order to properly manage unsteady neonates. Detailed structural heart assessment remains the domain of pediatric cardiologists. Nonetheless, many neonatologists take on an additional role in diagnosis of congenital heart defects, mostly compelled by the lack of in-house pediatric cardiology services. The experience of neonatologist performed echocardiography in an Italian neonatal unit was reported and the risk benefit profile of this practice was discussed. We retrospectively reviewed the echocardiograms undertaken by the neonatologist on infants admitted to the neonatal unit and postnatal ward of the Hospital San Pio in Benevento, over a 2-year period. Details of scans and concordance between neonatologist and cardiologist were analyzed. A total of 160 echocardiographic studies were done by the neonatologist on 136 infants. The ECG was requested in a minority of infants. The most common reason for performing the echocardiogram was admission to the neonatal care unit. Around half of the echocardiograms were normal. The remaining scans resulted in functional and structural abnormalities, transitional changes, and doubtful findings. Cardiac anomalies were significantly more likely found in cases of echocardiograms performed for fetal indications. Only 28 patients were eventually referred to the cardiology services. The inter-rater agreement was satisfactory. The hemodynamic assessment of sick infants, as well as triaging and referral of neonates with structural heart diseases are valuable advantages of the echocardiography run by neonatologists.Collaboration with pediatric cardiologists and robust training and accreditation programs are essential to ensure safety and quality service.",Journal of neonatal-perinatal medicine,2022-,"Casani A, Tozzi N, Cocca F",3,1812,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
32247298,Impact of trainee involvement on patient radiation exposure and contrast volumes during invasive cardiac procedures.,"The impact of cardiology fellows (CFs) and interventional cardiology fellows (ICFs) on patient radiation and contrast exposure during diagnostic coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention is unknown. Between 2011 and 2014, 16,175 cases were retrospectively assessed involving 27 CFs, 22 ICFs and 24 staff as primary operators. During diagnostic coronary angiography, ICFs administered the lowest radiation dose (5,648±5,523 cGy*cm2; 1.30 ± 1.27 mSv)-achieving 22% less radiation than the staff (6,889±4,294 cGy*cm2; 1.58 ± 0.99 mSv) and 36% less than CFs (7,700±6,751 cGy*cm2; 1.77 ± 1.55 mSv) (p<0.01). When adjusted for access site, CFs administered more radiation than either the ICFs or staff. However, differences between ICFs and staff were exclusively observed during transradial procedures (p<0.01). With regards to contrast administration, ICFs administered less contrast (126.3 ± 57.6 mL) than either CFs (130±52.4 mL) or staff (132.7±47.6 mL) (p<0.01)-again, a finding isolated to the transradial cohort. Of the 6,751 percutaneous coronary intervention cases, no significant differences existed between the ICFs or staff cardiologists in patient radiation exposure-but a CF as the primary operator resulted in an 18% increase in radiation exposure. Notably, contrast use was not different amongst the types of operators (p<0.05). In conclusion, having a cardiology fellow as primary operator during invasive cardiac procedures increases patient radiation exposure and minimally increases contrast administration. Strategies to minimize patient radiation exposure while maintaining trainee involvement should be evaluated.",Clinical and investigative medicine.

34228476,Incorporating SGLT2i and GLP-1RA for Cardiovascular and Kidney Disease Risk Reduction: Call for Action to the Cardiology Community.,"Multiple sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) have been shown to impart significant cardiovascular and kidney benefits, but are underused in clinical practice. Both SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA were first studied as glucose-lowering drugs, which may have impeded uptake by cardiologists in the wake of proven cardiovascular efficacy. Their significant effect on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, which are largely independent of glucose-lowering effects, must drive a broader use of these drugs. Cardiologists are 3 times more likely than endocrinologists to see patients with both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, thus they are ideally positioned to share responsibility for SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA treatment with primary care providers. In order to increase adoption, SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA must be reframed as primarily cardiovascular and kidney disease risk-reducing agents with a side effect of glucose-lowering. Coordinated and multifaceted interventions engaging clinicians, patients, payers, professional societies, and health systems must be implemented to incentivize the adoption of these medications as part of routine cardiovascular and kidney care.

Unlike cardiovascular conditions with a narrow referral pathway (e.g., acute coronary syndrome), AF may be first detected by a wide range of specialties (often noncardiology) or a general practitioner. Since timely initiated optimal management is essential for the prevention of AF-related complications, a concise and simple guidance is essential for practitioners managing AF patients, regardless of their specialty. Guideline-adherent management of patients with AF has been shown to translate to improved patient outcomes compared with guideline-nonadherent treatment. To facilitate guideline implementation in routine clinical practice, a good guideline document on AF should introduce only evidence-based new recommendations, while avoiding arbitrary changes, which may be confusing to practitioners.

Despite many technological advancements, CXR interpretation error rates have remained constant for decades. The application of machine learning has the potential to substantially improve clinical workflow efficiency, pathology detection accuracy, error rates and clinical decision making in cardiology. To date, machine learning has been developed to improve image processing, facilitate pathology detection, optimize the clinical workflow, and facilitate risk stratification. This review explores the current and potential future applications of machine learning for chest radiography to facilitate clinical decision making in cardiology.

32404302,EAPCI Position Statement on Invasive Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to healthcare worldwide. The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment. The transmission of the disease poses a risk to both patients and healthcare workers. The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions. This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe. Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge. Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described. In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries. Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,2020-Jun,"Chieffo A, Stefanini GG, Price S, Barbato E, Tarantini G, Karam N, Moreno R, Buchanan GL, Gilard M, Halvorsen S, Huber K, James S, Neumann FJ, Möllmann H, Roffi M, Tavazzi G, Ferré JM, Windecker S, Dudek D, Baumbach A",20,1727,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
32419096,Pediatric Cardiology Specialist's Opinions Toward the Acceptability of Comfort Care for Congenital Heart Disease.,"In order to evaluate physicians' willingness to seek legal action to mandate surgery when parents refuse surgery for various congenital heart lesions, we surveyed pediatric cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons at 4 children's hospitals. We asked whether physicians would support parental refusal of surgery for specific heart defects and, if not, whether they would seek legal action to mandate surgery. We then analyzed associations between physicians' willingness to mandate surgery and national operative mortality rates for each lesion. We surveyed 126 cardiologists and 9 cardiac surgeons at four tertiary referral centers. Overall response rate was 77%. Greater than 70% of physicians would seek legal action and mandate surgery for the following lesions: ventricular septal defect, coarctation of the aorta, complete atrioventricular canal, transposition of the great arteries, tetralogy of Fallot, and unobstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous return. Surgery for all of these lesions has reported mortality rates of < 5%. Physicians were less likely to seek legal action when parents refused surgery for Shone complex, any single ventricle lesion, or any congenital heart disease accompanied by Trisomy 13 or Trisomy 18. Among experts in pediatric cardiology, there is widespread agreement about the appropriate response to parental refusal of surgery for most congenital heart lesions, and these lesions tended to be heart defects with lower surgical mortality rates. Lesions for which there was greater consensus among experts were those with the best outcomes. There was less consensus for lesions with higher mortality rates. Such surveys, revealing disagreement among expert professionals, can provide an operational definition of the current professional ""gray zone"" in which parental preferences should determine treatment.",Pediatric cardiology,2020-Aug,"Swanson TM, Patel A, Baxter AJ, Morris SA, Maskatia SA, Lantos JD",6,1848,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
34052015,How the COVID-19 Pandemic Has Affected Cardiology Fellow Training.,"With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, resources have been reallocated and elective cases have been deferred to minimize the spread of the disease, altering the workflow of cardiac catheterization laboratories across the country. This has in turn affected the training experience of cardiology fellows, including diminished procedure numbers and a narrow breadth of cases as they approach the end of their training before joining independent practice. It has also taken a toll on the emotional well-being of fellows as they see their colleagues, loved ones, patients or even themselves struggling with COVID-19, with some succumbing to it. The aim of this opinion piece is to focus attention on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fellows and their training, challenges faced as they transition to practicing in the real world in the near future and share the lessons learned thus far.

35763772,Using co-creation to develop a cardiology online open course: an effective approach for implementing digital learning.,"we developed a massive online open course (MOOC) through co-creation between medical students and academic staff on heart semeiotics and evaluated its teaching efficiency and user satisfaction. ""The Heart, Its Signs and Symptoms"" was a MOOC aimed to teach medical students to collect clinical history and perform physical examination of patients presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, or syncope. It consisted of 4 interactive cases with preliminary, interim and final evaluation tests. A group of medical students, with the supervision of a multidisciplinary team of University professors residents, health management and informatics researchers developed the MOOC. Users (n = 701) registered to the online platform over 1 month. Students from 34 of the 40 Italian medical faculties participated. 96% of those who started the online course completed at least one of the 4 modules. Among users completing both the preliminary test and the final exam (n = 239, 34% of those registered to the online platform), the percentage of subjects passing the evaluation test raised s from 74% to 95% after the course. Younger age, attendance of Universities in Southern Italy, and a lower number of correct answers during the pre-test predicted a greater increase in the number of correct answers; Almost all participants who provided a feedback (n = 238) felt satisfied by the course. Partnership of medical students and academic staff was a key asset for the success of the initiative.

38769338,Development of a neonatal cardiac curriculum for neonatal-perinatal medicine fellowship training.,"The topic of neonatal cardiovascular care in neonatal-perinatal medicine (NPM) fellowship training has continued to transform due to increased complexity of patients, development of specialized units, continued Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements, and clinical practice variation across centers that care for neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD). We developed a neonatal cardiac curriculum comprised of eight interactive sessions with novel active learning concepts specific to our NPM fellows. A self-assessment survey in comfort in managing infants with CHD and perceived competency in neonatal cardiology topics was performed by all neonatology fellows at baseline and after completion of the curriculum. The American Board of Pediatrics Subspecialty In-training Exam (SITE) scores for fellows were compared to that of the national average. The average comfort score (0-100) of the first-year fellows increased from 33 to 76, and that of the second and third-year fellows increased from 72 to 86, and 75 to 86, respectively. The first-year fellows improved their competency score by 44 points (3 standard deviations), the second-year fellows improved their score by about 26 points (one standard deviation), and there was an overall 9-point increase in the competency score of all fellows (one standard deviation). The average local SITE score was lower than the national average before the initiation of this curriculum, became nearly equal to the national average score at the end of the first year the curriculum was implemented, and has progressively become higher since then.

31592719,Implementing Artificial Intelligence and Digital Health in Resource-Limited Settings? Top 10 Lessons We Learned in Congenital Heart Defects and Cardiology.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the key drivers of digital health. Digital health and AI applications in medicine and biology are emerging worldwide, not only in resource-rich but also resource-limited regions. AI predates to the mid-20th century, but the current wave of AI builds in part on machine learning (ML), big data, and algorithms that can learn from massive amounts of online user data from patients or healthy persons. There are lessons to be learned from AI applications in different medical specialties and across developed and resource-limited contexts. A case in point is congenital heart defects (CHDs) that continue to plague sub-Saharan Africa, which calls for innovative approaches to improve risk prediction and performance of the available diagnostics. Beyond CHDs, AI in cardiology is a promising context as well. The current suite of digital health applications in CHD and cardiology include complementary technologies such as neural networks, ML, natural language processing and deep learning, not to mention embedded digital sensors. Algorithms that build on these advances are beginning to complement traditional medical expertise while inviting us to redefine the concepts and definitions of expertise in molecular diagnostics and precision medicine. We examine and share here the lessons learned in current attempts to implement AI and digital health in CHD for precision risk prediction and diagnosis in resource-limited settings. These top 10 lessons on AI and digital health summarized in this expert review are relevant broadly beyond CHD in cardiology and medical innovations. As with AI itself that calls for systems approaches to data capture, analysis, and interpretation, both developed and developing countries can usefully learn from their respective experiences as digital health continues to evolve worldwide.",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,2020-May,"Thomford NE, Bope CD, Agamah FE, Dzobo K, Owusu Ateko R, Chimusa E, Mazandu GK, Ntumba SB, Dandara C, Wonkam A",10,1858,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
33227940,Simulation and Improvement of Patients' Workflow in Heart Clinics during COVID-19 Pandemic Using Timed Coloured Petri Nets.,"The COVID-19 epidemic has spread across the world within months and creates multiple challenges for healthcare providers. Patients with cardiovascular disease represent a vulnerable population when suffering from COVID-19. Most hospitals have been facing difficulties in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, and there is a need to minimise patient flow time so that staff health is less endangered, and more patients can be treated. This article shows how to use simulation techniques to prepare hospitals for a virus outbreak. The initial simulation of the current processes of the heart clinic first identified the bottlenecks. It confirmed that the current workflow is not optimal for COVID-19 patients; therefore, to reduce waiting time, three optimisation scenarios are proposed. In the best situation, the discrete-event simulation of the second scenario led to a 62.3% reduction in patient waiting time. This is one of the few studies that show how hospitals can use workflow modelling using timed coloured Petri nets to manage healthcare systems in practice. This technique would be valuable in these challenging times as the health of staff, and other patients are at risk from the nosocomial transmission.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020-Nov,"Zeinalnezhad M, Chofreh AG, Goni FA, Klemeš JJ, Sari E",5,1214,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Under the auspice of the Clinical Practice Guideline Quality Indicator Committee of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), the Working Group for cardiac pacing QIs was formed. The Group comprised Task Force members of the 2021 ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines on Cardiac Pacing and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy, members of the European Heart Rhythm Association, international cardiac device experts, and patient representatives. We followed the ESC methodology for QI development, which involved (i) the identification of the key domains of care by constructing a conceptual framework of the management of patients receiving cardiac pacing, (ii) the development of candidate QIs by conducting a systematic review of the literature, (iii) the selection of the final set of QIs using a modified-Delphi method, and (iv) the evaluation of the feasibility of the developed QIs. Four domains of care were identified: (i) structural framework, (ii) patient assessment, (iii) pacing strategy, and (iv) clinical outcomes. In total, seven main and four secondary QIs were selected across these domains and were embedded within the 2021 ESC Guidelines on Cardiac Pacing and Cardiac Resynchronization therapy. By way of a standardized process, 11 QIs for cardiac pacing were developed. These indicators may be used to quantify adherence to guideline-recommended clinical practice and have the potential to improve the care and outcomes of patients receiving cardiac pacemakers.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",2022-Jan,"Aktaa S, Abdin A, Arbelo E, Burri H, Vernooy K, Blomström-Lundqvist C, Boriani G, Defaye P, Deharo JC, Drossart I, Foldager D, Gold MR, Johansen JB, Leyva F, Linde C, Michowitz Y, Kronborg MB, Slotwiner D, Steen T, Tolosana JM, Tzeis S, Varma N, Glikson M, Nielsen JC, Gale CP",25,1602,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
38658906,Utility of RAND/UCLA appropriateness method in validating multiple-choice questions on ECG.,"This study aimed to investigate the utility of the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method (RAM) in validating expert consensus-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) on electrocardiogram (ECG). According to the RAM user's manual, nine panelists comprising various experts who routinely handle ECGs were asked to reach a consensus in three phases: a preparatory phase (round 0), an online test phase (round 1), and a face-to-face expert panel meeting (round 2). In round 0, the objectives and future timeline of the study were elucidated to the nine expert panelists with a summary of relevant literature. In round 1, 100 ECG questions prepared by two skilled cardiologists were answered, and the success rate was calculated by dividing the number of correct answers by 9. Furthermore, the questions were stratified into ""Appropriate,"" ""Discussion,"" or ""Inappropriate"" according to the median score and interquartile range (IQR) of appropriateness rating by nine panelists. In round 2, the validity of the 100 ECG questions was discussed in an expert panel meeting according to the results of round 1 and finally reassessed as ""Appropriate,"" ""Candidate,"" ""Revision,"" and ""Defer."" In round 1 results, the average success rate of the nine experts was 0.89. Using the median score and IQR, 54 questions were classified as "" Discussion."" In the expert panel meeting in round 2, 23% of the original 100 questions was ultimately deemed inappropriate, although they had been prepared by two skilled cardiologists. Most of the 46 questions categorized as ""Appropriate"" using the median score and IQR in round 1 were considered ""Appropriate"" even after round 2 (44/46, 95.7%).

39159709,Evaluating ChatGPT platform in delivering heart failure educational material: A comparison with the leading national cardiology institutes.,"Patient education plays a crucial role in improving the quality of life for patients with heart failure. As artificial intelligence continues to advance, new chatbots are emerging as valuable tools across various aspects of life. One prominent example is ChatGPT, a widely used chatbot among the public. Our study aims to evaluate the readability of ChatGPT answers for common patients' questions about heart failure. We performed a comparative analysis between ChatGPT responses and existing heart failure educational materials from top US cardiology institutes. Validated readability calculators were employed to assess and compare the reading difficulty and grade level of the materials. Furthermore, blind assessment using The Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) was done by four advanced heart failure attendings to evaluate the readability and actionability of each resource. Our study revealed that responses generated by ChatGPT were longer and more challenging to read compared to other materials. Additionally, these responses were written at a higher educational level (undergraduate and 9-10th grade), similar to those from the Heart Failure Society of America. Despite achieving a competitive PEMAT readability score (75 %), surpassing the American Heart Association score (68 %), ChatGPT's actionability score was the lowest (66.7 %) among all materials included in our study. Despite its current limitations, artificial intelligence chatbots has the potential to revolutionize the field of patient education especially given theirs ongoing improvements.

This study examines whether waiting room-based CV education could complement CV care. A 2:1 randomised clinical trial of patients in waiting rooms of hospital cardiology clinics. Intervention participants received a series of tablet-delivered CV educational videos and were randomised 1:1 to receive another video on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or no extra video. Control received usual care. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants reporting high motivation to improve CV risk-modifying behaviours (physical activity, diet and blood pressure monitoring) post-clinic. clinic satisfaction, CV lifestyle risk factors (RFs) and confidence to perform CPR. Assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. Among 514 screened, 330 were randomised (n=220 intervention, n=110 control) between December 2018 and March 2020, mean age 53.8 (SD 15.2), 55.2% male. Post-clinic, more intervention participants reported high motivation to improve CV risk-modifying behaviours: 29.6% (64/216) versus 18.7% (20/107), relative risk (RR) 1.63 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.55). Intervention participants reported higher clinic satisfaction RR: 2.19 (95% CI 1.45 to 3.33). Participants that received the CPR video (n=110) reported greater confidence to perform CPR, RR 1.61 (95% CI 1.20 to 2.16). Overall, the proportion of participants reporting optimal CV RFs increased between baseline and 30-day follow-up (16.1% vs 24.8%, OR=2.44 (95% CI 1.38 to 4.49)), but there was no significant between-group difference at 30 days.

Wherever no new data have been introduced with respect to the 2013 publication, please refer to the previous version. This document is intended to complement recent European and American guidelines but an important difference should be noted. The European and American guidelines indicate good practice for people engaging in physical activity at various levels, not only at the competitive level. In contrast, the COCIS guidelines refer specifically to competitive athletes in various sports including those with high cardiovascular stress. This explains why Italian guidelines are more restrictive than European and USA ones.

38616006,Palliative Care Education in Cardiovascular Disease Fellowships: A National Survey of Program Directors.,"Palliative care (PC) is an essential component of high-quality care for people with cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, little is known about the current state of PC education in CVD training, including attitudes toward integration of PC into training and implementation of PC by the program's leadership. We developed a nationwide, cross-sectional survey that queried education approaches, perspectives and barriers to PC education in general CVD fellowship training. The survey was distributed to 392 members of the American College of Cardiology Program Director (PD) listserv, representing 290 general CVD fellowships between 1/2023 and 4/2023. We performed descriptive and ꭕ<sup>2</sup> analyses of survey data. Of the program's representatives, 56 completed the survey (response rate = 19.3%). Respondents identified themselves as current PDs (89%), associate PDs (8.9%) or former PDs (1.8%), representing a diverse range of program sizes and types and regions of the country. Respondents reported the use of informal bedside teaching (88%), formal didactics (59%), online or self-paced modules (13%), in-person simulation (11%), and clinical rotations (16%) to teach PC content. Most programs covered PC topics at least annually, although there was variability by topic. We found no associations between program demographics and type or frequency of PC education. Most respondents reported dissatisfaction with the quantity (62%) or quality (59%) of the PC education provided. Barriers to PC education included an overabundance of other content to cover (36%) and perceived lack of fellow (20%) or faculty (18%) interest. Comments demonstrated the importance of PC education in fellowship, the lack of a requirement to provide PC education, difficulty in covering all topics, and suggestions of how PC skills should be taught. In a national survey of CVD educational leadership concerning approaches to PC education in CVD training, respondents highlighted both challenges to implementation of formal PC curricula in cardiology training and opportunities for comprehensive PC education.",Journal of cardiac failure,2024-Dec,"Godfrey S, Steiner JM, Damluji AA, Sampath R, Chuzi S, Warraich H, Krishnaswami A, Bernacki G, Goodlin S, Josephson R, Mulrow J, Doherty C",12,2096,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
33973513,Hybrid Coronary Revascularization: Perspective Current State After 25 Years of Start.,"Hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) represents a minimally invasive revascularization strategy in which the durability of the internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery graft is combined with percutaneous coronary intervention to treat remaining lesions. It first was introduced in the mid-1990s and aspired to bring together the ""best of both worlds"" - the excellent patency rates and survival benefits associated with the durable left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending artery alongside the good patency rates of drug-eluting stents, which outlive saphenous vein grafts to non-left anterior descending vessels. Although in theory this is a very attractive revascularization strategy, several years later, only small randomized controlled trials comparing HCR with coronary artery bypass grafting has recently emerged in the medical literature, raising concerns regarding HCR's role.

32297597,Comparison of Multiple Quantitative Evaluation Indices of Theoretical Knowledge and Clinical Practice Skills and Training of Medical Interns in Cardiovascular Imaging Using Blended Teaching and the Case Resource Network Platform (CRNP).,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to compare multiple quantitative evaluation indices of levels of theoretical knowledge and clinical practice skills in training medical interns in cardiovascular imaging based on the use of the blended teaching (BT) online artificial intelligence (AI) case resource network platform (CRNP), including time and frequency indices and effectiveness of the CRNP. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 110 medical interns who were divided into the routine teaching (RT) group (n=55) and the blended teaching (BT) group (n=55). The two were assessed using the mini-clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX) that assessed clinical skills, attitudes, and behaviors and using an objective written questionnaire. The following four indices were compared between the RT and BT groups: the X-ray score (XS), the computed tomography angiography (CTA) score (CS), the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) score (MS), and the average score (AS). Seven assessment indicators included: the imaging description (ID), the qualitative diagnosis (QD), the differential diagnosis (DD), examination preparation (EP), interview skill (IS), position display (PD), and human care (HC). Indicators of CRNP use included: number of times (TN), average duration (AD), single maximum duration (SMD), and total duration (TD). RESULTS AS significantly correlated with AD (rAD=0.761) and TD (rTD=0.754), and showed moderate correlation with TN (rTN=0.595), but weak correlation with SMD (rSMD=0.404).

Yet, quantifying training load remains challenging due to the complexity of its components (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type [FITT]). In this systematic review we evaluate how training load has been quantified in sports cardiology studies and provide recommendations for how this can be improved. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed and EMBASE up to October 2024. Studies involving ""sports cardiology,"" ""training load,"" and ""endurance sport"" were included. Data extraction included study characteristics, training load assessment methods, cardiovascular outcomes, and athlete profiles. A total of 62 studies with 1,060,700 participants were included in our review. The majority of studies (59.7%) focused on exercise-induced cardiac remodelling, with other topics being cardiac arrhythmias (12.9%), cardiac autonomic adaptation (3.2%), exercise dose-response (6.5%), and coronary heart disease (17.7%). Training load was primarily quantified by questionnaires (58.1%), whereas heart rate monitoring, a more objective measure, was used in only 1.6% of the studies. All studies reported exercise type, but only 19.4% measured all FITT components. There is a lack of uniformity in the assessment of key FITT variables to quantify training load within the field of sports cardiology, with many studies relying on subjective or incomplete methods. As cardiology moves into the precision medicine era, researchers and clinicians should seek to obtain objective training load information from their athletes according to the FITT framework, and data from use of objective wearable devices represent the optimal way to do this.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-Mar,"Dausin C, Tironi RM, Cornelissen V, Hespel P, Willems R, Haykowsky M, La Gerche A, Claessen G, Foulkes S",9,1766,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
35142829,Hospital Characteristics and Early Enrollment Trends in the American College of Cardiology Voluntary Public Reporting Program.,"Limited data exist regarding the characteristics of hospitals that do and do not participate in voluntary public reporting programs. To describe hospital characteristics and trends associated with early participation in the American College of Cardiology (ACC) voluntary reporting program for cardiac catheterization-percutaneous coronary intervention (CathPCI) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) registries. This cross-sectional study analyzed enrollment trends and characteristics of hospitals that did and did not participate in the ACC voluntary public reporting program. All hospitals reporting procedure data to the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) CathPCI or ICD registries that were eligible for the public reporting program from July 2014 (ie, program launch date) to May 2017 were included. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify hospital characteristics associated with voluntary participation. Enrollment trends were evaluated considering the date US News & World Report (USNWR) announced that it would credit participating hospitals. Data analysis was performed from March 2017 to January 2018. Hospital characteristics and participation in the public reporting program. By May 2017, 561 of 1747 eligible hospitals (32.1%) had opted to participate in the program. Enrollment increased from 240 to 376 hospitals (56.7%) 1 month after the USNWR announcement that program participation would be considered as a component of national hospital rankings. Compared with hospitals that did not enroll, program participants had increased median (IQR) procedural volumes for PCI (481 [280-764] procedures vs 332 [186-569] procedures; P < .001) and ICD (114 [56-220] procedures vs 62 [25-124] procedures; P < .001). Compared with nonparticipating hospitals, an increased mean (SD) proportion of participating hospitals adhered to composite discharge medications after PCI (0.96 [0.03] vs 0.92 [0.07]; P < .001) and ICD (0.88 [0.10] vs 0.81 [0.12]; P < .001). Hospital factors associated with enrollment included participation in 5 or more NCDR registries (odds ratio [OR],1.98; 95% CI, 1.24-3.19; P = .005), membership in a larger hospital system (ie, 3-20 hospitals vs ≤2 hospitals in the system: OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.65-3.17; P = .001), participation in an NCDR pilot public reporting program of PCI 30-day readmissions (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 2.19-3.91; P < .001), university affiliation (vs government affiliation: OR, 3.85, 95% CI, 1.03-14.29; P = .045; vs private affiliation: OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.35-3.57; P < .001), Midwest location (vs South: OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.06-2.08; P = .02), and increased comprehensive quality ranking (4 vs 1-2 performance stars in CathPCI: OR, 8.08; 95% CI, 5.07-12.87; P < .001; 4 vs 1 performance star in ICD: OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.48-3.44; P < .001) (C statistic = 0.829).

We sought to evaluate the validity of using a subjective scoring system to assess the accuracy of ECG interpretations submitted by pediatric cardiology fellows, trainees, and faculty to the Pediatric ECG Review (pECGreview), a web-based ECG interpretation training program. We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional study of responses submitted to pECGreview. ECG interpretations were assessed independently by four individuals with a range of experience. Accuracy was assessed using a 3-point scale: 100% for generally correct interpretations, 50% for over- or underdiagnosis of minor ECG abnormalities, and 0% for over- or underdiagnosis of major ECG abnormalities. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using expanded Bland-Altman plots, Pearson correlation coefficients, and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC). 1460 ECG interpretations by 192 participants were analyzed. 107 participants interpreted at least five ECGs. The mean accuracy score was 76.6 ± 13.7%. Participants were correct in 66.1 ± 5.1%, had minor over- or underdiagnosis in 21.5 ± 4.6% and major over- or underdiagnosis in 12.3 ± 3.9% of interpretations. Validation of agreement between evaluators demonstrated limits of agreement of 11.3%. Inter-rater agreement exhibited consistent patterns (all correlations ≥ 0.75). Absolute agreement was 0.74 (95% CI 0.69-0.80), and average measures agreement was 0.92 (95% CI 0.89-0.94).

This study aimed to evaluate the use of the data and results from the challenge for detection of AF in longer ECGs, taken from three other PhysioNet datasets. The used data-driven models were based on features extracted from ECG recordings, calculated according to three solutions from the challenge. A Random Forest classifier was trained with the data from the challenge. The performance was evaluated on all non-overlapping 30 s segments in all recordings from three MIT-BIH datasets. Fifty-six models were trained using different feature sets, both before and after applying three feature reduction techniques. Based on rhythm annotations, the AF proportion was 0.00 in the MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm (N = 46083 segments), 0.10 in the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia (N = 2880), and 0.41 in the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation (N = 28104) dataset. For the best performing model, the corresponding detected proportions of AF were 0.00, 0.11 and 0.36 using all features, and 0.01, 0.10 and 0.38 when using the 15 best performing features. The results obtained on the MIT-BIH datasets indicate that the training data and solutions from the 2017 Physionet/Cinc Challenge can be useful tools for developing robust AF detectors also in longer ECG recordings, even when using a low number of carefully selected features. The use of feature selection allows significantly reducing the number of features while preserving the classification performance, which can be important when building low-complexity AF classifiers on ECG devices with constrained computational and energy resources.",Biomedical physics & engineering express,2020-Feb,"Kleyko D, Osipov E, Wiklund U",3,1680,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

38198766,Cardiovascular multimodality imaging in women: a scientific statement of the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging of the European Society of Cardiology.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) represent an important cause of mortality and morbidity in women. It is now recognized that there are sex differences regarding the prevalence and the clinical significance of the traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors as well as the pathology underlying a range of CVDs. Unfortunately, women have been under-represented in most CVD imaging studies and trials regarding diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics. There is therefore a clear need for further investigation of how CVD affects women along their life span. Multimodality CV imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis of CVD in women as well as in prognosis, decision-making, and monitoring of therapeutics and interventions. However, multimodality imaging in women requires specific consideration given the differences in CVD between the sexes. These differences relate to physiological changes that only women experience (e.g. pregnancy and menopause) as well as variation in the underlying pathophysiology of CVD and also differences in the prevalence of certain conditions such as connective tissue disorders, Takotsubo, and spontaneous coronary artery dissection, which are all more common in women.

This provides challenges for the use of secondary prevention measures in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this Position Statement is to review the implications for effective delivery of secondary prevention strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced limitations for many patients to access standard health services such as visits to health care professionals, medications, imaging and blood tests as well as attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. In addition, the pandemic is having an impact on lifestyle habits and mental health. Taken together, this has the potential to adversely impact the ability of practitioners and patients to adhere to treatment guidelines for the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events. Every effort should be made to deliver safe, ongoing access to health care professionals and the use of evidenced based therapies in individuals with CVD. An increase in use of a range of electronic health platforms has the potential to transform secondary prevention.

An online survey was emailed to all APIC members, between August and November 2021. The questionnaire consisted of 50 questions focusing on knowledge and measures of IR protection in the catheterization laboratory. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. From a response rate of 46.9%, the study obtained a total sample of 159 responses (156 selected for analysis). Most survey respondents (66.0%) were unaware of the radiation exposure category, and only 60.4% reported systematically using a dosimeter. A large majority (90.4%) employed techniques to minimize exposure to radiation. All participants used personal protective equipment, despite eyewear protection only being used frequently by 49.2% of main operators. Ceiling suspended shields and table protectors were often used. Only two-thirds were familiar with the legally established limit on radiation doses for workers or the dose that should trigger patient follow-up. Most of the survey respondents had a non-certified training in IR procedures and only 32.0% had attended their yearly occupational health consultation. Safety methods and protective equipment are largely adopted among interventional cardiologists, who have shown some IR awareness.

35050949,Patient Pathways in Cardiology: Should Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Companies Care?,"A shared goal of patients, providers, and the companies that produce new therapies is to have these therapies used according to guidelines. Health services specialize in patient care and may lack the capabilities to take a product from conception through to everyday use. This results in a mutually beneficial relationship between health services and industry. The market for cardiovascular drugs is significant, which results in competition between companies. While traditional methods of observational analysis may be able to determine to what extent drugs and devices are being prescribed or implanted by health providers, there is less real-world patient level insight as to why patients are taking (or not taking) these treatments and why one agent is chosen over another. Considering patient pathways is a novel approach that can be utilized to understand real-world patient activities. This approach focuses on the patient flow across the healthcare system and barriers at each stage including identification of patients, diagnostic testing, the decisions on treatment, and prescribing can help identify ways of improving the utilization based on guidelines. It overcomes several assumptions related to patient and clinician decision-making and practical considerations such as geography and availability of health services. In this article, we introduce the concept of patient pathways and why considering them maybe of interest to companies. As significant resources are invested to bring a product to market, this approach can help define if there are missed opportunities for their products to be utilized and potential barriers to implementation.",Critical pathways in cardiology,2022-Mar,"Kwok CS, Muntean EA, Foster W, Mallen CD",4,1658,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

38880398,Canadian Cardiovascular Society Clinical Practice Update on Contemporary Management of the Patient With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"Numerous guidelines on the diagnosis and management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have been published, by learned societies, over the past decade. Although helpful they are often long and less adapted to nonexperts. This writing panel was challenged to produce a document that grew as much from years of practical experience as it did from the peer-reviewed literature. As such, rather than produce yet another set of guidelines, we aim herein to deliver a concentrate of our own experiential learning and distill for the reader the essence of effective and appropriate HCM care. This Clinical Practice Update on HCM is therefore aimed at general cardiologists and other cardiovascular practitioners rather than for HCM specialists. We set the stage with a description of the condition and its clinical presentation, discuss the central importance of ""obstruction"" and how to look for it, review the role of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, reflect on the appropriate use of genetic testing, review the treatment options for symptomatic HCM-crucially including cardiac myosin inhibitors, and deal concisely with practical issues surrounding risk assessment for sudden cardiac death, and management of the end-stage HCM patient. Uniquely, we have captured the pediatric experience on our panel to discuss appropriate differences in the management of younger patients with HCM. We ask the reader to remember that this document represents expert consensus opinion rather than dogma and to use their best judgement when dealing with the HCM patient in front of them.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2024-Sep,"Crean AM, Adler A, Arbour L, Chan J, Christian S, Cooper RM, Garceau P, Giraldeau G, Heydari B, Laksman Z, Mital S, Ong K, Overgaard C, Ruel M, Seifer CM, Ward MR, Tadros R",17,1572,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
38813819,Simulation-guided auscultatory training before graduation is associated with better auscultatory skills in residents.,"A growing body of scientific evidence shows that simulation-guided auscultatory training can significantly improve the skills of medical students. Nevertheless, it remains to be elucidated if this training has any long-term impact on auscultatory skills. We sought to ascertain whether there were differences in heart and lung auscultation among residents who received simulation-guided auscultatory training before graduation vs. those who did not. A total of 43 residents were included in the study; 20 of them entered into Cardiology specialty school (C) and 23 of them entered into Internal and Occupational Medicine specialty schools (M) at the University of Trieste. Based on the history of simulation-guided auscultatory training before graduation (yes = Y; no = N), four groups were formed: CY, CN, MY, and MN. Residents were evaluated in terms of their ability to recognize six heart and five lung sounds, which were reproduced in a random order with the Kyoto-Kagaku patient simulator. Associations between history of simulation training, specialty choice and auscultatory skills were evaluated with Kruskal-Wallis test and logistic regression analysis. Auscultatory skills of residents were associated with simulation-guided training before graduation, regardless of the specialty chosen. Simulation-guided training had a higher impact on residents in Medicine. Overall, heart and lung sounds were correctly recognized in 41% of cases. Logistic regression analysis showed that simulation-guided training was associated with recognition of aortic stenosis, S2 wide split, fine crackles, and pleural rubs. Specialty choice was associated with recognition of aortic stenosis as well as aortic and mitral regurgitation. History of simulation-guided auscultatory training was associated with better auscultatory performance in residents, regardless of the medical specialty chosen. Choice of Cardiology was associated with better scores in aortic stenosis as well as aortic and mitral regurgitation. Nevertheless, overall auscultatory proficiency was quite poor, which suggests that simulation-guided training may help but is probably still too short.","Journal of cardiovascular medicine (Hagerstown, Md.)",2024-Aug,"Bernardi S, Fabris B, Giudici F, Grillo A, Di Pierro G, Pellin L, Aleksova A, Larese Filon F, Sinagra G, Merlo M",10,2157,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

38864102,Cost Perception of Cardiological Procedures Among -Medical Students and Doctors in Switzerland.,"Aims: The aim of the present study was to analyze the cost awareness of cardiological tests and procedures among medical students, residents and doctors in Switzerland and discuss trends in cost perception in health expenditures. Methods: Using an online questionnaire, participants (randomly recruited by mailing lists, messaging app or via direct contact) had to estimate the costs of the 13 predefined cardiological procedures services, diagnostic tests and procedures in Swiss Francs (CHF). Short technical descriptions of the procedures and tests were provided. Estimated costs were considered accurate if they were within ±25 % of the reimbursement rate. Participant groups were defined: medical students, residents, hospital-based physicians and cardiologists in private practice (practitioners). Results: A total of 939 participants (172 physicians and 767 medical students) were enrolled. The overall proportion of medical gestures estimated correctly within ±25% of the reimbursement rate ranged from 10 % (students) to 55 % in practitioners. Residents (26 %) and hospital-based physicians (38 %) performed intermediately. In general, the costs were overestimated. Conclusions: The level of cost knowledge of cardiological tests and procedures among medical students, residents and doctors in Switzerland is modest. In general, the costs were overestimated. Increasing experience seems to sharpen the accuracy of cost estimation. Overestimation of costs is potentially problematic: Either in systems of governmental defined global budget or systems with substantial out-of-pocket costs for patients, overestimated costs will result in more restrictive ordering than it would be appropriate and affordable for the individual patient.",Praxis,2024-May,"Müller A, Melliger R, Biaggi P, Oechslin L, Wyss C",5,1742,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
38212100,Cardiogeriatrics: the current state of the art.,"It is estimated that by 2050, 17% of the world's population will be greater than 85 years old, which, combined with cardiovascular disease (CVD) being the leading cause of death and disability, sets an unprecedented burden on our health and care systems. This perfect storm will be accompanied by a rise in the prevalence of CVD due to increased survival of patients with pre-existing CVD and the incidence of CVD that is associated with the process of ageing. In this review, we will focus on the diagnosis and management of common CVD conditions in old age, namely: heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF) and valvular heart disease (VHD). Despite limited evidence, clinical guidelines are increasingly considering the complexity of management of these conditions in the older person, which often coexist, for example, AF and HF or CAD and VHD. Furthermore, they, in turn, need specific consideration in the context of comorbidities, polypharmacy, frailty and impaired cognition found in this age group. Hence, the emerging role of the geriatric cardiologist is therefore vital in performing comprehensive geriatric assessment, attending multidisciplinary team meetings and ultimately considering the patient and the sum of their diseases in their totality. There have been recent advances in CVD management but how we apply these to deliver integrated care to the elderly population is key. This review article aims to bring together emerging studies and guidelines on assessment and management of CVD in the elderly, summarising latest definitions, diagnostics, therapeutics and future challenges.",Heart (British Cardiac Society),2024-Jun,"Gaur A, Carr F, Warriner D",3,1637,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

We aimed to examine the impact of these unprecedented changes on the formal education of paediatric cardiology fellows through a nationwide survey. A REDCap™-based voluntary anonymous survey was sent to all current paediatric cardiology fellows in the United States of America in May, 2020. Of 143 respondents, 121 were categorical fellows, representing over one-fourth of all categorical paediatric cardiology fellows in the United States of America. Nearly all (140/143, 97.9%) respondents utilised online learning during the pandemic, with 134 (93.7%) reporting an increase in use compared to pre-pandemic. The percentage of respondents reporting curriculum supplementation with outside lectures increased from 11.9 to 88.8% during the pandemic. Respondents considered online learning to be ""equally or more effective"" than in-person lectures in convenience (133/142, 93.7%), improving fellow attendance (132/142, 93.0%), improving non-fellow attendance (126/143, 88.1%), and meeting individual learning needs (101/143, 70.6%). The pandemic positively affected the lecture curriculum of 83 respondents (58.0%), with 35 (24.5%) reporting no change and 25 (17.5%) reporting a negative effect. A positive effect was most noted by those whose programmes utilised supplemental outside lectures (62.2 versus 25.0%, p = 0.004) and those whose lecture frequency did not decrease (65.1 versus 5.9%, p < 0.001). Restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have greatly increased utilisation of online learning platforms by medical training programmes.

32251546,Triage considerations for patients referred for structural heart disease intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic: An ACC/SCAI position statement.,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has strained health care resources around the world, causing many institutions to curtail or stop elective procedures. This has resulted in an inability to care for patients with valvular and structural heart disease in a timely fashion, potentially placing these patients at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular complications, including CHF and death. The effective triage of these patients has become challenging in the current environment, as clinicians have had to weigh the risk of bringing susceptible patients into the hospital environment during the COVID-19 pandemic against the risk of delaying a needed procedure. In this document, the authors suggest guidelines for how to triage patients in need of structural heart disease interventions and provide a framework for how to decide when it may be appropriate to proceed with intervention despite the ongoing pandemic. In particular, the authors address the triage of patients in need of transcatheter aortic valve replacement and percutaneous mitral valve repair.

In this position statement, the Heart Failure Association aims to systematize the use of various imaging methods in accordance with the timeline of acute heart failure care proposed in the recent guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. During the first hours of admission the point-of-care focused cardiac and lung ultrasound examination is an invaluable tool for rapid differential diagnosis of acute dyspnoea, which is highly feasible and relatively easy to learn. Several portable and stationary imaging modalities are being increasingly used for the evaluation of cardiac structure and function, haemodynamic and volume status, precipitating myocardial ischaemia or valvular abnormalities, and systemic and pulmonary congestion. This paper emphasizes the central role of the full echocardiographic examination in the identification of heart failure aetiology, severity of cardiac dysfunction, indications for specific heart failure therapy, and risk stratification. Correct evaluation of cardiac filling pressures and accurate prognostication may help to prevent unscheduled short-term readmission. Alternative advanced imaging modalities should be considered to assist patient management in the pre- and post-discharge phase, including cardiac magnetic resonance, computed tomography, nuclear studies, and coronary angiography.

Adopting AUC into clinical workflows may present challenges, and there may be specific implementation strategies that are effective in promoting effective use of AUC. We sought to assess the effect of implementing AUC in clinical practice. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies found through a systematic search of the MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane, or CINAHL databases. Peer-reviewed manuscripts published after 2005 that reported on the implementation of AUC for a cardiovascular test or procedure were included. The main outcome was to determine if AUC implementation was associated with a reduction in inappropriate/rarely appropriate care. Of the 18 included studies, the majority used pre/post-cohort designs; few (n = 3) were randomized trials. Most studies used multiple strategies (n = 12, 66.7%). Education was the most common individual intervention strategy (n = 13, 72.2%), followed by audit and feedback (n = 8, 44.4%) and computerized physician order entry (n = 6, 33.3%). No studies reported on formal use of stakeholder engagement or 'nudges'. In meta-analysis, AUC implementation was associated with a reduction in inappropriate/rarely appropriate care (odds ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.49-0.78). Funnel plot suggests the possibility of publication bias. We found most published efforts to implement AUC observed reductions in inappropriate/rarely appropriate care. Studies rarely explored how or why the implementation strategy was effective. Because interventions were infrequently tested in isolation, it is difficult to make observations about their effectiveness as stand-alone strategies. PROSPERO 2018 CRD42018091602.

We evaluated the overall awareness regarding Ayurveda among patients attending two specialty clinics at a tertiary care institute. Methods We did a cross-sectional study on patients attending the cardiology and neurology clinics at a tertiary care hospital in India. We conducted this paper-based survey using a standardized, validated questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 14.2. Results Three hundred and ninety-seven patients agreed to participate in the study. Their mean (SD) age was 45.65 (15.02) years. Among them 68.5% were men and 56.9% were from urban areas. Participants perceived that Ayurveda comprised herbal drugs (77.6%), metallic/herbo-mineral preparations (44.3%), Panchakarma therapy (22.2%) and personalized medicine (37.8%). Principal sources of information were TV promotional programmes (34.7%) and newspaper advertisements (13.9%). Nearly two-thirds (63%) of participants opined that Ayurveda is effective in chronic disorders. Although only 9.1% of participants reported the use of Ayurvedic medicines, 89.2% believed it would be beneficial if the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi had Ayurveda services. Three-fourths (75.8%) of respondents were interested to participate in research studies integrating Ayurveda with modern medicine. Conclusion Imprecise knowledge and awareness towards Ayurveda appears to prevail in addition to the low practice among the patients surveyed.

This cross-sectional study evaluates the precision of ChatGPT-4 in interpreting multimodal images for paediatric cardiology knowledge assessment, including echocardiograms, angiograms, X-rays, and electrocardiograms. One hundred multiple-choice questions with accompanying images from the textbook <i>Pediatric Cardiology Board Review</i> were randomly selected. The chatbot was prompted to answer these questions with and without the accompanying images. Statistical analysis was done using <i>X</i><sup>2</sup>, Fisher's exact, and McNemar tests. Results showed that ChatGPT-4 answered 41% of questions with images correctly, performing best on those with electrocardiograms (54%) and worst on those with angiograms (29%). Without the images, ChatGPT-4's performance was similar at 37% (difference = 4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -9.4% to 17.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.56). The chatbot performed significantly better when provided the image of an electrocardiogram than without (difference = 18, 95% CI 4.0% to 31.9%, <i>p</i> < 0.04). In cases of incorrect answers, ChatGPT-4 was more inconsistent with an image than without (difference = 21%, 95% CI 3.5% to 36.9%, <i>p</i> < 0.02). In conclusion, ChatGPT-4 performed poorly in answering image-based multiple-choice questions in paediatric cardiology. Its accuracy in answering questions with images was similar to without, indicating limited multimodal image interpretation capabilities. Substantial training is required before clinical integration can be considered. Further research is needed to assess the clinical reasoning skills and progression of ChatGPT in paediatric cardiology for clinical and academic utility.",Cardiology in the young,2024-Nov,"Gritti MN, Prajapati R, Yissar D, Morgan CT",4,1883,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
31887781,Aspirin Therapy for Primary Prevention: The Case for Continuing Prescribing to Patients at High Cardiovascular Risk-A Review.,"Current evidence supports the use of low-dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention. By contrast, the benefit-to-risk ratio of aspirin use in primary prevention is debated: three contemporary randomized control trials have been conflicting, and meta-analyses have concluded for an unclear clinical benefit, based on the consideration that the reduction in thromboembolic events is counterbalanced by increased bleeding. The primary prevention setting is, however, a heterogeneous mix of subjects at highly variable cardiovascular risk. One possible explanation for the uncertainty of data interpretation is the progressive reduction in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in primary prevention that has accompanied global education programs, leading patients to smoke less, exercise more, and increasingly take lipid-lowering therapies. Based on a meta-regression of the benefits and harm of aspirin therapy in primary prevention as a function of the 10-year risk of MACE, we favor a nuanced approach still, however, based on the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, acknowledging differences between patients and emphasizing an individualized assessment of both benefits and harm. After optimal control of cardiovascular risk factors, and when patients are less than 70 years of age, clinicians should assess the risk of MACE and base decision on such stratification, considering the risk of bleeding and patient preferences. Clinicians would then advise the use of aspirin in primary prevention patients at the highest risk of MACE who do not have a prohibitive risk of bleeding, and in the majority of cases after initiation of properly titrated statin therapy.",Thrombosis and haemostasis,2020-Feb,"De Caterina R, Aimo A, Ridker PM",3,1688,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
39440939,Transformational learning and professional identity formation in postgraduate competency-based medical education.,"Residency programmes are in transition to a framework for competency-based medical education (CBME). The intersection of CBME with transformational learning (TL) experiences and professional identity formation (PIF) - particularly within senior learners in transitional states - is unknown but important to understand in order to develop and implement strategies to support trainees' professional development. Through inductive qualitative methods, we conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 22) of current trainees and recent graduates from adult cardiology residency training programmes within Canada to explore the impact of TL experiences on residents' professional growth and identity formation. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis informed by TL theory. CBME did not appear to influence trainees' experiences of disorienting dilemmas and TL. Important clinical encounters and interpersonal relationships - in particular, those between mentor and mentee - shaped trainees' professional development as cardiologists ('enabling factors' for TL and PIF). 'Imposter phenomenon' was widely prevalent in our sample study population even among graduates who had already completed their training. Requisite elements for transformation (disorienting dilemmas, critical reflection, discourse and action) also contributed to PIF. TL experiences influenced PIF in senior learners but infrequently intersected with CBME; these experiences were more commonly prompted by disorienting dilemmas relating to clinical outcomes or interpersonal interactions independent of CBME-specific architecture.",Medical education,2025-Apr,"Chow J, Al-Duaij L, Last N, Sheth U, Rehman M, Azim A, Khalid F, Blissett S, Sibbald M",9,1601,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
31907086,The patient encounter index: a novel method of measuring clinical workload in a paediatric cardiology service.,"Technological advances have led to better patient outcomes and the expansion of clinical services in paediatric cardiology. This expansion creates an ever-growing workload for clinicians, which has led to workflow and staffing issues that need to be addressed. The objective of this study was the development of a novel tool to measure the clinical workload of a paediatric cardiology service in Cape Town, South Africa: The patient encounter index is a tool designed to quantify clinical workload. It is defined as a ratio of the measured duration of clinical work to the total time available for such work. This index was implemented as part of a prospective cross-sectional study design. Clinical workload data were collected over a 10-day period using time-and-motion sampling. Clinicians were contractually expected to spend 50% of their daily workload on patient care. The median patient encounter index for the Western Cape Paediatric Cardiac Service was 0.81 (range 0.19-1.09), reflecting that 81% of total contractual working time was spent on clinical activities. This study describes the development and implementation of a novel tool for clinical workload quantification and describes its application to a busy paediatric cardiology service in Cape Town, South Africa. This tool prospectively quantifies clinical workload which may directly influence patient outcomes. Implementation of this novel tool in the described setting clearly demonstrated the excessive workload of the clinical service and facilitated effective motivation for improved allocation of resources.",Cardiology in the young,2020-Jan,"Harrison MJ, Barry OM, Hounsell RA, De Decker R",4,1582,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Here, the current medical and surgical applications of virtual reality are reviewed and the potential for future applications explored. Multiple centers have begun to develop software designed to bring virtual reality technology to bear on congenital heart disease. These efforts have focused on surgical preparation, on education of medical providers, and on preparation of patients and their family members for cardiac interventions. Though relatively little statistical evidence for benefit has been generated to date, those studies currently available suggest that virtual reality may provide a significant benefit in all three of these aspects of medical care. The immersive nature of virtual reality meshes well with the learning styles of adult practitioners and promises to be a powerful tool for both pediatric cardiologists and the patients with whose care they are entrusted.

33813599,High Acuity Therapy Variation Across Pediatric Acute Care Cardiology Units: Results from the Pediatric Acute Care Cardiology Collaborative Hospital Surveys.,"We utilized the multicenter Pediatric Acute Care Cardiology Collaborative (PAC<sup>3</sup>) 2017 and 2019 surveys to describe practice variation in therapy availability and changes over a 2-year period. A high acuity therapies (ATs) score was derived (1 point per positive response) from 44 survey questions and scores were compared to center surgical volume. Of 31 centers that completed the 2017 survey, 26 also completed the 2019 survey. Scores ranged from 11 to 34 in 2017 and 11 to 35 in 2019. AT scores in 2019 were not statistically different from 2017 scores (29/44, IQR 27-32.5 vs. 29.5/44, IQR 27-31, p = 0.9). In 2019, more centers reported initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and Bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) in Acute Care Cardiology Unit (ACCU) (19/26 vs. 4/26, p < 0.001) and permitting continuous CPAP/BiPAP (22/26 vs. 14/26, p = 0.034) compared to 2017. Scores in both survey years were significantly higher in the highest surgical volume group compared to the lowest, 33 ± 1.5 versus 25 ± 8.5, p = 0.046 and 32 ± 1.7 versus 23 ± 5.5, p = 0.009, respectively.

33277408,Sacred hearts and pumps: cardiology and the conflicted body politic (1500-1900).,"This article examines how conflicting notions of the body politic between the natural and the spiritual have contextualised the evolution of cardiology. After a brief look at the place of the heart in biblical, patristic and medieval notions of the church, the article turns to the Reformation period. While Martin Luther moved theological gravity to the individual's heart and conscience, his contemporary Michael Servetus described the pulmonary cycle in the context of an antitrinitarian theology condemned as theological and political heresy. In the early modern period, nature conceived as creation grounded sovereign political authority, which science could then align with. Whereas William Harvey still adhered to an Aristotelian teleology, René Descartes and subsequent mechanistic contributions to cardiology were flanked by an intense 'cardiolatry'. Both, it is argued, are two sides of the same, almost non-corporeal coin. The emerging Enlightened epistemology allowed for a position distinct from both sovereign and ecclesial powers. The French Revolution was a paradigm shift: the ancien régime falls, and its Sacred Heart devotion is mocked; the new 'Erastian' state-university emerges as the context of cardiology. These developments are reflected in the life of René Laënnec and in cultural interpretations of the heart later in the 19th century. It is shown that the heart as a doubly inscribed, both biological and spiritual organ, played a central role in theological, and therefore political and scientific notions of the body politic. These continue to haunt the present, allowing us to interpret normative appeals to the heart particularly in political contexts.",Medical humanities,2020-Dec,Feiler T,1,1684,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
34473044,Perceptions of Training Pathways from Recent Cardiothoracic Surgery Graduates.,"There are three cardiothoracic surgery (CTS) training pathways-general surgery residency followed by a CTS residency of 2-3 years (traditional), 4 years of general surgery and 3 years of CTS residency (4+3), and an integrated 6-year pathway (I-6). The goal of this study was to survey early career cardiothoracic surgeons regarding their training experiences. An email-based survey was sent to cardiothoracic surgeons, who graduated between 2012-2017. Data on training pathway specific variables and overall satisfaction were collected. The primary endpoints were career preparation and satisfaction, scored on a scale from 1-100, 100 being the most positive. Four hundred seventy-seven emails were sent, with a response rate of 95/477 (20%). Seventy-six of the respondents (80%) were male; the mean age was 39. Seventy-seven (81.0%) completed a traditional training pathway, 7 (7.4%) completed a 4+3 pathway, and 11 (11.6%) completed an I-6 pathway. Participants felt prepared for practice with a mean response of 79.8 (range 31-100); mean career satisfaction was 87.6.  When asked which pathway respondents would choose in the current era, 52 (54.7%) would choose a traditional pathway, 17 (17.9%) a 4+3 pathway, and 19 (20.0%) an I-6 program; 7 (7.4%) did not respond. Twenty of 72 (27.8%) traditional pathway trained and 18/18(100%) integrated pathway trained surgeons would choose an integrated pathway.

33133359,Paying for Performance Improvement in Quality and Outcomes of Cardiovascular Care: Challenges and Prospects.,"Over the past two decades, Medicare and other payers have been looking at ways to base payment for cardiovascular care on the quality and outcomes of care delivered. Public reporting of hospital performance on a series of quality measures began in 2004 with basic processes of care such as aspirin use and influenza vaccination, and it expanded in later years to include outcomes such as mortality and readmission rates. Following the passage of the Affordable Care Act in March 2010, Medicare and other payers moved forward with pay-for-performance programs, more commonly referred to as value-based purchasing (VBP) programs. These programs are largely based on an underlying fee-for-service payment infrastructure and give hospitals and clinicians bonuses or penalties based on their performance. Another new payment mechanism, called alternative payment models (APMs), aims to move towards episode-based or global payments to improve quality and efficiency. The two most relevant APMs for cardiovascular care include Accountable Care Organizations and bundled payments. Both VBP programs and APMs have challenges related to program efficacy, accuracy, and equity. In fact, despite over a decade of progress in measuring and incentivizing high-quality care delivery within cardiology, major limitations remain. Many of the programs have had little benefit in terms of clinical outcomes yet have led to marked administrative burden for participants. However, there are several encouraging prospects to aid the successful implementation of value-based high-quality cardiovascular care, such as more sophisticated data science to improve risk adjustment and flexible electronic health records to decrease administrative burden. Furthermore, payment models designed specifically for cardiovascular care could incentivize innovative care delivery models that could improve quality and outcomes for patients. This review provides an overview of current efforts, largely at the federal level, to pay for high-quality cardiovascular care and discusses the challenges and prospects related to doing so.",Methodist DeBakey cardiovascular journal,2020-,"Husaini M, Joynt Maddox KE",2,2096,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

The validation sample included all residents in our cardiology program (n = 19). Each resident was evaluated by 8 raters chosen by themselves, through a 4-point Likert scale. Validity was evaluated with factor analysis and reliability by analyzing internal consistency using the Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Feasibility was defined by a minimum of 80% of the raters responding the questionnaire. The factor analysis clearly identified five item groupings, similar to the theoretical attributes predefined in the original questionnaire, providing evidence of the validity of the Spanish version. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.92, indicating high internal consistency of the items included. All the evaluators proposed completed the electronic form (152 surveys) demonstrating feasibility to implement. This study provides evidence of reliability and validity of the Spanish version of the 360° feedback tool Mini-PAT performed in a cardiology residency program to assess global performance and humanistic qualities.","Education for health (Abingdon, England)",2020-,"Parodi JB, de Lima AA, Burgos LM, Gelpi RJ",4,1562,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Here, we consider how it will change daily practice for cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and healthcare professionals. Clinical evidence for any high-risk device must be reported by the manufacturer in a Summary of Safety and Clinical Performance (SSCP) that will be publicly available in the European Union Database on Medical Devices (Eudamed) maintained by the European Commission; this will facilitate evidence-based choices of which devices to recommend. Hospitals must record all device implantations, and each high-risk device will be trackable by Unique Device Identification (UDI). Important new roles are envisaged for clinicians, scientists, and engineers in EU Expert Panels-in particular to scrutinize clinical data submitted by manufacturers for certain high-risk devices and the evaluations of that data made by notified bodies. They will advise manufacturers on the design of their clinical studies and recommend to regulators when new technical specifications or guidance are needed. Physicians should support post-market surveillance by reporting adverse events and by contributing to comprehensive medical device registries. A second law on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices will take effect from 2022.
