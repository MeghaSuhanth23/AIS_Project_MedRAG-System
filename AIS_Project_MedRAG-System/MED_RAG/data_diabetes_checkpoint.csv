34173093,Oxidative Stress: Pathogenetic Role in Diabetes Mellitus and Its Complications and Therapeutic Approaches to Correction.,"The review presents modern views about the role of oxidative stress reactions in the pathogenesis of types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus and their complications based on the analysis of experimental and clinical studies. The sources of increased ROS generation in diabetes are specified, including the main pathways of altered glucose metabolism, oxidative damage to pancreatic β-cells, and endothelial dysfunction. The relationship between oxidative stress, carbonyl stress, and inflammation is described. The significance of oxidative stress reactions associated with hyperglycemia is considered in the context of the ""metabolic memory"" phenomenon. The results of our studies demonstrated significant ethnic and age-related variability of the LPO-antioxidant defense system parameters in patients with diabetes mellitus, which should be considered during complex therapy of the disease. Numerous studies of the effectiveness of antioxidants in diabetes mellitus of both types convincingly proved that antioxidants should be a part of the therapeutic process. Modern therapeutic strategies in the treatment of diabetes mellitus are aimed at developing new methods of personalized antioxidant therapy, including ROS sources targeting combined with new ways of antioxidant delivery.",Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,2021-May,"Darenskaya MA, Kolesnikova LI, Kolesnikov SI",3,1277,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

33962641,Variability of risk factors and diabetes complications.,"Several studies suggest that, together with glucose variability, the variability of other risk factors, as blood pressure, plasma lipids, heart rate, body weight, and serum uric acid, might play a role in the development of diabetes complications. Moreover, the variability of each risk factor, when contemporarily present, may have additive effects. However, the question is whether variability is causal or a marker. Evidence shows that the quality of care and the attainment of the target impact on the variability of all risk factors. On the other hand, for some of them causality may be considered. Although specific studies are still lacking, it should be useful checking the variability of a risk factor, together with its magnitude out of the normal range, in clinical practice. This can lead to an improvement of the quality of care, which, in turn, could further hesitate in an improvement of risk factors variability.",Cardiovascular diabetology,2021-May,"Ceriello A, Prattichizzo F",2,928,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The lack of diagnostic methods for early detection results in patients losing the best treatment opportunity. Oral hypoglycemics and exogenous insulin replenishment are currently the most common therapeutic strategies, which only yield temporary glycemic control rather than curing the disease and its complications. Exosomes are nanoparticles containing bioactive molecules reflecting individual physiological status, regulating metabolism, and repairing damaged tissues. They function as biomarkers of diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications. Considering that exosomes are bioactive molecules, can be obtained from body fluid, and have cell-type specificity, in this review, we highlight the multifold effects of exosomes in the pathology and therapy of diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2021-,"Sun Y, Tao Q, Wu X, Zhang L, Liu Q, Wang L",6,948,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

In addition to type 2 diabetes, in which aging is a well-known risk factor, individuals with type 1 and other types of diabetes are also increasing owing to longevity in the general population and improved prognosis of the disease and comorbidities. Insulin-dependent state in type 1 diabetes and other types of diabetes, such as diabetes after pancreatectomy, inevitably requires insulin treatment for survival; however, daily injection of insulin is often hampered in older adults due to impaired cognitive function or limited activities of daily living. In this review, we aimed to discuss the current situation of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in older adults and highlight future prospects.

39556629,Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Evaluation and Treatment.,"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes resulting from an absolute or relative insulin deficiency. It can occur in patients of all ages and can be the initial presentation of diabetes, especially in young children. Polyuria and polydipsia are the most common symptoms, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, severe fatigue, dyspnea, and preceding febrile illness. Traditionally, DKA has been diagnosed by the triad of hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.3, serum bicarbonate less than 18 mEq/L, anion gap greater than 10 mEq/L), and elevated serum (preferred) or urine ketones. However, hyperglycemia has been de-emphasized in recent guidelines because of the increasing incidence of euglycemic DKA. The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors modestly increases the risk of DKA and euglycemic DKA. Electrolytes, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood cell count with differential, A1C, and electrocardiography should be evaluated for all patients diagnosed with DKA to identify causes and complications of DKA. Amylase, lipase, hepatic transaminase levels, troponin, creatine kinase, blood and urine cultures, and chest radiography are additional tests to consider. Treatment involves fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin, treatment of precipitating causes, and close monitoring to adjust therapy and identify complications. Prevention strategies include identifying diabetes before DKA develops, educating patients to manage high-risk situations, and ensuring uninterrupted access to therapies for diabetes.",American family physician,2024-Nov,"Veauthier B, Levy-Grau B",2,1682,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
30961501,The Growing Epidemic of Diabetes Mellitus.,"During the past decades, the prevalence of diabetes (DM) has increased significantly, mainly as a result of continuous rise in the incidence of type 2 DM. According to World Health Organization statistics, >422 million adults globally were suffering from DM in 2014 and a continuous rise in DM prevalence is expected. The present review considers recent epidemiological data providing worldwide estimates regarding the incidence of DM. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify available data from epidemiological studies evaluating the current burden of DM. Over the past few decades the prevalence of DM has risen significantly in nearly all countries and may be considered as a growing epidemic. Urbanization and income status are major factors which influence current rates in the prevalence studies introducing interesting differences between several population groups. Having recognized the global burden of DM, we now realize the urgent need for effective interventions. In order to monitor the public-health strategies and design effective future interventions we need reliable global estimates regarding the prevalence of DM.",Current vascular pharmacology,2020-,"Lovic D, Piperidou A, Zografou I, Grassos H, Pittaras A, Manolis A",6,1152,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
31057114,Microvascular Complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic, non communicable, multisystem disease that has reached epidemic proportions. Chronic exposure to hyperglycaemia affects the microvasculature, eventually leading to diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy with high impact on the quality of life and overall life expectancy. Sexual dysfunction is an often-overlooked microvascular complication of T2DM, with a complex pathogenesis originating from endothelial dysfunction. The purpose of this review is to present current definitions, epidemiological data and risk factors for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and sexual dysfunction. We also describe the clinical and laboratory evaluation that is mandatory for the diagnosis of these conditions. A comprehensive review of the literature was performed to identify data from clinical studies for the prevalence, risk factors and diagnostic methods of microvascular complications of T2DM. Diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy affect approximately 25% of patients with T2DM; diabetic neuropathy is encountered in almost 50% of the diabetic population, while the prevalence of erectile dysfunction ranges from 35-90% in diabetic men. The duration of T2DM along with glycemic, blood pressure and lipid control are common risk factors for the development of these complications. Criteria for the diagnosis of these conditions are well established, but exclusion of other causes is mandatory. Early detection of microvascular complications associated with T2DM is important, as early intervention leads to better outcomes. However, this requires awareness of their definition, prevalence and diagnostic modalities.",Current vascular pharmacology,2020-,"Faselis C, Katsimardou A, Imprialos K, Deligkaris P, Kallistratos M, Dimitriadis K",6,1673,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

37839502,β-cell neogenesis: A rising star to rescue diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM), a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose, is caused by various degrees of insulin resistance and dysfunctional insulin secretion, resulting in hyperglycemia. The loss and failure of functional β-cells are key mechanisms resulting in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of β-cell failure, and exploring approaches for β-cell neogenesis to reverse β-cell dysfunction may provide novel strategies for DM therapy. Emerging studies reveal that genetic susceptibility, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative stress, islet inflammation, and protein modification linked to multiple signaling pathways contribute to DM pathogenesis. Over the past few years, replenishing functional β-cell by β-cell neogenesis to restore the number and function of pancreatic β-cells has remarkably exhibited a promising therapeutic approach for DM therapy. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the underlying mechanisms of β-cell failure in DM, highlight the effective approaches for β-cell neogenesis, as well as discuss the current clinical and preclinical agents research advances of β-cell neogenesis. Insights into the challenges of translating β-cell neogenesis into clinical application for DM treatment are also offered.",Journal of advanced research,2024-Aug,"Niu F, Liu W, Ren Y, Tian Y, Shi W, Li M, Li Y, Xiong Y, Qian L",9,1349,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

In this narrative review, the main endocrinopathies accompanied by increased glycemic values are identified, as well as the mechanisms by which the excess or deficiency of certain hormones impact beta cell function or insulin resistance. The main endocrinopathies (acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome, Basedow-Graves' disease, pheochromocytoma, somatostatinoma and glucagonoma) and their characteristics are described along with the impact of hormone changes on blood sugar, body mass index and other parameters associated with diabetes. The overall information regarding the complex molecular mechanisms that cause the risk of secondary diabetes and metabolic syndrome is of crucial importance in order to prevent the development of the disease and its complications and particularly to reduce the cardiovascular risk of these patients. The purpose of this study is to highlight the particular features of endocrine pathologies accompanied by an increased risk of developing diabetes, in the context of personalized therapeutic decision making.

Two SGLT2 inhibitors, namely bexagliflozin and velagliflozin, were recently FDA approved for the treatment of uncomplicated feline diabetes mellitus. These oral hypoglycemic agents are a suitable option for many newly diagnosed cats, with rapid improvements in glycemic control and clinical signs. Suitable candidates must have some residual β-cell function, as some endogenous insulin production is required to prevent ketosis.

36916961,Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Therapy as a new Treatment Option for Diabetes Mellitus.,"The worldwide increase in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus has raised the demand for new therapeutic strategies targeting diabetic symptoms and its chronic complications. Among different treatment options for diabetes, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) therapy attract the most attention. The therapeutic effects of ADMSCs are based primarily on their paracrine release of immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and trophic factors. Animal models of diabetes as well as human clinical trials have shown that ADMSCs can effectively facilitate endogenous β cell regeneration, preserve residual β cell mass, reduce islet graft rejection, regulate the immune system, and ultimately improve insulin sensitivity or ameliorate insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Nevertheless, transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells is associated with certain risks; therefore recently much attention has been devoted to ADMSCs derivatives, such as exosomes or conditioned media, as therapeutic agents for the treatment of diabetes. Compared to ADMSCs, cell-free therapy has even better therapeutic potential. This narrative review summarizes recent outcomes and molecular mechanisms of ADMSCs action in the treatment for both type 1 DM and type 2 DM, as well as shows their feasibility, benefits, and current limitations.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2023-Jul,"Mikłosz A, Chabowski A",2,1322,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

37295292,The promise of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in diabetes mellitus therapy: How gene editing is revolutionizing diabetes research and treatment.,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease, characterized by chronic hyperglycemia caused by an abnormality in insulin secretion or action. Millions of people across the world are affected by diabetes mellitus which has serious implications for their health. Over the past few decades, diabetes has become a major cause of mortality and morbidity across the world due to its rapid prevalence. Treatment for diabetes that focuses on insulin secretion and sensitization can lead to unwanted side effects and/or poor compliance, as well as treatment failure. A promising way to treat diabetes is through gene-editing technologies such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9). However, issues such as efficiency and off-target effects have hindered the use of these technologies. In this review, we summarize what we know today about CRISPR/Cas9 technology's therapeutic potential for treating diabetes. We discuss how different strategies are employed, including cell-based therapies (such as stem cells and brown adipocytes), targeting critical genes involved in diabetes pathogenesis, and discussing the challenges and limitations associated with this technology.

DPN increases the risk of ulcers, foot infections, and noninvasive amputations, ultimately leading to long-term disability. Seven hundred patients with T2DM were investigated from 2013 to 2017 in the Sanlin community by obtaining basic data from the electronic medical record system (EMRS). From September 2018 to July 2019, 681 patients (19 missing) were investigated using a questionnaire, physical examination, biochemical index test, and follow-up Toronto clinical scoring system (TCSS) test. Patients with a TCSS score ≥6 points were diagnosed with DPN. After removing missing values, 612 patients were divided into groups in a 3:1 ratio for external validation. Using different Lasso analyses (misclassification error, mean squared error, -2log-likelihood, and area under curve) and a logistic regression analysis of the training set, models A, B, C, and D were established. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration plot, dynamic component analysis (DCA) measurements, net classification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used to validate discrimination and clinical practicality of the model.

32894314,The clinical consequences of heterogeneity within and between different diabetes types.,"Advances in molecular methods and the ability to share large population-based datasets are uncovering heterogeneity within diabetes types, and some commonalities between types. Within type 1 diabetes, endotypes have been discovered based on demographic (e.g. age at diagnosis, race/ethnicity), genetic, immunological, histopathological, metabolic and/or clinical course characteristics, with implications for disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis and treatment. In type 2 diabetes, the relative contributions of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction are heterogeneous and relate to demographics, genetics and clinical characteristics, with substantial interaction from environmental exposures. Investigators have proposed approaches that vary from simple to complex in combining these data to identify type 2 diabetes clusters relevant to prognosis and treatment. Advances in pharmacogenetics and pharmacodynamics are also improving treatment. Monogenic diabetes is a prime example of how understanding heterogeneity within diabetes types can lead to precision medicine, since phenotype and treatment are affected by which gene is mutated. Heterogeneity also blurs the classic distinctions between diabetes types, and has led to the definition of additional categories, such as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, type 1.5 diabetes and ketosis-prone diabetes. Furthermore, monogenic diabetes shares many features with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which make diagnosis difficult. These challenges to the current classification framework in adult and paediatric diabetes require new approaches. The 'palette model' and the 'threshold hypothesis' can be combined to help explain the heterogeneity within and between diabetes types. Leveraging such approaches for therapeutic benefit will be an important next step for precision medicine in diabetes.

35008906,The Role of the Gut Microbiota in the Pathogenesis of Diabetes.,"Diabetes mellitus is a significant clinical and therapeutic problem because it can lead to serious long-term complications. Its pathogenesis is not fully understood, but there are indications that dysbiosis can play a role in the development of diabetes, or that it appears during the course of the disease. Changes in microbiota composition are observed in both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. These modifications are associated with pro-inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, endotoxemia, impaired β-cell function and development of insulin resistance. This review summarizes the role of the gut microbiota in healthy individuals and the changes in bacterial composition that can be associated with T1D or T2D.

38512073,"Diabetes: a review of its pathophysiology, and advanced methods of mitigation.","Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a long-lasting metabolic non-communicable disease often characterized by an increase in the level of glucose in the blood or hyperglycemia. Approximately, 415 million people between the ages of 20 and 79 years had DM in 2015 and this figure will rise by 200 million by 2040. In a study conducted by CARRS, it's been found that in Delhi the prevalence of diabetes is around 27% and for prediabetic cases, it is more than 46%. The disease DM can be both short-term and long-term and is often associated with one or more diseases like cardiovascular disease, liver disorder, or kidney malfunction. Early identification of diabetes may help avoid catastrophic repercussions because untreated DM can result in serious complications. Diabetes' primary symptoms are persistently high blood glucose levels, frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. Therefore, DM is classified into four major categories, namely, Type 1, Type 2, Gestational diabetes, and secondary diabetes. There are various oral and injectable formulations available in the market like insulin, biguanides, sulphonylureas, etc. for the treatment of DM. Recent attention can be given to the various nano approaches undertaken for the treatment, diagnosis, and management of diabetes mellitus. Various nanoparticles like Gold Nanoparticles, carbon nanomaterials, and metallic nanoparticles are some of the approaches mentioned in this review. Besides nanotechnology, artificial intelligence (AI) has also found its application in diabetes care. AI can be used for screening the disease, helping in decision-making, predictive population-level risk stratification, and patient self-management tools. Early detection and diagnosis of diabetes also help the patient avoid expensive treatments later in their life with the help of IoT (internet of medical things) and machine learning models. These tools will help healthcare physicians to predict the disease early. Therefore, the Nano drug delivery system along with AI tools holds a very bright future in diabetes care.",Current medical research and opinion,2024-May,"Gupta S, Sharma N, Arora S, Verma S",4,2071,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The pre-diabetic phase of the disease is called tropical chronic pancreatitis (TCP). Currently FCPD is classified as a secondary form of diabetes called pancreatic diabetes, because essentially the disease is caused by pancreatic damage. There is an overlap of these subjects with idiopathic, non-alcoholic pancreatitis. This review will cover the etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and management of this clinical condition. FCPD could lead to endocrine dysfunction (diabetes and its complications) as well as exocrine dysfunction, and is associated with a higher risk of pancreatic cancer, for which early detection is important.",Journal of diabetes and its complications,2021-Jan,"Kumaran S, Unnikrishnan AG",2,798,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37644750,Types of Nursing Intervention on Improving Quality of Life among Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review.,"Long-term treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is considered a major factor causing disease complications. DM complications mostly impact the patient's quality of life (QoL). Only a few studies have been conducted summarizing the types of nursing interventions for improving the QoL of DM patients. The objective of this study is to explore the types of nursing interventions that can improve the QoL of DM patients. The online databases, including ScienceDirect, Medline, Google Search, and Pro-Quest, were used to search for the relevant articles. Articles that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed, and their level of evidence was determined and synthesized. A total of 30 articles defining the types of nursing intervention on improving the QoL of DM patients were discovered, comprising the five types of nursing interventions, such as health education (15 articles), exercise (8 articles), WhatsApp/short message service (WA/SMS) gateway (3 articles), blood glucose control (3 articles), and black garlic herbal therapy (1 article). Sequentially, the most common types of nursing interventions to improve the QoL of DM patients was health education, followed by exercise, WA/SMS gateway, and glucose control. A personal approach to health education is a significant point in improving the QoL of DM patients in the future.

There is an interplay of nongenetic and genetic components in pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications. There are several established genes such as ABCC8, TCF7L2, SLC2A2, and CAPN10 which are known to influence blood insulin and glucose levels. Current management of diabetes types may include lifetime burdensome use of insulin, insulin sensitizers, insulin secretagogues, etc. There has been increasing interest in improving genetic editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 and using genetically edited stem cells to alter diabetes disease course or possibly cure it. Current research on microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs may provide insights into the pathways involved in development of diabetes and its complications.

38890775,Estimation of the direct health and indirect societal costs of diabetes in the UK using a cost of illness model.,"The direct cost of diabetes to the UK health system was estimated at around £10 billion in 2012. This analysis updates that estimate using more recent and accurate data sources. A pragmatic review of relevant data sources for UK nations was conducted, including population-level data sets and published literature, to generate estimates of costs separately for Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes. A comprehensive cost framework, developed in collaboration with experts, was used to create a population-based cost of illness model. The key driver of the analysis was prevalence of diabetes and its complications. Estimates were made of the excess costs of diagnosis, treatment and diabetes-related complications compared with the general UK population. Estimates of the indirect costs of diabetes focused on productivity losses due to absenteeism and premature mortality. The direct costs of diabetes in 2021/22 for the UK were estimated at £10.7 billion, of which just over 40% related to diagnosis and treatment, with the rest relating to the excess costs of complications. Indirect costs were estimated at £3.3 billion. Diabetes remains a considerable cost burden in the UK, and the majority of those costs are still spent on potentially preventable complications. Although rates of some complications are reducing, prevalence continues to increase and effective approaches to primary and secondary prevention continue to be needed.

DM is one of the fastest growing challenges to global health in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and places a tremendous burden on affected individuals and their families and countries. Although insulin and antidiabetic drugs have been used to treat DM, a radical cure for the disease is unavailable. The pathogenesis of DM remains unclear. Emerging roles of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in DM have become a subject of global research. CircRNAs have been verified to participate in the onset and progression of DM, implying their potential roles as novel biomarkers and treatment tools.

Male Factor Infertility (MFI) is responsible, alone or in combination with female factors, for about half of the overall cases of couple infertility. MFI is gradually increasing in prevalence, with a notable decline in semen parameters over the last decades. The aetiologies behind the finding of decreasing sperm counts are difficult to pinpoint but might be due in part to increasing rates of overweight and obesity in men of childbearing age. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common and chronic metabolic disease, whose prevalence is also gradually increasing, rising up to 10% of the population. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that there are currently more than 500 million people living with DM worldwide, the vast majority of whom suffering from type 2 DM (T2DM). There is growing awareness of the relationship between unhealthy lifestyle, in particular unhealthy diet, and MFI. Starting from all these premises, the aim of this narrative review is to describe the current evidence on the link between DM and MFI, both in terms of DM as a cause of/a risk factor for MFI and of MFI as a possible predictive marker for T2DM. Finally, we will discuss the risk of DM as a consequence of the therapy of MFI or assisted reproductive techniques.",Molecular aspects of medicine,2024-Oct,"Graziani A, Scafa R, Grande G, Ferlin A",4,1393,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39461229,Prevalence and clinical implications of diabetes mellitus in autoimmune nodopathies: A systematic review.,"Autoimmune nodopathies comprise a newly-established subtype of immune-mediated peripheral neuropathies, characterized by circulating autoantibodies that target nodal-paranodal proteins, including contactin-1 (CNTN1), contactin-associated protein-1 (Caspr1), neurofascin-155 (NF155) and neurofascin-isoforms (NF140 and NF186). Emerging evidence suggests that diabetes mellitus (DM) may confer increased risk for autoimmune nodopathies. A systematic search was performed including studies reporting on patients harboring nodal/paranodal antibodies (CNTN1, Caspr1, NF155, NF140 and NF186). We sought to evaluate: (1) the prevalence of DM among patients with autoimmune nodopathies; (2) the phenotype of DM-patients harboring different types of nodal/paranodal antibodies; (3) clinical features that allow distinction of autoimmune nodopathies from diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Five cohort studies, 3 case-reports and one case-series study were identified comprising 114 patients with autoimmune nodopathies. DM prevalence was documented to range between 10.5 % and 60 %. DM-patients harbored mostly paranodal antibodies; CNTN1: 58.3 %, followed by pan-neurofascin: 33.3 %, and Caspr1: 25 % antibodies. No significant differences in clinical phenotype were uncovered between DM-patients and their non-DM counterparts. Overall, DM patients were refractory to intravenous-immunoglobulins (IVIG), but responded well to escalation immunotherapies. Compared to DPN, distinctive features of autoimmune nodopathy comprised: (i) severe ataxia, tremor, and cranial nerve involvement; (ii) neurophysiological findings indicative of nodal-paranodal pathology, including (reversible) conduction failure and conduction velocity slowing, often accompanied by reduced compound muscle and sensory nerve action potentials; and (iii) marked protein-elevation or albuminocytological dissociation in cerebrospinal fluid analysis. DM patients fall under the typical clinical phenotype of autoimmune nodopathy, displaying predominantly paranodal antibodies.

37449742,Chronic Venous Disease and Its Intersections With Diabetes Mellitus.,"Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a vascular disorder in which blood return is severely compromised and CVD is usually characterized by venous hypertension. Along with obesity and diabetes mellitus, CVD is one of the most common civilization diseases. In general, the estimated prevalence of CVD ranges from 60-80 %. Early diagnosis and adequate treatment are important for preventing progression to more severe stages of the disease like venous leg ulcers. Clinical manifestations of CVD in initial stages of the disease are often asymptomatic. However, as CVD progresses, symptoms begin to develop. Treatment of CVD could be divided into conservative and surgical. Conservative therapy consists of compression, pharmacological treatment and lifestyle change. In cases where conservative therapy is ineffective, surgical or endovascular treatment may be required. The intersections between diabetes mellitus (DM) and CVD are not to be underestimated. CVD and DM have often the same risk factors. Symptoms of CVD can be modified by late complications of DM, but the incidence of different CVD degrees seems to be the same as in diabetics as in non-diabetics population. We are particularly concerned in diabetics about worse compliance with treatment due to their often-poorer adherence to treatment of DM and lifestyle changes. Moreover, there exist a higher risk of CVD and peripheral arterial disease in diabetics patients. Patients with CVD should always be inspected for the presence of DM, considering its presence can have a bearing on CVD symptoms, diagnostic procedures, and therapeutic strategies.",Physiological research,2023-Jul,"Jarošíková R, Roztočil K, Husáková J, Dubský M, Bém R, Wosková V, Fejfarová V",7,1605,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33175668,The interrelationship between diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial disease.,"<b></b>This systematic review examined the interrelationship between concomitant diabetes mellitus (DM) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The objective was to determine differences in the prevalence as well as in the outcomes in diabetic vs. non-diabetic PAD patients. The current review followed a study protocol that was published online in German in 2017. The search included societal practice guidelines, consensus statements, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and observational studies published from 2007 to 2020 reporting symptomatic PAD and concomitant DM in patients undergoing invasive open-surgical and endovascular revascularizations. German and English literature has been considered. Eligibility criteria were verified by three independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by discussion involving a fourth reviewer. 580 articles were identified. After exclusion of non-eligible studies, 61 papers from 30 countries remained, respectively 850,072 patients. The included studies showed that PAD prevalence differed between diabetic vs. non-diabetic populations (20-50% vs. 10-26%), and further by age, gender, ethnicity, duration of existing diabetes, and geographic region. The included studies revealed worse outcomes regarding perioperative complications, amputation rate, and mortality rate in diabetic patients when compared to non-diabetic patients. In both groups, the amputation rates decreased during the research period. This review emphasizes an interrelationship between PAD and DM. To improve the outcomes, early detection of PAD in diabetic patients, and vice versa, should be recommended.

38732253,Pathophysiology and Advances in the Therapy of Cardiomyopathy in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is known as the first non-communicable global epidemic. It is estimated that 537 million people have DM, but the condition has been properly diagnosed in less than half of these patients. Despite numerous preventive measures, the number of DM cases is steadily increasing. The state of chronic hyperglycaemia in the body leads to numerous complications, including diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). A number of pathophysiological mechanisms are behind the development and progression of cardiomyopathy, including increased oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, increased synthesis of advanced glycation products and overexpression of the biosynthetic pathway of certain compounds, such as hexosamine. There is extensive research on the treatment of DCM, and there are a number of therapies that can stop the development of this complication. Among the compounds used to treat DCM are antiglycaemic drugs, hypoglycaemic drugs and drugs used to treat myocardial failure. An important element in combating DCM that should be kept in mind is a healthy lifestyle-a well-balanced diet and physical activity. There is also a group of compounds-including coenzyme Q10, antioxidants and modulators of signalling pathways and inflammatory processes, among others-that are being researched continuously, and their introduction into routine therapies is likely to result in greater control and more effective treatment of DM in the future.

This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the emerging roles of MVs in the pathogenesis of diabetes and associated complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, cardiomyopathy, and neuropathy. MVs, through their cargo of proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and miRNAs, regulate critical processes like inflammation, oxidative stress, immune responses, and tissue remodeling, all of which contribute to the progression of diabetes and its complications. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying MVs' involvement in these pathological processes and discuss their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic tools, particularly for drug delivery. Despite promising evidence, challenges remain in isolating and characterizing MVs, understanding their molecular mechanisms, and validating them for clinical use. Advanced techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomics are required to gain deeper insights.

On the one hand, diabetes mellitus is considered one of the most important risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19. Several factors that are often present in diabetes mellitus are likely to contribute to this risk, such as older age, a proinflammatory and hypercoagulable state, hyperglycemia and underlying comorbidities (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and obesity). On the other hand, a severe COVID-19 infection, and its treatment with steroids, can have a specific negative impact on diabetes itself, leading to worsening of hyperglycemia through increased insulin resistance and reduced β-cell secretory function. Worsening hyperglycemia can, in turn, adversely affect the course of COVID-19.

This study, therefore, provides an update on NDM candidate genes and pathophysiology. Reputable online academic databases were searched for relevant information, which led to the identification of 43 genes whose mutations are linked to the condition. Of the linked genes, mutations in the KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS genes as well as the genes on 6q24 chromosomal region are the most frequently implicated. Mutations in these genes can cause pancreatic agenesis and developmental errors, resulting in NDM in the first six to twelve months of birth. The clinical presentations of NDM include frequent urination, rapid breathing, and dehydration, among others.

36376223,Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes: Clinical approach and knowledge gaps.,"Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes (CFRD) is a unique type of diabetes mellitus that shares some features with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Yet, its distinguishing feature of acute pulmonary complications associated with hyperglycemia and the catabolic metabolism associated with a relative insulin deficiency poses challenges to the application of traditional definitions and treatments for diabetes mellitus. People with CF (pwCF) undergo rigorous annual screening starting at age 10, a process that is challenging for patients and limited by sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. As pwCF continue to live longer, over 50% are expected to develop CFRD over their lifetime, including up to 20% of adolescents. Increasing numbers of people with CFRD will make this disease increasingly relevant to diabetes practitioners. Evidence-guided practice in CFRD care is limited by small and short studies. Our current understanding of CFRD may change significantly with the recent introduction of CF Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) modulator medications. This review will explore current challenges in the diagnosis and management of CFRD, specifically highlighting knowledge gaps in the pathophysiology of CFRD, optimal screening methods, priorities for research and provide guidance with regards to screening, diagnosis, and treatment.",Paediatric respiratory reviews,2023-Jun,"Prentice BJ, Potter KJ, Coriati A, Boudreau V, Rusnell L, Kherani T, Senior PA, Hameed S, Rabasa-Lhoret R",9,1340,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32299722,Diabetes: an Overview for Clinical Oncologists.,"Diabetes and cancer are common conditions highly prevalent in the general population. The co-existence of diabetes and cancer in a patient is therefore not unexpected. Diabetes increases the risk of mortality from cancer and morbidity from the treatment of cancer. Furthermore, many cancer chemotherapeutic regimens increase glucose levels, especially those involving glucocorticoids. Many clinical oncologists will deal with patients with diabetes in their clinical work, and some working knowledge of diabetes diagnosis and management is helpful when managing such patients. This overview aims to summarise the clinical diagnosis and management of diabetes, review the potential links between diabetes and cancer, and provide some practical guidance on the management of hyperglycaemia in patients undergoing cancer therapy.",Clinical oncology (Royal College of Radiologists (Great Britain)),2020-Sep,"Lee YN, Chowdhury TA",2,826,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39316333,"Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diabetes mellitus.","Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment, offering hope for patients with various malignancies. However, along with their remarkable anticancer effects, ICIs can also trigger immune-related adverse events (irAEs). One such noteworthy complication is the development of Diabetes Mellitus (DM), which particularly resembles Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). The aim of this review is to provide insights into the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic issues, and treatment considerations of ICI-induced DM (ICI-DM), emphasizing the importance of early recognition and management to mitigate adverse outcomes. Although still rare, the incidence has increased with the widespread use of ICIs, especially PD-1/PD-L1 blockers (from 0.2% to 1.9%). Factors affecting the development of ICI-DM, such as specific ICIs, patient demographics, and genetic predispositions, are discussed. The complex interplay between immune dysregulation and pancreatic β-cell destruction contributes to diagnostic challenges, with presentations varying from asymptomatic hyperglycemia to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Management strategies prioritize meticulous glycemic and electrolyte regulation along with tailored intravenous insulin therapy in cases of DKA. DM remission is rare, therefore treatment with both long-acting insulin at bedtime and short-acting insulin before meals is needed in longterm. Total daily insulin requirements can be estimated at 0.3-0.4 units/kg/day for most patients as a starting dose.",Endocrine,2025-Mar,"Kani ER, Karaviti E, Karaviti D, Gerontiti E, Paschou IA, Saltiki K, Stefanaki K, Psaltopoulou T, Paschou SA",9,1524,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33789298,Post-Transplantation Diabetes Mellitus in Pediatric Patients.,"More than 80% of pediatric solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients now survive into young adulthood and many encounter transplant-related complications. Post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM), sometimes also referred to as post-transplant diabetes or new onset diabetes after transplant, occurs in 3-20% of pediatric SOT recipients depending upon the organ transplanted, age at transplantation, immunosuppressive regimen, family history, and time elapsed since transplant. To diagnose PTDM, hyperglycemia must persist beyond the initial hospitalization for transplantation when a patient is on stable doses of immunosuppressive medications. Though standard diagnostic criteria used by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) to diagnose diabetes are employed, clinicians need to be aware of the limitations of using these criteria in this unique patient population. Management of PTDM parallels strategies used for type 2 diabetes (T2D), while also carefully considering comorbidities and potential interactions with immunosuppressive medications in these patients. In caring for patients with PTDM, it is important to be familiar with these interactions and comorbidities in order to coordinate care with the transplant team and optimize outcomes for these patients.",Hormone research in paediatrics,2020-,"Grundman JB, Wolfsdorf JI, Marks BE",3,1274,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34462631,Diabetes Mellitus Prediction and Severity Level Estimation Using OWDANN Algorithm.,"Today, diabetes is one of the most prevalent, chronic, and deadly diseases in the world owing to some complications. If accurate early diagnosis is feasible, the risk factor and incidence of diabetes may be greatly decreased. Diabetes prediction is stable and reliable, since there are only minimal labelling evidence and outliers found in the datasets of diabetes. Numerous works coped with diabetes disease prediction and provided the solution. But the existing methods proffered low accuracy detection and consumed more training time. So, this paper proposed an OWDANN algorithm for diabetes mellitus disease prediction and severity level estimation. The proposed system mainly consists of two phases, namely, disease prediction and severity level estimation phase. In the disease prediction phase, the preprocessing is performed for the Pima dataset. Then, the features are extracted from the preprocessed data, and finally, the classification step is performed by using OWDANN. In the severity level estimation phase, the diabetes positive dataset is preprocessed first. Then, the features are extracted, and lastly, the severity level is predicted using GDHC. The extensive experimental results showed that the proposed system outperforms with 98.97% accuracy, 94.98% sensitivity, 95.62% specificity, 97.02% precision, 93.84% recall, 9404% <i>f</i>-measure, 0.094% FDR, and 0.023% FPR compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",Computational intelligence and neuroscience,2021-,"R A, R N",2,1434,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35775305,Feline Comorbidities: Clinical perspective on diabetes mellitus and pancreatitis.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common feline endocrine disorders. It has been shown by several studies that DM in cats frequently coexists with pancreatitis. It has not been definitively established what the exact pathogenetic association between DM and pancreatitis is in the cat. However, the association between these two conditions is most likely bidirectional, with DM predisposing cats to pancreatitis and vice versa. Diagnosis of pancreatitis in cats with DM is crucial because concurrent pancreatitis commonly leads to difficulties in the management of DM. When pancreatitis is associated with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), therapeutic management is even more challenging. This review focuses on the concurrent presence of DM or DKA and pancreatitis in cats, mainly focusing on their clinical management. Information provided in this review is based on feline-specific clinical research when available. In addition, comparative and human research, as well as clinical experience, has been used to enrich knowledge in areas where feline-specific research is not yet available.",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,2022-Jul,"Xenoulis PG, Fracassi F",2,1093,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39041707,The connections of sialic acids and diabetes mellitus: therapeutic or diagnostic value?,"Modulation of sialic acids is one of the important pathological consequences of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus with or without the micro- and macrovascular complications. However, the mechanistic, therapeutic and/or diagnostic implications of these observations are uncoordinated and possibly conflicting. This review critically analyses the scientific investigations connecting sialic acids with diabetes mellitus. Generally, variations in the levels and patterns of sialylation, fucosylation and galactosylation were predominant across various tissues and body systems of diabetic patients, but the immune system seemed to be most affected. These might be explored as a basis for differential diagnosis of various diabetic complications. Sialic acids are predominantly elevated in nearly all forms of diabetic conditions, particularly nephropathy and retinopathy, which suggests some diagnostic value but the mechanistic details were not unequivocal from the available data. The plausible mechanistic explanations for the elevated sialic acids are increased desialylation by sialidases, stimulation of hexosamine pathway and synthesis of acute phase proteins as well as oxidative stress. Additionally, sialic acids are also profoundly associated with glucose transport and insulin resistance in human-based studies while animal-based studies revealed that the increased desialylation of insulin receptors by sialidases, especially NEU1, might be the causal link. Interestingly, inhibition of the diabetes-associated NEU1 desialylation was beneficial in diabetes management and might be considered as a therapeutic target. It is hoped that the article will provide an informed basis for future research activities on the exploitation of sialic acids and glycobiology for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes against diabetes mellitus.",Glycobiology,2024-Jul,"Ibrahim MA, Isah MB, Inim MD, Abdullahi AD, Adamu A",5,1847,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38251642,Early post-transplant hyperglycemia and post-transplant diabetes mellitus following heart transplantation.,"Heart transplantation is an important treatment for end-stage heart failure. Early post-transplant hyperglycemia (EPTH) and post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) are common following heart transplantation and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This review summarizes the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of EPTH and PTDM in cardiac transplant patients, incorporating findings from non-cardiac solid organ transplant studies where relevant due to limited heart-specific research. EPTH following heart transplantation is common yet understudied and is associated with the later development of PTDM. PTDM is associated with adverse outcomes including infection, renal dysfunction, microvascular disease, and an increased risk of re-transplantation and mortality. Risk factors for EPTH include the post-operative immunosuppression regimen, recipient and donor age, body mass index, infections, and chronic inflammation. Early insulin treatment is recommended for EPTH, whereas PTDM management is varied and includes lifestyle modification, anti-glycemic agents, and insulin. Given the emerging evidence on the transplant benefits associated with effective glucose control, and the cardioprotective potential of newer anti-glycemic agents, further focus on the management of EPTH and PTDM within heart transplant recipients is imperative.",Expert review of endocrinology & metabolism,2024-Mar,"Kuang W, Raven LM, Muir CA",3,1374,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33064971,Defining and Classifying New Subgroups of Diabetes.,"An etiologically based classification of diabetes is needed to account for the heterogeneity of type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D) and emerging forms of diabetes worldwide. It may be productive for both classification and clinical discovery to consider variant forms of diabetes as a spectrum. Maturity onset diabetes of youth and neonatal diabetes serve as models for etiologically defined, rare forms of diabetes in the spectrum. Ketosis-prone diabetes is a model for more complex forms, amenable to phenotypic dissection.

33082551,The trials and tribulations of determining HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets for diabetes mellitus.,"Glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) is considered the gold standard for predicting glycaemia-associated risks for the microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus over 5-10 years. The value of HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the care of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is unassailable, yet HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets remain contentious. Guidelines from diabetes care organizations recommend conflicting HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets - generally between 6.5% and 8%. However, all such organizations advocate for individualization of HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets, leaving both health-care providers and their patients confused about what HbA<sub>1c</sub> target is appropriate in an individual patient. In this Review, we outline the landmark T1DM and T2DM trials that informed the current guidelines, we discuss the evidence that drives individualized HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets, we examine the limitations of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and we consider alternatives for monitoring glycaemic control. Ultimately, in synthesizing this literature, we argue for an HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of <7% for most individuals, but emphasize the importance of helping patients determine their own personal goals and determinants of quality of life that are independent of a particular glycaemic target. We also recognize that as newer technologies and anti-hyperglycaemic therapies emerge, glycaemic targets will continue to evolve.",Nature reviews.

32176560,The assessment and management of quality of life of older adults with diabetes mellitus.,"<b>Introduction</b>: As the population ages, the number of older adults with diabetes mellitus will continue to rise. The burden of diabetes on older adults is significant due to the disease itself, its complications, and its treatments. This is compounded by geriatric syndromes such as frailty and cognitive dysfunction. Consequently, health and diabetes-related quality of life (QoL) are diminished.<b>Areas covered</b>: This article reviews the value of assessing QoL in providing patient-centered care and the associations between QoL measures and health outcomes. The determinants of QoL particular to diabetes and the older population are reviewed, including psychosocial, physical, and cognitive burdens of diabetes and aging and the impact of hypoglycemia on QoL. Strategies are described to alleviate these burdens and improve QoL, and barriers to multidisciplinary patient-centered care are discussed. QoL measurement instruments are reviewed.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The goals of treating diabetes and its complications should be considered carefully along with each patient's capacity to withstand the burdens of treatment. This capacity is reduced by socioeconomic, psychological, cognitive, and physical factors reduces this capacity. Incorporating measurement of HRQoL into clinical practices is possible, but deficiencies in the systems of health-care delivery need to be addressed to facilitate their use.",Expert review of endocrinology & metabolism,2020-Mar,"Sayyed Kassem L, Aron DC",2,1421,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34418040,Periodontitis management in diabetes care.,"Periodontitis is the chronic inflammation of the oral cavity involving the gum, teeth and the supporting bone. Since it appears to have a similar pathophysiology as other microvascular complications of diabetes it can be considered to be the fourth chronic microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus. There is a three-fold increase in risk of periodontal disease among patients with diabetes mellitus. Periodontitis in diabetes is associated with increased myocardial infarctions, strokes and renal related complications, poor glycaemic control and an increase in the risk of dying of cardiorenal causes. However, treatment of periodontal disease has been demonstrated to improve glucose control and reduce inflammatory markers. Improvements in periodontal health among patients with diabetes mellitus can be achieved with better oral health education, oral examination in diabetic clinics during regular visits and annual dental examinations by qualified dentists. Dental treatments for periodontal infections include mechanical disruption of the pathogenic biofilm using scaling and planing, use of systemic antibiotics to treat refractory pathogens and specialized dental surgery in advanced disease.",JPMA.

39666834,Diabetes and cardiovascular disease in older adults.,"An aging population combined with a rapidly increasing prevalence of diabetes foreshadows a global epidemic of cardiovascular and kidney disease that threatens to halt improvements in life and health-span and will have particularly severe consequences in older adults. The management of diabetes has been transformed with the recent development of newer anti-hyperglycemic agents that have demonstrated superior efficacy. However, the utility of these drugs extends beyond glycemic control to benefits for managing obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. Numerous cardiovascular and kidney outcomes trials of these drugs have played an instrumental role in shaping current guidelines for the management of diabetes and CVD. Older adults with diabetes are diverse in terms of their comorbidities, diabetic complications, and cognitive and functional status. Therefore, there is an unmet need for personalized management of diabetes and CVD in this population. In this review, we provide an overview of the epidemiological burden and management of diabetes and CVD in older adults. We then focus on randomized cardiovascular and kidney outcome trials with anti-hyperglycemic agents to propose an evidence-based approach to the management of diabetes in older adults with high risk of cardiovascular and kidney disease.",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,2025-Jan,"Bilal A, Pratley R",2,1358,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32562358,Challenges in the diagnosis of diabetes type in pediatrics.,"The incidence of diabetes, both type 1 and type 2, is increasing. Health outcomes in pediatric diabetes are currently poor, with trends indicating that they are worsening. Minority racial/ethnic groups are disproportionately affected by suboptimal glucose control and have a higher risk of acute and chronic complications of diabetes. Correct clinical management starts with timely and accurate classification of diabetes, but in children this is becoming increasingly challenging due to high prevalence of obesity and shifting demographic composition. The growing obesity epidemic complicates classification by obesity's effects on diabetes. Since the prevalence and clinical characteristics of diabetes vary among racial/ethnic groups, migration between countries leads to changes in the distribution of diabetes types in a certain geographical area, challenging the clinician's ability to classify diabetes. These challenges must be addressed to correctly classify diabetes and establish an appropriate treatment strategy early in the course of disease for all. This may be the first step in improving diabetes outcomes across racial/ethnic groups. This review will discuss the pitfalls in the current diabetes classification scheme that is leading to increasing overlap between diabetes types and heterogeneity within each type. It will also present proposed alternative classification schemes and approaches to understanding diabetes type that may improve the timely and accurate classification of pediatric diabetes type.",Pediatric diabetes,2020-Nov,"Siller AF, Tosur M, Relan S, Astudillo M, McKay S, Dabelea D, Redondo MJ",7,1527,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

It typically affects people with type 1 diabetes at the onset of the disease. It can also affect people with type 2 diabetes, although this is uncommon. Research and online content related to diabetes online activity is reviewed. DKA is caused by a relative or absolute deficiency of insulin and elevated levels of counter-regulatory hormones.

39544236,"The clinical potential of 1,5-anhydroglucitol as biomarker in diabetes mellitus.","A crucial measure of diabetes management is to monitor blood glucose, which often requires continuous blood collection, leading to economic burden and discomfort. Blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin A1c serve as traditional indicators of glucose monitoring. But now glycated albumin, fructosamine, and 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) have been gaining more attention. 1,5-AG is a chemically stable monosaccharide that exists in the human body. Its serum concentration remains stable when blood glucose levels are normal. However, it decreases when blood glucose exceeds the renal glucose threshold. Studies have shown that 1.5-AG reflects blood glucose changes in 1 to 2 weeks; therefore, decreased levels of serum 1,5-AG can serve as a clinical indicator of short-term blood glucose disturbances. Recent studies have shown that 1,5-AG can be used not only for the screening and managing of diabetes but also for predicting diabetes-related adverse events and islet β cell function in prediabetic patients. In addition, saliva 1,5-AG demonstrates potential value in the screening and diagnosis of diabetes. This review focuses on the biological characteristics, detection methods, and clinical application of 1,5-AG to promote understanding and applicable research of 1,5-AG in the future.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,"Xu H, Chen R, Hou X, Li N, Han Y, Ji S",6,1288,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

38000983,Association between unstable diabetes mellitus and risk of pancreatic cancer.,"Deterioration of glycaemic control in people with long-standing diabetes mellitus (diabetes) may be a possible indicator of pancreatic cancer. However, the magnitude of the association between diabetes deterioration and pancreatic cancer has received little attention. We conducted a matched cohort study, nested within a population-based cohort of Australian women with diabetes. Women with unstable diabetes, defined as a change in medication after a 2-year period of stable medication use, were matched by birth year to those with stable diabetes, in a 1:4 ratio. We used flexible parametric survival models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 134,954 and 539,789 women in the unstable and stable diabetes cohorts, respectively (mean age 68 years). In total, 1,315 pancreatic cancers were diagnosed. Deterioration of stable diabetes was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer (HR 2.55; 95% CI 2.29-2.85). The risk was particularly high within the first year after diabetes deteriorated. HRs at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year were: 5.76 (95% CI 4.72-7.04); 4.56 (95% CI 3.81-5.46); and 3.33 (95% CI 2.86-3.89), respectively. The risk was no longer significantly different after 7 years. Deterioration in glycaemic control in people with previously stable diabetes may be an indicator of pancreatic cancer, suggesting investigations of the pancreas may be appropriate. The weaker longer-term (3-7 years) association between diabetes deterioration and pancreatic cancer may indicate that poor glycaemic control can be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer.",Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 is an important regulator of the fibrinolytic process and levels of this antifibrinolytic protein are elevated in diabetes and insulin resistant states. This review describes both the physiological and pathological role of PAI-1 in health and disease, focusing on the mechanism of action as well as protein abnormalities in vascular disease with special focus on diabetes. Attempts at inhibiting protein function, using different techniques, are also discussed including direct and indirect interference with production as well as inhibition of protein function. Developing PAI-1 inhibitors represents an alternative approach to managing hypofibrinolysis by targeting the pathological abnormality rather than current practice that relies on profound inhibition of the cellular and/or acellular arms of coagulation, and which can be associated with increased bleeding events. The review offers up-to-date knowledge on the mechanisms of action of PAI-1 together with the role of altering protein function to improve hypofirbinolysis.

39280004,Association and causality between diabetes and activin A: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Activin A, a cytokine belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily, mediates a multifunctional signaling pathway that is essential for embryonic development, cell differentiation, metabolic regulation, and physiological equilibrium. Biomedical research using diabetes-based model organisms and cellular cultures reports evidence of different activin A levels between diabetic and control groups. Activin A is highly conserved across species and universally expressed among disparate tissues. A systematic review of published literatures on human populations reveals association of plasma activin A levels with diabetic patients in some (7) but not in others (5) of the studies. With summarized data from publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWASs), a two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) analysis is conducted on the causality between the exposure and the outcome. Wald ratio estimates from single instruments are predominantly non-significant. In contrast to positive controls between diabetes and plasma cholesterol levels, inverse-variance-weighted (IVW), Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode MR methods all lead to no observed causal link between diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and plasma activin A levels. Unavailability of strong instruments prevents the reversal MR analysis of activin A on diabetes. In summary, further research is needed to confirm or deny the potential association between diabetes and plasma activin A, and to elucidate the temporal incidence of these traits in human populations. At this stage, no causality has been found between diabetes and plasma activin A based on TSMR analysis.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,Wang M,1,1660,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted by searching Medline, Embase, and Cochrane between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2021 for observational studies investigating progression to T2DM after GDM. Inclusion criteria were IADPSG-diagnosed GDM, studies with both GDM and controls, postpartum follow-up duration at least one year. Data were pooled by random effects meta-analysis models. Heterogeneity was assessed by I<sub>2</sub> statistic. The pooled relative risk for incidence of T2DM and pre-diabetes between GDM participants and controls were estimated. Reasons for heterogeneity among studies were investigated by prespecified subgroup and meta-regression analysis. Publication bias was assessed by the Begg's and Egger's tests. This meta-analysis of six studies assessed a total of 61932 individuals (21978 women with GDM and 39954 controls). Women with IADPSG-diagnosed GDM were 6.43 times (RR=6.43, 95% CI:3.45-11.96) more likely to develop T2DM in the future compared with controls. For GDM women, the cumulative incidence of T2DM was 12.1% (95% CI: 6.9%-17.3%), while the pooled cumulative incidence of T2DM was estimated to be 8% (95% CI: 5-11%) in studies with 1 to 5 years of follow-up and increased to 19% (95% CI: 3-34%) for studies with more than 5 years of follow-up. Women with IADPSG-diagnosed GDM had 3.69 times (RR=3.69, 95% CI:2.70-5.06) higher risk of developing pre-diabetes (including impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance) than controls. Meta-regression analysis showed that the study effect size was not significantly associated with study design, race, length of follow-up, and maternal age (P>0.05). Overall, the studies had a relatively low risk of bias. Women with IADPSG-diagnosed GDM have higher risk of developing T2DM and pre-diabetes. The risk of T2DM in GDM women are higher with longer follow-up duration. Our results highlight the importance of promoting postpartum screening and keeping health lifestyle as well as pharmacological interventions to delay/prevent the onset of T2DM/pre-diabetes in GDM women. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero, identifier (CRD42022314776).",Frontiers in endocrinology,2022-,"Juan J, Sun Y, Wei Y, Wang S, Song G, Yan J, Zhou P, Yang H",8,2366,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
31074371,A Comprehensive Review on Preclinical Diabetic Models.,"Preclinical experimental models historically play a critical role in the exploration and characterization of disease pathophysiology. Further, these in-vivo and in-vitro preclinical experiments help in target identification, evaluation of novel therapeutic agents and validation of treatments. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a multifaceted metabolic disorder of multidimensional aetiologies with the cardinal feature of chronic hyperglycemia. To avoid or minimize late complications of diabetes and related costs, primary prevention and early treatment are therefore necessary. Due to its chronic manifestations, new treatment strategies need to be developed, because of the limited effectiveness of the current therapies. The study included electronic databases such as Pubmed, Web of Science and Scopus. The datasets were searched for entries of studies up to June, 2018. A large number of in-vivo and in-vitro models have been presented for evaluating the mechanism of anti-hyperglycaemic effect of drugs in hormone-, chemically-, pathogen-induced animal models of diabetes mellitus. The advantages and limitations of each model have also been addressed in this review. This review encompasses the wide pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms associated with diabetes, particularly focusing on the challenges associated with the evaluation and predictive validation of these models as ideal animal models for preclinical assessments and discovering new drugs and therapeutic agents for translational application in humans. This review may further contribute to discover a novel drug to treat diabetes more efficaciously with minimum or no side effects. Furthermore, it also highlights ongoing research and considers the future perspectives in the field of diabetes.",Current diabetes reviews,2020-,"Shakya A, Chaudary SK, Garabadu D, Bhat HR, Kakoti BB, Ghosh SK",6,1767,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The essential diabetic difficulties are including cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, inflammation, and retinopathy. Despite developments in glucose decreasing treatments and drugs, these diabetic complications are still ineffectively reversed or prohibited. Several signaling and molecular pathways are vital targets in the new therapies of diabetes. This review assesses the newest researches about the key molecules and signaling pathways as targets of molecular pharmacology in diabetes and diseases related to it for better treatment based on molecular sciences. The disease is not cured by current pharmacological strategies for type 2 diabetes. While several drug combinations are accessible that can efficiently modulate glycemia and mitigate long-term complications, these agents do not reverse pathogenesis, and in practice, they are not established to modify the patient's specific molecular profiling.

Early identification of patients with a higher risk of developing diabetes could allow to take timely measures. However, no validated model exists to predict the risk of post-transplant diabetes mellitus. This retrospective study includes 267 adult patients who underwent kidney transplantation at the Antwerp University Hospital between January 2014 and August 2021. Post-transplant diabetes mellitus was diagnosed based on the American Diabetes Association definition at 3 months post-transplant. First, a logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors for post-transplant diabetes mellitus. Second, criteria to identify patients with a high risk (> 35%) of developing post-transplant diabetes mellitus at 3 months were established. At 3 months post-transplantation, 54 (20.2%) patients developed post-transplant diabetes mellitus. Univariable analysis showed that age, body mass index and HbA1c on the day of transplantation were associated with post-transplant diabetes mellitus. However, in a multivariable model with the same parameters, only HbA1c remained statistically significant. An absolute increase in HbA1c of 0.1% increases the odds for developing post-transplant diabetes mellitus by 28% (95% confidence interval 1.15-1.42). An HbA1c level ≥ 5.3% at transplantation, regardless of age or body mass index, is sufficient to identify patients with a post-transplant diabetes mellitus risk of ≥ 35% with a positive predictive value of 39% and a negative predictive value of 88%. The HbA1c value at transplantation was the strongest predictor for post-transplant diabetes mellitus at 3 months post-transplant. Furthermore, at least in our population, a pre-transplant HbA1c of ≥ 5.3% can be used as an easy tool to identify patients at high risk of early post-transplant diabetes mellitus.",Journal of nephrology,2023-Sep,"Laghrib Y, Massart A, de Fijter JW, Abramowicz D, De Block C, Hellemans R",6,1974,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32413571,Therapeutic approaches to diabetic cardiomyopathy: Targeting the antioxidant pathway.,"The global epidemic of cardiovascular disease continues unabated and remains the leading cause of death both in the US and worldwide. We hereby summarize the available therapies for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in diabetics. Clearly, the current approaches to diabetic heart disease often target the manifestations and certain mediators but not the specific pathways leading to myocardial injury, remodeling and dysfunction. Better understanding of the molecular events determining the evolution of diabetic cardiomyopathy will provide insight into the development of specific and targeted therapies. Recent studies largely increased our understanding of the role of enhanced inflammatory response, ROS production, as well as the contribution of Cyp-P450-epoxygenase-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET), Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), Heme Oxygenase (HO)-1 and 20-HETE in pathophysiology and therapy of cardiovascular disease. PGC-1α increases production of the HO-1 which has a major role in protecting the heart against oxidative stress, microcirculation and mitochondrial dysfunction. This review describes the potential drugs and their downstream targets, PGC-1α and HO-1, as major loci for developing therapeutic approaches beside diet and lifestyle modification for the treatment and prevention of heart disease associated with obesity and diabetes.",Prostaglandins & other lipid mediators,2020-Oct,"Arad M, Waldman M, Abraham NG, Hochhauser E",4,1408,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

34369715,Role of Heavy Metals in Diabetes: Mechanisms and Treatment Strategies.,"Toxic metals affecting metabolic pathways have a broad range in the ecosystem from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Because of constant contamination from waste and untreated chemical effluents, their emissions have risen significantly over the last few decades, quickly gaining attention due to their crucial role in the development of several metabolic disorders, notably diabetes mellitus. Cadmium and arsenic not only spread widely in our atmosphere but are also linked to a wide range of health hazards. These are primarily accumulated in the liver, kidney, and pancreas once they reach the human body, where they have deleterious effects on the metabolism of glucose and its association with other metabolic pathways, particularly glycolysis, glycogenesis, and gluconeogenesis, by altering and impairing the specific activity of major enzymes. Impairment of hepatic glucose homeostasis plays a crucial role in diabetes mellitus pathogenesis. Impaired liver and kidney functions, as well as decreased pancreatic and muscle function, also contribute significantly to elevated levels of blood glucose. Heavy metals have the potential to cause changes in the conformation in these enzymes. They also impair hormonal balance by destroying the pancreas and adrenal glands. Such metals often facilitate the development of reactive oxygen species and inhibit antioxidant defense mechanisms, with multiple organs subsequently damaged. This review briefly discusses the involvement of heavy metals in metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, the enzymes involved in this pathway, and glucose homeostasis.",Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression,2021-,"Javaid A, Akbar I, Javed H, Khan U, Iftikhar H, Zahra D, Rashid F, Ashfaq UA",8,1613,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35619303,Telemedicine for Diabetes Mellitus Management in Older Adults: A Systematic Review.,"Diabetes mellitus affects almost 20% of the world's population between 65 and 99 years old. The care for this disease urges a complex, multidisciplinary, and stepwise approach. Telemedicine has been evaluated, and clinical trials as well as systematic reviews have been performed, and most have shown the benefits of its use in DM management. However, as the prevalence of diabetes mellitus increases, as well as the population ages, considerations regarding access and compliance of older patients to such technologies arise. The study aimed to determine the efficacy of telemedicine medical consultations in comparison to standard face-to-face consultations. A systematic literature search to identify trials investigating the effect of telemedicine medical consultations in clinical-laboratory aspects of DM management was conducted. The search was carried out in electronic databases: Medline, EMBASE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the CENTRAL Cochrane. Two authors independently assessed the included studies using the proper bias assessment tool for each study design. In agreement with the eligibility criteria, three studies were included. In terms of the main outcome, HbA1c, only one out of three articles showed a significant difference between the groups, favoring patients in the telemedicine group. With respect to blood pressure, Sood A reported that the usual care group exhibited a greater improvement in systolic blood pressure with statistical differences. All other results displayed no significant statistical difference between the groups. Also, no statistical difference was found in most of the lipid profile results. Our review shows that teleconsultations do not provide a clear benefit to elderly people with diabetes, but they may be non-inferior.",Current diabetes reviews,2023-,"Tristão LS, Tavares G, Tustumi F, Bernardo WM, Duarte ML, Peccin MS, Dos Santos LR",7,1777,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Population-based cohorts of 528 children (7-18 years of age) with prevalent T2D, 1519 matched control children without diabetes and 778 children with T1D were identified from a clinical registry and linked to health care records to assess hospitalizations and reasons for hospitalizations using ICD-9CM and ICD-10CA codes. Children with T2D are more likely than their matched controls and children with T1D to be admitted to hospital in the year prior to diagnosis {RR 2.83 (1.77, 4.53) p < 0.0001 and 8.05 (4.05, 16.00) p < 0.0001, respectively}, in the first year post diagnosis {RR 3.19 (2.08, 4.89) p < 0.0001 and 3.04 (1.86, 4.98) p < 0.0001, respectively} and in the 5 year post diagnosis period {RR 1.99 (1.56, 2.53) p < 0.0001 and 1.91 (1.48, 2.46) p < 0.0001, respectively}. Mental illness was the most common cause for hospital admission in both children with T2D and their matched controls. This differs from children with T1D where endocrine causes constitute the most common reason for hospital admission. This analysis provides novel data on hospitalization rates and diagnoses in the increasing population of children with T2D.

Retrospective analysis of the clinical and genetic profile of 12 NDM patients. Eight patients presented with NDM before the age of 6 mo. Three other patients, including 2 siblings presented in later part of infancy. An additional patient was diagnosed at age 5 y with the same etiology as her infant sibling. Four patients had transient diabetes [TNDM:1 each with a mutation in KCNJ11 and INS gene, 2 with ABCC8 mutation], 7 had permanent diabetes [PNDM: 2 siblings with complete glucokinase deficiency, 2 siblings with thiamine responsive megaloblastic anemia (TRMA), 1 with Immune dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome and 2 with Wolcott Rallison syndrome, (WRS)]. Four patients had 5 novel mutations. Genetic etiology could not be established in 1 patient with features of insulin resistance. Poorly controlled blood glucose in the TRMA patient led to hyperglycemia-induced hemichorea-hemiballismus, a rare manifestation in children. The authors describe 5 novel mutations, in the EIF2AK3, ABCC8, and GCK genes, a homozygous mutation at the ABCC8 locus presenting as TNDM, an obscure phenotype of the GCK gene mutation, and hyperglycemia-induced hemichorea-hemiballismus in a patient with TRMA.

34040951,Health System Capacity and Access Barriers to Diagnosis and Treatment of CVD and Diabetes in Nepal.,"Universal access to essential medicines and routine diagnostics is required to combat the growing burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Evaluating health systems and various access dimensions availability, affordability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality is crucial yet rarely performed, especially in low- and middle-income countries. To evaluate health system capacity and barriers in accessing diagnostics and essential medicines for CVD and diabetes in Nepal. We conducted a WHO/HAI nationally-representative survey in 45 health-facilities (public-sector: 11; private-sector: 34) in Nepal to collect availability and price data for 21 essential medicines for treating CVD and diabetes, during MayJuly 2017. Data for 13 routine diagnostics was obtained in 12 health facilities. Medicines were considered unaffordable if the lowest paid worker spends >1 days wage to purchase a monthly supply. To evaluate accessibility, we conducted facility exit interviews among 636 CVD patients. Accessibility (e.g., private-public health facility mix, travel to hospital/pharmacy) and acceptability (i.e. Nepals adoption of WHO Essential Medicine List, and patient medication adherence) were summarized using descriptive statistics, and we conducted a systematic review of relevant literature. We did not evaluate medicine quality. We found that mean availability of generic medicines is low (<50%) in both public and private sectors, and less than one-third medicines met WHOs availability target (80%). Mean (SD) availability of diagnostics was 73.1% (26.8%). Essential medicines appear locally unaffordable. On average, the lowest-paid worker would spend 1.03 (public-sector) and 1.26 (private-sector) days wages to purchase a monthly supply. For a person undergoing CVD secondary preventive-interventions in the private sector, the associated expenditure would be 7.511.2% of monthly household income. Exit-interviews suggest that a long/expensive commute to health-facilities and poor medicine affordability constrain access. This study highlights critical gaps in Nepals health system capacity to offer basic health services to CVD and diabetes patients, owing to low availability, poor affordability and accessibility of essential medicines and diagnostics. Research and policy initiatives are needed to ensure uninterrupted supply of affordable essential medicines and diagnostics.",Global heart,2021-May,"Sharma A, Kaplan WA, Satheesh G, Poudyal IP, Gyawali P, Neupane D, Bhandari PM, Malla M, Sapkota S, Mishra SR",10,2402,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Indeed, diabetic glomerulopathy is the predominant renal lesion in type 1 diabetes, although also tubular, interstitial and arteriolar lesions are present in the advanced stages of renal disease. In contrast, in type 2 diabetes renal lesions are heterogeneous, and a substantial number of type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic kidney disease have mild or absent glomerulopathy with tubulointerstitial and/or arteriolar abnormalities. In addition, a high prevalence of non-diabetic renal diseases, isolated or superimposed on classic diabetic nephropathy lesions have been reported in patients with type 2 diabetes, often reflecting the bias of selecting patients for unusual clinical presentations for renal biopsy. This review focuses on renal structural changes in type 2 diabetes, emphasizing the contribution of research kidney biopsy studies to the understanding of the pathogenesis of DKD and of the structural lesions responsible for the different clinical phenotypes.

This national study aimed to assess the prevalence and clinical aspects of diabetes mellitus in Lebanon with special focus on type 1 (T1DM). A national multistage, random household sample survey was conducted, using face-to-face interviews with 1 questionnaire per household. A total of 4500 households were selected from all areas based on a pre-existing sampling frame of the Lebanese population. The prevalence of previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus in the surveyed population of 17 832 persons (mean age ~36 years) was 7.95%. The prevalence of T1DM in particular was estimated at 0.1%, or almost 1% of all detected cases of diabetes mellitus. Most persons with diabetes mellitus reported obtaining their usual care from endocrinologists rather than primary healthcare physicians. Delayed performance of haemoglobin A1c test was reported in 25% of 1418 patients. Hypoglycaemic episodes recently occurred in 30% of patients; of whom, at least one third required medical attention, including hospital admission. Diagnosed complications were reported in 22% of cases, with retinopathy being the most common. Prevalence of T1DM in this population was lower than international estimates. Diabetes mellitus management appears to be deficient, based on delays in standard control testing, hypoglycaemic episodes and diabetes mellitus-related complications.

39106207,Monogenic Diabetes: A Comprehensive Overview and Therapeutic Management of Subtypes of Mody.,"Monogenic diabetes often occurs as a result of single-gene mutations. The illness is minimally affected by environmental and behavioral factors, and it constitutes around one to five percent of all cases of diabetes. Newborn diabetes mellitus (NDM) and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) are the predominant causes of monogenic diabetes, accounting for a larger proportion of cases, while syndromic diabetes represents a smaller percentage. MODY, a group of inherited non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus disorders, is quite common. However, it remains frequently misdiagnosed despite increasing public awareness. The condition is characterized by insulin resistance, the development of diabetes at a young age (before 25 years), mild high blood sugar levels, inheritance in an autosomal dominant pattern, and the preservation of natural insulin production. Currently, there are 14 distinct subtypes of MODY that have been identified. Each subtype possesses distinct characteristics in terms of their frequency, clinical symptoms, severity of diabetes, related complications, and response to medicinal interventions. Due to the clinical similarities, lack of awareness, and high expense of genetic testing, distinguishing between type I (T1D) and type II diabetes mellitus (T2D) can be challenging, resulting in misdiagnosis of this type of diabetes. As a consequence, a significant number of individuals are being deprived of adequate medical attention. Accurate diagnosis enables the utilization of novel therapeutic strategies and enhances the management of therapy in comparison to type II and type I diabetes. This article offers a concise overview of the clinical subtypes and characteristics of monogenic diabetes. Furthermore, this article discusses the various subtypes of MODY, as well as the process of diagnosing, managing, and treating the condition.

Of these, 13,421 had T2DM and 1196 had T1DM. The linear MR analyses were conducted in the UK Biobank with 6838 cases of microvascular diseases and 10,755 controls. Lung function measurements included forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1). The study outcome was microvascular diseases, a composite outcome including chronic kidney diseases, retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy. During a median follow-up of 12.1 years, 2668 new-onset microvascular diseases were recorded. FVC (%predicted) was inversely associated with the risk of new-onset microvascular diseases in participants with diabetes (Per SD increment, adjusted HR = 0.86; 95%CI:0.83-0.89), T2DM (Per SD increment, adjusted HR = 0.86; 95%CI:0.82-0.90) and T1DM (Per SD increment, adjusted HR = 0.87; 95%CI: 0.79-0.97), respectively. Similar results were found for FEV1 (%predicted). In MR analyses, genetically predicted FVC (adjusted RR = 0.55, 95%CI:0.39-0.77) and FEV1 (adjusted RR = 0.48, 95%CI:0.28-0.83) were both inversely associated with microvascular diseases in participants with T1DM. No significant association was found in those with T2DM. Similar findings were found for each component of microvascular diseases. There was a causal inverse association between lung function and risks of microvascular diseases in participants with T1DM, but not in those with T2DM.","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2024-Oct,"Zhou C, Ye Z, Zhang Y, He P, Liu M, Zhang Y, Yang S, Gan X, Nie J, Qin X",10,1775,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32650008,Pleiotropic effects of anti-diabetic drugs: A comprehensive review.,"Diabetes mellitus characterized by hyperglycaemia presents an array of comorbidities such as cardiovascular and renal failure, dyslipidemia, and cognitive impairments. Populations above the age of 60 are in an urgent need of effective therapies to deal with the complications associated with diabetes mellitus. Widely used anti-diabetic drugs have good safety profiles and multiple reports indicate their pleiotropic effects in diabetic patients or models. This review has been written with the objective of identifying the widely-marketed anti-diabetic drugs which can be efficiently repurposed for the treatment of other diseases or disorders. It is an updated, comprehensive review, describing the protective role of various classes of anti-diabetic drugs in mitigating the macro and micro vascular complications of diabetes mellitus, and differentiating these drugs on the basis of their mode of action. Notably, metformin, the anti-diabetic drug most commonly explored for cancer therapy, has also exhibited some antimicrobial effects. Unlike class specific effects, few instances of drug specific effects in managing cardiovascular complications have also been reported. A major drawback is that the pleiotropic effects of anti-diabetic drugs have been mostly investigated only in diabetic patients. Thus, for effective repurposing, more clinical trials devoted to analyse the effects of anti-diabetic drugs in patients irrespective of their diabetic condition, are required.",European journal of pharmacology,2020-Oct,"Nath M, Bhattacharjee K, Choudhury Y",3,1481,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38833191,Diabetes and Infectious Diseases with a Focus on Melioidosis.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) leads to impaired innate and adaptive immune responses. This renders individuals with DM highly susceptible to microbial infections such as COVID-19, tuberculosis and melioidosis. Melioidosis is a tropical disease caused by the bacterial pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, where diabetes is consistently reported as the most significant risk factor associated with the disease. Type-2 diabetes is observed in 39% of melioidosis patients where the risk of infection is 13-fold higher than non-diabetic individuals. B. pseudomallei is found in the environment and is an opportunistic pathogen in humans, often exhibiting severe clinical manifestations in immunocompromised patients. The pathophysiology of diabetes significantly affects the host immune responses that play a critical role in fighting the infection, such as leukocyte and neutrophil impairment, macrophage and monocyte inhibition and natural killer cell dysfunction. These defects result in delayed recruitment as well as activation of immune cells to target the invading B. pseudomallei. This provides an advantage for the pathogen to survive and adapt within the immunocompromised diabetic patients. Nevertheless, knowledge gaps on diabetes-infectious disease comorbidity, in particular, melioidosis-diabetes comorbidity, need to be filled to fully understand the dysfunctional host immune responses and adaptation of the pathogen under diabetic conditions to guide therapeutic options.",Current microbiology,2024-Jun,"Uthaya Kumar A, Ahmad Zan M, Ng CL, Chieng S, Nathan S",5,1476,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We aimed to develop an expert opinion on prediabetes in Lebanon to pave the way for national guidelines tailored for the Lebanese population in the near future. A panel of seven diabetes experts conducted a thorough literature review and discussed their opinions and experiences before coming up with a set of preliminary recommendations for the detection and management of prediabetes in Lebanon. Lebanese physicians employ multiple tests for the diagnosis of prediabetes and no national cut-off values exist. The panel agreed that prediabetes screening should be focused on patients exceeding 45 years of age with otherwise no risk factors and on adults with risk factors. The panel reached that fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c should be used for prediabetes diagnosis in Lebanon. FPG values of 100-125 mg/dL or HbA1c values of 5.7%-6.4% were agreed upon as indicative of prediabetes. For the management of prediabetes, a three-step approach constituting lifestyle modifications, pharmacological treatment and bariatric surgery is recommended. There should be more focus on research on prediabetes in Lebanon. This preliminary report will be further discussed with the Lebanese Society of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Lipids in 2021 in order to come up with the first Lebanese national guidelines for the detection and management of prediabetes in Lebanon.",Science progress,2021-,"Andari E, Atallah P, Azar S, Echtay A, Jambart S, Saab C, Howlett HC, Al-Naqshbandi M",8,1514,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33232247,Deep Learning for Diabetes: A Systematic Review.,"Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects an estimated 463 million people worldwide. Aiming to improve the treatment of people with diabetes, digital health has been widely adopted in recent years and generated a huge amount of data that could be used for further management of this chronic disease. Taking advantage of this, approaches that use artificial intelligence and specifically deep learning, an emerging type of machine learning, have been widely adopted with promising results. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the applications of deep learning within the field of diabetes. We conducted a systematic literature search and identified three main areas that use this approach: diagnosis of diabetes, glucose management, and diagnosis of diabetes-related complications. The search resulted in the selection of 40 original research articles, of which we have summarized the key information about the employed learning models, development process, main outcomes, and baseline methods for performance evaluation. Among the analyzed literature, it is to be noted that various deep learning techniques and frameworks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many diabetes-related tasks by outperforming conventional machine learning approaches. Meanwhile, we identify some limitations in the current literature, such as a lack of data availability and model interpretability. The rapid developments in deep learning and the increase in available data offer the possibility to meet these challenges in the near future and allow the widespread deployment of this technology in clinical settings.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2021-Jul,"Zhu T, Li K, Herrero P, Georgiou P",4,1632,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32341338,Use and abuse of dietary supplements in persons with diabetes.,"The dietary supplement industry has estimated sales of over $30 billion in the US and over $100 billion globally. Many consumers believe that dietary supplements are safer and possibly more effective than drugs to treat diabetes. The sheer volume of the literature in this space makes compiling them into one review challenging, so much so that primarily narrative reviews currently exist. By applying the interactive database supplied by the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health, we identified the top 100 ingredients that appeared most often in dietary supplement products. One-hundred different keyword searches using the ingredient name and the word diabetes were performed using a program developed to automatically scrape PubMed. Each search was retained in a separate Excel spreadsheet, which was then reviewed for inclusion or exclusion. The studies that met the inclusion criteria were evaluated for effect of reducing and controlling diabetes. The PubMed scrape resulted in 6217 studies. For each keyword search only the most recent 100 were retained, which refined the total to 1823 studies. Of these 425 met the screening criteria. The ingredients, fiber, selenium and zinc had the most studies associated with improvement in diabetes. Several popular supplement ingredients (phosphorus, pantothenic acid, calcium, magnesium, glutamine, isoleucine, tyrosine, choline, and creatine monohydrate) did not result in any studies meeting our screening criteria. Our study demonstrates how to automate reviews to filter and collapse literature in content areas that have an enormous volume of studies.

32903709,The Challenges in the Development of Diabetes Prevention and Care Models in Low-Income Settings.,"In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the burden of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes is rapidly rising, overpassing the existing burden of communicable diseases. Patients with diabetes living in low-income communities face unique challenges related to lack of awareness, difficulty in accessing health care systems and medications, and consequently failure in achieving optimal diabetes management and preventing complications. Effective diabetes prevention and care models could help reduce the rising burden by standardizing guidelines for prevention and management, improving access to care, engaging community and peers, improving the training of professionals and patients and using the newest technology in the management of the disease. In this article, we review the latest research and evidence on effective models of diabetes prevention and diabetes care delivery in low- income settings.

38642828,Virus-induced diabetes mellitus: revisiting infection etiology in light of SARS-CoV-2.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is comprised of two predominant subtypes: type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), accounting for approximately 5 % of cases worldwide and resulting from autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β-cells, and type 2 (T2DM), accounting for approximately 95 % of cases globally and characterized by the inability of pancreatic β-cells to meet the demand for insulin due to a relative β-cell deficit in the setting of peripheral insulin resistance. Both types of DM involve derangement of glucose metabolism and are metabolic diseases generally considered to be initiated by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Viruses have been reported to play a role as infectious etiological factors in the initiation of both types of DM in predisposed individuals. Among the reported viral infections causing DM in humans, the most studied include coxsackie B virus, cytomegalovirus and hepatitis C virus. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the diabetogenic potential of SARS-CoV-2, rekindling interest in the field of virus-induced diabetes (VID).

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis is aimed at determining the pooled national percentage of diabetic self-care practice and its determinants among adult diabetic patients in Ethiopian. Different electronic databases including PubMed/Medline and search engines such as Google scholar were used to retrieve published studies. The Joanna Briggs Institute quality appraisal checklists were used to appraise the quality of studies. Data were extracted using excel spreadsheets and analyses were done by STATA 14. Heterogeneity among studies was diagnosed using the I<sup>2</sup> test. The DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was employed for substantial heterogeneity (I2 > 50%). The pooled estimate of diabetic self-care and odds ratio was reported based on the 95% CI. A total of 3861 studies were identified, of which only 19 studies have reached the final qualitative synthesis and quantitative analysis. Well over half of the Ethiopian diabetic patients have good self-care 54.04% (47.07-61.01, I<sup>2</sup> = 97.3, P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis by region showed that the highest pooled estimate was observed in Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples 81.96% (71.85-92.04), I<sup>2</sup> = 89.1, p < 0.002), whereas the lowest was from the Harari region 44.53% (32.16-56.89%) I<sup>2</sup> = 94%, p < 0.001). Being knowledgeable about diabetes Mellitus 2.69 (1.62, 4.46; I2 = 99%, p < 0.001), having good social support 2.25 (1.49-3.39; I<sup>2</sup> = 99%, p = 0.00), owning private glucometer 3.04(1.64, 5.65; I<sup>2</sup> = 97.4, P < 0.001), and being urban residents 3.26 (2.24, 4.74; I<sup>2</sup> = 96.3%, P < 0.001) promote diabetic victims to apply self-care practice. Despite the life-threatening complications of diabetes Mellitus, the percentage of patients applying self-care has remained low in Ethiopia, depicting the high proportion of diabetic patients are prone to develop long and short-term sequelae of diabetes Mellitus. Therefore, improving the client's awareness about the disease and counseling clients about the significance of social support are believed to be possible strategies to improve self-care practice and policymakers are strongly recommended to combat complications to attain sustainable development goal 3.4 Aims to reduce premature death.

It affects more than 463 million people worldwide and is expected to reach 700 million by 2045. In the Southeast Asian region, the prevalence of DM has tripled to 115 million due to rapid urbanization, unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyles, and genetic factors. In Nepal, a developing country, DM affects 8.5% of adults, with an alarming increase in recent years. Lack of diabetes education and limited populational adoption of behavioural changes further hamper care. In the present study, we performed a scoping review to determine the status of awareness, attitudes, and knowledge about diabetes in the Nepalese population with a focus on the educational initiatives that have been implemented. We also conducted a two-week international case study discussion among medical students to brainstorm viable intervention strategies. Our findings indicate that limited data is available on the level of education or initiatives to improve knowledge and practice among healthcare professionals and community members. Targeted studies of people with diabetes also present heterogeneous results due to differences in the sample population, geographic location, education, age, and gender. Accordingly, we propose five interrelated education-based strategies that leverage existing networks to expand community outreach and engagement, improve system resilience, and improve health outcomes.

Patients with diabetes exhibit an increased risk to develop heart failure and the presence of both comorbidities has a major impact on the prognosis of these patients. Thus, it is of utmost importance to detect heart failure in patients with diabetes and to screen all patients with heart failure for the presence of diabetes. Moreover, the diagnosis of heart failure in diabetes often requires an adjustment of medical therapy.

It currently finds itself in a state of taxonomic dereliction and requires a long overdue refurbishment. Correct conceptualisation is a key precondition for knowledge development in this disorder. This article lays out the epistemological foundation for diabetes of the exocrine pancreas (DEP) and presents a synthesis of the current interdisciplinary discourse on diagnosing and classifying DEP. A diagnosis of DEP in people with no medical records of pre-existing diabetes is generally based on the most up-to-date biochemical criteria endorsed by the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes. The presence of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction is not considered a mandatory diagnostic criterion for DEP but is rather a significant risk factor for developing DEP. DEP principally comprises post-pancreatitis diabetes mellitus, pancreatic cancer-related diabetes, and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, which are mutually exclusive with autoimmune diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Other exclusions and stipulations apply. The DEP criteria will be instrumental in aiding optimal design and conduct of clinical studies, uniform collection of health utilisation data, meaningful comparison of scientific findings across countries, and clear communication among stakeholders (healthcare providers, patients, medical regulatory authorities, pharmaceutical industry).",European journal of endocrinology,2021-Apr,"Petrov MS, Basina M",2,1531,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
31490762,Dietary Phytonutrients in the Prevention of Diabetes-related Complications.,"The increasing prevalence of reported cases of diabetes has evidently become a major global public health concern. Although diabetes management is possible by the administration of synthetic anti-diabetic agents, there are profound side-effects associated with their long-term usage. Hence there is a demand for safer alternatives which could be possibly formulated using specific yet common phytonutrients. The main objective of this review is to describe the cellular mechanisms of phytonutrients as an alternative to commercially available synthetic anti-diabetic agents in the management of diabetes and related complications. Furthermore, the clinical evidence that supports this view is also highlighted. An in-depth review of published literature was carried out to identify the most promising phytonutrients in the management of diabetes and related complications. A number of phytonutrients are reported to be potential anti-diabetic agents. Few examples include biguanides, resveratrol, lycopene, thymoquinone and quercetin. However, suitable formulations using these phytonutrients and their clinical trials are still underway. Most of the reported findings focus on one aspect of several biochemical processes e.g. enhancement of glucose utilization, antioxidation, induction of insulin production, antiglycation, etc. An in-depth study of phytonutrients with respect to functional, immunological as well as biochemical factors suggesting their efficacy, as well as safety in the management of diabetes, is rarely reported. Our study thus highlights the abundance of clinical evidence of the efficiency of phytonutrients, and at the same time, the scarcity of clinically approved and marketed phytonutrients, as drugs, for the management of diabetes and related complications.",Current diabetes reviews,2020-,"Jha P, Kumari S, Jobby R, Desai N, Ali A",5,1788,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

When diabetes is not well controlled, it can cause complications and affect health-related quality of life. Determining the burden of diabetes in elderly patients can provide a good health-related quality of life. The study was conducted to examine the relationship between diabetes burden and health-related quality of life in elderly patients with diabetes. This is a descriptive and correlational study of 207 patients who applied to the diabetes outpatient clinics of a private and a public hospital in Istanbul. Respondents were completed with ""Personal Information Form for Elderly People"", ""Elderly Diabetes Burden Scale"" and the ""Quality of Life in the Elderly Scale"". Data were analyzed by SPSS. The tests used are Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal Wallis and Spearman Correlation tests. The mean total score from the Elderly Diabetes Burden Scale was 47.13 ± 11.95 (18-88), and the mean score from the Quality of Life in the Elderly Scale was 19.36 ± 7.00.

37157933,Use of hospital care among Dutch diabetes patients.,"To provide insight into healthcare resource utilization and hospital expenditure of patients treated for diabetes in Dutch hospitals. We conducted an observational cohort study of 193 840 patients aged ≥18 years and treated for diabetes mellitus in 65 Dutch hospitals in 2019 to 2020, using real-world reimbursement data. Consultations, hospitalizations, technology use, total hospital and diabetes care costs (encompassing all care for diabetes itself) were assessed during 1-year follow-up. In addition, expenditure was compared with that in the general Dutch population. Total hospital costs for all patients with diabetes were €1 352 690 257 (1.35 billion) per year, and 15.9% (€214 963 703) was associated with treatment of diabetes. Mean yearly costs per patient were €6978, with diabetes care costs of €1109. Mean hospital costs of patients exceeded that of the Dutch population three- to sixfold. Total hospital costs increased with age, whereas diabetes expenditure decreased with age (18-40 years, €1575; >70 years, €932). Of all patients with diabetes, 51.3% (n = 99 457) received care related to cardiovascular complications. Micro- and macrovascular complications, or a combination, increased hospital costs (1.4-5.3 times higher). The hospital resource use of Dutch diabetes patients is high, with a large burden of cardiovascular complications.

31797455,Behaviour change in diabetes: behavioural science advancements to support the use of theory.,"Behaviour is central to the management of diabetes, both for people living with diabetes and for healthcare professionals delivering evidence-based care. This review outlines the evolution of behavioural science and the application of theoretical models in diabetes care over the past 25 years. There has been a particular advancement in the development of tools and techniques to support researchers, healthcare professionals and policymakers in taking a theory-based approach, and to enhance the development, reporting and replication of successful interventions. Systematic guidance, theoretical frameworks and lists of behavioural techniques provide the tools to specify target behaviours, identify why ideal behaviours are not implemented, systematically develop theory-based interventions, describe intervention content using shared terminology, and evaluate their effects. Several examples from a range of diabetes-related behaviours (clinic attendance, self-monitoring of blood glucose, retinal screening, setting collaborative goals in diabetes) and populations (people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, healthcare professionals) illustrate the potential for these approaches to be widely translated into diabetes care. The behavioural science approaches outlined in this review give healthcare professionals, researchers and policymakers the tools to deliver care and design interventions with an evidence-based understanding of behaviour. The challenge for the next 25 years is to refine the tools to increase their use and advocate for the role of theoretical models and behavioural science in the commissioning, funding and delivery of diabetes care.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2020-Mar,"McSharry J, Byrne M, Casey B, Dinneen SF, Fredrix M, Hynes L, Lake AJ, Morrissey E",8,1662,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The WHO Diabetes Compact recommends that countries meet and monitor these targets for diabetes management. Surveillance-ie, continuous, systematic measurement, analysis, and interpretation of data-is a crucial component of public health. In this Personal View, we use the case of India as an illustration of the challenges and future directions needed for a diabetes surveillance system that documents national progress and persistent gaps. To address the growing burdens of diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases, the Government of India has launched programmes such as the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases. Different surveys have provided estimates of the diabetes care continuum of awareness, treatment, and control at the national, state, and, very recently, district level. We reviewed the literature to analyse how these surveys have varied in both their data collection methods and the reported estimates of the diabetes care continuum. We propose an integrated surveillance and monitoring framework to augment decentralised decision making, leveraging the complementary strengths of different surveys and electronic health record databases, such as data obtained by the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases, and building on methodological advances in model-based small-area estimation and data fusion. Such a framework could aid state and district administrators in monitoring the progress of diabetes screening and management initiatives, and benchmarking against national and global standards in all countries.",The lancet.

We examined the presence of microvascular and macrovascular disease in individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes by glycemic status within 3 years before diagnosis. We identified 159 736 individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink database in England between 2004 and 2017. We used logistic regression models to compare presence of microvascular (retinopathy and nephropathy) and macrovascular (acute coronary syndrome, cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial disease) disease at the time of type 2 diabetes diagnosis by prior glycemic status. Half of the study population (49.9%) had at least one vascular disease, over one-third (37.4%) had microvascular disease, and almost a quarter (23.5%) had a diagnosed macrovascular disease at the time of type 2 diabetes diagnosis.Compared with individuals with glycemic values within the normal range, those detected with pre-diabetes before the diagnosis had 76% and 14% increased odds of retinopathy and nephropathy (retinopathy: adjusted OR (AOR) 1.76, 95% CI 1.69 to 1.85; nephropathy: AOR 1.14, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.19), and 7% higher odds of the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.12) in fully adjusted models at time of diabetes diagnosis. Microvascular and macrovascular diseases are detected in 37%-24% of people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Pre-diabetes before diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is associated with increased odds of microvascular disease and acute coronary syndrome.

From 1998 to 2004, 159,755 adults from Mexico City were recruited to a prospective study, and from 2015 to 2019, 10,144 survivors were resurveyed. Diabetes was defined as self-reported diagnosis, glucose-lowering medication use, or HbA<sub>1c</sub> ≥6.5%. Controlled diabetes was defined as HbA<sub>1c</sub> <7%. Prevalence estimates were uniformly standardized for age, sex, and residential district. Cox models explored the relevance of controlled and inadequately controlled diabetes to cause-specific mortality. During 1998-2004 and 2015-2019, 99,623 and 8,986 participants were aged 45-84 years. Diabetes prevalence had increased from 26% in 1998-2004 to 35% by 2015-2019. Of those with diabetes, the proportion previously diagnosed had increased from 76% to 89%, and glucose-lowering medication use among them had increased from 80% to 94%. Median HbA<sub>1c</sub> among those with diabetes had decreased from 8.2% to 7.3%, and the proportion of participants with controlled diabetes had increased from 16% to 37%. Use of blood pressure-lowering medication among those with previously diagnosed diabetes had increased from 35% to 51%, and their use of lipid-lowering therapy had increased from 1% to 14%. The excess mortality risk associated with diabetes accounted for 34% of deaths at ages 35-74 years, of which 5% were attributable to controlled and 29% to inadequately controlled diabetes.

33186216,Novel management of diabetes in kidney transplantation.,"Posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a prevalent complication in kidney transplant recipients, and has been associated with worse short-term and long-term outcomes. While hyperglycemia is frequently seen in the early posttransplant period because of surgical stress, infection, and use of high-dose steroids, the diagnosis of PTDM should be established after patients are clinically stable and on stable maintenance immunosuppression. In the early posttransplant period, hyperglycemia is typically treated with insulin, and pilot data have suggested potential benefit of lower vs. higher glycemic targets in this setting. Growing data indicate lifestyle modifications, including dietary interventions, physical activity, and mitigation of obesity, are associated with improved posttransplant outcomes. While there are limited data to support a first-line antidiabetic medication for PTDM, more established pharmacotherapies such as sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and dipetidyl peptidase IV inhibitors are commonly used. Given recent trials showing the benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists upon kidney outcomes in nontransplant patients, further study of these agents specifically in kidney transplant recipients are urgently needed. Increasing evidence supports a multidisciplinary approach, including lifestyle modification, obesity treatment, judicious immunosuppression selection, and careful utilization of novel antidiabetic therapies in PTDM patients.",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,2021-Jan,"Ong SC, Rhee CM",2,1524,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Despite the improvements in therapy, the clinical management of DM patients remains challenging as they develop more extensive CAD at a younger age and consistently have worse clinical outcomes than non-DM patients. Current diagnostic modalities as well as revascularisation treatments mainly focus on ischemic lesions. However, the impact of plaque morphology and composition are emerging as strong predictors of adverse cardiac events even in the absence of identified ischemia. In particular, the presence of vulnerable plaques such as thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) lesions has been identified as a very strong predictor of future adverse events. This emphasises the need for an approach combining both functional and morphological methods in the assessment of lesions. In particular, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has proven to be a valuable asset by truly identifying TCFAs. New treatment strategies should consist of individualised and advanced medical regimens and may evolve towards plaque sealing through percutaneous treatment.",Cardiovascular diabetology,2023-May,"Hommels TM, Hermanides RS, Fabris E, Kedhi E",4,1211,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We aimed to investigate changes in these outcomes of diabetes as depressive symptoms aggravate. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 14 328 participants in the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants were classified into depressive symptom groups of none, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depending on their Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted in three models adjusted for expanding confounders to evaluate the associations between severity of depressive symptoms and prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of DM. As depressive symptom severity worsened, both prevalence and awareness of DM increased regardless of models (p value for trend <0.01 in all models for prevalence and awareness; adjusted OR (aOR) 2.14, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.56 for prevalence in the severe group, model 1; aOR 2.43, 95% CI 1.27 to 4.64 for awareness in the moderately severe group, model 1). Notwithstanding higher awareness of diabetes in the moderately severe and severe groups (84.5% and 86.2%, respectively, vs 71.3% in the none group), these groups were treated less (aOR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.55 in the severe group, model 3) or inadequately controlled (aOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.98 in the moderately severe group, model 3).

32458291,Review of the veteran affairs diabetes trial: Lessons learned.,"Despite robust evidence linking long-term hyperglycemia with cardiovascular complications, several large randomized trials found only modest benefits from intensive compared to standard glucose control. Of these trials, the Veteran Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT), offers a unique long-term perspective in that there were analyses of outcomes at the end of the intervention trial, 5-years post-trial, and after 10-years post-trial. From the VADT and other large trials, we draw several valuable lessons that are relevant to the care of patients with type 2 diabetes. Intensive glucose control reduces development of nephropathy and retinopathy but not neuropathy, though evaluations of neuropathy are less consistent and conclusions regarding outcomes less reliable. While the VADT did not demonstrate reduction in cardiovascular outcomes at completion of the glucose lowering intervention, it did demonstrate a 17% reduction 5-years post-trial, which waned by 10-years post-trial observation. Of interest, the 5-year post trial period included 3 additional years of HbA1c separation between treatment groups which suggests that longer-term glucose control may be needed before benefits are seen. Other factors including hypoglycemia and increased glucose variation are also associated with cardiovascular events and are more prevalent during intensive glucose control, potentially lessening the benefit of lowering average glucose levels. Finally, intensive glucose control requires substantial effort from both the patient and clinician perspective. All of these factors must be kept in mind when considering the benefits of aggressive glucose control for each patient.",Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,2020-Dec,"Tran K, Reaven P",2,1669,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The most alarming is possibly the escalation propensity of diabetes, in recent years, where a nearly ten-fold increase has been witnessed over the past thirty years in Saudi Arabia. However, the number of research arbitrations on the prevalence and incidence of DM is woefully inadequate, as compared to developed countries. Apart from this, most of the existing research data carried out in Saudi Arabia is cross-sectional, with small sample sizes, which most often involve only certain parts of the country.

Many of the clinical signs associated with feline HAC are subtle and may be attributed to concurrent DM or the aging process. Failure to recognize HAC in the diabetic cat can impact patient wellbeing and predispose the patient to progressive compromise. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to establish a diagnosis of HAC, as test results may be influenced by poor diabetic regulation, and protocols are different to those used in canine patients. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause, and often require careful, ongoing assessment and modulation of both adrenal function and insulin requirements. However, various approaches have been shown to either improve glycemic control in cats with sustained insulin dependence, or facilitate diabetic remission. This review summarizes the current literature on feline HAC, with a particular focus on cats with concurrent DM. The clinical findings that suggest HAC are discussed, along with an outline of diagnostic options and their limitations. Published outcomes for various medical options, surgical procedures and radiation therapy are provided. The authors also share their thoughts on the safe and effective management of cats with HAC and DM, with an emphasis on the anticipation and recognition of changing insulin requirements.",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,2021-Jan,"Cook AK, Evans JB",2,1682,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34029524,A Comprehensive Cardiovascular-Renal-Metabolic Risk Reduction Approach to Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Despite decades of research into risk-reduction strategies, cardiovascular disease and renal disease remain leading causes of morbidity and mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given the tight clustering of cardiovascular and renal disease with the metabolic abnormalities of type 2 diabetes mellitus, we can think of these conditions together as cardiovascular-renal-metabolic disease states. A holistic view of cardiovascular-renal-metabolic disease states is critical to provide integrated patient-centered care to individuals with these disease states. Here, we explore the cardiovascular and renal risks associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and highlight the importance of reducing cardiovascular-renal-metabolic disease risk in a comprehensive manner. We advocate a cross-disciplinary, team-based model to manage cardiovascular-renal-metabolic disease risk among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",The American journal of medicine,2021-Sep,"Pagidipati NJ, Deedwania P",2,931,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We evaluated the association of early rhythm control (ERC), lifestyle modification (LSM), and a combination of ERC and LSM with cardiovascular or diabetes-related complication risk in patients with AF-DM (type 2). From the National Health Information Database, 47,940 patients diagnosed with AF-DM in 2009-2016 were included. We defined ERC as rhythm control therapy within two years of AF diagnosis and LSM as adherence to ≥ 2 of the healthy behaviors among non-current smoking, non-drinking, and regular exercise. We compared the primary (ischemic stroke) and secondary (macro- and microvascular complications, glycemic emergency, and all-cause death) outcomes in four groups: non-ERC and non-LSM (group 1), LSM only (group 2), ERC only (group 3), and both ERC and LSM (group 4). Of total, 10,617 (22%), 26,730 (55.8%), 2,903 (6.1%), and 7,690 (16.0%) were classified into groups 1 to 4, in sequence. The mean duration from AF diagnosis to ERC was 25.6 ± 75.5 days.

Conflicting findings from previous studies have resulted in inconsistencies in guidelines regarding DR management in pregnancy. Global estimates of DR prevalence and progression in pregnancy are therefore required to provide clearer information about the overall true burden of DR in this population. To estimate the prevalence of DR and its progression rate in pregnant women with preexisting T1D or T2D diagnosed before pregnancy. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, conducted from November 27, 2018, to June 29, 2021, a systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE/Ovid, Embase/Ovid, and Scopus databases to identify English-language articles that were published from inception through October 2020. Observational studies that reported on DR and its changes in pregnant women with preexisting T1D and T2D. Two independent reviewers extracted relevant data from each included study. Data were pooled using a random-effects model with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. This study followed the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) reporting guidelines. Prevalence of any DR, proliferative DR (PDR), and DR progression rates. A total of 18 observational studies involving 1464 pregnant women with T1D and 262 pregnant women with T2D were included in the analysis. The pooled prevalence of any DR and PDR in early pregnancy was 52.3 (95% CI, 41.9-62.6) and 6.1 (95% CI, 3.1-9.8) per 100 pregnancies, respectively. The pooled progression rate per 100 pregnancies for new DR development was 15.0 (95% CI, 9.9-20.8), worsened nonproliferative DR was 31.0 (95% CI, 23.2-39.2), progression from nonproliferative DR to PDR was 6.3 (95% CI, 3.3-10.0), and worsened PDR was 37.0 (95% CI, 21.2-54.0). DR progression rates per 100 pregnancies were similar between the T1D and T2D groups, except for the development of new DR (T1D groups: 15.8; 95% CI, 10.5-21.9; T2D groups: 9.0; 95% CI, 4.9-14.8). A global trend toward a lower DR progression rate was observed after the 1989 St Vincent Declaration. Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that women with T1D and T2D had a similar risk of DR progression during pregnancy.

This secondary data analysis study used data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. The participants comprised 186 patients who did not have diabetes at baseline, but developed hyperglycemia at the first follow-up. The average and median periods until DM diagnosis and treatment were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Of the 186 participants, 57.0% were men and 35.5% were 40-49 years old. The average time to DM diagnosis and treatment was 10.87 years and 11.34 years, respectively. The risk factors for the duration of DM were current smoking, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood sugar (FBS), and postprandial 2-hour glucose (PP2). The risk factors for the duration of diabetes treatment were current smoking, hypertension, BMI, FBS, and PP2. The development of one or more comorbidities or diabetes complications was identified at the time of DM diagnosis (36.5%) and DM treatment (41.4%).

39408828,Monogenic Defects of Beta Cell Function: From Clinical Suspicion to Genetic Diagnosis and Management of Rare Types of Diabetes.,"Monogenic defects of beta cell function refer to a group of rare disorders that are characterized by early-onset diabetes mellitus due to a single gene mutation affecting insulin secretion. It accounts for up to 5% of all pediatric diabetes cases and includes transient or permanent neonatal diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), and various syndromes associated with diabetes. Causative mutations have been identified in genes regulating the development or function of the pancreatic beta cells responsible for normal insulin production and/or release. To date, more than 40 monogenic diabetes subtypes have been described, with those caused by mutations in <i>HNF1A</i> and <i>GCK</i> genes being the most prevalent. Despite being caused by a single gene mutation, each type of monogenic diabetes, especially MODY, can appear with various clinical phenotypes, even among members of the same family. This clinical heterogeneity, its rarity, and the fact that it shares some features with more common types of diabetes, can make the clinical diagnosis of monogenic diabetes rather challenging. Indeed, several cases of MODY or syndromic diabetes are accurately diagnosed in adulthood, after having been mislabeled as type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The recent widespread use of more reliable sequencing techniques has improved monogenic diabetes diagnosis, which is important to guide appropriate treatment and genetic counselling. The current review aims to summarize the latest knowledge on the clinical presentation, genetic confirmation, and therapeutic approach of the various forms of monogenic defects of beta cell function, using three imaginary clinical scenarios and highlighting clinical and laboratory features that can guide the clinician in reaching the correct diagnosis.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024-Sep,"Serbis A, Kantza E, Siomou E, Galli-Tsinopoulou A, Kanaka-Gantenbein C, Tigas S",6,1798,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This study aimed to investigate the interrelationships between the age of onset, frailty, anti-diabetic medications and clinical outcomes in people with diabetes mellitus (DM). A total of 123,172 people aged 40 years and older who were newly diagnosed with DM were identified and categorised into four frailty subgroups (robust, mild, moderate and severe) based on the multimorbidity frailty index (mFI). Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine associations between frailty and clinical outcomes at different ages of DM onsets (40-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ years). Outcomes of interest included generic outcomes (mortality and unplanned hospitalisation) and DM-related outcomes (cardiovascular disease-related mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), diabetes-related hospitalisation and hypoglycaemia). The proportion of frailty increased with age at diagnosis amongst people with incident DM and the mFI scores increased significantly during the 10-year follow-up. Amongst people with diabetes, those with mild, moderate and severe frailty were associated with greater risks of all-cause mortality (mild: adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.69 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60-1.80], P < 0.01; moderate: aHR 2.46 [2.29-2.65], P < 0.01; severe frailty: aHR 3.40 [3.16-3.65], P < 0.01) compared with the robust group. Similar results were found in unplanned hospitalisations, cardiovascular disease-related mortality, MACEs and hypoglycaemia.

People experience negative affect after diagnoses, which can impede self-regulation of health behaviours. Self-compassion, extending care to oneself in difficult times, can mitigate negative affect and promote self-regulation. This scoping review explored the relationship between self-compassion and adaptive affect, self-regulation and engagement in health-promoting/management behaviours among people with prediabetes or diabetes. We conducted a scoping literature search from 6 databases for studies and conference abstracts. Randomized controlled trials and cross-sectional, longitudinal, observational and qualitative designs focused on self-compassion were included. Eligible studies included adults with diabetes (prediabetes, type 1, type 2 and gestational), measured self-compassion using a validated Self-Compassion Scale (quantitative) or included the 3 components (qualitative) and investigated: negative affect, health promoting/management behaviours and/or self-regulation. After deduplication, 5,338 quantitative and 953 qualitative abstracts, and 18 conference proceedings were screened leaving 35 articles. Full-text screening retained 11 eligible studies (6 cross-sectional studies, 2 randomized controlled trials, 2 longitudinal studies and 1 qualitative study). Higher self-compassion was associated with decreased negative affect in 9 studies and was positively associated with well-being in 1 cross-sectional study. Self-compassion led to decreased negative affect and improved blood glucose in 2 interventions.

33860488,Metformin for Preventing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Women with a Previous Diagnosis of Gestational Diabetes: A Narrative Review.,"Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) when compared with women who have not had GDM. To delay or prevent T2DM, guidelines recommend regular screening in the primary care setting and lifestyle interventions that are largely focused on dietary and physical activity modifications. As the postpartum period can be challenging for women, uptake and engagement in screening and lifestyle interventions have been poor. Poor uptake and engagement places women with a history of GDM at heightened risk for future morbidity and development of T2DM. Metformin has been a longstanding and safe treatment for the control of blood glucose in people with T2DM. Research has supported the efficacy of metformin, used as an adjunct to a lifestyle intervention or as a stand-alone treatment, in preventing T2DM in people at high risk of T2DM. Findings from longitudinal studies have demonstrated the potential for metformin to reduce conversion to T2DM when used by women with a previous diagnosis of GDM. This review examines the potential effectiveness of metformin to reduce the incidence of T2DM among women with a previous diagnosis of GDM in the ""real-world"" setting.",Seminars in reproductive medicine,2020-Nov,"Versace VL, Beks H, Wesley H, McNamara K, Hague W, Anjana RM, Mohan V, Khunti K, Dunbar JA",9,1244,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

However, the result of these studies lacks consistency. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis estimates the pooled level of HRQoL and their associated factors among diabetic patients in sub-Saharan countries. Electronic databases predominantly PubMed were searched. Databases, such as Google and Google scholar, were searched for gray literature. A funnel plot and Egger's regression test were used to see publication bias. Heterogeneity of the studies was checked by Forest plot and I-squared statistic. Both inverse-variance fixed-effect and DerSimonian and Laird random-effects methods were applied to estimate the pooled level of HRQoL (for both WHO-QoL-BREF and SF-36) and the effect size of associated factors. From a total 776 retrieved studies, 16 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled mean score of physical health, psychological, social relation and environmental health domain of WHO-QoL-BREF were 43.12, 47.40, 46.60 and 45.59 respectively. Age had a significant association (pooled β = - 0.47), (pooled β = - 0.24), (pooled β = - 0.32) and (pooled β = - 0.03) with physical health, psychological health, social relation and environmental health domains respectively. Being rural residence (pooled β = - 0.32) was inversely associated with environmental health domain of WHO-QoL-BREF. Increased fasting blood sugar had a significant association (pooled β = - 0.08, 95% CI - 0.11, - 0.05), (pooled β = - 0.07) and (pooled β = - 0.004) with physical health, psychological health and environmental health domains respectively. Having Co-morbidity (pooled β = - 6.25) and diabetes related complication (pooled β = - 5.65) were contrarily related to physical health domain of WHO-QoL-BREF. The pooled mean of physical and environmental domains of HRQOL scores was the least compared to the psychological and social domains. Being Old age and rural residence, increased fasting blood sugar, having co-morbidity and diabetic related complications were contrarily related to level of HRQoL. Therefore, we recommend that early detection and treatment of diabetes related complication and comorbidity and control of fasting blood sugar.

32566680,Measuring the Quality of Life in Diabetic Patients: A Scoping Review.,"Diabetes mellitus is a widely diffused chronic condition which impacts on several aspects of patients' lives. In the current clinical practice, the implementation in the clinical routine of monitoring systems of patients' outcomes has led to an increased generation and use of several measures for the assessment of patients' quality of life (QOL). Nevertheless, this construct appears to be particularly complex, and its operationalization is variable across different measures. The purpose of this paper is to offer an updated review of the diabetes-specific QOL measures present in scientific literature with a specific focus on the broad domains assessed. A scoping review was carried out with the purpose of identifying the existing measures in literature and describing their implicit representation of QOL in diabetes care. Five different databases (Scopus; Web of Science Core Collection; Medline; PsycInfo; and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched with a string including validation studies of adult-only, diabetes-specific QOL measures. Each measure was then qualified according to its structure, a qualitative assessment of the broad domains of QOL it comprises, and finally an overview of the psychometric properties of its first validation. 30 scales were identified and assessed. Theme analysis shows that QOL is operationalized with multidimensional surveys comprising of both mental, physical, and social health components. Some scales also consider the impact of societal attitudes, public policies, and context on QOL. Several self-report measures of QOL specifically developed for diabetic patients exist in scientific literature. The present scoping review reports scales structure, broad domains of QOL, and development purpose. This may help in understanding the concept of QOL in diabetic patients and may also serve the purpose of guiding the reader in the choice of the most appropriate instrument or in the development of a new one.",Journal of diabetes research,2020-,"Palamenghi L, Carlucci MM, Graffigna G",3,1983,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Poor glycemic control, longer duration, and poor medication adherence increased the risk of DM complications. Comprehensive evidence on the pooled prevalence of microvascular complications in DM patients in Ethiopia is not available. Furthermore, individual study findings for the prevalence of microvascular complications in DM patients, and associated factors were not consistent. This systemic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the pooled prevalence of microvascular complications in DM patients, and its associated risk factors in Ethiopia. Systematic search on Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct electronic database, Google Scholar search engine, and library registration was used to identify relevant studies following reviews and meta-analysis guidelines. Microsoft Excel spreadsheets were used to extract data, and Extracted data was analyzed using STATA software version 17.0. A Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the role of each study in the final result and the presence of publication bias was assessed by Egger's test. Heterogeneity across studies was checked by Cochran's Q statistic and I2 statistics and significant heterogeneity was assessed using subgroup analysis. The pooled prevalence of microvascular complications in DM patients was 32.89 % (95 % CI: 28.17-37.60). In addition, the pooled prevalence of retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy in DM patients was 17.16 % (95 % CI: 12-22 %), 10.49 % (95 % CI: 8-13 %) and 11.52 % (95 % CI: 9-15 %) respectively.

SIRT1 is also capable of deacetylation of transcription factors, as well as other regulatory proteins. The SIRT1 activity plays a unique role in the prevention of metabolic memory, reducing many pathways leading to chronic diabetic complications or diseases concomitant with diabetes. Factors modifying expression and/or activity of SIRT1 may be especially helpful for patients with diabetes. This article attempts to sum up the current state of knowledge about agents commonly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes which might have an impact on the SIRT1 expression and activity.

38870560,Incretin therapy in feline diabetes mellitus - A review of the current state of research.,"Incretin hormones potentiate the glucose-induced insulin secretion following enteral nutrient intake. The best characterised incretin hormones are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) which are produced in and secreted from the gut in response to nutrient ingestion. The property of incretins to enhance endogenous insulin secretion only at elevated blood glucose levels makes them interesting therapeutics for type 2 diabetes mellitus with a better safety profile than exogenous insulin. While incretin therapeutics (especially GLP-1 agonists, and more recently also GLP-1 / GIP dual agonists and other drugs that influence the incretin metabolism (e.g., dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors)) are already widely used treatment options for human type 2 diabetes, these drugs are not yet approved for the therapy of feline diabetes mellitus. This review provides an introduction to incretins and feline diabetes mellitus in general and summarises the current study situation on incretins as therapeutics for feline diabetes mellitus to assess their possible future potential in feline medicine. Studies to date on the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) in healthy cats largely confirm their insulinotropic effect known from other species. In diabetic cats, GLP-1RAs appear to significantly reduce glycaemic variability (GV, an indicator for the quality of glycaemic control), which is important for the management of the disease and prevention of long-term complications. However, for widespread use in feline diabetes mellitus, further studies are required that include larger numbers of diabetic cats, and that consider and test a possible need for dose adjustments to overweight and diabetic cats. Also evaluation of the outcome of GLP-1RA monotherapy will be neceessary.",Domestic animal endocrinology,2024-Oct,"Haller N, Lutz TA",2,1835,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

33217903,Diabetes Mellitus Is a Chronic Disease that Can Benefit from Therapy with Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality, with an increasing incidence worldwide. The impact of DM on public health in developing countries has triggered alarm due to the exaggerated costs of the treatment and monitoring of patients with this disease. Considerable efforts have been made to try to prevent the onset and reduce the complications of DM. However, because insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells progressively deteriorate, many people must receive insulin through subcutaneous injection. Additionally, current therapies do not have consistent results regarding the prevention of chronic complications. Leveraging the approval of real-time continuous glucose monitors and sophisticated algorithms that partially automate insulin infusion pumps has improved glycemic control, decreasing the burden of diabetes management. However, these advances are facing physiologic barriers. New findings in molecular and cellular biology have produced an extraordinary advancement in tissue development for the treatment of DM. Obtaining pancreatic β-cells from somatic cells is a great resource that currently exists for patients with DM. Although this therapeutic option has great prospects for patients, some challenges remain for this therapeutic plan to be used clinically. The purpose of this review is to describe the new techniques in cell biology and regenerative medicine as possible treatments for DM. In particular, this review highlights the origin of induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) and how they have begun to emerge as a regenerative treatment that may mitigate the pathology of this disease.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020-Nov,"Arroyave F, Montaño D, Lizcano F",3,1640,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The interest in measuring QoL in relation to clinical treatment and interventions has led to an increase in the development and use of QoL measures. The vast number of available instruments can be a barrier for establishing evidence and can be overwhelming for clinicians and researchers who are interested in measuring QoL of children with diabetes. As a first step for reaching consensus, we aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the application of QoL instruments used in children (2-18 years old) with diabetes.

Addressing the heterogeneity of T2D is a major task of diabetes research to lower the high rate of treatment failure as well as to reduce the risk of long-term complications. A pathophysiology-based clustering system seems the most promising to help in the stratification of diabetes in terms of complication risk and response to treatment. This urges for clinical studies looking at novel biomarkers related to the different metabolic pathways of T2D and able to inform about the therapeutic cluster of each patient.

For interim analysis, clinical data were obtained from medical records for 79 patients. 22.8% of patients developed NODAT in the first post-transplant year. <i>GSTP1 rs1695</i> and <i>rs1138272</i> polymorphisms were associated with an increased risk for NODAT. <i>NR3C1</i> rs6198 polymorphism was associated with higher serum glucose at the end of the first post-transplant year. The observed incidence of NODAT in the first post-transplant year is in accordance with the literature data. <i>GSTP1</i> genotypes leading to decreased conjugation capacity were associated with higher probability of NODAT. As these polymorphisms can be determined already before kidney transplantation, they can help planning early glucocorticoid withdrawal if a favorable post-transplant course permits it.",Clinical nephrology,,"Pahor K, Maver B, Blagus T, Vončina B, Praznik M, Goričar K, Dolžan V, Arnol M, Mlinšek G",9,1365,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32539915,Recent clinical advances of glucokinase activators in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2.,"Glucokinase (GK) is an isozyme of hexokinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose. GK is present in many organs of the human body, including the liver and pancreas. GK plays an important role in promoting the synthesis of hepatic glycogen and balancing postprandial blood glucose. Mutations in the GK gene can result in the inclusion of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY2) and permanent neonatal Diabetes mellitus (PNDM). Glucokinase activators (GKAs) are a class of type 2 diabetes drugs designed for this target. In various animal models of type 2 diabetes, GKAs have been shown to have the ability to decrease blood glucose, and some GKAs also have the ability to stimulate β cell proliferation. However, due to the induction of hypoglycemia and increased liver burden, many candidates stopped in phase II clinical trials. Recently, dorzagliatin has reached the primary endpoint of phase III clinical trial, which can repair the core function of GK as a blood glucose sensor, and can delay or even reverse islet β -cell damage and functional decline. This provides a promising prospect for the study of GKAs as candidates for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This review summarizes the clinical advances in GKAs.",Die Pharmazie,2020-Jun,"Li W, Zhang X, Sun Y, Liu Z",4,1234,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

They improve glycemic control by inducing glucosuria. Notwithstanding with potent anti-hyperglycemic activity, SGLT2 inhibitors are emerging as drugs with multifaceted therapeutic potential, evidenced for cardioprotective, renoprotective, antihypertensive, and neuroprotective activities. Continuous attempts are being accomplished through structural modification, development of new formulation, or combination with other drugs, to enhance the bioactivity spectrum of SGLT2 inhibitors for better management of diabetes and related complications. This review comprises a summary of patent applications, acquired using the Espacenet Patent Search database, concerning SGLT2 inhibitors from 2019 to 2023, with focus on improving therapeutic potentials in management of diabetes and metabolic complications. SGLT2 inhibitors have provided an exciting treatment option for diabetes. Originally developed as anti-hyperglycemic agents, SGLT2 inhibitors exert pleiotropic metabolic responses and have emerged as promising antidiabetic agents with cardio-protective and reno-protective activities. Given their distinct therapeutic profile, SGLT2 inhibitors have revolutionized the management of diabetes and associated complications.

36757165,Adverse Effects of Tacrolimus and Its Associated Risk Factors in Renal Transplant Recipients.,"Tacrolimus, an important constituent of the immunosuppressant regimen for renal transplant recipients, can result in posttransplant diabetes mellitus. The adverse effect profile of tacrolimus is yet to be completely understood. The relationship between the blood level of tacrolimus and development of posttransplant diabetes mellitus has not been clearly elucidated in Indian populations. We conducted this study to investigate the frequency of posttransplant diabetes mellitus and other adverse effects of tacrolimus, to enumerate the risk factors associated with posttransplant diabetes mellitus development, and to correlate the blood levels of tacrolimus with its occurrence. This prospective observational study included 77 renal transplant patients receiving tacrolimus. The blood sugar levels (fasting and postprandial) were monitored, and patients were asked regularly about the adverse effects of tacrolimus experienced by them for 6 months posttransplant. Trough levels of tacrolimus in blood were correlated with occurrence of posttransplant diabetes mellitus. Posttransplant diabetes mellitus developed in 62.3% (48/77) of renal transplant recipients on a tacrolimus-based regimen. Other adverse effects observed included tremors, diarrhea, alopecia, cyto- megalovirus infection, headache, biopsy-proven calci- neurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and BK virus infection. Higher tacrolimus trough level at month 1 posttransplant was significantly associated with the development of posttransplant diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio = 1.379; 95% CI, 1.02-1.86). The best cutoff of tacrolimus trough level at month 1 posttransplant to reduce the risk of posttransplant diabetes mellitus was 8.1 ng/mL. There was a 5 times increased risk of developing posttransplant diabetes mellitus when tacrolimus trough level at month 1 posttransplant was >8.1 ng/mL (adjusted odds ratio = 5.4; 95% CI, 1.4-19.9). Posttransplant diabetes mellitus is a common adverse effect of tacrolimus among renal transplant recipients. A trough level >8.1 ng/mL at month 1 posttransplant was an important predictor for posttransplant diabetes mellitus.",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,2023-Jan,"Meera M, Manikandan S, Parameswaran S",3,2160,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This is a qualitative study where participants were invited to respond by direct interview to a standard questionnaire that is validated by the World Health Organization (WHO), ""Tool for Assessment of Diabetic Retinopathy and DM Management Systems"". The questionnaire casts out of the WHO Health Systems Framework concept, assessing the presence of programs, guidelines, health technology and workforce, health promotion, and financing of DM and DR care in Jordan. Forty-two participants were included. DM is considered as priority in Jordan, but no programs are implemented. National guidelines are present for DM but not for DR. Networking should be improved between different disciplines caring for DM and DR. Human resources for DM and DR care were found insufficient and inadequately distributed. Health technology is only present in major cities and central hospitals. There is no nationwide data on disease burden nor a screening program for DR. More collaborated efforts should be spent on health education and raising awareness among people living with diabetes about the risk of DR. Advanced DM and DR care is not accessible to most people.

33475814,Association of diabetes type and chronic diabetes complications with early exit from the labour force: register-based study of people with diabetes in Finland.,"Diabetes and diabetes complications are a cause of substantial morbidity, resulting in early exits from the labour force and lost productivity. The aim of this study was to examine differences in early exits between people with type 1 and 2 diabetes and to assess the role of chronic diabetes complications on early exit. We also estimated the economic burden of lost productivity due to early exits. People of working age (age 17-64) with diabetes in 1998-2011 in Finland were detected using national registers (N<sub>type 1</sub> = 45,756, N<sub>type 2</sub> = 299,931). For the open cohort, data on pensions and deaths, healthcare usage, medications and basic demographics were collected from the registers. The outcome of the study was early exit from the labour force defined as pension other than old age pension beginning before age 65, or death before age 65. We analysed the early exit outcome and its risk factors using the Kaplan-Meier method and extended Cox regression models. We fitted linear regression models to investigate the risk factors of lost working years and productivity costs among people with early exit. The difference in median age at early exit from the labour force between type 1 (54.0) and type 2 (58.3) diabetes groups was 4.3 years. The risk of early exit among people with type 1 diabetes increased faster after age 40 compared with people with type 2 diabetes. Each of the diabetes complications was associated with an increase in the hazard of early exit regardless of diabetes type compared with people without the complication, with eye-related complications as an exception. Diabetes complications partly but not completely explained the difference between diabetes types. The mean lost working years was 6.0 years greater in the type 1 diabetes group than in the type 2 diabetes group among people with early exit. Mean productivity costs of people with type 1 diabetes and early exit were found to be 1.4-fold greater compared with people with type 2 diabetes. The total productivity costs of incidences of early exits in the type 2 diabetes group were notably higher compared with the type 1 group during the time period (€14,400 million, €2800 million). We found a marked difference in the patterns of risk of early exit between people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The difference was largest close to statutory retirement age. On average, exits in the type 1 diabetes group occurred at an earlier age and resulted in higher mean lost working years and mean productivity costs. The potential of prevention, timely diagnosis and management of diabetes is substantial in terms of avoiding reductions in individual well-being and productivity.",Diabetologia,2021-Apr,"Kurkela O, Forma L, Ilanne-Parikka P, Nevalainen J, Rissanen P",5,2688,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We sought to describe the clinical care of individuals with prediabetes, determine patient factors associated with this care, and evaluate risk for diabetes development. Retrospective cohort study using linked claims and electronic health record data. We created a cohort of adults with prediabetes based on laboratory measures. We excluded patients with a prior history of diabetes, pregnancy in prior 6 months, or recent steroid use. We measured ordering and completion of clinical services targeting prediabetes management and diabetes incidence within 12 months following cohort entry. We tested the strength of the association between individuals' characteristics and outcomes of interest using bivariate and multiple logistic regression. Our cohort included 3888 patients with a laboratory diagnosis of prediabetes (incident or prevalent prediabetes). Within 12 months, 63.4% had repeat glycemic testing, yet only 10.4% had coded diagnoses of prediabetes, 1.0% were referred for nutrition services, and 5.4% were prescribed metformin. Most patients completed labs and nutrition visits when referred and filled metformin when prescribed. Individuals with a higher glycemic level or BMI were more likely to receive prediabetes clinical care. Six percent of individuals developed diabetes within 12 months of cohort entry and had higher glycemic levels and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. In the adjusted model, Black individuals had 1.4 times higher odds of developing diabetes than White individuals. Rates of prediabetes clinical care activities are low and have not improved.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to determine the relationship between metformin use and ND risk based on data from population-based cohort studies. Articles were systematically searched in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs were obtained using a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses and meta-regression were performed to identify the sources of heterogeneity and strengthen the results. Twelve population-based cohort studies involving 194,792 participants (94,462 metformin users and 100,330 metformin non-users) were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The pooled RR of NDs reached 0.77 (95% CI 0.67-0.88) when comparing metformin users with non-users. The effects were more prominent in long-term metformin users (≥4 years) (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13-0.44) and studies from Asian countries (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.64-0.74). The effect estimates were stable when stratified by subtypes of NDs, study designs, and control definitions (p for interaction >0.05). Meta-regression did not identify the coefficients as the sources of heterogeneity (all p > 0.05).

An online survey developed using a rapid Delphi method. The survey was translated into 17 different languages and disseminated electronically in 27 countries via national diabetes nurse networks. Survey responses from 1829 diabetes nurses were included in the analysis. The responses indicated that 28% (n = 504) and 48% (n = 873) of diabetes nurses felt the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted 'a lot' on the physical and psychological risks of people with diabetes, respectively. The following clinical problems were identified as having increased 'a lot': anxiety 82% (n = 1486); diabetes distress 65% (n = 1189); depression 49% (n = 893); acute hyperglycaemia 39% (n = 710) and foot complications 18% (n = 323). Forty-seven percent (n = 771) of respondents identified that the level of care provided to people with diabetes had declined either extremely or quite severely.

Overall, diabetic patients with HDHP were less likely to adhere to treatment and prescription refills, utilize fewer healthcare services and medications, and more likely to have acute emergency visits than their counterparts enrolled in low-deductible plans. However, the results on overall healthcare costs and the final health outcome were unclear. It appears that HDHPs negatively impact low-income diabetic patients by leading them to forgo preventive and primary care services and experience excessive preventable emergency department visits.

The Risk Assessment and Management Program (RAMP) in Hong Kong has been providing long-term face-to-face follow-up to DM patients in the government out-patient clinics since 2009. However, under the current outbreak of COVID-19, these face-to-face consultations were ceased over and over again to lower the risk of disease transmission. With the advancement in technology, the recent emergence of telecare has provided an alternative to replace the conventional consultations in the clinics.

SGLT2 inhibitors have been studied in patients with T1DM in phase 3 clinical trials such as the inTandem, DEPICT, and EASE trials, which demonstrated consistent reductions in HbA1c. Secondary analyses of these trials have also reported potential kidney protective effects that are independent of improved glycemic control. However, trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have found an increased risk of DKA with SGLT2 inhibitors, a serious concern in patients with T1DM. SGLT2 inhibitors provide cardiovascular benefits and kidney protection in patients with T2DM and are a promising therapeutic option for patients with T1DM due to overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms. However, SGLT2 inhibitors increase the risk of DKA, and there is currently a lack of research investigating the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T1DM. Preventative measure for DKA would have to be implemented and the risks would need to be carefully balanced with the benefits offered by SGLT2 inhibitors.

A total of 690 volunteers in four groups were included in the study (type 1 [T1DG]: n = 80, 61.3% women; type 2 diabetes [T2DG]: n = 438, 63.5% women; prediabetes [Pre-DG]: n = 88, 80.7% women; healthy control [HC-G]: n = 84, 67.5% women). All subjects were investigated for clinical diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy and sudomotor dysfunction. The characteristics of participants obtained from outpatient records were evaluated. We used the Sudoscan device to measure ESC which was normalized for BMI, to improve the discriminative capability of the method. Diabetic polyneuropathy was found in 17.5% of T1DG, 27.4% of T1DG, and 10.2% of Pre-DG. The mean ESC/BMI was lower in subgroups with diabetic polyneuropathy than those without. Mean ESC/BMI was lowest in T2DG and highest in HC-G but comparable in T1DG and Pre-DG. We accepted the ""mean ESC/BMI-1 SD"" in the HC-G as the threshold for sudomotor dysfunction. Accordingly, the prevalence of sudomotor dysfunction was 18.8%, 44.3%, 59.1%, and 15% in T1DG, T2DG, Pre-DG, and HC-G, respectively. In T2DG, sudomotor dysfunction was found in 66.7% of persons with retinopathy, of which 56.3% had clinical diabetic polyneuropathy. The prevalence of sudomotor dysfunction in subjects with peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension was 46.7%, 47.4%, 43.4%, and 50%, respectively, and 42.9%, 38.9%, 45.5%, and 37.3% of whom in the same order detected with clinical diabetic polyneuropathy. Considering the entire group, a logistic regression model demonstrated that the variables associated with SMD were: retinopathy (OR: 2.969; 95% CI: 1.723, 5.114), female gender (OR: 1.952; 95% CI: 1.287, 2.962), and e-GFR (OR: 0.989; 95% CI: 0.981, 0.998). Since the rate of complications was very low in T1DG, excluding this group, a new model similarly revealed that retinopathy and female gender were associated with SMD, however, the association with e-GFR was disappeared. The prevalence of sudomotor dysfunction is high when established peripheral polyneuropathy was present in diabetes. Even though, sudomotor dysfunction can also occur before clinical polyneuropathy in both types of diabetes (T1DG: 18.8%, T2DG 44.3%), prediabetes (59.1%), and nondiabetic healthy subjects (15%). The variables associated with sudomotor dysfunction were retinopathy and female sex. Normalization of ESC for BMI would be a beneficial approach. However, before this method is included in the routine screening programs for diabetic polyneuropathy, large-scale and prospective studies are required to reach a consensus on the pathological threshold values.",Primary care diabetes,2023-Oct,"Calikoglu BF, Celik S, Idiz C, Bagdemir E, Issever H, Calvet JH, Satman I",7,3020,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35063344,Association of periodontitis with microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus: A nationwide cohort study.,"Periodontitis is a common chronic inflammatory disease and one of oral complications in diabetes. Diabetes-related microvascular complications and periodontitis are also closely related to systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that periodontitis and oral hygiene markers might increase the risk of microvascular complications in diabetes mellitus. We enrolled 11,353 diabetes participants without prior microvascular complications who received complete oral health checkups in the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort in 2003-2004. The primary outcome was the first development of diabetes-related microvascular complications, including nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. The age of all participants was 55.27 ± 9.46 years, and 7833 (68.99%) participants were male. Periodontitis was noted in 8.37%. During the 7.03 ± 4.30 year of the mean follow-up period, 7227 patients experienced diabetes-related microvascular complications (2645 with nephropathy, 2513 with neuropathy, 2069 with retinopathy). Multivariable Cox regression analyses revealed that periodontitis was an independent risk factor for diabetes-related microvascular complications (adjusted hazard ratio (HR):1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI):1.04-1.23; p = 0.004). In the secondary analysis for individual microvascular complications, periodontitis was an independent risk factor for retinopathy (adjusted HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04-1.40; p = 0.013).

34299172,Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young-New Approaches for Disease Modelling.,"Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically heterogeneous group of monogenic endocrine disorders that is characterised by autosomal dominant inheritance and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. These patients are commonly misdiagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, as the clinical symptoms largely overlap. Even though several biomarkers have been tested none of which could be used as single clinical discriminator. The correct diagnosis for individuals with MODY is of utmost importance, as the applied treatment depends on the gene mutation or is subtype-specific. Moreover, in patients with HNF1A-MODY, additional clinical monitoring can be included due to the high incidence of vascular complications observed in these patients. Finally, stratification of MODY patients will enable better and newer treatment options for MODY patients, once the disease pathology for each patient group is better understood. In the current review the clinical characteristics and the known disease-related abnormalities of the most common MODY subtypes are discussed, together with the up-to-date applied diagnostic criteria and treatment options. Additionally, the usage of pluripotent stem cells together with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing for disease modelling with the possibility to reveal new pathophysiological mechanisms in MODY is discussed.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021-Jul,"Skoczek D, Dulak J, Kachamakova-Trojanowska N",3,1346,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Knowledge, attitude, and practice of the pre-diabetic stage are of great importance and can decrease complications. The present study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practice of the pre-diabetic older people. This cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2022 to August 2022 on 219 pre-diabetic older people referring to Sina Hospital in Tabriz, one of the most populated cities in the northwest of Iran. Data were collected using questionnaires of Knowledge, Attitude, Practice-Prediabetes Assessment Questionnaire (KAP-PAQ). The data were analyzed by SPSS 21. The mean scores of knowledge (in the range of 0-17), attitude (in the range of -10, + 10), and practice (in the range of 0-26) were 1.72 ± 1.0, 2.24 ± 1.92, and 5.76 ± 2.61, respectively. The older people's knowledge and practice levels in the pre-diabetes stage were low and about 50% of them had negative views. According to the Spearman correlation test, there was a positive significant relationship between the older people's knowledge and practice (p < 0.001, r = 0.234). The older people in the pre-diabetes stage had low knowledge and attitude and a negative viewpoint towards correcting lifestyle on diet, exercising and physical activity, weight control, diagnostic and screening methods. Increased knowledge about pre-diabetes and strengthened positive attitude towards correcting lifestyle through counseling as well as empowering the pre-diabetic older people can increase the efficiency of pre-diabetes prevention and control programs and prevent its progression to the diabetes stage.",BMC geriatrics,2024-Mar,"Pakpour V, Molayi F, Nemati H",3,1695,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32554214,Application of mass spectrometry based proteomics to understand diabetes: A special focus on interactomics.,"Diabetes, a multifactorial disorder is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels resulting from changes in lifestyle, genetic and epigenetic changes or aberrations in proteome. In addition, alterations in post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) also contribute to the development of diabetes pathogenesis. Recent advances in omics technologies have broadened the perspective for systematic investigation of proteome alterations in understanding the pathogenesis of diabetes. Further, PPIs are central to cellular signaling in all living organisms and deranged PPIs lead to diabetic complications. In this context, affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) along with diverse bioinformatic approaches has proven to be competent in mapping large-scale PPI networks around the critical players in the glucose homeostasis. In this review, we revisit the application of proteomic approaches in investigating proteome alterations and probing PPI networks for a better understanding of the underlying intricacies of the major signaling pathways in altered glucose homeostasis.",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

31833083,Sweet dreams or bitter nightmare: a narrative review of 25 years of research on the role of sleep in diabetes and the contributions of behavioural science.,"The aim of this review was to provide an overview of developments, clinical implications and gaps in knowledge regarding the relationship between diabetes and sleep over the past 25 years, with special focus on contributions from the behavioural sciences. Multiple prospective observational and experimental studies have shown a link between suboptimal sleep and impaired glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity and the development of type 2 diabetes. While prevalence rates of suboptimal sleep vary widely according to definition, assessment and sample, suboptimal subjective sleep quality appears to be a common reality for one-third of people with type 1 diabetes and over half of people with type 2 diabetes. Both physiological and psychosocial factors may impair sleep in these groups. In turn, suboptimal sleep can negatively affect glycaemic outcomes directly or indirectly via suboptimal daytime functioning (energy, mood, cognition) and self-care behaviours. Technological devices supporting diabetes self-care may have both negative and positive effects. Diabetes and its treatment also affect the sleep of significant others. Research on the merits of interventions aimed at improving sleep for people with diabetes is in its infancy. Diabetes and sleep appear to be reciprocally related. Discussion of sleep deserves a central place in regular diabetes care. Multi-day, multi-method studies may shed more light on the complex relationship between sleep and diabetes at an individual level. Intervention studies are warranted to examine the potential of sleep interventions in improving outcomes for people with diabetes.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2020-Mar,"Nefs GM, Bazelmans E, Donga E, Tack CJ, de Galan BE",5,1641,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38872966,The unmet drug-related needs of patients with diabetes in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Diabetes is a major health concern globally and in Ethiopia. Ensuring optimal diabetes management through minimizing drug therapy problems is important for improving patient outcomes. However, data on the prevalence and factors associated with unmet drug-related needs in patients with diabetes in Ethiopia is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence of unmet drug-related needs among patients with diabetes mellitus in Ethiopia. A thorough exploration of databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Hinari, and Embase and Google Scholar, was conducted to identify pertinent studies. Inclusion criteria involved observational studies that reported the prevalence of unmet drug-related needs in Ethiopian patients with diabetes. The quality of the studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists. A random-effects meta-analysis was employed to amalgamate data on study characteristics and prevalence estimates, followed by subsequent subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Graphical and statistical assessments were employed to evaluate publication bias. Analysis of twelve studies involving 4,017 patients revealed a pooled prevalence of unmet drug-related needs at 74% (95% CI 63-83%). On average, each patient had 1.45 unmet drug-related needs. The most prevalent type of unmet need was ineffective drug therapy, 35% (95% CI 20-50). Type 2 diabetes, retrospective study designs, and studies from the Harari Region were associated with a higher prevalence. Frequently reported factors associated with the unmet drug-related needs includes multiple comorbidities, older age, and polypharmacy. Notably, the results indicated significant heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 99.0%; p value < 0.001), and Egger's regression test revealed publication bias with p<0.001. The prevalence of unmet drug-related needs among diabetes patients with diabetes in Ethiopia is high with the most prevalent issue being ineffective drug therapy. Targeted interventions are needed; especially patients on multiple medications, advanced age, with comorbidities, and prolonged illness duration to improve diabetes management and outcomes. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero, identifier CRD42024501096.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,"Gobezie MY, Tesfaye NA, Solomon T, Demessie MB, Wendie TF, Belayneh YM, Baye AM, Hassen M",8,2253,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34121168,"Is diabetic retinopathy affected by diabetes type? A retrospective study using electronic medical record data from patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes.","To determine whether the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and its related factors are affected by diabetes type (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [LADA], type 1 diabetes mellitus [T1DM], type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM]). LADA patients were matched for age (± 2 years) and sex to T1DM (1:1) and T2DM (1:2) patients. Retrieved variables included demographic characteristics, diabetes history, laboratory test findings, and history of DR screening, etc. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to identify influencing factors of DR. A decision tree was used to explore interactions between diabetes type and other influencing factors of DR. We included 110 LADA, 101 T1DM, and 220 T2DM patients. DR prevalence was 26.4% in LADA patients, lower than that in T1DM (50.5%) and T2DM (47.7%) patients (P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that diabetes duration (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.1-1.26, P < 0.001) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) (OR = 42.39, 95% CI: 10.88-165.11, P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for DR, and regular DR screening (OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.16-0.69, P = 0.003) was an independent protective factor. Decision tree analysis showed that in patients without DN with a diabetes duration of at least 10.5 years, T1DM and LADA patients had a higher incidence of DR than T2DM patients (72.7% vs. 55.1%). The prevalence of DR in diabetes patients was affected by diabetes duration, DN occurrence, and regular DR screening. Diabetes type indirectly affects DR occurrence through its interaction with diabetes duration and DN.

34649983,Identifying priority and bright spot areas for improving diabetes care: a geospatial approach.,"The objective of this study was to describe a novel geospatial methodology for identifying poor-performing (priority) and well-performing (bright spot) communities with respect to diabetes management at the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level. This research was the first phase of a mixed-methods approach known as the focused rapid assessment process (fRAP). Using data from the Lehigh Valley Health Network in eastern Pennsylvania, geographical information systems mapping and spatial analyses were performed to identify diabetes prevalence and A1c control spatial clusters and outliers. We used a spatial empirical Bayes approach to adjust diabetes-related measures, mapped outliers and used the Local Moran's I to identify spatial clusters and outliers. Patients with diabetes were identified from the Lehigh Valley Practice and Community-Based Research Network (LVPBRN), which comprised primary care practices that included a hospital-owned practice, a regional practice association, independent small groups, clinics, solo practitioners and federally qualified health centres. Using this novel approach, we identified five priority ZCTAs and three bright spot ZCTAs in LVPBRN. Three of the priority ZCTAs were located in the urban core of Lehigh Valley and have large Hispanic populations. The other two bright spot ZCTAs have fewer patients and were located in rural areas. As the first phase of fRAP, this method of identifying high-performing and low-performing areas offers potential to mitigate health disparities related to diabetes through targeted exploration of local factors contributing to diabetes management. This novel approach to identification of populations with diabetes performing well or poor at the local community level may allow practitioners to target focused qualitative assessments where the most can be learnt to improve diabetic management of the community.",Family medicine and community health,2021-Oct,"Topmiller M, Mallow PJ, Shaak K, Kieber-Emmons AM",4,1893,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Direct sequencing of all exons of INS genes was carried out in 189 children with PNDM. Clinical and biochemical data were collected and correlated. The pathogenicity of mutations was determined based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Association of Medical Pathology guidelines. Two novel mutations (His34Pro, Leu35Met) in a compound heterozygous state and seven known mutations (Gly32Ser, Phe48Cys, Arg89Cys, Cys96Tyr, Ser98Ile, Try108Asp and Cys109Phe) in the INS gene were identified in 8 patients out of the total of 189 PNDM children studied. Four mutations were involved in defects with disulphide bond formation and hence were in crucial regions of the gene. All the mutations were de novo in origin.

31797443,Assessing the impact of diabetes on quality of life: what have the past 25 years taught us?,"Over the past 25 years, there has been significant acknowledgement of the importance of assessing the impact of diabetes on quality of life. Yet, despite the development of several diabetes-specific quality of life measures, the challenges we faced in 1995 remain. There is little consensus on the definition of quality of life because of the complexity and subjectivity of the concept. General quality of life comprises several domains of life, and these are highly individualized. Assessing the impact of diabetes on these life domains adds to the complexity. While comprehensive diabetes-specific quality-of-life measures typically increase respondent burden, brief questionnaires may not capture all relevant/important domains. Today, the lack of resolution of these challenges may explain why the impact of diabetes on quality of life is not systematically assessed in research or clinical care. Few researchers report detailed rationales for assessment, there is often a mismatch between the concept of interest and the measure selected, and data are misinterpreted as assessing the impact of diabetes on quality of life when, in reality, related but distinct constructs have been assessed, such as diabetes distress, treatment satisfaction or health status. While significant efforts are being made to increase routine monitoring of psychological well-being and understand the lived experience, no guidelines currently recommend routine clinical assessment of diabetes-specific quality of life, and there is no consensus on which questionnaire(s) to use. The gaps identified in this review need urgent attention, starting with recognition that assessment of diabetes-specific quality of life is as important as biomedical markers, if we are to improve the lives of people with diabetes.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2020-Mar,"Speight J, Holmes-Truscott E, Hendrieckx C, Skovlund S, Cooke D",5,1793,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33438572,Association between Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy and Serum Bile Acid Level in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the diabetic microvascular complications, which is also one of the important causes of blindness in adults. To investigate the association between proliferative retinopathy and serum bile acid level in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Three hundred and thirty-six patients with T2DM were included, of which, 229 had a history of more than 10 years without diabetic retinopathy (no diabetic retinopathy, NDR) and 107 had proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The baseline characteristics of the two groups were compared. According to the level of bile acid, the patients were divided into low, medium and high bile acid groups. The ratio of proliferative retinopathy in each group was compared. The presence of retinopathy was taken as the dependent variable, and the significant variables were analyzed by logistic regression. The level of total bilirubin and bile acid in the NDR group was significantly higher than that in the PDR group, while the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol and LDL-C were significantly lower than that in the PDR group (P<0.05). With the increase of bile acid level, the proportion of proliferative retinopathy decreased. Logistic regression analysis showed that bilirubin and bile acid were protective factors of diabetic retinopathy, while SBP, LDL-C and UAER were risk factors of diabetic retinopathy. Bile acid might be a protective factor for diabetic retinopathy in T2DM, which might be a potential therapeutic role in retinal disorders.","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2021-,"Su Z, Liu W, Yang J",3,1526,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF)-Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS) to screen for undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in a large representative population in India. Data were acquired from the Indian Council of Medical Research-INdia DIABetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study, a large national survey that included both urban and rural populations from 30 states/union territories in India. Stratified multistage design was followed to obtain a sample of 113,043 individuals (94.2% response rate). MDRF-IDRS used four simple parameters, viz. age, waist circumference, family history of diabetes and physical activity to detect undiagnosed diabetes.

32674731,Current Approaches in Diabetes Treatment and Other Strategies to Reach Normoglycemia.,"Cells are mainly dependent on glucose as their energy source. Multicellular organisms need to adequately control individual glucose uptake by the cells, and the insulin-glucagon endocrine system serves as the key glucose regulation mechanism. Insulin allows for effective glucose entry into the cells when blood glucose levels are high, and glucagon acts as its opponent, balancing low blood glucose levels. A lack of insulin will prevent glucose entry to the cells, resulting in glucose accumulation in the bloodstream. Diabetes is a disease which is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. All diabetes types are characterized by an inefficient insulin signaling mechanism. This could be the result of insufficient insulin secretion, as in the case of type I diabetes and progressive incidents of type II diabetes or due to insufficient response to insulin (known as insulin resistance). We emphasize here, that Diabetes is actually a disease of starved tissues, unable to absorb glucose (and other nutrients), and not a disease of high glucose levels. Indeed, diabetic patients, prior to insulin discovery, suffered from glucose malabsorption. In this mini-review, we will define diabetes, discuss the current status of diabetes treatments, review the current knowledge of the different hormones that participate in glucose homeostasis and the employment of different modulators of these hormones.

Recipient T2D PRS was associated with pre-transplant T2D and the development of PTDM. T2D PRS in liver donors, but not in kidney donors, was an independent risk factor for PTDM development. The inclusion of a combined liver donor and recipient T2D PRS significantly improved PTDM prediction compared with a model that included only clinical characteristics: the area under the curve (AUC) was 67.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 64.1-71.1%) for the combined T2D PRS versus 62.3% (95% CI 58.8-65.8%) for the clinical characteristics model (P = 0.0001). Liver recipients in the highest quintile of combined donor and recipient T2D PRS had the greatest risk of PTDM, with an odds ratio of 3.22 (95% CI 2.07-5.00) (P = 1.92 × 10<sup>-7</sup>) compared with those in the lowest quintile. In conclusion, T2D PRS identifies transplant candidates with high risk of PTDM for which pre-emptive diabetes management and donor selection may be warranted.",Nature medicine,2022-May,"Shaked A, Loza BL, Van Loon E, Olthoff KM, Guan W, Jacobson PA, Zhu A, Fishman CE, Gao H, Oetting WS, Israni AK, Testa G, Trotter J, Klintmalm G, Naesens M, Asrani SK, Keating BJ",17,1306,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Effect of sleep and sedentariness on incidence of diabetes.","We aimed to determine the individual effect of long/short sleep and of inactivity on diabetes risk using data from a population-based prospective study in Switzerland. Prospective study with a median (min-max) follow-up of 9 (2.4-11.5) years. Incident diabetes was defined based on 1) fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2) glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), or 3) any diagnostic criterion (FPG, HbA<sub>1</sub>c or medical diagnosis). Sleep and sedentary levels were assessed by questionnaire. Sleep was categorized into short (<7 h/day), adequate (7-9 h/day) and long (>9 h/day). Data from 3355 participants (57.6% women, mean age years 56.6 ± 10.3) was analyzed. There were 136, 110 and 142 incident cases of diabetes defined by FPG, HbA<sub>1</sub>c or any criterion, respectively. Participants who developed diabetes had a higher sedentariness but no differences were found regarding sleep duration. Similar results were obtained after adjusting for age, gender, education, smoking and body mass index: hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for sedentariness 1.61 (1.11-2.35), 1.40 (0.93-2.12) and 1.39 (1.04-1.87) for diabetes defined by FPG, HbA<sub>1</sub>c or any diagnostic criterion, respectively.

36629168,Increasing diabetes testing adherence with incentives in rural Northwestern Ontario.,"The health outcomes of rural Canadians have been described as poor and can in some part be related to diabetes mellitus. Despite the high mortality and morbidity rates associated with the disease, compliance with management remains low. Research has shown that a small financial incentive used to modify patient behaviour, can improve outcomes in cardiac disease and exercise adherence. This study aims to evaluate if a small financial incentive awarded to rural Northwestern Ontario patients with diabetes who complete an haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test, would result in greater compliance in test completion. Patients were recruited through two Northern rural clinics. Participants were divided into two groups: Group A received a financial incentive, whereas Group B received a letter of reminder. HbA1c tests were recorded every 6 months for 2 years and compliance was analysed using a t-test and Chi-square. One hundred and forty-six participants were recruited with 30 lost to follow-up. Overall, the incentive group completed a statistically significantly higher number of HbA1c tests compared to those in the control group. In addition, it was noted that there was an increase in test adherence for participants that received reminder letters, although not an initially expected outcome of the study. The results suggest that either a financial incentive or a reminder directed towards rural Canadians could have a benefit in promoting health behaviours to subsequent medical management of diabetes mellitus.",Canadian journal of rural medicine : the official journal of the Society of Rural Physicians of Canada = Journal canadien de la medecine rurale : le journal officiel de la Societe de medecine rurale du Canada,2023-,"Mashru J, Gagnon G, Kaus C, Gagnon Y, Moir A",5,1513,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39393003,Bringing the assessment and treatment of diabetes distress into the real world of clinical care: Time for a shift in perspective.,"Diabetes distress (DD) refers to the emotional and behavioural challenges associated with managing this demanding chronic disease over time. DD is alarmingly common and it has a significant impact on self-management behaviours and clinical outcomes. Thus, there is growing recognition that DD is a pressing problem that deserves careful attention in clinical care. Translating the application of validated DD assessment and intervention protocols from the research to the clinical setting, however, presents challenges that require a reconsideration of some common assumptions about what DD is, how prevalent it is, how it presents itself clinically, how it might best be assessed and by whom. We employed data from six large-scale studies using five common DD measures. Using these data, we review and challenge several common assumptions about DD. These data suggest that, because of its relative ubiquity, DD should not be viewed as a 'co-morbidity' or 'complication' of diabetes and it should not be seen as a mental health/illness 'condition'. Furthermore, we argue that DD assessment should: (1) be accepted as a standard part of comprehensive diabetes care, (2) occur regularly using broad rather than brief screening measures and (3) be addressed directly by diabetes clinicians, rather than exclusively by behavioural specialists. The results form the basis of a series of suggestions to enhance the translation, adoption and implementation of DD knowledge derived from the research setting directly into the real world of clinical care.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2024-Dec,"Fisher L, Guzman S, Polonsky W, Hessler D",4,1546,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The study was done using a retrospective study design. Fasting blood samples from consented patients with no previous diagnosis of diabetes and within the specified age range were collected from King Edward Hospital in Durban. The pre-diabetes diagnosis was confirmed in participants with fasting glucose concentrations between 5.6 and 6.9 mmol/L and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels between 5.7 % and 6.4 % using the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and World Health Organisation (WHO) diagnosis criteria. The study participants' characterisation was stratified according to the diagnosis criterion, age, gender and ethnicity. An alarming 68 % average pre-diabetes prevalence across ADA and WHO criteria in the Durban, eThekwini district sample population. The highest prevalence was recorded using the IFG criterion (83%) and the lowest when using the HbA1c criterion (54 %). Between the White, Black and Indian ethnic groups, the Indian group were more predisposed to pre-diabetes onset, with a prevalence of 62.7 %. If pre-diabetes management is unattended, an unprecedented increase in metabolic disorders such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and all-cause mortality incidence can be expected.

32128655,"Type 2 diabetes - unmet need, unresolved pathogenesis, mTORC1-centric paradigm.","The current paradigm of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is gluco-centric, being exclusively categorized by glycemic characteristics. The gluco-centric paradigm views hyperglycemia as the primary target, being driven by resistance to insulin combined with progressive beta cells failure, and considers glycemic control its ultimate treatment goal. Most importantly, the gluco-centric paradigm considers the non-glycemic diseases associated with T2D, e.g., obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, macrovascular disease, microvascular disease and fatty liver as 'risk factors' and/or 'outcomes' and/or 'comorbidities', rather than primary inherent disease aspects of T2D. That is in spite of their high prevalence (60-90%) and major role in profiling T2D morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the gluco-centric paradigm fails to realize that the non-glycemic diseases of T2D are driven by insulin and, except for glycemic control, response to insulin in T2D is essentially the rule rather than the exception. Failure of the gluco-centric paradigm to offer an exhaustive unifying view of the glycemic and non-glycemic diseases of T2D may have contributed to T2D being still an unmet need. An mTORC1-centric paradigm maintains that hyperactive mTORC1 drives the glycemic and non-glycemic disease aspects of T2D. Hyperactive mTORC1 is proposed to act as double-edged agent, namely, to interfere with glycemic control by disrupting the insulin receptor-Akt transduction pathway, while concomitantly driving the non-glycemic diseases of T2D. The mTORC1-centric paradigm may offer a novel perspective for T2D in terms of pathogenesis, clinical focus and treatment strategy.",Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,2020-Dec,Bar-Tana J,1,1648,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Its pathophysiology is multifactorial and poorly understood and no specific therapeutic guideline has yet been established. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a challenging diagnosis, made after excluding other potential entities, treated with different pharmacotherapeutic agents targeting various pathophysiological pathways that need yet to be unraveled. It has great clinical importance as diabetes is a disease with pandemic proportions.

A follow-up study on two independent cohorts having oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 1991/1992 and 2011-2016: Cohort 1 consisted of 406 women including 54 with GDM and 352 with a non-GDM OGTT-test and cohort 2 had 433 women diagnosed with GDM. The first cohort had nearly 25 years of follow-up and gave information on magnitude, conversion rate and type of diabetes manifestation. The second cohort was started recently to evaluate whether newer diagnostic criteria and baseline information on the old cohort are still valid for prediction of diabetes risk. The risk of manifest diabetes in cohort 1 at the end of follow-up was six times higher in women with previous GDM compared with non-GDM (RR = 6; 95% CI 4-11). We observed a 70% diabetes rate 25 years after pregnancy. Only family history of diabetes in cohort 2 was associated with conversion to manifest diabetes (p = 0.002), also after adjustment for age, BMI, non-Danish origin and smoking during pregnancy (p < 0.001) CONCLUSION: The incidence of diabetes after GDM is higher than that previously reported in Scandinavian populations and the rate of manifest diabetes rises steeply 15 years after pregnancy and after 40 years of age. The women of cohort 2 with recent GDM are at risk of DM at a higher rate.

The incidence and risk factors for new-onset morbidities after AP need to be clarified to inform a personalized medicine approach. Using a longitudinal electronic healthcare record-linkage analysis, all patients admitted to hospital in Scotland with a first episode of AP between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2012 and followed for a minimum of 5 years after their index AP admission were identified. All new-onset morbidity with specific focus on type 3c DM were analysed and, using time-split multiple regression. A total of 2047 patients were included. AP requiring critical care was followed by 2 years of heightened risk (HR 5.24) of developing type 3c DM, increased risk of new-onset cardiac disease (HR 1.61), and renal disease (HR 2.96). The additional risk conferred by critical care AP had a negative interaction with time, whereas additional risk associated with male sex and a non-gallstone aetiology was long lasting. Based on these findings, a personalized approach to include type 3c DM screening for a minimum of 2 years for individuals who required critical care when hospitalized with AP is recommended.",BJS open,2022-Nov,"Walker A, O'Kelly J, Graham C, Nowell S, Kidd D, Mole DJ",6,1258,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

37861021,From Gut to Glucose: A Comprehensive Review on Functional Foods and Dietary Interventions for Diabetes Management.,"In the realm of diabetes research, considerable attention has been directed toward elucidating the intricate interplay between the gastrointestinal tract and glucose regulation. The gastrointestinal tract, once exclusively considered for its role in digestion and nutrient assimilation, is presently acknowledged as a multifaceted ecosystem with regulatory supremacy over metabolic homeostasis and glucose metabolism. Recent studies indicate that alterations in the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota could potentially influence the regulation of glucose levels and glucose homeostasis in the body. Dysbiosis, characterized by perturbations in the equilibrium of gut microbial constituents, has been irrevocably linked to an augmented risk of diabetes mellitus (DM). Moreover, research has revealed the potential influence of the gut microbiota on important factors, like inflammation and insulin sensitivity, which are key contributors to the onset and progression of diabetes. The key protagonists implicated in the regulation of glucose encompass the gut bacteria, gut barrier integrity, and the gut-brain axis. A viable approach to enhance glycemic control while concurrently mitigating the burden of comorbidities associated with diabetes resides in the strategic manipulation of the gut environment through adapted dietary practices. This review aimed to provide a deep understanding of the complex relationship between gut health, glucose metabolism, and diabetes treatment. This study has presented an exhaustive overview of dietary therapies and functional foods that have undergone extensive research to explore their potential advantages in the management of diabetes. It looks into the role of gut health in glucose regulation, discusses the impact of different dietary elements on the course of diabetes, and evaluates how well functional foods can help with glycemic control. Furthermore, it investigates the mechanistic aspects of these therapies, including their influence on insulin sensitivity, β-cell activity, and inflammation. It deliberates on the limitations and potential prospects associated with integrating functional foods into personalized approaches to diabetes care.",Current diabetes reviews,2024-,"Patel N, Dinesh S, Sharma S",3,2214,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

To address inequity of access to diabetes-related services in remote areas of WQ, a visiting credentialled diabetes educator program (VCDEP) was developed. Using a fly-in, fly-out model of service delivery and supporting telehealth services, upskilling of rural primary healthcare professionals occurred and credentialled diabetes educator (CDE) accessibility increased in WQ. This study objectively measured the impact of the VCDEP. Practice report data from five representative VCDEP practices and five non-VCDEP practices were analysed using Pearson Chi-squared tests to ascertain associations in reporting of blood pressure (BP), HbA1c, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), total cholesterol, microalbumin, body mass index (BMI) and foot and eye examinations, as well as improvements in BP, HbA1c, eGFR, total cholesterol, microalbumin and BMI measures at two set date points. In practices involved in the VCDEP, aggregated data indicated significant increases in reporting of HbA1c (P ≤ 0.001), eGFR (P ≤ 0.001), total cholesterol (P = 0.022) and foot assessments (P = 0.015). In contrast, aggregated data from practices not involved in the VCDEP identified significant decreases in the reporting of BP and eye examinations between October 2019 and March 2021 (P = 0.034 and P = 0.007 respectively). Decreases in reporting of HbA1c, eGFR, microalbumin, BMI and foot examinations were also found, although these did not reach statistical significance.

A total of 321,525 HFwDM under triple GDMT (female:49%, median age:68[61-75] years) were included. The highest rate of prescribed combination therapy was metformin and sulfonylureas (n = 55,266). In Cox regression analysis, insülin monotherapy had the highest risk for all-cause mortality (HR:2.25, 95CI%:2.06 - 2.45), whereas combination therapy including metformin, SGLT2i, and sulfonylureas provided the most beneficial effect on survival (HR:0.29, 95CI%:0.22-0.39) when compared to patients not receiving diabetes medication. Among patients taking diabetes medications, the inclusion of SGLT2i demonstrated a survival benefit (p < 0.05), despite concurrent use of volume-retaining medications such as insulin and thiazolidinediones. Conversely, combinations of diabetes medications without SGLT2i did not demonstrate any survival benefit compared to patients not taking diabetes medication (p > 0.05).

To determine the prevalence of hyperglycaemia without previously recognised diabetes among all patients screened in the emergency department (ED). Secondary aims are to describe the extent of haemoglobin A1c testing for evaluation of new diabetes, adequate glucose monitoring, treatment of significant hyperglycaemia and documented follow-up plans. Patients presenting to ED at the Alfred (tertiary hospital in Melbourne) have undergone screening random plasma glucose (RPG) with their first plasma biochemistry since 2015. Of the 16 268 adults screened from July to December 2015, a retrospective, cross-sectional study was undertaken evaluating those with hyperglycaemia (RPG >7.8 mmol/L) but without previously recognised diabetes as determined from coding data. After patient records were reviewed to correct for coding errors, a nested cohort of 200 such patients were further evaluated. Glucose monitoring was deemed adequate if undertaken for ≥48 h. Significant hyperglycaemia (RPG >11 mmol/L) was considered appropriately treated if insulin/hypoglycaemic agents were prescribed.

31809715,"A new research hot spot: The role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, a key step in pyroptosis, in diabetes and diabetic complications.","Pyroptosis is a form of cell death mediated by gasdermin D (GSDMD); it is characterised by NLRP3 inflammasome activation, caspase activation, cell membrane pore formation, and the release of interleukin-1β and interleukin-18. NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays a central role in pyroptosis. Recent research has suggested that NLRP3 inflammasome activation may be involved in the occurrence and development of diabetes mellitus and its associated complications. This finding provided the impetus for us to clarify the significance of pyroptosis in diabetes. In this review, we summarise the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in pyroptosis, as well as recent advances in the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in the development of diabetes and diabetic complications.",Life sciences,2020-Jan,"Yu ZW, Zhang J, Li X, Wang Y, Fu YH, Gao XY",6,810,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37468169,"Implementing Effective Care Through Utilization of Diabetes-Focused ""Right Care"" Visits in a Suburban Primary Care Setting.","<b>Background:</b> Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of lower limb amputations, adult-onset blindness, and renal failure. It is estimated that 34.2 million Americans have a diabetes diagnosis, and the prevalence of this condition has continually increased over the last two decades. This study includes patients at a large, suburban primary care practice in southwest Ohio who were considered to have uncontrolled diabetes based on their last Hemoglobin A1c of greater than 9%. Compliance with recommended annual screenings among this population was 15%. <b>Objectives:</b> The aim of this project was to improve glycemic control and increase the number of patients who received the recommended annual screenings through the implementation of nurse practitioner-driven, diabetes-focused ""Right Care"" visits.C <b>Methods:</b> This quality improvement pilot study consisted of interventions implemented over the four plan-do-study-act cycles. Each cycle included a test of change that was identified based on data from previous cycles to ensure continuous improvement throughout project implementation. Four interventions were evaluated including the utilization of a diabetes registry, implementation of a ""Right Care"" checklist during ""Right Care"" visits, use of a patient engagement tool with a focus on individualizing diabetes medication regimens, and implementation of a team-engagement plan. <b>Results:</b> Average Hemoglobin A1c reduction was 2.4% post-""Right Care"" visit. Compliance with the annual screening bundle increased to 44% over 8 weeks. Utilization of the patient/provider relationship increased visit compliance by 18%, and the team engagement plan decreased work-related stress by 12%. <b>Conclusions:</b> The implementation of ""Right Care"" visits led to improved glycemic control and increased compliance with the recommended annual screenings among patients with an A1c greater than 9%. The patient engagement tool identified key factors related to diabetes medication adherence and team engagement decreased work-related stress and improved annual fundoscopic exam screening compliance. <b>Implications for Nursing:</b> Nurse practitioner-led ""Right Care"" visits utilize the knowledge and skills of advanced practice registered nurses to improve glycemic control in patients with uncontrolled diabetes.",Journal of doctoral nursing practice,2023-Jul,"Neu T, Eppley C, Gianelis K",3,2381,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37560999,Utility of Polygenic Scores for Differentiating Diabetes Diagnosis Among Patients With Atypical Phenotypes of Diabetes.,"Misclassification of diabetes type occurs in people with atypical presentations of type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although current clinical guidelines suggest clinical variables and treatment response as ways to help differentiate diabetes type, they remain insufficient for people with atypical presentations. This work aimed to assess the clinical utility of 2 polygenic scores (PGSs) in differentiating between T1D and T2D. Patients diagnosed with diabetes in the UK Biobank were studied (N = 41 787), including 464 (1%) and 15 923 (38%) who met the criteria for classic T1D and T2D, respectively, and 25 400 (61%) atypical diabetes. The validity of 2 published PGSs for T1D (PGST1D) and T2D (PGST2D) in differentiating classic T1D or T2D was assessed using C statistic. The utility of genetic probability for T1D based on PGSs (GenProb-T1D) was evaluated in atypical diabetes patients. The joint performance of PGST1D and PGST2D for differentiating classic T1D or T2D was outstanding (C statistic = 0.91), significantly higher than that of PGST1D alone (0.88) and PGST2D alone (0.70), both P less than .001. Using an optimal cutoff of GenProb-T1D, 23% of patients with atypical diabetes had a higher probability of T1D and its validity was independently supported by clinical presentations that are characteristic of T1D. PGST1D and PGST2D can be used to discriminate classic T1D and T2D and have potential clinical utility for differentiating these 2 types of diseases among patients with atypical diabetes.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2023-Dec,"Billings LK, Shi Z, Wei J, Rifkin AS, Zheng SL, Helfand BT, Ilbawi N, Dunnenberger HM, Hulick PJ, Qamar A, Xu J",11,1529,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35603258,Prevention of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes: importance of a screening program for the early detection of risk conditions in a target population.,"Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are two of the main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In their genesis, an important role is played by some behavioural risk factors that may induce the onset of further risk factors represented by hypertension, prediabetes, overweight and obesity. This study aimed to show the importance of the screening methodology for early detection of these risk conditions in order to reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes complications. We carried out a screening programme involving a cohort of people aged 45-60 in which risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes were evaluated. The subjects were then classified into four groups according to the risk conditions. A high percentage (27.0%) of the sample had some alteration in the detected anthropometric and/or clinical-laboratory parameters but were unaware of this condition and, consequently, not under therapeutic treatment. The screening programme allowed the early detection of hypertension and prediabetes or full-blown diabetes conditions in subjects who were unaware they had a pathological condition, and consequently to proceed with adequate investigations and start healthy lifestyles/pharmacological therapies. Overall, the results highlight the need to anticipate these screening campaigns, especially in men, to increase the effectiveness of the prevention programmes.",Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,2021-Dec,"Facciolà A, Visalli G, D'Andrea G, Varvarà M, Santoro G, Cuffari R, DI Pietro A",7,1407,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis on 500 patients who attended the Endocrinology department at a quaternary health care center in Kerala between November 2017 and April 2018. Patients above the age of 30 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) were included. They underwent a detailed medical history, dilated fundus examination for DR, assessment and grading of DPN, and blood investigations. Among these, 49 randomly selected patients without DR had peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) assessed by optical coherence tomogram. RNFL and GCIPL changes in different grades of neuropathy were evaluated. Out of 500 patients, 303 (60.6%) were males and 197 (39.4%) were females. Prevalence of DR was 48% and DPN 71.8%. Risk factors for the development of DR included duration of DM >15 years, HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) greater than 6.5%, serum creatinine more than 1.5 mg/dl, and the presence of DPN. There was a statistically significant association between DR and DPN. There was significant thinning of GCIPL in patients with moderate to severe neuropathy without DR. There is a significant association between DR and DPN and their severities. There are early changes in inner retinal layers of diabetic patients without microvascular changes of DR.

39019572,New Perspectives and Prospects of microRNA Delivery in Diabetic Wound Healing.,"The remarkable potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) as a class of biotherapeutic agents in the treatment of diverse pathological conditions has garnered significant interest in recent years. To heal both acute and chronic wounds, miRNAs work by post-transcriptionally controlling various proteins and the pathways that are linked to them. Diabetes mellitus predisposes to several macro- and microvascular defects of end organs such as atherosclerosis, peripheral artery disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and impaired wound healing. Here, miRNAs emerge as a beacon of hope, with the capacity to heal diabetic wounds by precisely modulating the expression of genes involved in the healing process. Despite the therapeutic promise, the journey to realizing the full potential of miRNAs is fraught with challenges. Their intrinsic instability and the inefficient delivery into target cells pose significant barriers to their clinical application. Consequently, a major focus of current research is the discovery of novel miRNAs and the development of innovative delivery systems that can effectively transport these nucleic acids into the cells where they are needed most. This review delves into the intricate roles that miRNAs play at various stages of diabetic wound healing, providing a comprehensive overview of the latest research findings. The review also addresses the obstacles and opportunities that come with translating miRNA-based strategies into clinical practice, offering a critical assessment of the field's advancements and the hurdles that remain to be overcome.

36127565,A simulation model estimates lifetime health and economic outcomes of screening prediabetes using the 1-h plasma glucose.,"The current method to diagnose impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is based on the 2-h plasma glucose (2-hPG) value during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Robust evidence demonstrates that the 1-h post-load plasma glucose (1-hPG) ≥ 8.6 mmol/L in those with normal glucose tolerance is highly predictive of type 2 diabetes (T2D), micro and macrovascular complications and mortality. The aim of this study was to conduct a health economic analysis to estimate long-term cost-effectiveness of using the 1-hPG compared to the 2-hPG for screening and assessing the risk of diabetes over 35 years. The main outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A Monte Carlo-based Markov simulation model was developed to forecast long-term effects of two screening strategies with regards to clinical and cost-effectiveness outcomes. The base case model included 20,000 simulated patients over 35-years follow-up. Transition probabilities on disease progression, mortality, effects on preventive treatments and complications were retrieved from landmark diabetes studies. Direct medical costs were sourced from published literature and inflated to 2019 Euros. In the lifetime analysis, the 1-hPG was projected to increase the number of years free from disease (2 years per patient); to delay the onset of T2D (1 year per patient); to reduce the incidence of T2D complications (0·6 RR-Relative Risk per patient) and to increase the QALY gained (0·58 per patient). Even if the 1-hPG diagnostic method resulted in higher initial costs associated with preventive treatment, long-term diabetes-related costs as well as complications costs were reduced leading to a lifetime saving of - 31225719.82€. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was - 8214.7€ per each QALY gained for the overall population. Screening prediabetes with the 1-hPG is feasible and cost-effective resulting in reduced costs per QALY. Notwithstanding, the higher initial costs of testing with the 1-hPG compared to the 2-hPG due to incremental preventive intervention, long-term diabetes and complications costs were reduced projecting an overall cost saving of - 8214.7€ per each QALY gained.",Acta diabetologica,2023-Jan,"Andellini M, Manco M, Esposito MT, Tozzi AE, Bergman M, Ritrovato M",6,2174,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of secondary data comprising Portuguese PHC indicators by health centres group (ACES) and the National Hospital Morbidity Database. We calculated and analysed age-sex-adjusted rates for each PQI. Worse-performing ACES were identified using the 2017 median PQI values as an assessment cut-off. A multivariate logistic analysis was carried to find variables associated with the likelihood of being a worse-performing ACES for the biennium. The median values of the indicator PQI93 - Prevention Quality Diabetes Composite were 79 and 65.2 hospitalizations per 100 000 pop, in 2016 and 2017 respectively. Diabetes long term complications (PQI 03) accounted for most of the hospitalizations. The quality indicator in PHC with greater influence on PQI93 was the proportion of DM patients with <65 years with test results for HbA1c < = 6.5%. This study shows that some PHC quality indicators are closely related to DM care, and so their monitoring is of high importance.

36418058,Barriers and enablers to diabetic retinopathy screening: a cross-sectional survey of young adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the UK.,"Diabetic retinopathy screening (DRS) attendance in young adults (YAs) is consistently below recommended levels. The aim of this study was to identify barriers and enablers of DRS attendance among YAs in the UK living with type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). YAs (18-34 years) were invited to complete an anonymous online survey in June 2021 assessing agreement with 30 belief statements informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) of behavior change describing potential barriers/enablers to DRS. In total, 102 responses were received. Most had T1D (65.7%) and were regular attenders for DRS (76.5%). The most salient TDF domains for DRS attendance were '<i>Goals</i>', with 93% agreeing that DRS was a high priority, and '<i>Knowledge</i>', with 98% being aware that screening can detect eye problems early.Overall, 67.4% indicated that they would like greater appointment flexibility <i>(Environmental context/resources</i>) and 31.3% reported difficulties getting time off work/study to attend appointments <i>(Environmental context/resources</i>). This was more commonly reported by occasional non-attenders versus regular attenders (59.1% vs 23.4%, p=0.002). Most YAs were worried about diabetic retinopathy (74.3%), anxious when receiving screening results (63%) (<i>Emotion</i>) and would like more support after getting their results (66%) (<i>Social influences</i>). Responses for T1D and T2D were broadly similar, although those with T2D were more likely have developed strategies to help them to remember their appointments (63.6% vs 37.9%, p=0.019) (<i>Behavioral regulation</i>). Attendance for DRS in YAs is influenced by complex interacting behavioral factors.

To assess the risk of developing diabetes-associated ocular complications among youth diagnosed with diabetes. This retrospective, population-based medical record review included all residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (95.7% White in 1990), diagnosed with diabetes at younger than 22 years (hereinafter referred to as children) from January 1, 1970, through December 31, 2019. Risk of developing ocular complications over time. Among 1362 individuals with a diagnostic code of diabetes, medical record reviews confirmed a diagnosis of T1D or T2D in 606 children, of whom 525 (86.6%) underwent at least 1 eye examination (mean [SD] age at diabetes diagnosis, 12.1 [5.4] years; 264 [50.3%] male). Diabetes-associated ocular complications occurred in 147 of the 461 children (31.2%) with T1D and in 17 of the 64 children (26.6%) with T2D. The hazard ratio illustrating the risk between T2D and T1D rates was 1.88 (95% CI, 1.13-3.12; P = .02) for developing any diabetic retinopathy (nonproliferative or greater), 2.33 (95% CI, 0.99-5.50; P = .048) for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 1.49 (95% CI, 0.46-4.89; P = .50) for diabetic macular edema, 2.43 (95% CI, 0.54-11.07; P = .24) for a visually significant cataract, and 4.06 (95% CI, 1.34-12.33; P = .007) for requiring pars plana vitrectomy by 15 years after the diagnosis of diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and the need for pars plana vitrectomy occurred within a shorter diabetes duration for children with T2D compared with T1D in this population-based cohort. Children with T2D had almost twice the risk of developing retinopathy compared with those with T1D. These findings suggest that to prevent serious ocular complications, children with T2D may require ophthalmoscopic evaluations at least as frequently as or more frequently than children with T1D.",JAMA ophthalmology,2022-Jan,"Bai P, Barkmeier AJ, Hodge DO, Mohney BG",4,2053,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35098857,Mother-Infant Dyad program in primary care: evidence-based postpartum care following gestational diabetes.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a common complication of pregnancy, is associated with a 10-fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to the general population. Evidence-based guidelines recommend that patients with GDM receive postpartum care for T2DM risk reduction including an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 4-12 weeks after delivery, yet half of patients with GDM did not return for their postpartum visits by 12 weeks postpartum. Additionally, only 10% utilize primary care within 12 months of delivery and one-third of GDM patients receive timely postpartum OGTT. To determine if the Mother-Infant Dyad postpartum primary care program provides a framework to link well-child visits with postpartum primary care visits to increase postpartum clinical interactions promoting longitudinal care, such as postpartum visit attendance and T2DM screening. All patients with a diagnosis of GDM that received care at a postpartum mother-infant dyad program at a Midwestern academic medical center internal medicine and pediatrics primary care clinic were enrolled. Clinic level data was obtained by baseline and 6-month post-enrollment surveys and chart review. A comparison population was identified from Medicaid claims data using propensity score matching to enable a comparison of program participants' outcomes to a population comprised of similar individuals diagnosed with GDM that received care at sites not participating in the Dyad program. Our primary outcome was completion of T2DM screening in the 4-12 week postpartum period. The secondary outcomes were postpartum visit attendance with a prenatal provider, and prediabetes diagnoses. A total of 75 mother-infant dyads were seen by the clinic. Of the enrolled women, 43% were Non-Hispanic White and 30% were Non-Hispanic Black; mean age was 30.75 years. The matched comparison group (<i>n</i> = 62) had a mean age of 30.75 years, were 43% Non-Hispanic White and 30% Non-Hispanic Black. Women who participated in the program were more likely to receive T2DM screenings than women who did not participate (87 vs. 79%, <i>p</i><.001) and complete postpartum visits (95 vs. 58%, respectively; <i>p</i><.001). Additionally, a higher rate of new prediabetes diagnoses was observed (12 vs. 6%, <i>p</i> < .001). The Mother-Infant Dyad postpartum primary care program improved T2DM screenings and postpartum visit attendance. In addition, a greater proportion of Dyad program participants experienced new prediabetes diagnoses that those in the comparison group. Our findings suggest that the dyad care model, in which women with GDM engage in postpartum primary care concurrent with well-child visits, can improve longitudinal postpartum care after a GDM diagnosis.","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2022-Dec,"Bose Brill S, May S, Lorenz AM, Spence D, Prater L, Shellhaas C, Otsubo M, Mao S, Flanigan M, Thung S, Leonard M, Jiang F, Oza-Frank R",13,2750,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35752540,Direct and indirect costs of heart failure in relation to diabetes status - A nationwide study.,"Heart failure (HF) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are burdensome chronic diseases with high lifetime risks and numerous studies indicate associations between HF and DM. The objective of this study was to investigate the direct and indirect costs of HF patients with and without DM. Patients with a first-time diagnosis of HF from 1998 to 2016 were identified through nationwide Danish registries and stratified according to DM status into HF with or without DM. The economic healthcare cost analysis was based on both direct costs, including hospitalization, procedures, medication and indirect costs including social welfare and lost productivity. The economic burden was investigated prior to, at, and following diagnosis of HF. Patients with concomitant HF and DM were younger (median age 74 vs. 77), had more comorbidities and fewer were female as compared to patients with HF but without DM. The socioeconomic burden of concomitant HF and DM compared to HF alone was substantially higher; 45% in direct costs (€16,237 vs. €11,184), 35% in home care costs (€3123 vs. €2320), 8% in social transfer income (€17,257 vs. €15,994) and they had 27% lower income (€10,136 vs. €13,845). The economic burden peaked at year of diagnosis, but the difference became increasingly pronounced in the years following the HF diagnosis.

One such disorder involves biallelic mutations in the gene encoding endoplasmic reticulum resident co-chaperone DNAJC3 (P58<sup>IPK</sup> ) that leads to diabetes in the second decade of life, in addition to multiple endocrine dysfunction and nervous system involvement. The aim of this study was to define the natural history of this new form of diabetes, especially the course of abnormalities related to glucose metabolism. Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing was used to detect DNAJC3 defect in two patients. Detailed analysis of their clinical history as well as biochemical, neurological and radiological studies were carried out to deduce natural history of neurological and endocrine phenotype. DNAJC3 defect led to beta-cell dysfunction causing hyperinsulinemichypoglycemia around 2 years of age in both patients, which evolved into diabetes with insulin deficiency in the second decade of life, probably due to beta cell loss. Endocrine phenotype involved severe early-onset growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency, and hypothyroidism of central origin. Neurological phenotype involved early onset sensorineural deafness discovered around 5 to 6 years, and neurodegeneration of central and peripheral nervous system in the first two decades of life.

37332110,Diabetes in School Health (DiSH): Telementoring Collaboration Between Pediatric Diabetes Specialists and School Nurses to Improve Care of Children With Diabetes.,"Rates of diabetes in youth are rising and more than 1 million children have diabetes. School nurses are central to a school-aged child's diabetes care and they must make important moment-to-moment decisions requiring understanding of and comfort with diabetes care and technology. The rapid changes in diabetes care and technology make ongoing education essential, yet access to up-to-date and practical education is limited for many school nurses. Integrating needs data and stakeholders' input, this group developed Diabetes in School Health (DiSH) to address this gap. We adapted a well-established, innovative, and easily-accessible telementoring educational model, Project ECHO, to create a collaborative learning community. In the first year, 9 diabetes experts and >150 school nurses joined live DiSH sessions. DiSH has been well-received by the school community and next steps include expansion of DiSH to other states and study of impact of DiSH on health disparities.",The Journal of school nursing : the official publication of the National Association of School Nurses,2025-Jun,"Pollock AJ, Beaton WN, Burgess BA, Logel SN, Wilson L, Ciha JE, Allen J",7,977,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

From 2017-2019, 252 adults with type 1(n = 80) (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (n = 172) (T2DM) self-reported demographic factors, DD(PAID) and related psychological and clinical questionnaires. We examined PAID internal consistency, structural and convergent validity. Associations of measures with DD were explored with hierarchical linear regression analysis. PCA yielded a 3-factor solution for PAID-20 and a 2-factor solution for PAID-5. Cronbach's α for PAID/PAID-5 subscales ranged from 0.63-0.90. All PAID versions correlated most strongly to BIPQ and HFS. The prevalence of elevated distress (PAID-20 ≥33) was 40% in T1DM and 15% in T2DM. DD severity was significantly positively associated (p < 0.01) with more negative diabetes perceptions (BIPQ) and type 1 diabetes.

We focused on a cohort of diabetic patients with HHCN belonging to Resource Utilization Bands 4 and 5 according to the Adjusted Clinical Group (ACG) system. Their comorbidities were assessed using the clinical diagnoses that the ACG system assigns to single patients by combining different information flows. Regression models were applied to analyze the associations between comorbidities and health care service use or costs, adjusting for age and sex. Our analyses showed that all health care service usage measures (e.g. access to emergency care; number of outpatient visits) and the total annual costs and pharmacy costs are associated significantly with comorbidity class. Instead, no differences in hospitalization rates by comorbidity class were revealed. The association between a larger number of comorbidities and higher total health care service usage and costs was seen mainly for primary care services. This underscores the need to strengthen primary care for today's aging and multimorbid population.",Primary care diabetes,2021-Apr,"Buja A, Caberlotto R, Pinato C, Mafrici SF, Bolzonella U, Grotto G, Baldovin T, Rigon S, Toffanin R, Baldo V",10,1213,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This is partly explained by the separate treatment of diabetes and SMI, which occurs in parallel silos in many healthcare systems. The Steno Diabetes Center Sjaelland and Region Zealand established the Fusion Clinic to offer combined psychiatric and diabetes care delivered by both diabetes and mental healthcare professionals. This study describes how the clinic was established and the initial diabetes outcomes. The Fusion Clinic was co-designed by people with diabetes and SMI and healthcare professionals to improve the care of adults with diabetes and SMI. The clinic approach utilised the F-ACT model. The 63 people referred to the Fusion Clinic between 01.02.2020 and 01.01.2022 who attended the clinic for more than 6 months were included in this study. Diabetes outcomes were recorded in the electronic medical records (Sundhedsplatformen EPIC). There was a high prevalence of diabetes complications at baseline. Furthermore, 70% had one or more additional concomitant diseases, as well as SMI and diabetes. Assessment of diabetes complications and measurements of HbA<sub>1c</sub> and lipid profile improved after referral to the clinic.

New Zealanders aged ≥65 years in 2013 were identified using anonymised linkage of national administrative health databases. Dispensing of blood pressure lowering (BPL), lipid lowering (LL) or antithrombotic (AT) medications, was documented, stratified by age and by history of CVD, diabetes, or neither. Of the 593,549 people identified, 32% had prior CVD, 14% had diabetes (of whom half also had prior CVD) and 61% had neither diagnosis. For those with prior CVD, between 79-87% were dispensed BPL and 73-79% were dispensed AT medications, across all age groups. In contrast, LL dispensing was lower than either BPL or AT in every age group, falling from 75% at age 65-69 years to 43% at 85+ years. For people with diabetes, BPL and LL dispensing was similar to those with prior CVD, but AT dispensing was approximately 20% lower. Among people without prior CVD or diabetes, both BPL and AT dispensing increased with age (from 39% and 17% at age 65-69 years to 56% and 35% at 85+ years respectively), whereas LL dispensing was 26-31% across the 65-84 year age groups, falling to 17% at 85+ years.

39470889,"A novel (-)-(2S)-7,4'-dihydroxyflavanone compound for treating age-related diabetes mellitus through immunoinformatics-guided activation of CISD3.","The iron-sulfur domain (CISD) proteins of CDGSH are classified into three classes: CISD1, CISD2, and CISD3. During premature ageing, mutations that affect these proteins, namely their binding sites, could result in reduced protein production and an inability to preserve cellular integrity. Consequently, this leads to the development of conditions such as diabetes. Notably, CISD3 plays a crucial role in the management of age-related disorders such as Wolfram syndrome, which is often referred to as DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness). Computational analyses have predicted that CISD3 regulates the redox state, safeguards the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, and maintains intracellular calcium levels. CISD3, a member of a recently discovered gene family associated with the CDGSH iron protein apoptotic compensatory response, fulfils a crucial function in mitigating the effects of accelerated ageing. The compound ""(-)-(2S)-7,4'-Dihydroxyflavanone"" has been discovered by computational drug design as a possible activator of CISD3. It shows potential therapeutic benefits in ameliorating metabolic dysfunction and enhancing glucose regulation. The ligand binds to the binding pocket of the CISD3 protein, increasing the stability of the protein and enhancing its functionality. The current research investigates the binding processes of the molecule in various structures and its anticipated effects on these tissues, therefore providing valuable insights into the mitigation of age-related diabetes and metabolic dysfunction. The projected tripling of the worldwide population of individuals aged 50 and above by 2050 necessitates the urgent development of immunoinformatics-based approaches, including pharmaceutical therapies that target CISD3, to prevent age-related pathologies. The stimulation of CISD3, namely by compounds such as ""(-)-(2S)-7,4'-Dihydroxyflavanone"", has the potential to counteract telomere shortening and improve metabolic pathways.",Biogerontology,2024-Oct,"Munir AR, Baig SI, Razzaq MA, Rauf F, Ali Y, Azam SMA",6,2012,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted using a standard predesigned and pretested structured questionnaire through online mode in the month of April 2021 to assess the criteria used for referral of diabetic patients for DR screening, barriers to DR screening, and the management plan among physicians after the patient has been diagnosed with DR. In total, 100 physicians participated in the study. Physicians responded that criteria used for referral for DR screening according to duration was <5 years (n = 0), 5-10 years (n = 60), >10 years (n = 10), and irrespective of the duration (n = 30). According to severity, well-controlled DM without (n = 30) and with other system involvement (n = 50) and uncontrolled DM without (20) and with other system involvement (n = 50) and irrespective of the severity of disease (n = 30) was reported. Physicians (n = 40) responded that patients who were diagnosed with DR belonged to the Type 1 DM category rather than Type 2 DM (P < 0.05). With regard to the barriers and challenges faced in ensuring DR screening, the following themes emerged: no ocular symptoms, lack of compliance, time constraint for the patient, and lack of motivation. We found that the preferred practice pattern of physicians regarding referral for DR screening was dependent on the duration of the disease (mostly 5-10 years of the disease) and severity (when other systems were involved).

Key eligibility criteria were a diagnosis of type 1, type 2, or gestational diabetes and regular self-monitoring of blood glucose. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to either use the digital diabetes logbook (mySugr PRO), or to the control group without app use. The primary outcome was the reduction in diabetes distress at the 12-week follow-up. All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population with all randomized participants. The trial was registered at the German Register for Clinical Studies (DRKS00022923). Between February 11, 2021, and June 24, 2022, 424 participants (50% female, 50% male) were included, with 282 being randomized to the intervention group (66.5%) and 142 to the control group (33.5%). A total of 397 participants completed the trial (drop-out rate: 6.4%). The median reduction in diabetes distress was 2.41 (interquartile range [IQR]: -2.50 to 8.11) in the intervention group and 1.25 (IQR: -5.00 to 7.50) in the control group. The model-based adjusted between-group difference was significant (-2.20, IQR: -4.02 to -0.38, <i>P</i> = .0182) favoring the intervention group. There were 27 adverse events, 17 (6.0%) in the intervention group, and 10 (7.0%) in the control group. The efficacy of the digital diabetes logbook was demonstrated regarding improvements in mental health in people with type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes.",Journal of diabetes science and technology,2025-Sep,"Ehrmann D, Hermanns N, Finke-Gröne K, Roos T, Kober J, Schäfer V, Krichbaum M, Haak T, Ziegler R, Heinemann L, Rieger C, Bingol E, Kulzer B, Silbermann S",14,1627,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33199194,Diabetes care innovation in the Mexican Institute for Social Insurance: Scaling up the preventive chronic disease care model to address critical coverage constraints.,"With diabetes prevalence in Mexico at 11.3% of adults, the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) is piloting the Chronic Disease Preventive Model (CDPM). CDPM includes intensive patient education, care by multidisciplinary teams and risk management in primary care. The objective of this article is to determine CDPM coverage bottlenecks and to explore facilitators and barriers to implementation. The National Health and Nutrition Survey 2018 was processed to identify key diabetes prevalence, coverage, quality and outcome indicators. Key IMSS informant interviews and document content analyses were undertaken following the Tanahashi coverage decay model and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). IMSS screens 49% of adult beneficiaries for diabetes but only 26% with presumptive diagnosis proceed to confirmation. Out of 4.1 million adults with diabetes, IMSS diagnoses 94% and treats 85%. Medications are received by 90% of patients but only 63% of those requiring insulin receive it. The overall quality of care indicator attains 37% of potential. Coverage of diabetes education, monitoring with HbA1c and interdisciplinary care are 20%, 15% and 3%, respectively. Among IMSS beneficiaries treated by the institute 38.1% have HbA1c levels below 7% and 26.1% have levels above 9%. CDPM facilitators are the perceived threat of uncontrolled diabetes, compatibility of innovation values and willingness for institutional learning. Barriers are centralized decision making, functional differentiation across managers and practitioners and lack of incentives, resource shortages and the lack of measures to ensure fidelity. CDPM scale-up has to address organizational and process barriers while ensuring the necessary resources for sustainability.",Primary care diabetes,2021-Apr,"González Block MÁ, Díaz Portillo SP, Morales HR, Rodríguez Saldaña J, Gutiérrez Calderón E",5,1779,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34739523,Alleviating the burden of diabetes with Health Equity Funds: Economic evaluation of the health and financial risk protection benefits in Cambodia.,"In Cambodia, diabetes caused nearly 3% of the country's mortality in 2016 and became the fourth highest cause of disability in 2017. Providing sufficient financial risk protection from health care expenditures may be part of the solution towards effectively tackling the diabetes burden and motivating individuals to appropriately seek care to effectively manage their condition. In this study, we aim to estimate the distributional health and financial impacts of strategies providing financial coverage for diabetes services through the Health Equity Funds (HEF) in Cambodia. The trajectory of diabetes was represented using a Markov model to estimate the societal costs, health impacts, and individual out-of-pocket expenditures associated with six strategies of HEF coverage over a time horizon of 45 years. Input parameters for the model were compiled from published literature and publicly available household survey data. Strategies covered different combinations of types of diabetes care costs (i.e., diagnostic services, medications, and management of diabetes-related complications). Health impacts were computed as the number of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted and financial risk protection was analyzed in terms of cases of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) averted. Model simulations demonstrated that coverage for medications would be cost-effective, accruing health benefits ($27 per DALY averted) and increases in financial risk protection ($2 per case of CHE averted) for the poorest in Cambodia. Women experienced particular gains in health and financial risk protection. Increasing the number of individuals eligible for financial coverage also improved the value of such investments. For HEF coverage, the government would pay between an estimated $28 and $58 per diabetic patient depending on the extent of coverage and services covered. Efforts to increase the availability of services and capacity of primary care facilities to support diabetes care could have far-reaching impacts on the burden of diabetes and contribute to long-term health system strengthening.",PloS one,2021-,"Feldhaus I, Nagpal S, Verguet S",3,2107,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35939485,Is mental health co-morbidity an influencing factor in the health service utilisation of women with diabetes mellitus?,"Diabetes Mellitus, affecting nearly half a billion people worldwide, is a substantial global public health issue. Although diabetes predominantly affects men, women with diabetes have specific risks and self-management characteristics. Women have a higher risk of either presenting with or developing depression or anxiety, as well as being high users of complementary medicine which can create clinical governance issues. In spite of these known gender differences, limited research has explored gender-specific diabetes care, especially health service use patterns. As increasing attention has turned to supporting people with diabetes to successfully self-manage their diabetes, it is important that we understand how women with diabetes are using health services, and if their specific risk profile is influencing their health care choices. Our study sought to examine the relationship between mental health status and the patterns of conventional and complementary medicine health service use by women diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Our results showed that women with diabetes and any mental health co-morbidity were more likely to visit their general practitioner more frequently or use herbal medicine than those without a mental health co-morbidity. Women with depression and anxiety were also less likely to consult a physiotherapist and those with anxiety less likely to consult a podiatrist over time when compared to the other mental health groups.",PloS one,2022-,"Oorschot T, Adams J, Sibbritt D",3,1463,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39521723,Investigating health professionals' perspectives and experiences of food security-related conversations in diabetes care.,"Household food insecurity (FI) is a serious public health concern and disproportionately affects people living with chronic health conditions, undermining diabetes self-management. Little is known about healthcare professionals' (HCPs) experiences of supporting people affected by diabetes and FI, and no national guidelines incorporate consideration of FI within UK diabetes care. A qualitative study of NHS HCPs' consideration of FI within diabetes care, and the extent to which it informs their clinical practice, was undertaken. Fifteen HCPs providing self-management support to people with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes in a Scottish Health Board took part in semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using a thematic framework approach informed by the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour (COM-B) model of behaviour change. Although the potential impact of FI on diabetes self-management was recognised, this important consideration was not currently core to their clinical practice. Enablers and barriers identified included: personal feelings about raising the issue, lack of knowledge of available resources, the patient-practitioner relationship, and the wider socioeconomic environment. Practical suggestions to support HCPs included: specific training on communication, access to patient support information, use of a screening tool to assess FI, and building NHS-third sector links. Our findings provide insight into cognitive factors, emotional processes and environmental systems impacting on HCPs' practice supporting individuals with diabetes and FI. Research with affected patients is needed to gain a better understanding of how to provide support within NHS settings.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2025-Mar,"Mohamed S, Avenell A, Douglas F, Keen A",4,1702,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Questionnaires were administered to 321 certified diabetes educator nurses from 1277 institutions. The practice of periodontal care was assessed, with factors contributing to periodontal care through items developed based on the capability, opportunity, and motivation-behavior model. Fisher's exact tests and logistic regression were performed. >70% of certified diabetes educator nurses did not provide periodontal care for diabetes patients. The respondents who assessed people's oral conditions were more likely to engage in individual or group education and consult for oral management professionals than those who did not. Significant factors for such assessment were low psychological capability and reflective motivation, irregular and weak intention to engage in oral management, and working at an institution without an outpatient department specializing in diabetes. The education for certified diabetes educator nurses who do not work at an institution with an outpatient department specialized in diabetes care should be prioritized. Particularly, education to improve knowledge, skills, and confidence in oral assessments and to make periodontal management regular is needed.",Primary care diabetes,2021-Oct,"Shibayama T, Kudoh R, Hidaka K",3,1388,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We compared the frequency and results of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing in adults with early-onset and usual-onset diabetes and assessed factors related to guideline concordance. Population-level databases from Alberta, Canada (∼4.5 million) were used to identify adults with incident diabetes. The cohort was stratified by age at diagnosis (< 40 vs. ≥ 40 years) and then followed for 365 days for HbA1c testing. Adjusted multivariable analyses were used to identify clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with guideline concordance. Among 23,643 adults with incident diabetes (mean age 54.1 ± 15.4 years; 42.1 % female), 18.9 % had early-onset diabetes. Early-onset diabetes was associated with lower frequency of testing (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 0.80; 95 % CI 0.70-0.90) and above target glycaemic levels compared to usual-onset diabetes (aOR, 1.45; 95 % CI 1.29-1.64). Factors associated with guideline concordant frequency of HbA1c testing were rural residence and insulin use. In our universal care setting with premium-free health care, early-onset diabetes was associated with lower rates of HbA1c testing and sub-optimal glycaemic control compared to those with usual-onset diabetes.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,2024-Jul,"Sriskandarajah A, Metcalfe A, Nerenberg KA, Butalia S",4,1369,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39696157,"Identify unmet needs in diabetes care in Shandong, China: a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study using cascade of care framework.","The continuum management of diabetes remains under-evaluated in China. This study aimed to estimate the proportions of diabetes adults at each stage of the cascade of care framework in Shandong, China. We conducted a secondary analysis using the 2018 China Adult Chronic Disease and Nutrition Surveillance (CACDNS) data in Shandong. This nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted between September and November 2018, investigating the major chronic diseases among Chinese adults through interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. We employed the cascade model to examine the proportion of diabetes adults, including both type 1 and type 2, from diabetes screening, diagnosis, pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical treatments, to single and comprehensive management targets, and quantified the attrition between each stage. Diabetes screening was defined as participants reported to have ever received a blood glucose test. Diabetes diagnosis was defined as: 1) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dL, or 2) 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (2 h-OGTT) ≥ 200 mg/dL, or 3) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5%, or 4) self-reported diabetes. Diabetes management targets included: 1) single glycemic target of personalized HbA1c level, 2) comprehensive ABC targets of personalized HbA1c level, blood pressure (BP) < 140/80 mm Hg, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) level < 2.6 mmol/L, 3) lifestyle target of not currently smoking. The estimated proportion was calculated through self-reported diabetes status and FPG, 2h-OGTT and HbA1c. The number of diabetes cases in Shandong was extrapolated using the 2018 provincial census data for adults aged 18 years and above (N = 80.6 million). The cascade of diabetes care was further examined by age, sex, and Basic Public Health Service (BPHS) enrollment. This secondary analysis included 8,462 individuals (47.8% males, median age: 49.0), among whom 12.4% had diabetes (self-reported: 4.2%, newly diagnosed: 8.2%) and 41.1% had prediabetes. In 2018, an estimated 9.2 million adults in Shandong had diabetes, with 6.4 million (69.6%) receiving diabetes screening but 6.2 million (67.7%) remaining unaware of their conditions. Among self-reported diabetes adults, 2.7 million (86.4%) and 2.8 million (89.6%) received pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical treatment, respectively. Of those with treatments, 1.2 million (58.2%) met personalized glycemic target. A rapid decline, however, was observed in BP (31.1%) and LDL-c (39.3%) control among diabetes patients with multimorbidity (≥ 2 diseases). Ultimately, 0.1 million self-reported diabetes adults (3.8%) achieved the ABC targets. BPHS Enrollment slightly improved comprehensive management with ABC targets. A significant unmet need exists for diabetes adults from screening to management, particularly the comprehensive management of glycemia, BP and LDL-c levels among those with multimorbidity. Tailored strategies and appropriate allocation of healthcare resource is needed to addressing gaps in care continuum and reduce long-term disease burden.",BMC endocrine disorders,2024-Dec,"Wang Y, Ren J, Chai X, Wang Y, Lu Z, Dong J, Guo X, Yin X, Zhang J, Tang J, Ma J, Shao R",12,3073,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Their simultaneous development remains disputable. The aim of the present study was to examine the correlation between CAN and the presence/severity of DSPN in DM. Subjects with type 1 (group A: n=51; mean age 40.4 years) and type 2 DM (group B: n=153; mean age 64.6 years) were studied. Evaluation of DSPN was based on neuropathy disability score. Assessment of CAN was based on the battery of 4 standardized cardiovascular autonomic function tests. In group A, patients with moderate/severe DSPN exhibited a 12-fold higher likelihood of CAN in univariate analysis (p=0.035). However, significance was lost after adjustment for gender, age, DM duration, and haemoglobin A1c. In group A, likelihood for CAN did not correlate with the presence of mild DSPN in univariate and multivariate analysis. In group B, likelihood of CAN was similar in patients with mild and in those with moderate/severe DSPN compared with patients without DSPN in univariate and multivariate analysis. In between group comparison CAN was similarly distributed in the 2 groups (p for interaction=0.367), in patients with no, mild and moderate/severe DSPN.

34689778,Are racial/ethnic minorities recently diagnosed with diabetes less likely than white individuals to receive guideline-directed diabetes preventive care?,"Diabetes mellitus has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. As the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise, the burden of disease is divided unevenly among different populations. Racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes care are pervasive, including the provision of care for prevention of complications. Prevention efforts should be focused on the time that immediately follows a diagnosis of diabetes. The aim of this study was to assess racial/ethnic differences in the receipt of guideline-directed diabetes care for complication prevention by individuals recently diagnosed with diabetes. We used repeated cross-sections of individuals recently diagnosed with diabetes (within the past 5 years) from the National Health Interview Survey from 2011 to 2017. Multivariate regression was used to estimate the associations between race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic) and guideline-directed process measures for prevention of diabetes complications (visits to an eye and foot specialist, and blood pressure and cholesterol checks by a health professional - each in the prior year). We assessed effect modification of these associations by socioeconomic status (SES). In a sample of 7,341 participants, Hispanics had lower rates of having any insurance coverage (75.9 %) than Non-Hispanic Whites (93.2 %) and Blacks (88.1 %; p<0.001). After adjustment for demographics, total comorbidities, SES, and health insurance status, Hispanics were less likely to have an eye exam in the prior year (OR 0.80; (95 % CI 0.65-0.99); p=0.04) and a blood pressure check (OR 0.42; (95 % CI 0.28-0.65); p<0.001) compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. There was no significant effect modification of race/ethnicity by SES. Hispanics recently diagnosed with diabetes were less likely to receive some indicators of guideline-directed care for the prevention of complications. Lack of insurance and SES may partially explain those differences. Future work should consider policy change and providers' behaviors linked to racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes care.",BMC health services research,2021-Oct,"Marcondes FO, Cheng D, Alegria M, Haas JS",4,2080,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

There have been few factors that can predict future diabetic complications at the time of diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. This study aimed to clarify the clinical usefulness of MBBO for predicting the development of advanced diabetic microvascular complications. This was a cross-sectional observational study. Of 1304 consecutively admitted patients with type 2 diabetes, we enrolled 435 patients for whom we could confirm their MBBO. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to examine whether MBBO or BMI on admission was associated with advanced diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy. To evaluate the predictive performance of these indexes, we performed cross-validation in various models with MBBO or BMI and evaluated the areas under the curve (AUCs) yielded by these analyses. Univariate analyses suggested that MBBO was associated with advanced retinopathy and nephropathy, while BMI on admission was associated only with advanced nephropathy. In multivariate analyses, MBBO was significantly associated with advanced complications, while BMI on admission was not. For advanced diabetic retinopathy, the AUCs were 0.70-0.72, and for advanced nephropathy, the AUCs were 0.81-0.83. When comparing the AUCs among models, the models with MBBO sustained high predictive performance for diabetic complications. MBBO was independently associated with advanced diabetic complications, while BMI on admission was not. Diabetic microvascular complications in patients with high MBBO could progress more rapidly.

However, grouped SES data is not always representative of all members and it is difficult to obtain individual level data. A validated individual housing-based measure termed HOUSES is available, but has not been studied in diabetes. We hypothesize that patients in the lowest HOUSES quartile are associated with worse diabetic control as measured by the D5. A retrospective cohort study of 5463 patients with diabetes in 5 patient centered medical home practices in southeast Minnesota was conducted. HOUSES is a validated, standardized housing-based SES measure constructed from publicly available county assessor's office data. Diabetic control was assessed by the D5 (HgbA1c < 8, BP < 140/90, statin use, nonsmoking status, and antiplatelet therapy). In the lowest HOUSES quartile, more patients had an uncontrolled D5 (56.4%) than any of the other quartiles (49.2%, 49.8%, 49.6% respectively, p < 0.001). A multivariate analysis shows the adjusted odds of D5 control for patients in the 2nd, 3rd or 4th HOUSES quartiles as opposed to the 1st quartile are 1.28, 1.21, and 1.20, respectively. Lower SES as represented by the first quartile of HOUSES index, is associated with lower odds of D5 control and thus worse diabetic outcomes.

The health care system's workforce constraints limit its capacity to holistically support patients. To assess the effectiveness of layperson-delivered empathetic engagement over the telephone in helping improve glycemic management for patients with diabetes. This parallel-arm randomized clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment was conducted from February 12, 2022, to April 15, 2023, with final measurements on November 18, 2023, among 260 patients with uncontrolled diabetes from a federally qualified health center in Austin, Texas, engaging telephonically from home. Patients assigned to the intervention group received empathy-oriented telephone calls by community-hired laypeople for 6 months, while those assigned to the control group received usual care. Patients were stratified by baseline score (≥5 vs <5) on the depressive symptom scale of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The primary outcome was hemoglobin A1c level at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months, assessed for interaction between time and trial arm. Secondary outcomes were self-perceptions of managing diabetes, diabetes-related behaviors and distress, and mental health symptoms (measured via surveys). Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

The within-person change in hemoglobin A1c level was -0.7% (95% CI, -1.0% to -0.4%) for the intervention group and 0.02% (95% CI, -0.4% to 0.4%) for the control group. For the subgroup with a PHQ-9 score of 5 or more at baseline (38.1% [99 of 260]), the within-person change in hemoglobin A1c was -1.1% (95% CI, -1.8% to -0.5%) for the intervention group and 0.1% (95% CI, -0.7% to 0.8%; P = .004) for the control group. For the subgroup with a PHQ-9 score less than 5, the within-person change in hemoglobin A1c was -0.4% (95% CI, -0.8% to -0.1%) for the intervention group and -0.02% (95% CI, -0.5% to 0.5%; P = .21) for the control group. At 6 months, 91.7% of the participants (99 of 108) responded that the program was very or extremely beneficial.

32561381,Predictors of adherence to physical activity guidelines in patients with diabetes mellitus in the US in 2017: An exploratory analysis.,"To identify if there is an association between socio-economic or demographic factors, lifestyle habits, or chronic conditions and meeting the current exercise recommendations for adult patients with Diabetes Mellitus 2 in the United States. This secondary analysis of a cross sectional study used data from participants who reported having diabetes and answered questions regarding physical activity in the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey (n=37,204; 42% women; 30%<60 years-of-age). Respondents were dichotomized according to physical activity adherence. Predictors tested included socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, lifestyle habits, and chronic conditions. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Our data showed that 46.5% of participants with diabetes adhered to the physical activity guidelines. Daily smokers were 25% less likely to adhere to the physical activity recommendations (95% CI 0.59-0.95), patients with obesity were 37% less likely (95% CI 0.53-0.74), and those with chronic kidney disease were 24% (95% CI 0.61-0.94) less likely to do so. The odds of adhering to exercise guidelines were reduced by 20% (95% CI 0.70-0.92), 42% (95% CI 0.49-0.68), and 47% (95% CI 0.32-0.57) in good, fair, and poor health respectively.

34874534,To Tweet or Not to Tweet: A Longitudinal Analysis of Social Media Use by Global Diabetes Researchers.,"Engaging influential stakeholders in meaningful exchange is essential for pharmaceutical companies aiming to improve care. At a time where opportunities for face-to-face engagement are limited, the ability to interact, learn and generate actionable insights through digital channels such as Twitter, is of considerable value. The aim of this study was to evaluate digital engagement among global diabetes mellitus researchers. We identified every global tweet (20,614,515) and scientific publication (44,135) regarding diabetes mellitus from 1 August 2018 to 1 August 2020. Through author matching we combined datasets, resulting in a list of digitally active scientific authors. Generalised linear modelling identified factors predicting their digital engagement. Globally, 2686 diabetes researchers used Twitter to discuss the management of diabetes mellitus, posting 110,346 diabetes-related tweets. As Twitter followers increased, so did tweet frequency (p < 0.001), retweets (p < 0.001) and replies (p < 0.001) to their content. Publication count (overall/per month) and proportion of first/last authorships were unrelated to tweet frequency and the likelihood of being retweeted or replied to (p > 0.05). Those with the most  academic co-authors were significantly less likely to tweet than those with smaller networks (< 50; p = 0.001). Finally, those publishing most frequently on specific themes, including insulin (p = 0.041) and paediatrics (p < 0.001), were significantly more likely to tweet about these themes. Academic expertise and seniority cannot be assumed as proxies for digital influence. Those aiming to promote science and obtain digital insights regarding condition management should consider looking beyond well-known 'key opinion leaders' to perhaps lesser known 'digital opinion leaders' with smaller academic networks, who are likely to specialise in the delivery of highly specific content to captive audiences.",Pharmaceutical medicine,2021-Nov,"Leigh S, Noble ME, Pearson FE, Iremonger J, Williams DT",5,1940,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Records from the Diabetes Eye Screening Wales (DESW) service for people in Wales, UK, with T1DM diagnosed under age 18 years were combined with other electronic health record (EHR) data in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Data close to the screening date were collected, and risk factors derived from multivariate, multinomial logistic regression modelling. Data from 4172 persons, with median (lower quartile, upper quartile) age 16.3 (13.0, 22.3) years and duration of diabetes 6.6 (2.3, 12.3) years were analysed. 62.6% (n = 2613) had no DR, 26.7% (n = 1112) background DR, and 10.7% (n = 447) had referable DR (RDR). No RDR was observed under 19 years of age. Factors associated with an increased risk of DR were diabetes duration, elevated HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and diastolic blood pressure. People diagnosed with T1DM at 12 years or older had an additional risk for each year they had diabetes compared to those diagnosed before age 12 controlling for the diabetes duration (odds ratios 1.23 and 1.34, respectively). This study found that 37.4% of the study cohort had DR at first screening, the risk being greater the longer the duration of diabetes or higher the HbA<sub>1c</sub> and diastolic blood pressure. In addition, people diagnosed at 12 years of age or over were more likely to have DR with each additional year with diabetes.","Eye (London, England)",2021-Oct,"Rafferty J, Owens DR, Luzio SD, Watts P, Akbari A, Thomas RL",6,1515,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Data regarding the prognostic significance of HbA1c levels in contemporary intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU) patients is limited. All patients admitted to the ICCU at a tertiary care medical center between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, with documented admission HbA1c levels were included in the study. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their HbA1c levels: < 5.7 g% [no diabetes mellitus (DM)], 5.7-6.4 g% (pre-DM), ≥ 6.5 g% (DM). A total of 1412 patients were included. Of them, 974 (69%) were male with a mean age of 67(± 15.7) years old. HbA1c level < 5.7 g% was found in 550 (39%) patients, 5.7-6.4 g% in 458 (32.4%) patients and ≥ 6.5 g% in 404 (28.6%) patients. Among patients who did not know they had DM, 81 (9.3%) patients had high HbA1c levels (≥ 6.5 g%) on admission. The crude mortality rate at follow-up (up to 1.5 years) was almost twice as high among patients with pre-DM and DM than in patients with no DM (10.6% vs. 5.4%, respectively, p = 0.01). Interestingly, although not statistically significant, the trend was that pre-DM patients had the strongest association with mortality rate [HR 1.83, (95% CI 0.936-3.588); p = 0.077].

38768121,"Exploring the path to optimal diabetes care by unravelling the contextual factors affecting access, utilisation, and quality of primary health care in West Africa: A scoping review protocol.","The prevalence of diabetes in West Africa is increasing, posing a major public health threat. An estimated 24 million Africans have diabetes, with rates in West Africa around 2-6% and projected to rise 129% by 2045 according to the WHO. Over 90% of cases are Type 2 diabetes (IDF, World Bank). As diabetes is ambulatory care sensitive, good primary care is crucial to reduce complications and mortality. However, research on factors influencing diabetes primary care access, utilisation and quality in West Africa remains limited despite growing disease burden. While research has emphasised diabetes prevalence and risk factors in West Africa, there remains limited evidence on contextual influences on primary care. This scoping review aims to address these evidence gaps. Using the established methodology by Arksey and O'Malley, this scoping review will undergo six stages. The review will adopt the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to ensure methodological rigour. We will search four electronic databases and search through grey literature sources to thoroughly explore the topic. The identified articles will undergo thorough screening. We will collect data using a standardised data extraction form that covers study characteristics, population demographics, and study methods. The study will identify key themes and sub-themes related to primary healthcare access, utilisation, and quality. We will then analyse and summarise the data using a narrative synthesis approach.

32057724,Perceptions of health care professionals towards clinical practice guidelines: The case of Diabetes Mellitus in Saudi Arabia.,"Clinical practice guidelines are developed by healthcare policy makers and disseminated to practitioners in order to minimize practice variations and to improve the quality of care. Problems arise when there is a sole reliance on passive dissemination strategies such as mailing or publishing the guidelines, as these approaches do not usually lead to the adoption. This study aims to explore the perspectives of the health care professionals toward the Saudi National Diabetes Guidelines in terms of awareness, adherence and their preferred dissemination and implementation strategies of the guideline. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among physicians and nurses working in twenty primary health care centers in the city of Riyadh between February and March 2019. Nearly half of the total 179 respondents reported that they were unaware of the guidelines (49.1%), and 92% of the remaining 91 participants who were aware of the guideline reported that they had first heard about it through their official mail. The mean scores ranked according to the most preferred methods for disseminating and implementing the diabetes guidelines were as follows: via reminder systems 4.35±0.74, financial incentives 4.33±0.65, and audit and feedback 4.27±0.58. On the other hand, the least favorable strategies were traditional education 3.79±0.96 and the distribution of the guideline by mail 3.13±0.95. The level of awareness of the diabetes guidelines among the primary health care professionals was suboptimal. This was more likely due to the Ministry of Health's reliance on passive implementation strategies. In order to have the guidelines translated into clinical practice, active and targeted implementation strategies such as reminder systems, audit and feedback must be considered by the Saudi health policy makers.",Primary care diabetes,2020-Dec,"Alharbi NS, Alanazi MA",2,1820,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Between 2015 and 2019, University of Michigan employees, retirees, and dependents with prediabetes were offered the National DPP at no out-of-pocket cost. Individuals with prediabetes were identified and mailed letters encouraging them to enroll. We surveyed those who enrolled and a random sample of those who did not using the HBM as a framework to examine factors associated with enrollment. Analyses were performed using multivariable logistic regression models. Of 64,131 employees, retirees, and dependents, 8131 were identified with prediabetes and 776 (9.5%) enrolled in the National DPP. Of those surveyed, 532 of 776 National DPP enrollees and 945 of 2673 non-enrollees responded to the survey (adjusted response rates 74% and 43%, respectively). Among survey respondents, factors associated with National DPP enrollment included older age, female sex, higher BMI, prediabetes awareness, greater perceived benefits of health-protective action, and one or more cues to action. Optimizing National DPP enrollment among adults with prediabetes will require identifying individuals with prediabetes, increasing personal awareness of the diagnosis, increasing perceived benefits of enrollment, and providing strong cues to action.",Journal of diabetes and its complications,2022-Jul,"Joiner KL, McEwen LN, Hurst TE, Adams MP, Herman WH",5,1397,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

38184599,Determinants of disparities of diabetes-related hospitalization rates in Florida: a retrospective ecological study using a multiscale geographically weighted regression approach.,"Early diagnosis, control of blood glucose levels and cardiovascular risk factors, and regular screening are essential to prevent or delay complications of diabetes. However, most adults with diabetes do not meet recommended targets, and some populations have disproportionately high rates of potentially preventable diabetes-related hospitalizations. Understanding the factors that contribute to geographic disparities can guide resource allocation and help ensure that future interventions are designed to meet the specific needs of these communities. Therefore, the objectives of this study were (1) to identify determinants of diabetes-related hospitalization rates at the ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA) level in Florida, and (2) assess if the strengths of these relationships vary by geographic location and at different spatial scales. Diabetes-related hospitalization (DRH) rates were computed at the ZCTA level using data from 2016 to 2019. A global ordinary least squares regression model was fit to identify socioeconomic, demographic, healthcare-related, and built environment characteristics associated with log-transformed DRH rates. A multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model was then fit to investigate and describe spatial heterogeneity of regression coefficients. Populations of ZCTAs with high rates of diabetes-related hospitalizations tended to have higher proportions of older adults (p < 0.0001) and non-Hispanic Black residents (p = 0.003). In addition, DRH rates were associated with higher levels of unemployment (p = 0.001), uninsurance (p < 0.0001), and lack of access to a vehicle (p = 0.002). Population density and median household income had significant (p < 0.0001) negative associations with DRH rates. Non-stationary variables exhibited spatial heterogeneity at local (percent non-Hispanic Black, educational attainment), regional (age composition, unemployment, health insurance coverage), and statewide scales (population density, income, vehicle access). The findings of this study underscore the importance of socioeconomic resources and rurality in shaping population health. Understanding the spatial context of the observed relationships provides valuable insights to guide needs-based, locally-focused health planning to reduce disparities in the burden of potentially avoidable hospitalizations.",International journal of health geographics,2024-Jan,"Lord J, Odoi A",2,2356,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32516505,Use of a simplified clinical audit tool to evaluate hypertension and diabetes management in primary care clinics in Jamaica.,"This study evaluates a simple clinical audit tool for assessing quality of care and blood pressure control among persons with hypertension in primary care clinics. A systematic random sampling of persons with diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) attending five health centers in Kingston, Jamaica, was conducted. A modified Ministry of Health paper-based audit tool captured quality of care and outcome indicators (blood pressure and glycemic control). Additional chart audits were conducted by a physician and nurse to assess reliability. One hundred and forty-nine charts were audited between January and September 2017. One hundred and thirty-eight persons (92.6%) had hypertension (27 men and 111 women); 77 persons (51.7%) had DM (14 men and 63 women). The median age was 64 years old. Approximately two-thirds of persons with HTN and DM had electrolytes, lipid profile, and ECG done within the last year. One-fifth of persons with hypertension (18.5% men and 19.8% women, P = 1.000) had adequate blood pressure control with greater control among persons with HTN only compared to persons with both DM and HTN. Poor glycemic control was recorded for 69% of persons with DM (57% men and 71% women, P = .297). Moderate to substantial inter-rater agreement was observed for quality of care indicators. Our findings confirmed that hypertension and glycemic control are inadequate among persons attending primary care clinics in Jamaica's capital city. Simplified clinical audits can provide important quality of care and outcome indicators without losing the meaningfulness of the data collected.","Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)",2020-Jul,"Duncan JP, Tulloch-Reid MK, Reid-Jones H, Figueroa JP",4,1606,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38980510,Community-engaged Systems for Population Health Improvement: A Novel Approach to Improve Diabetes Outcomes in Rural Communities.,"Approaches to prevent and manage diabetes at a community population level are hindered because current strategies are not aligned with the structure and function of a community system. We describe a community-driven process based on local data and rapid prototyping as an alternative approach to create diabetes prevention and care management solutions appropriate for each community. We report on the process and provide baseline data for a 3-year case study initiative to improve diabetes outcomes in two rural Nebraska communities. We developed an iterative design process based on the assumption that decentralized decision-making using local data feedback and monitoring will lead to the innovation of local sustainable solutions. Coalitions act as community innovation hubs and meet monthly to work through a facilitated design process. Six core diabetes measures will be tracked over the course of the project using the electronic health record from community clinics as a proxy for the entire community. Baseline data indicate two-thirds of the population in both communities are at risk for prediabetes based on age and body mass index. However, only a fraction (35% and 12%) of those at risk have been screened. This information led both coalitions to focus on improving screening rates in their communities. In order to move a complex system towards an optimal state (e.g., improved diabetes outcomes), stakeholders must have access to continuous feedback of accurate, pertinent information in order to make informed decisions.

The aims of our study were to assess diabetic foot ulcer risk factors according to International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) classification, stratify patients into risk categories and identify factors associated with higher-risk grade. Cross-sectional setting over a period of 07 months, patients were randomly selected from the diabetic outpatients attending our unit of diabetology. Questionnaire and clinical examination were made by the same physician. Patients free of active foot ulcer were included. Among 230 patients evaluated, 10 had an active foot ulcer and were excluded. Five patients (2.27%) had a history of foot ulcer and 3(1.36%) had a lower-limb amputation. Sensory neuropathy, as measured by the 5.07(10 g) Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing, was present in 23.63% of patients, whereas 36.82% had a peripheral arterial disease based on clinical findings, and 43.63% had foot deformities. According to the IWGDF classification, Group 0: 72.72%, Group 1: 5.9%, Group 2: 17.73% and Group 3: 3.63%. After univariate analysis, patients in higher-risk groups were significantly more often female, had higher age and BMI, longer diabetes duration, elevated waist circumference, low school level, retinopathy and hyperkeratosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified 3 significant independent factors associated with high-risk groups: retinopathy (OR = 2.529, CI95 [1.131-5.655], p = 0.024), hyperkeratosis (OR = 2.658, CI95 [1.222-5.783], p = 0.014) and school level (OR = 0.489, CI95 [0.253-9.44], p = 0.033).

Key government organizations have developed clinical quality indicators (CQIs) to ensure patients receive adequate care. The CQIs for comprehensive diabetes care are complex and often indicate a gap-in-care among vulnerable populations. To evaluate if the availability of point-of-care (POC) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing in a mobile clinic increases CQIs adherence in vulnerable populations. This evidence-based clinical practice change project (EBCPCP) focused on improving diabetic CQIs in vulnerable populations by implementing POC HbA1c testing on a federally qualified health centers (FQHC) mobile clinic. The results, 125 individuals having received HbA1c results, indicate having POC HgbA1c testing available on the mobile unit increased HbA1c testing. No patients had an HbA1c lab completed prior to the availability of POC testing. The availability of POC testing on a mobile clinic increases access to HbA1c for vulnerable populations which improves practice outcomes and increased CQI adherence.

We aimed to develop a machine-learning model for predicting people's failure to attend a follow-up visit. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults with newly screened diabetes at a national screening program using a large Japanese insurance claims database (JMDC, Tokyo, Japan). We defined failure to attend a follow-up visit for diabetes care as no physician consultation during the 6 months after the screening. The candidate predictors were patient demographics, comorbidities, and medication history. In the training set (randomly selected 80% of the sample), we developed two models (previously reported logistic regression model and Lasso regression model). In the test set (remaining 20%), prediction performance was examined. We identified 10,645 patients, including 5,450 patients who failed to attend follow-up visits for diabetes care. The Lasso regression model using four predictors had a better discrimination ability than the previously reported logistic regression model using 13 predictors (C-statistic: 0.71 [95% CI 0.69-0.73] vs. 0.67 [0.65-0.69]; P < 0.001). The four selected predictors in the Lasso regression model were lower frequency of physician visits in the previous year, lower HbA1c levels, and negative history of antidyslipidemic or antihypertensive treatment. The developed machine-learning model using four predictors had a good predictive ability to identify patients who failed to attend a follow-up visit for diabetes care after a screening program.",Diabetes care,2022-Jun,"Okada A, Hashimoto Y, Goto T, Yamaguchi S, Ono S, Ikeda Kurakawa K, Nangaku M, Yamauchi T, Yasunaga H, Kadowaki T",10,1647,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34209306,Acellular Dermal Matrix Used in Diabetic Foot Ulcers: Clinical Outcomes Supported by Biochemical and Histological Analyses.,"Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a diabetes complication which greatly impacts the patient's quality of life, often leading to amputation of the affected limb unless there is a timely and adequate management of the patient. DFUs have a high economic impact for the national health system. Data have indeed shown that DFUs are a major cause of hospitalization for patients with diabetes. Based on that, DFUs represent a very important challenge for the national health system. Especially in developed countries diabetic patients are increasing at a very high rate and as expected, also the incidence of DFUs is increasing due to longevity of diabetic patients in the western population. Herein, the surgical approach focused on the targeted use of the acellular dermal matrix has been integrated with biochemical and morphological/histological analyses to obtain evidence-based information on the mechanisms underlying tissue regeneration. In this research report, the clinical results indicated decreased postoperative wound infection levels and a short healing time, with a sound regeneration of tissues. Here we demonstrate that the key biomarkers of wound healing process are activated at gene expression level and also synthesis of collagen I, collagen III and elastin is prompted and modulated within the 28-day period of observation. These analyses were run on five patients treated with Integra<sup>®</sup> sheet and five treated with the injectable matrix Integra<sup>®</sup> Flowable, for cavitary lesions. In fact, clinical evaluation of improved healing was, for the first time, supported by biochemical and histological analyses. For these reasons, the present work opens a new scenario in DFUs treatment and follow-up, laying the foundation for a tailored protocol towards complete healing in severe pathological conditions.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021-Jun,"Campitiello F, Mancone M, Cammarota M, D'Agostino A, Ricci G, Stellavato A, Della Corte A, Pirozzi AVA, Scialla G, Schiraldi C, Canonico S",11,1833,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The study explores disparities in the availability of services and predicts the readiness of primary healthcare facilities to manage diabetes in Tanzania. The study analyzed data from the 2014-2015 Tanzania Service Provision Assessment Survey. A total of 1142 primary healthcare facilities were included in this analysis. The Negative binomial regression models were fitted to predict each of selected independent variable that is associated with the readiness of primary healthcare to manage diabetes. The overall availability of services was significantly different across the type of facility and managing authority. In an adjusted model, the following were the predictors for a significant increase in readiness to manage diabetes: health center [β = 0.470], private facilities [β = 0.252], the performance of management meetings [β = 0.446], having source of fund other than government [β = 0.193,], and presence of medical doctors [β = 0.677]. The robust primary care systems to manage diabetes could be achieved by improving the readiness of primary healthcare facilities through optimizing the availability of diagnostic tools, basic medicines, medical doctors, and early release of a government fund to publicly-owned facilities.",Primary care diabetes,2021-Apr,"Bintabara D, Shayo FK",2,1338,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We report on a male infant with neonatal diabetes who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis at two months and 16 days. A novel homozygous missense mutation (c.259T>G) was identified in the <i>ABCC8</i> gene. In this case, insulin was replaced with glimepiride at a dosage of 0.49 mg/kg/day at five months, and this achieved metabolic control and satisfactory growth as observed at follow-up. This report improves our understanding of the mutational spectrum of <i>ABCC8,</i> which is normally associated with NDM, and shows that the treatment regimen for this condition can be successfully switched from insulin therapy to the use of sulfonylurea.",Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,2020-Dec,"Qin X, Zhong J, Lan D",3,775,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

To determine the difference in 30-day hospital readmission rates for patients who receive IDPE compared to those who do not. This retrospective cohort was completed at UTMC. Patients admitted between October 1, 2012, and September 30, 2013, were included if they were ≥18 years and had one of the following: (1) diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, (2) blood glucose >200 mg/dL (>11.11 mmol/L) on admission, or (3) hemoglobin A<sub>1C</sub> of >6.5% (>48 mmol/mol). Patients who received IDPE from a pharmacist or student pharmacist (intervention group) were compared to patients who did not receive IDPE (control group). The 30-day readmission rate was 13.2% for the intervention group (n = 364) and 21.5% for the control group (n = 149) (<i>P</i> = .023). Average time to 30-day readmission was 13.1 (±8.3) days for the IDPE group and 11.9 (±7.9) days for the control group. There was no significant difference in diabetes-related readmission between the intervention and control groups (25.5% vs 21.9%). An IDPE program delivered primarily by pharmacists and student pharmacists significantly reduced 30-day readmission rates among patients with diabetes.",Journal of pharmacy practice,2020-Dec,"Murphy JA, Schroeder MN, Ridner AT, Gregory ME, Whitner JB, Hackett SG",6,1307,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This study examined whether older adults with diabetes can be classified into different profiles based on Internet use. A latent class analysis based on 10 Internet activities was conducted using a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 65 and older (N = 1919). A multinomial logistic regression was performed to explore the potential differences related to socio-demographic characteristics and health-related factors among the classes. Three distinct classes were identified based on Internet use: non-users (n = 1299, 67.6%), communicating users (n = 327, 17.4%), and smart users (n = 293, 15.3%). Smart users were more likely to be highly educated, wealthy, and socially active, and to have good physical and cognitive functioning abilities in comparison, to the other classes. The communicating users were defined by a low incidence of depression. Older adults with diabetes are a diverse group in terms of their Internet activities. Distinguishing among the various types of older adults with diabetes can help healthcare providers tailor their approach to encourage such adults to engage in digital self-care.",Primary care diabetes,2020-Dec,"Park S, Kim B",2,1234,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Class imbalance happens where an instance in the class of interest is relatively low, when compared to the rest of the data. This study aims to apply oversampling strategies in an attempt to balance the classes and improve classification performance. We evaluated four different classifiers from k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and decision trees (DT) with 73 oversampling strategies. In this work, we used imbalanced learning oversampling techniques to improve classification in datasets that are distinctively sparser and clustered.

34237470,Use of Endocrine Consultation for Hemoglobin A1C ≥9.0% as a Standardized Practice in an Emergency Department Observation Unit.,"Severely uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with poor long-term outcomes and may remain unrecognized. A high frequency of uncontrolled DM has been identified in the acute-care setting, including the emergency department observation unit (EDOU). We assess the use of standardized endocrine consultation in the EDOU for hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels ≥9%. Standard practice in our EDOU includes universal HbA1C screening and endocrine consultation for HbA1C levels ≥9.0%. As part of a quality improvement program, EDOU patients with HbA1C levels ≥9.0% had an endocrinology consult. One-month follow-up phone calls assessed the effects of consultation after discharge. HbA1C tests were administered to 3688 (95.7%) of 3853 EDOU patients, of which 7.0% (n = 258) were found to have an HbA1C level ≥9% (mean ± SD, 11.7 ± 1.8%; range, 9%-16.6%). Endocrine consults were completed for 73.6% (190/258) patients with severely uncontrolled DM. Among the 190 patients, 92.1% (n = 175) had discharge DM medication adjustments. For known patients with DM (n = 142), injectable diabetes medication prescriptions increased from 47.2% (67/142) on EDOU arrival to 78.2% (111/142) upon discharge. Newly diagnosed DM injectable prescriptions increased from 0% (0/48) on arrival to 72.9% (35/48) upon discharge. A total of 72.6% (n = 138) were contacted at a 1-month follow-up and 94.9% (n = 131) reported taking DM medications, compared with 68.2% (n = 94) before consult.

Among the numerous techniques dedicated to tackle this problem, data preprocessing solutions are known to be efficient and easy to implement. In this paper, we propose a selective data preprocessing approach that embeds knowledge of the outlier instances into artificially generated subset to achieve an even distribution. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) was used to balance the training data by introducing artificial minority instances. However, this was not before the outliers were identified and oversampled (irrespective of class). The aim is to balance the training dataset while controlling the effect of outliers.

It is unclear how these practices currently vary across different US population subgroups. The objective of this study was to assess variation in overall and individual diabetes care practices and identify specific factors associated with differences in these practices in a representative sample of US diabetic adults. Cross-sectional data were from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Survey logistic regression was used to account for the complex sampling design. Among 30 780 eligible participants, 8957 (equivalent to 28% of the target population) followed all four diabetes care practices. Insulin-dependent participants had higher adjusted odds (adjusted OR=2.95; 95% CI 2.62 to 3.31) of following all four diabetic care practices compared with those who did not. Cost-related variables (having healthcare coverage and/or a personal doctor) were positively associated with diabetes care practices, with the strongest association observed for adherence to more costly practices (annual eye examination and cholesterol check) versus less costly ones (daily blood glucose check, daily foot check).

39577876,Clinical utility of novel diabetes subgroups in predicting vascular complications and mortality: up to 25 years of follow-up of the HUNT Study.,"Cluster analysis has previously revealed five reproducible subgroups of diabetes, differing in risks of diabetic complications. We aimed to examine the clusters' predictive ability for vascular complications as compared with established risk factors in a general adult diabetes population. Participants from the second (HUNT2, 1995-1997) and third (HUNT3, 2006-2008) surveys of the Norwegian population-based Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT Study) with adult-onset diabetes were included (n=1899). To identify diabetes subgroups, we used the same variables (age at diagnosis, body mass index, HbA1c, homeostasis model assessment estimates of beta cell function and insulin resistance, and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies) and the same data-driven clustering technique as in previous studies. We used Cox proportional hazards models to investigate associations between clusters and risks of vascular complications and mortality. We estimated the C-index and R<sup>2</sup> to compare predictive abilities of the clusters to those of established risk factors as continuous variables. All models included adjustment for age, sex, diabetes duration and time of inclusion. We reproduced five subgroups with similar key characteristics as identified in previous studies. During median follow-up of 9-13 years (differing between outcomes), the clusters were associated with different risks of vascular complications and all-cause mortality. However, in prediction models, individual established risk factors were at least as good predictors as cluster assignment for all outcomes. For example, for retinopathy, the C-index for the model including clusters (0.65 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.68)) was similar to that of HbA1c (0.65 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.68)) or fasting C-peptide (0.66 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.68)) alone. For chronic kidney disease, the C-index for clusters (0.74 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.76)) was similar to that of triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein ratio (0.74 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.76)) or fasting C-peptide (0.74 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.76)), and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate yielded a C-index of 0.76 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.78).

39531755,Prognostic value of pulse wave velocity for cardiovascular disease risk stratification in diabetic patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Arterial stiffness, a significant cardiovascular risk marker, is particularly important in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Pulse wave velocity (PWV), a non-invasive measure of arterial stiffness, has emerged as an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, its precise prognostic value in DM patients for cardiovascular risk stratification remains unclear. To address this, a systematic review was conducted. A thorough search of Ovid and Scopus databases was performed for cohort studies on PWV measurements for cardiovascular risk stratification in DM patients. Nine studies were included, examining the relationship between PWV and cardiovascular events or composite endpoints in DM patients asymptomatic of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The review revealed that optimal PWV cutoffs to predict composite cardiovascular events ranged from 10 to 12.16 m/s (aortic PWV) and 14 to 16.72 m/s (brachial-ankle PWV). In addition, meta-analysis yielded a HR of 1.15 (95 % CI 1.07-1.24, p < 0.001, I<sup>2</sup> = 70 %) for aortic PWV in predicting cardiovascular events. The assessment of arterial stiffness via PWV shows promise as an early diagnostic marker for CVD in DM patients, aiding in improved disease management. This underscores the potential of PWV in enhancing cardiovascular risk assessment and guiding clinical decisions in this high-risk population, without invasive procedures or radiation exposure.",Journal of diabetes and its complications,2024-Dec,"Cheong SS, Samah N, Che Roos NA, Ugusman A, Mohamad MSF, Beh BC, Zainal IA, Aminuddin A",8,1448,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34213655,Redefining distal symmetrical polyneuropathy features in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review.,"Diabetic neuropathy is among the most frequent complications of both type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and commonly manifests as a distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN). Despite evidence that T1DM- and T2DM-related DSPN are separate entities, most of our knowledge on diabetic DSPN derives from studies focused on type 2 diabetes. This systematic review provides an overview of current evidence on DSPN in T1DM, including its epidemiological, pathophysiological and clinical features, along with principal diagnostic tests findings. This review included 182 clinical and preclinical studies. The results indicate that DSPN is a less frequent complication in T1DM compared with T2DM and that distinctive pathophysiological mechanisms underlie T1DM-related DSPN development, with hyperglycemia as a major determinant. T1DM-related DSPN more frequently manifests with non-painful than painful symptoms, with lower neuropathic pain prevalence compared with T2DM-associated DSPN. The overt clinical picture seems characterized by a higher prevalence of large fiber-related clinical signs (e.g., ankle reflexes reduction and vibration hypoesthesia) and to a lesser extent small fiber damage (e.g., thermal or pinprick hypoesthesia). These findings as a whole suggest that large fibers impairment plays a dominant role in the clinical picture of symptomatic T1DM-related DSPN. Nevertheless, small fiber diagnostic testing shows high diagnostic accuracy in detecting early nerve damage and may be an appropriate diagnostic tool for disease monitoring and screening.",Acta diabetologica,2022-Jan,"Galosi E, Hu X, Michael N, Nyengaard JR, Truini A, Karlsson P",6,1567,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

32428521,Heat transfer analysis of blood perfusion in diabetic rats using a genetic algorithm.,"Diabetes is frequently associated with structural and functional impairment of the microcirculation. Blood perfusion is an important indicator of both physiological and pathological conditions of the microcirculation. Given that temperature is closely related to blood perfusion and is more easily measured, blood perfusion can be estimated from variations in skin temperature using an inverse method. The aim of this paper was to develop a thermal analysis method for estimation of blood perfusion and apply it in the assessment of skin blood perfusion in diabetic rats. First, diabetes was induced in the rat models of the experimental group. Skin temperature from the rats left hind paws was measured during a 10-min local heating period followed by a 15-min cooling period. A simple one-dimensional heat transfer model, including an arteriolar vessel node, was used to describe the skin heat transfer process. The blood perfusion of the arteriole was estimated by correlating the calculated skin temperature with known experimental temperatures using a genetic algorithm. The results indicated that the average blood perfusion in the control group was higher during local heating and decreased faster during the cooling period, showing dynamic responses to the thermal stimuli. In contrast, the blood perfusion of diabetic rats was reduced compared with that of the control rats during the heating phase and the rate of decrease in perfusion during the cooling stage was similarly reduced, implying a slower response to thermal stimulation in these rats. It is interesting to note that diabetic rats fed a normal diet showed a similar blood perfusion pattern to that in the control rats, implying that diet may be important in the treatment of diabetes-associated microvascular dysfunction.",Microvascular research,2020-Sep,"Wang Y, Mu L, He Y, Tang Y, Liu C, Lu Y, Xu L",7,1794,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

However, no study has previously examined how this work routinely occurs in NZ. Two case studies of practices serving ethnically and socio-economically diverse populations, followed by cross-case analysis. The NZ health care context including funding mechanisms, reporting targets, and the disease centred focus of care, acted together to dis-incentivise and de-prioritise pre-diabetes care in general practices. The social determinants of health differentially influenced patients' ability to engage with and respond to pre-diabetes care, significantly impacting this work. Differing perspectives about the significance of pre-diabetes and gaps in systematic screening practices were identified. Interventions used were inconsistent and lacked comprehensive ongoing support. Complex multi-layered factors impact on pre-diabetes care, and many of the barriers cannot be addressed at the general practice level.

33266117,Screening Model for Estimating Undiagnosed Diabetes among People with a Family History of Diabetes Mellitus: A KNHANES-Based Study.,"A screening model for estimating undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (UDM) is important for early medical care. There is minimal research and a serious lack of screening models for people with a family history of diabetes (FHD), especially one which incorporates gender characteristics. Therefore, the primary objective of our study was to develop a screening model for estimating UDM among people with FHD and enable its validation. We used data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). KNAHNES (2010-2016) was used as a developmental cohort (n = 5939) and was then evaluated in a validation cohort (n = 1047) KNHANES (2017). We developed the screening model for UDM in male (SMM), female (SMF), and male and female combined (SMP) with FHD using backward stepwise logistic regression analysis. The SMM and SMF showed an appropriate performance (area under curve (AUC) = 76.2% and 77.9%) compared with SMP (AUC = 72.9%) in the validation cohort. Consequently, simple screening models were developed and validated, for the estimation of UDM among patients in the FHD group, which is expected to reduce the burden on the national health care system.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020-Nov,"Ryu KS, Kang HYJ, Lee SW, Park HW, You NY, Kim JH, Hwangbo Y, Choi KS, Cha HS",9,1176,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34783760,Care by the Ear: The increasing role of history taking.,"History taking and clinical interviewing is usually the start of medical contact with patients with chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus in primary care. The current novel corona virus-19 epidemic has limited our ability to conduct in-person consultations with patients as before and most of us limit physical contact to the minimum. This has made the process of history taking either by virtual consultations or physically in our offices but by maintaining appropriate physical distance more important than even before. This review summarizes an easy-to-understand hierarchy of questioning to help us in maximizing the information obtained by history taking. We initiate the clinical interview with a warm welcome and first focus on the primary felt need of the patient. Then we interview the patient about his duration and current control of his diabetes. The second part of the interview focuses on current clinical status including reviewing for complications and co-morbidities. The third part focuses on current ongoing management including life style, diet, glucose lowering and other drugs and the use of complementary and alternative medicines. The fourth part of the interview focuses on emotional status including religious and cultural beliefs about diabetes management and presence of diabetes related distress. Special attention should be paid to the financial status of patients who are paying for their treatment out of pocket. The interview should conclude with summarization of current issues with regards to diabetes management and a therapeutic plan individualized for the patient.",JPMA.

33164851,"The diagnosis and management of diabetes in Australia: Does the ""Rule of Halves"" apply?","The Rule of Halves (ROH) is a theoretical framework which states that roughly half of all people with a condition are diagnosed; half of those diagnosed receive care; half of those who receive care achieve their treatment targets; and half of those who reach their targets achieve the desired treatment outcomes. This review examined the applicability of the ROH to diabetes in Australia. Five databases were searched for articles and government reports published between January 2000 and August 2019. Data was extracted for each level of the framework, and pooled sample proportions calculated for the total population and sub-group analysis by ethnicity and type of diabetes. The results showed that 72% of people with diabetes are diagnosed. Approximately 50% are receiving standard care, and 40-60% are meeting treatment targets for HbA1c, blood pressure and lipid levels. Overall, Australia is doing better than the ROH when it comes to achieving treatment outcomes; prevalence of microvascular complications was 20-30% and cardiovascular disease 62%. Indigenous people were less likely to meet treatment targets and more likely to experience adverse complications of diabetes. This review indicates the ROH does generally apply for diabetes care and management in Australia, highlighting the need for further improvement.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,2020-Dec,"Sainsbury E, Shi Y, Flack J, Colagiuri S",4,1327,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

34301190,Primary care providers' perceptions and experiences of family-centered care for older adults: a qualitative study of community-based diabetes management in China.,"Family-centered care, as a contemporary model of health service delivery, involves a mutually beneficial partnership between healthcare providers, patients and their families. Although evidence on the positive effects of family-centered care on older adults and their families is accumulating, less is known about the providers' beliefs, attitudes and practices related to family-centeredness, especially regarding community-based primary healthcare services for the rapidly-ageing Chinese population. This study investigated Chinese primary care providers' perceptions and experiences of family-centered care for older adults, using community-based diabetes management services as an example. Ten focus-group interviews involving 48 community health professionals were conducted. Major themes were identified using thematic analysis. The interviews revealed that the providers acknowledged the importance of the family in older patients' diabetes management, while their current scope of practice with the patients' families was limited and informal. The barriers to implementing family-centered care were attributed to structural and environmental obstacles associated with the patients' families and the community healthcare context and culture. To engage patients' families more effectively, the providers suggested that family-centered values endorsed by their healthcare organizations and reinforced by policies, a trained interdisciplinary team of health professionals and community social workers, and also that the utilization of technology would be beneficial. Our study extends the evidence of family-centered care for older adults in Chinese community-based healthcare settings, contributing to the design of a tailored healthcare delivery model embodying ageing in place.",BMC geriatrics,2021-Jul,"Tu J, Liao J",2,1784,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
31494031,Smoking and Diabetes Control in Adults With Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes: A Nationwide Study From the 2018 National Program for Prevention and Control of Diabetes of Iran.,"Smoking is among the top leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, studies on the association between smoking and diabetes complications and metabolic control have shown conflicting results. In this study, we aimed to assess the association of smoking with micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes and lipid and glycemic indices. We used the National Program for Prevention and Control of Diabetes of Iran database of 99,651 adult patients with diabetes across Iran. Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association between smoking and diabetes complications including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy. This association was adjusted for age, sex, duration of diabetes, glycated hemoglobin (A1C), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, medication, obesity and type of diabetes. Smoking was associated with cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy (odds ratios [ORs] for patients with type 1 diabetes were 1.51, 2.29, 2.70 and 2.40, respectively; for patients with type 2 diabetes, ORs were 1.27, 1.21, 1.51 and 1.70, respectively; all with p values <0.001). Among patients with type 1 diabetes, smoking was significantly (p<0.05) associated with A1C (OR, 2.12), 2-h postglucose level (OR, 1.30), triglycerides (OR, 1.48) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) control (OR, 1.34). Among patients with type 2 diabetes, smoking was significantly associated with A1C (OR, 1.09) and HDL control (OR, 1.21). Smoking was associated with multiple diabetes complications including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy and worse A1C and HDL control in both patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It was also associated with worse 2-h postglucose level and triglyceride control among patients with type 1 diabetes.

36538088,Diabetes medication following heart transplantation: a focus on novel cardioprotective therapies-a joint review from endocrinologists and cardiologists.,"There is accumulating evidence that novel glucose-lowering agents infer potent cardiovascular and renal benefits. Therefore, it is imperative to reassess the management of post-transplant diabetes mellitus and consider the role of newer agents. With improved transplant-related survival and high prevalence of post-transplant diabetes, management of long-term complications such as diabetes are increasingly important. There are limited guidelines to assist in choice of appropriate agents after solid organ transplantation. Traditional therapies including insulin and sulfonylureas may still have a role; however, other agents should be considered prior. The evidence of novel glucose-lowering agents in post-transplant care is limited, and most studies have focused on kidney transplant recipients. While there are some parallels between renal and cardiac transplant recipients, the potential cardiovascular benefits, particularly on cardiac fibrosis are unique to cardiac transplantation. The treatment of diabetes, with a focus on additional cardiac and renal benefits, needs to be brought to the forefront of post-transplant care with incorporation of recent evidence outside of transplantation. The role for novel glucose-lowering agents in cardiac transplant recipients will be explored, with a summary of available evidence.",Acta diabetologica,2023-Apr,"Raven LM, Muir CA, Macdonald PS, Hayward CS, Jabbour A, Greenfield JR",6,1332,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Recent evidence showed increased cutaneous macrophage infiltration in patients with type 2 diabetes and painful DPN, and this study aimed to understand whether the same applies to type 1 diabetes. The study included 104 participants: 26 healthy controls and 78 participants with type 1 diabetes (participants without DPN [n = 24], participants with painless DPN [n = 29], and participants with painful DPN [n = 25]). Two immune cells, dermal IBA1<sup>+</sup> macrophages and epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs, CD207<sup>+</sup>), were visualized and quantified using immunohistological labeling and stereological counting methods on skin biopsies from the participants. The IBA1<sup>+</sup> macrophage infiltration, LC number density, LC soma cross-sectional area, and LC processes were measured in this study. Significant difference in IBA1<sup>+</sup> macrophage expression was seen between the groups (<i>p</i> = 0.003), with lower expression of IBA1 in participants with DPN. No differences in LC morphologies (LC number density, soma cross-sectional area, and process level) were found between the groups (all <i>p</i> > 0.05). In addition, IBA1<sup>+</sup> macrophages, but not LCs, correlated with intraepidermal nerve fiber density, Michigan neuropathy symptom inventory, (questionnaire and total score), severity of neuropathy as assessed by the Toronto clinical neuropathy score, and vibration detection threshold in the whole study cohort. This study showed expressional differences of cutaneous IBA1<sup>+</sup> macrophages but not LC in participants with type 1 diabetes-induced DPN compared with those in controls. The study suggests that a reduction in macrophages may play a role in the development and progression of autoimmune-induced diabetic neuropathy.",Neurology(R) neuroimmunology & neuroinflammation,2023-Sep,"Hu X, Buhl CS, Sjogaard MB, Schousboe K, Mizrak HI, Kufaishi H, Hansen CS, Yderstræde KB, Jensen TS, Nyengaard JR, Karlsson P",11,1946,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38628006,Discrepancies between Glycated Hemoglobin and Fasting Plasma Glucose in New-onset Diabetes Mellitus.,"Background Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) are commonly used for diagnosing diabetes mellitus in Nepal. Though HbA1c criteria are convenient for diagnosis there is a discrepancy between the fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c for diagnosis. Objective To assess the comparability between fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels in the new-onset diabetes mellitus. Method This is a hospital-based descriptive cross-sectional study including 128 newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus conducted at Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital. New onset diabetes patients above 18 years of age who met inclusion criteria were included. The clinical characteristics and biochemical parameters were analyzed. Statistical analysis was done using student's t-test and correlation coefficient. Result There were 128 newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus patients included in the study among which 57.0% were males with a mean age of 49.48±11.40 years. The mean fasting plasma glucose, postprandial sugar (PPBS), and glycated hemoglobin were 205.54±88.93 mg/dL, 331.08±146.61 mg/dL, and 9.59±2.70% respectively. Diabetes was diagnosed using fasting plasma glucose, and glycated hemoglobin criteria in 84.4% and 90.6% of patients. In new-onset diabetic patients, 76.56% of patients had both elevated levels of fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin. Of the diabetic patients who had fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL, 90.7% of patients had HbA1c ≥ 6.5% whereas 1.6% of new-onset diabetes had < 126 mg/dL and glycated hemoglobin < 6.5%. There was a strong correlation between fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin (r=0.723; p<0.01).

33743696,Exploratory study on classification of diabetes mellitus through a combined Random Forest Classifier.,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) has become the third chronic non-communicable disease that hits patients after tumors, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and has become one of the major public health problems in the world. Therefore, it is of great importance to identify individuals at high risk for DM in order to establish prevention strategies for DM. Aiming at the problem of high-dimensional feature space and high feature redundancy of medical data, as well as the problem of data imbalance often faced. This study explored different supervised classifiers, combined with SVM-SMOTE and two feature dimensionality reduction methods (Logistic stepwise regression and LAASO) to classify the diabetes survey sample data with unbalanced categories and complex related factors. Analysis and discussion of the classification results of 4 supervised classifiers based on 4 data processing methods. Five indicators including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score and AUC are selected as the key indicators to evaluate the performance of the classification model. According to the result, Random Forest Classifier combining SVM-SMOTE resampling technology and LASSO feature screening method (Accuracy = 0.890, Precision = 0.869, Recall = 0.919, F1-Score = 0.893, AUC = 0.948) proved the best way to tell those at high risk of DM. Besides, the combined algorithm helps enhance the classification performance for prediction of high-risk people of DM. Also, age, region, heart rate, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and BMI are the top six most critical characteristic variables affecting diabetes. The Random Forest Classifier combining with SVM-SMOTE and LASSO feature reduction method perform best in identifying high-risk people of DM from individuals.

36745515,"Clinical and biochemical determinants of length of stay, readmission and recurrence in patients admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis.","The increasing prevalence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) related admissions poses a significant burden on the healthcare systems globally. However, data regarding the predictors of healthcare resource utilization in DKA is limited and inconsistent. This study aimed to identify key predictors of hospital length of stay (LOS), readmission and recurrent DKA episodes. We undertook a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of all DKA admissions from 2015 to 2021 across four hospitals in Qatar. The primary outcomes were the length of stay (LOS), 90-day readmission and 6-month and 1-year DKA recurrence. We included 922 patients with a median age of 35 years (25-45). 62% were males with type-1 diabetes-mellitus (T1DM) and type-2 DM (T2DM), present in 52% and 48% of patients. The median LOS was 2.6 days (IQR 1.1-4.8), and the median DKA resolution time was 18 h (10.5-29). Male-gender, new-onset DM, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), lower haemoglobin, sodium and potassium, higher urea, longer DKA duration and MICU admission predicted a longer LOS in a multivariate regression analysis. None of the factors were significantly associated with 90-day readmission. Patients with pre-existing T1DM were more likely to have a six-month DKA recurrence than pre-existing T2DM. Patients with a 6-month DKA recurrence, female gender and T1DM had higher odds of 12-month recurrence, whereas a consult with a diabetes educator at the index admission was associated with decreased odds of recurrence. This is the most extensive study from the Middle-East region reporting on LOS, readmissions and the recurrence of DKA. Results from this study with a diverse population may be valuable for physicians and healthcare systems to decrease the diabetes-related healthcare burden in DKA patients.",Annals of medicine,2023-Dec,"Ata F, Khan AA, Khamees I, Iqbal P, Yousaf Z, Mohammed BZM, Aboshdid R, Marzouk SKK, Barjas H, Khalid M, El Madhoun I, Bashir M, Kartha A",13,1790,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

33628833,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy in Ethiopia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Currently, diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most severe complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). Despite the seriousness of this problem, limited evidence is available on the prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patients with diabetes mellitus in Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, there were no updated studies that estimate the national prevalence of DPN. Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis provided a national prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patients with diabetes mellitus in Ethiopia. This study was submitted for registration with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) in March 2020 and accepted with the registration number CRD42020173831. Different database searching engines were searched online to retrieve related articles, including PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, African Journals Online, World Health Organization (WHO) Afro Library, and Cochrane Review. The reviewers used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline in the reviewing process. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, all published and unpublished articles were analyzed. The reviewers used the random effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among diabetes mellitus patients. The reviewers conducted the statistical analysis using the R version 3.5.3 and RStudio version 1.2.5033 software for Windows. The reviewers evaluated the heterogeneity across the included studies by the inconsistency index (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>). The reviewers examined the publication bias by the funnel plot. The search of the databases produced 245 papers. After checking the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 38 articles with 14029 total patients with diabetes mellitus were found suitable for the review. Except for three (retrospective cohort study), all studies were cross-sectional. The overall pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was 22% (95% CI 18% to 26%).

38773932,MicroRNA-29-mediated cross-talk between metabolic organs in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and its complications: A narrative review.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by hyperglycemia. Microribonucleic acids (microRNAs) are noncoding RNA molecules synthesized in the nucleus, modified, and exported to the extracellular environment to bind to their complementary target sequences. It regulates protein synthesis in the targeted cells by inhibiting translation or triggering the degradation of the target messenger. MicroRNA-29 is one of noncoding RNA that can be secreted by adipose tissue, hepatocytes, islet cells, and brain cells. The expression level of the microRNA-29 family in several metabolic organs is regulated by body weight, blood concentrations of inflammatory mediators, serum glucose levels, and smoking habits. Several experimental studies have demonstrated the effect of microRNA-29 on the expression of target genes involved in glucose metabolism, insulin synthesis and secretion, islet cell survival, and proliferation. These findings shed new light on the role of microRNA-29 in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications, which plays a vital role in developing appropriate therapies. Different molecular pathways have been proposed to explain how microRNA-29 promotes the development of diabetes and its complications. However, to the best of our knowledge, no published review article has summarized the molecular mechanism of microRNA-29-mediated initiation of DM and its complications. Therefore, this narrative review aims to summarize the role of microRNA-29-mediated cross-talk between metabolic organs in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications.",Cell biochemistry and function,2024-Jun,"Yesuf HA, Molla MD, Malik T, Seyoum Wendimagegn Z, Yimer Y",5,1601,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32771242,Toward a model of shared meaningful diagnosis.,"The purpose was to explain the process of diabetes-related diagnosis that prompts patient action (behavior change or treatment adherence). A secondary purpose was to identify barriers/gaps that prevent those outcomes. Using a grounded theory approach, we explored diagnosis from the patient's perspective and through the lens of the electronic health record (EHR). A thematic analysis was conducted on interview and EHR data from 28 patients, using the constant comparative method. The emerging model of shared meaningful diagnosis included four stages: stimulus to screen, medical decision making, medical information transfer, and patient sensemaking. Barriers to a meaningful diagnosis emerged in clinical documentation, clinician communication, and patient sensemaking. This study expands current understanding of ""diagnosis,"" suggesting additional stages between diagnostic labeling and disease management. The additional stages of medical information transfer and patient sensemaking are critical steps to a shared meaningful diagnosis that could enable teamwork among the patient and healthcare team. To sustain meaningful diagnosis for the patient, clinicians should document what language they used to explain the diagnosis to the patient so that subsequent clinicians can use similar language.

32561466,A randomized clinical trial of a collaborative home-based diabetes intervention to reduce emergency department visits and hospitalizations in black individuals with diabetes.,"The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in black individuals (blacks) is twice that of white individuals (whites), and blacks are more likely to have worse glycemic control, less optimal medication regimens, and higher levels of mistrust in the medical system. These three factors account for higher rates of acute medical care use in blacks with DM. To address this disparity, we developed DM I-TEAM (Diabetes Interprofessional Team to Enhance Adherence to Medical Care), a home-based multidisciplinary behavioral intervention that integrates care from a community health worker (CHW), the participant's primary care physician (PCP), a DM nurse educator, and a clinical pharmacist. Treatment is delivered during 9 sessions over 1 year, and includes diabetes education and goal setting, telehealth visits with participants' PCP and a DM nurse educator, and comprehensive medication reviews by a pharmacist. We describe the rationale and methods for a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of DM I-TEAM to reduce emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. We are enrolling 200 blacks with DM during an ED visit. Participants are randomized to DM I-TEAM or Usual Medical Care (UMC). Follow-up assessments are conducted at 6 and 12 months.

33550441,Realising the long-term promise of insulin therapy: the DCCT/EDIC study.,"The introduction of insulin in the treatment of juvenile-onset, now type 1, diabetes mellitus transformed a rapidly fatal disease into a chronic degenerative one. During the insulin-treatment era, long-term microvascular and cardiovascular complications proved to be the bane of existence for people with type 1 diabetes, leading to blindness, kidney failure, amputations, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and premature mortality. The nascent understanding of the link between non-physiologically regulated glucose levels and these complications led to the development of new treatment tools in the 1970s and 1980s that facilitated the delivery of insulin to achieve glucose levels closer to non-diabetic levels. These therapeutic advances set the stage for definitive testing of the glucose hypothesis. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), supported by the National Institute of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH), definitively established the benefits and risks of intensive therapy that substantially lowered mean blood glucose levels, measured by HbA<sub>1c</sub>, over a mean 6.5 years of therapy. Intensive therapy in the DCCT, resulting in a mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> of ~7% (53 mmol/mol), reduced the development and progression of early microvascular and neurological complications associated with diabetes by 34-76% compared with the conventional-treatment group, which maintained an HbA<sub>1c</sub> of ~9% (75 mmol/mol). Intensive therapy was also associated with weight gain and a threefold increased risk for hypoglycaemia. At the end of the DCCT, a long-term observational follow-up study, the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study, commenced. Despite the convergence of HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels between the two groups during EDIC, owing to the adoption of intensive therapy by the original DCCT conventional-treatment group and the return of all participants to their own healthcare providers for diabetes care, the development and progression of complications continued to be substantially less in the original intensive-treatment group vs the conventional-treatment group; this phenomenon was termed 'metabolic memory'. The DCCT demonstrated a major reduction in early-stage complications with intensive therapy and the metabolic memory phenomenon during EDIC contributed to a substantially lower burden of advanced complications over time. These included a 57% lower risk of CVD events and 33% lower rate of mortality in the original intensive-treatment group compared with the conventional-treatment group. DCCT/EDIC has ushered in the intensive-treatment era, which has been universally adopted and includes the goal of achieving HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels less than 7% (53 mmol/mol) for most patients. Although the challenge of making intensive therapy (with the aim of achieving normoglycaemia) as widely accessible and safe as possible remains, continuing improvements in insulin therapy 100 years after its introduction promise a brighter future for people with type 1 diabetes.",Diabetologia,2021-May,Nathan DM,1,3080,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34838412,"Efficacy of DiaLife, an Education Program for Relatives of Adults with Diabetes - A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.","Diabetes affects the lives of patients and their close relatives. Considering the proven benefit of patient education programs, DiaLife was elaborated as the first German education program addressing the needs of relatives. The objective of this study was to investigate its efficacy. The evaluation was implemented in the form of a cRCT with longitudinal design and waiting list condition.In total, 179 relatives were recruited. Participants' diabetes-related knowledge was defined as the primary outcome. Diabetes-related strains, family interaction and other psychosocial factors were determined as secondary outcomes. A generalized estimating equation model showed a persistent increase of diabetes-related knowledge in the intervention group compared to the control group regardless of the type of diabetes. Concerning secondary outcomes, mixed linear models showed an improvement for relatives of people with type 2 diabetes who participated in the DiaLife program. This study provides evidence of DiaLife's efficacy regarding a persistent increase of diabetes-related knowledge and a positive effect on psychosocial outcomes in relatives of people with type 2 but not in type 1 diabetes. Adding (an)other psychosocial module(s) might improve their well-being and psychosocial outcomes. Diabetes centers should consider implementing an education program for relatives, such as DiaLife, in their curriculum.

34762354,Using the AUSDRISK score to screen for pre-diabetes and diabetes in GP practices: a case-finding approach.,"To identify the optimal AUSDRISK threshold score to screen for pre-diabetes and diabetes. A total of 406 adult patients not diagnosed with diabetes were screened in General Practices (GP) between May and October 2019. All patients received a point of care (POC) HbA1c test. HbA1c test results were categorised into diabetes (≥6.5% or ≥48 mmol/mol), pre-diabetes (5.7-6.4% or 39-47 mmol/mol), or normal (<5.7% or 39 mmol/mol). Of these patients, 9 (2%) had undiagnosed diabetes and 60 (15%) had pre-diabetes. A Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to predict the presence of pre-diabetes and diabetes; the area under the ROC curve was 0.72 (95%CI 0.65-0.78) indicating modest predictive ability. The optimal threshold cut point for AUSDRISK score was 17 (sensitivity 76%, specificity 61%, + likelihood ratio (LR) 1.96, - likelihood ratio of 0.39) while the accepted cut point of 12 performed less well (sensitivity 94%, specificity 23%, +LR=1.22 -LR+0.26). The AUSDRISK tool has the potential to be used as a screening tool for pre-diabetes/diabetes in GP practices. A cut point of ≥17 would potentially identify 75% of all people at risk and three in 10 sent for further testing would be positive for prediabetes or diabetes. Routine case-finding in high-risk patients will enable GPs to intervene early and prevent further public health burden from the sequelae of diabetes.",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,2022-Apr,"Fleming K, Weaver N, Peel R, Hure A, McEvoy M, Holliday E, Parsons M, Acharya S, Luu J, Wiggers J, Rissel C, Ranasinghe P, Jayawardena R, Samman S, Attia J",15,1399,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37498716,Assessing fear of complications in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes with the Fear of Diabetes Complications Questionnaire.,"Fear of diabetes complications (FDC) is a common source of emotional distress in people with diabetes across types and treatments and may affect health outcomes. To assess FDC, the Fear of Diabetes Complications Questionnaire (FDCQ) was developed. This study evaluates the FDCQ's German version in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). A German version of the FDCQ was developed and administered as part of four different studies sampling people with T1D and T2D. Measurement properties were evaluated across studies using factor analyses, reliability estimates, and associations of the measure within a network of variables. A cutoff criterion for elevated FDC was derived. A short form scale was also developed. High reliability and validity were supported. FDC as measured by the FDCQ was independently associated with higher diabetes distress and depressive symptoms. A cut-off score for elevated FDC was set at ≥30 in the 15-item FDCQ. Elevated FDCQ scores were detected in 36% of participants in secondary diabetes care and up to 46% of those in tertiary care. FDC is prevalent in people with T1D and T2D and associated with diabetes distress and depressive symptoms. The FDCQ is a reliable and valid tool for assessing FDC in research and practice. It may help identify persons in need of tailored education and care and monitor effects following treatment.

38087202,Making prediabetes visible in primary health care: a qualitative study of health care professionals' perspectives.,"People with prediabetes are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and its complications, such as cardiovascular diseases and premature mortality. Primary prevention and health maintenance are therefore imperative. Evidence has shown that prediabetes can be prevented or delayed with behavioural change, mainly in eating habits and physical activity. Interventions that use a person-centered approach can lead to improvements in self-management, quality of life, and health outcomes. Nevertheless, there is a need for further research that engages healthcare professionals and people with prediabetes in constructing and implementing preventive programs. The purpose of this study is to explore and describe how healthcare professionals perceive prediabetes, the current challenges in its detection and treatment, and what is needed to improve quality of care. This qualitative study was conducted in Region Stockholm. A total of 26 primary health care professionals participated in individual interviews: 15 diabetes nurses and/or district nurses, five general practitioners, five dietitians, and one physiotherapist. Interview transcripts were analyzed with qualitative content analysis. The analysis revealed two main themes that emphasize the need to make prediabetes more visible in primary health care. Despite the healthcare professionals' engagement and their motivation to improve prediabetes care, ad hoc practices and the absence of clear screening guidelines and referral pathways made it harder to focus on primary prevention. Supporting professionals in implementing structured care for people with prediabetes might encourage more efficient interprofessional collaboration and contribute to better strategies for promoting behavioural change. Establishing prediabetes care guidelines, supporting health care professionals´ knowledge and skills in prediabetes care, and implementing interprofessional referral pathways are some steps to enhance prediabetes detection and care precedence in primary health care. These steps could lead to more preventive care and ensure patient safety and health care equity.",BMC primary care,2023-Dec,"Harcke K, Graue M, Skinner TC, Olsson CB, Saleh-Stattin N",5,2125,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We found that young people with diabetes, as they develop through to adulthood, are exposed to considerable risks to their physical and mental health. Family-system interventions have had mixed outcomes. Research in this area would benefit from attention to ethnic/cultural diversity, and involving fathers and other family members. In adults with diabetes, social support relates to better diabetes outcomes. While family member involvement in care is likely to affect health and psychosocial outcomes of the person with diabetes, key elements and mediators of effective family interventions need to be identified. The challenges of diabetes management at work are under-researched; distress and intentional hyperglycaemia are common. When depression is comorbid with diabetes, there are increased work-related risks, e.g. unemployment, sickness absence and reduced income. Research to support people with diabetes at work should involve colleagues and employers to raise awareness and create supportive environments. Stigma and discrimination have been found to be more common than previously acknowledged, affecting self-care, well-being and access to health services. Guidance on stigma-reducing choice of language has been published recently. Resilience, defined as successful adaptation to adversity such as stigma and discrimination, requires studies relevant to the specific challenges of diabetes, whether at diagnosis or subsequently. The importance of the social context for living well with diabetes is now fully recognized, but understanding of many of the challenges, whether at home or work, is still limited, with much work needed to develop successful interventions.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2020-Mar,"de Wit M, Trief PM, Huber JW, Willaing I",4,1916,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Our primary goal was to examine diagnosis rates and therapy of individuals with diabetes living in Ormánság, one of the most deprived areas in Hungary and Europe. Our secondary goal was to examine the differences in lifestyle factors and cancer screening participation of patients with diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes compared to healthy participants. Our study is a cross-sectional analysis using data from the ""Ormánság Health Program"". The ""Ormánság Health Program"" was launched to improve the health of individuals in a deprived region of Hungary. Participants in the program were coded as diagnosed diabetes based on diagnosis by a physician as a part of the program, self-reported diabetes status, and self-reported prescription of antidiabetic medication. Undiagnosed diabetes was defined as elevated blood glucose levels without self-reported diabetes and antidiabetic prescription. Diagnosis and therapeutic characteristics were presented descriptively. To examine lifestyle factors and screening participation, patients with diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes were compared to healthy participants using linear regression or multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for sex and age. Our study population consisted of 246 individuals, and 17.9% had either diagnosed (n=33) or undiagnosed (n=11) diabetes. Metformin was prescribed in 75.8% (n=25) of diagnosed cases and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2) in 12.1% (n=4) of diagnosed patients. After adjustment, participants with diagnosed diabetes had more comorbidities (adjusted [aOR]: 3.50, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.34-9.18, p<0.05), consumed vegetables more often (aOR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.07-5.78, p<0.05), but desserts less often (aOR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.15-0.75, p<0.01) than healthy individuals. Patients with undiagnosed diabetes were not different in this regard from healthy participants. No significant differences were observed for cancer screening participation between groups.

Exosomes can carry diverse cargo including RNA, DNA, lipids, proteins, and metabolites. Exosomes transfer substances and information between cells by circulating in body fluids and are thus involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes in the human body. Recent studies have closely associated exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) with various human diseases, including diabetes mellitus (DM), which is a complex multifactorial metabolic disorder disease. Exosomal miRNAs are emerging as pivotal regulators in the progression of DM, mainly in terms of pancreatic β-cell injury and insulin resistance. Exosomal miRNAs are closely associated with DM-associated complications, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic nephropathy (DN), and diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), etc. Further investigations of the mechanisms of action of exosomal miRNAs and their role in DM will be valuable for the thorough understanding of the physiopathological process of DM.

There is an absence of strong evidence-based dietary guidelines for the prevention and management of post-transplant diabetes mellitus in kidney transplant recipients. The aim of this study was to systematically review all dietary evidence for kidney transplant recipients on clinical outcomes relating to diabetes, patient-reported outcomes and economic outcomes. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in August 2020 using the databases Medline, Embase, CENTRAL and CINAHL. Studies were critically appraised using Cochrane risk of bias tools and GRADE. A total of 12 studies and 1928 participants were included. Four papers focused on diet and exercise, one paper on diet only, two papers on magnesium supplementation, one paper on magnesium and fibre intake, two papers on Mediterranean diet, one paper on marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation and one paper on fruit and vegetable intake. There were no significant effects on outcomes relating to dietary counselling, magnesium supplementation, magnesium and fibre intake or marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation. Low-quality evidence supports the Mediterranean diet in reducing the risk of post-transplant diabetes mellitus and fasting plasma glucose levels. Low-quality evidence suggests vegetable intake being associated with a lower risk of post-transplant diabetes mellitus. This review demonstrates limited evidence for dietary interventions in the prevention and management of diabetes in post-kidney transplantation.

However, as useful as CGMs are, the experience in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited and has not been summarized. A scoping review of the scientific literature was conducted. Medline, Embase, Global Health and Scopus were used to seek original research conducted in LMICs. The search results were screened by two reviewers independently. We included studies assessing health outcomes following the use of CGMs at the individual level (e.g. glycaemic control or complications) and at the health system level (e.g. barriers, facilitators and cost-effectiveness) in English, Portuguese, Spanish and French. Results were summarized narratively. From 4772 records found in database search, 27 reports were included; most of them from China (n = 7), Colombia (n = 5) and India (n = 4). Thirteen reports studied T1DM, five T2DM, seven both T1DM and T2DM and two GDM. Seven reports presented results of experimental studies (five randomized trials and two quasi-experimental); two on cost-effective analysis and the remaining 18 were observational. Studies showed that CGMs improved surrogate glycaemic outcomes (HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction), hard endpoints (lower hospitalization rates and diabetes complications) and patient-oriented outcomes (quality of life). However, several caveats were identified: mostly observational studies, few participants in trials, short follow-up and focused on surrogate outcomes. The scoping review identified that studies about CGMs in LMICs have several limitations. Stronger study designs, appropriate sample sizes and the inclusion of patient-important outcomes should be considered to inform the evidence about CGMs for the management of people with diabetes in LMICs.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2023-Jun,"Bernabe-Ortiz A, Carrillo-Larco RM, Safary E, Vetter B, Lazo-Porras M",5,1944,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39559363,"A comprehensive review of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related diabetes mellitus: incidence, clinical features, management, and prognosis.","Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related diabetes mellitus (ICI-DM) is a rare complication that medical oncologists seldom encounter in routine practice. The sporadic nature and intrinsic complexity of ICI-DM make it challenging to analyze comprehensively in experimental settings. In this review, we examine phase 3 clinical trials on ICIs and published case reports of ICI-DM, aiming to summarize its incidence, clinical features, management, and prognosis. Phase 3 clinical trials reveal that the incidence of ICI-DM is higher with combination therapies, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-L1, compared to anti-PD-1 monotherapy. ICI-DM typically presents as severe hyperglycemia with a fulminant onset and is often associated with diabetic ketoacidosis, accompanied by unexpectedly low HbA1c and C-peptide levels. ICI-DM shares similarities with classic type 1 diabetes, particularly in terms of autoimmunity and genetic predisposition. This includes a high prevalence of islet autoantibodies and susceptibility to certain HLA haplotypes, often with concurrent endocrine gland dysfunction. This suggests that genetic susceptibility and exposure to ICIs may both be necessary for triggering islet autoimmunity and inducing ICI-DM. Notably, patients with positive islet autoantibodies, such as glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody and islet-associated antigen 2 antibody, tend to experience rapid onset of ICI-DM after ICI exposure. Although patients with ICI-DM generally show a high objective response rate to immunotherapy, a significant proportion also face the need to permanently discontinued treatment. Further research is urgently needed to determine whether permanent discontinuation of immunotherapy is necessary and whether this discontinuation negatively impacts overall survival.",Frontiers in immunology,2024-,"Zhou L, Yang S, Li Y, Xue C, Wan R",5,1798,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

In recent years, research on intracellular zinc dynamics has progressed, and it has become clear that zinc transporters strictly control intracellular zinc localization, zinc regulates the functions of various proteins and signal transduction pathways as a second messenger similar to calcium ions, and intracellular zinc dyshomeostasis is associated with impaired insulin synthesis, secretion, sensitivity, lipid metabolism, and vascular function. Numerous animal and human studies have shown that zinc deficiency may be associated with the risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and zinc administration might be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of these diseases. Therefore, an understanding of zinc biology may help the establishment of novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and CVDs.

Diabetes mellitus is a common complication of acromegaly, occurring in approximately one-third of patients. The risk of diabetes mellitus in acromegaly is driven by increased exposure to growth hormone, which directly attenuates insulin signalling and stimulates lipolysis, leading to decreased glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. Acromegaly is a unique human model, where insulin resistance occurs independently of obesity and is paradoxically associated with a lean phenotype and reduced body adipose tissue mass. Diabetes mellitus in patients with acromegaly is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Therefore, preventive measures and optimized treatment of diabetes mellitus are essential in these patients. However, specific recommendations for the management of diabetes mellitus secondary to acromegaly are lacking due to limited research on this subject. This Review explores the underlying mechanisms for diabetes mellitus in acromegaly and its effect on morbidity and mortality.

Male patients, older than 50 years, attended their first dental visit to the School of Dentistry for a period of two years, and it was proposed to evaluate undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. Periodontal, biochemical, microbiological examinations, nutritional profile, and physical activity were performed. A total of 106 patients were examined, 6 (5.6%) had diabetes, and 37 (34.9%) had prediabetes without prior diagnosis. The severity of periodontitis was greater in patients with diabetes. Most of the patients were overweight and had increased systolic blood pressure. Patients with prediabetes and periodontitis had a low adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Tannerella forsythia was present in more patients with periodontitis, and the prevalence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is practically absent in groups with periodontitis, except for the group with diabetes. In the population studied, the prevalence of patients without a diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes was very high and underestimated. The increased severity of periodontitis in patients with diabetes and in conjunction with the high level of cortisol seen in patients with periodontitis, especially those with diabetes, emphasize the dysregulation of the immunoinflammatory system. It is essential to add all this data to our dental practice to cover patient health with a broader landscape.",Journal of dentistry,2023-May,"Portes J, Bullón B, Gallardo I, Fernandez-Riejos P, Quiles JL, Giampieri F, Bullón P",7,1654,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37227368,Evaluating Metformin Strategies for Cancer Prevention: A Target Trial Emulation Using Electronic Health Records.,"Metformin users appear to have a substantially lower risk of cancer than nonusers in many observational studies. These inverse associations may be explained by common flaws in observational analyses that can be avoided by explicitly emulating a target trial. We emulated target trials of metformin therapy and cancer risk using population-based linked electronic health records from the UK (2009-2016). We included individuals with diabetes, no history of cancer, no recent prescription for metformin or other glucose-lowering medication, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <64 mmol/mol (<8.0%). Outcomes included total cancer and 4 site-specific cancers (breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate). We estimated risks using pooled logistic regression with adjustment for risk factors via inverse-probability weighting. We emulated a second target trial among individuals regardless of diabetes status. We compared our estimates with those obtained using previously applied analytic approaches. Among individuals with diabetes, the estimated 6-year risk differences (metformin - no metformin) were -0.2% (95% CI = -1.6%, 1.3%) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.0% (95% CI = -2.1%, 2.3%) in the per-protocol analysis. The corresponding estimates for all site-specific cancers were close to zero. Among individuals regardless of diabetes status, these estimates were also close to zero and more precise. By contrast, previous analytic approaches yielded estimates that appeared strongly protective. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that metformin therapy does not meaningfully influence cancer incidence. The findings highlight the importance of explicitly emulating a target trial to reduce bias in the effect estimates derived from observational analyses.","Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",2023-Sep,"Dickerman BA, García-Albéniz X, Logan RW, Denaxas S, Hernán MA",5,1766,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Adult patients with DM hospitalized in our tertiary care centre from January 2017 to December 2018 were included in the study. K-means cluster analysis was done in clusters based on glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, body mass index, glycosylated haemoglobin, homeostasis model-assessed beta cell function, insulin resistance index, and age at diagnosis of DM. Chi-square test was used to analyse inter-subgroup differences in DM-related complications and family history of DM. p < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 1152 inpatients with DM were included in the study. Five subgroups were obtained by cluster analysis with highest proportion of population in mild obesity-related DM subgroup (34.55%), followed by mild age-related DM (21.55%), severe insulin deficiency DM (20.51%), severe insulin resistance DM (19.02%), and severe autoimmune DM subgroup (4.36%). The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic peripheral vascular disease, diabetic ketosis, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and family history of DM differed significantly among the subgroups (p < 0.05 for all). This cluster-based classification could be applied to hospitalized adult patients with DM in China. It might help in strategizing for DM patients, and hence, improve management of DM in these patients.",Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews,2021-Oct,"Wang W, Pei X, Zhang L, Chen Z, Lin D, Duan X, Fan J, Pan Q, Guo L",9,1447,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35384822,New-Onset Diabetes as a Complication After Kidney Transplant: Incidence and Outcomes.,"Diabetes after kidney transplant is a common complication. It may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality after kidney transplant. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of diabetes that developed after transplant on outcomes in kidney transplant recipients. This study included renal allograft recipients without diabetes who received transplants from 2008 to 2019 in our Department of Nephrology at Sahloul Hospital (Tunisia). Demographic and clinical data at transplant time and clinical events during the study period were collected. Patient and graft survival rates were analyzed. Patients with and without diabetes after transplant were compared. In the 257 patients (median age of 36 years) included in our study, the overall incidence of diabetes after transplant was 21.8%. Laboratory data (serum cholesterol, serum creatinine at discharge, and 24-hour proteinuria) were similar in those with and without diabetes after transplant. We observed no significant differences in cardiovascular diseases and infectious complication rates between patients with and without diabetes after transplant. There was also no significant difference in graft loss at 5 years between those with and without diabetes after transplant (P = .582). The 5-year patient survival rate in kidney transplant recipients with diabetes after transplant was 87.5%. There was no significant difference in death rate between those with and without diabetes after transplant (P = .566). Diabetes after transplant affected graft and patient survival and increased the incidence of posttransplant cardiovascular disease. The incidence and impact of diabetes after transplant can be minimized through pre- and posttransplant screening to identify patients at higher risk.",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,2022-Mar,"Ouni A, Sahtout W, Hadj Brahim M, Azzabi A, Aicha NB, Mrabet S, Fradi A, Zallema D, Guedri Y, Achour A",10,1772,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

A total of 60 type-2 diabetic patients, assigned to either a diabetes mellitus (DM) with microalbuminuria group (DM/MA+, n=30) or a DM without microalbuminuria group (DM/MA-, n=30), and 30 age-matched control subjects were enrolled in this study. All cases underwent evaluation of blood glucose level, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, lipid fractions, body mass index (BMI), and corneal sensitivity (CS). Corneal nerve fiber length (NFL), nerve fiber density (NFD), nerve branch density (NBD), and tortuosity coefficient (TC) were quantified by IVCCM. None of the patients had peripheral neuropathy or retinopathy. Compared with the healthy subjects, NFL and NFD were reduced in both diabetic groups (P<0.0001), while NBD was significantly reduced in the DM/MA+ group. Between the diabetic groups, NFL, NFD, and NBD were significantly higher in the DM/MA- group (all P's<0.001). CS was significantly lower in DM/MA+ compared with DM/MA- and controls (both P's<0.0001). NFD and NFL were inversely correlated with age, triglyceride level, and BMI. These results indicate that significant damage to small nerves, quantified using IVCCM, can be detected in the absence of retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy or microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients. The severity of corneal nerve involvement may further increase in the presence of nephropathy. This feature may also be valuable for early detection of microvascular complications of DM, allowing for the prevention of progression of life threatening microvascular complications.",Journal francais d'ophtalmologie,2021-Apr,"Celiker H, Erekul G, Turhan SA, Kokar S, Yavuz DG, Gunduz OH, Tavakoli M, Toker E",8,1742,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33539595,Diabetes and atrial fibrillation in hospitalized patients in the United States.,"Data on the burden of atrial fibrillation (AF) associated with diabetes among hospitalized patients are scarce. We assessed the AF-related hospitalizations trends in patients with diabetes, and compared AF outcomes in patients with diabetes to those without diabetes. AF-related health outcomes differ between patient with diabetes and without diabetes. Using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2004-2014, we studied trends in AF hospitalization rate among diabetic patients, and compared in-hospital case fatality rate, length of stay (LOS), cost and utilization of rhythm control therapies, and 30-day readmission rate between patients with and without diabetes. Logistic or Cox regression models were used to assess the differences in AF outcomes by diabetes status. Over the study period, there were 4 325 522 AF-related hospitalizations, of which 1 075 770 (24.9%) had a diagnosis of diabetes. There was a temporal increase in AF hospitalization rate among diabetic patients (10.4 to 14.4 per 1000 hospitalizations among patients with diabetes; +4.4% yearly change, p-trend < .0001). Among AF patients, those with diabetes had a lower in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.65-0.72) and LOS (aOR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.94-0.96), but no difference in costs (aOR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.94-0.96) and a higher 30-day rate of readmissions compared with no diabetes (aHR 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01-1.08), compared to individuals without diabetes. AF and diabetes coexist among hospitalized patients, with rising trends over the last decade.

34872802,Animal models of diabetic microvascular complications: Relevance to clinical features.,"Diabetes has become more common in recent years worldwide, and this growth is projected to continue in the future. The primary concern with diabetes is developing various complications, which significantly contribute to the disease's mortality and morbidity. Over time, the condition progresses from the pre-diabetic to the diabetic stage and then to the development of complications. Years and enormous resources are required to evaluate pharmacological interventions to prevent or delay the progression of disease or complications in humans. Appropriate screening models are required to gain a better understanding of both pathogenesis and potential therapeutic agents. Different species of animals are used to evaluate the pharmacological potentials and study the pathogenesis of the disease. Animal models are essential for research because they represent most of the structural, functional, and biochemical characteristics of human diseases. An ideal screening model should mimic the pathogenesis of the disease with identifiable characteristics. A thorough understanding of animal models is required for the experimental design to select an appropriate model. Each animal model has certain advantages and limitations.

The availability of these ""real-world,"" ""big data"" has fuelled also an intense methodological research into methods to handle them and extract actionable information. In medicine, the evidence generated from ""real-world data"" (RWD), which are not purposely collected to answer biomedical questions, is commonly termed ""real-world evidence"" (RWE). In this review, we focus on RWD and RWE in the area of diabetes research, highlighting their contributions in the last decade; and give some suggestions for future RWE diabetes research, by applying well-established and less-known tools to direct RWE diabetes research towards better personalized approaches to diabetes care. We underline the essential aspects to consider when using RWD and the key features limiting the translational potential of RWD in generating high-quality and applicable RWE. Only if viewed in the context of other study designs and statistical methods, with its pros and cons carefully considered, RWE will exploit its full potential as a complementary or even, in some cases, substitutive source of evidence compared to the expensive evidence obtained from randomized controlled trials.","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2020-Apr,"Zaccardi F, Davies MJ, Khunti K",3,1354,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36457298,Central pancreatectomy prevents postoperative diabetes.,"Central pancreatectomy (CP) can be performed as an alternative surgical approach to distal pancreatectomy (DP) in the treatment of benign or low-grade malignant lesions located in the neck and body of the pancreas, aiming to reduce loss of parenchyma and therefore organ failure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the short- and long-term outcome of CP in comparison to DP. Patients who received CP in a large tertiary care pancreatic surgery center between 2001 and 2020 were identified from a prospectively maintained database and compared via propensity score matching with patients receiving DP during the same time period. Perioperative rate of complications and long-term outcome of pancreatic endocrine and exocrine function were evaluated. One hundred and seven patients undergoing open CP were compared to 107 patients with open DP. No significant difference in rates or severity of most surgical complications could be found including postoperative pancreatic fistula, intraabdominal fluid collection, delayed gastric emptying and wound infection. However, patients receiving CP had a significantly higher risk of grade C postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH) (CP: 10 patients, 9.3% versus DP: 1 patient, 0.9%; p = .0019). Perioperative mortality was comparable. Long-term follow-up of 60 matched pairs revealed significantly less patients with new-onset diabetes after CP (eight patients, 13.3%) compared to DP (22 patients, 36.7%, p = .0056). CP offers an improved endocrine long-term outcome at the expense of a higher risk of PPH without increased perioperative mortality.

This study aimed to investigate balancing ability using a multi-directional reach test (MDRT) in older adults with and without diabetes mellitus. 72 older adults with and without diabetes mellitus were recruited, and divided into two groups, including older adults without diabetes mellitus (n = 36) and older adults with diabetes mellitus (n = 36). All subjects completed all directions of the MDRT. There were no significant differences in MDRT scores in all directions between the two groups (p>0.05). Both groups achieved the highest MDRT scores in the forward direction. In contrast, the two groups had the lowest scores of MDRT in a backward direction. Furthermore, older adults with diabetes mellitus had lower MDRT scores in all directions than older adults without diabetes mellitus.

35877064,The Therapeutic Potential of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exist in many tissues and can differentiate into cells of multiple lineages, such as adipocytes, osteoblasts, or chondrocytes. MSC administration has demonstrated therapeutic potential in various degenerative and inflammatory diseases (<i>e.g.</i>, graft-vs.-host disease, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, organ fibrosis, and diabetes mellitus [DM]). The mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effects of MSCs are multifaceted. Generally, implanted MSCs can migrate to sites of injury, where they establish an anti-inflammatory and regenerative microenvironment in damaged tissues. In addition, MSCs can modulate innate and adaptive immune responses through immunosuppressive mechanisms that involve immune cells, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and immunomodulatory factors. DM has a high prevalence worldwide; it also contributes to a high rate of mortality worldwide. MSCs offer a promising therapeutic agent to prevent or repair damage from DM and diabetic complications through properties such as multilineage differentiation, homing, promotion of angiogenesis, and immunomodulation (<i>e.g.</i>, prevention of oxidative stress, fibrosis, and cell death). In this study, we review current findings regarding the immunomodulatory and regenerative mechanisms of MSCs, as well as their therapeutic applications in DM and DM-related complications.",Cellular reprogramming,2022-Dec,"Zhu L, Wang S, Qu J, Hui Z, Kan C, Hou N, Sun X",7,1386,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

31638279,Twenty-five years of diabetes distress research.,"The term 'diabetes distress' first entered the psychosocial research vernacular in 1995, and refers to 'the negative emotional or affective experience resulting from the challenge of living with the demands of diabetes'. At first the proponents of the concept were hesitant in advocating that diabetes distress was a major barrier to individuals' self-care and management of diabetes. Since then, a burgeoning body of evidence, now including several systematic reviews of intervention studies, suggests that diabetes distress, in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, across ages and in all countries and cultures where it has been studied, is common and can be a barrier to optimal emotional well-being, self-care and management of diabetes. As a consequence, monitoring diabetes distress as part of routine clinical care is part of many national guidelines.

The aim of the present study is to verify the COVID-19 pandemic effects on diabetes control and management. The study was designed as a retrospective observational study, performed on two cohorts of patients with diabetes in 2019 and 2020. Data used for the analyses were gathered from administrative and laboratory databases, which do not include any sensible information on COVID-19. The Tuscany Regional Health Agency is data controller for current administrative databases and has been working to produce available information for policy decision-making. In 2020, in comparison with 2019, a relevant reduction of the number of patients measuring HbA1c was observed during the March-April lockdown, and again during the second pandemic wave in Autumn. A similar pattern was observed for specialist visits for diabetes, for which the introduction of televisits only partly compensated for the reduction of traditional office visits. The number of patients receiving drugs for diabetes each week in 2020 was very similar to 2019. The mean HbA1c values and the proportion of HbA1c values > 8% for each week, were higher during the 2020 Spring and Autumn lockdown. COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacts diabetes management, reducing specialist visits and HbA1c determinations during the first and second pandemic wave. Despite a satisfactory continuity in pharmacological treatment, short-term impairment of average glycemic control was detected, particularly in Autumn.","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2022-Nov,"Bellini B, Nreu B, Francesconi P, Mannucci E",4,1582,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The newer antidiabetes drugs, approved after 2008, were therefore evaluated in long-term cardiovascular outcome trials, designed and powered for the assessment of cardiovascular safety. Accordingly, the primary endpoint of these trials was a cardiac composite endpoint. Since 2008, the data from various cardiovascular outcome trials have been reported, including SAVOR-TIMI 53 (saxagliptin), EXAMINE (alogliptin), TECOS (sitagliptin), CARMELINA (linagliptin), CAROLINA (linagliptin), ELIXA (lixisenatide), LEADER (liraglutide), EXSCEL (exenatide once-weekly), SUSTAIN-6 (injectable semaglutide), HARMONY Outcomes (albiglutide), REWIND (dulaglutide), PIONEER-6 (oral semaglutide), EMPA-REG OUTCOME (empagliflozin), the CANVAS Program (canagliflozin) and DECLARE-TIMI 53 (dapagliflozin). Some of these trials subsequently also published data on renal outcomes, although these were secondary or exploratory analyses. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists had beneficial effects on albuminuria, while sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors additionally showed a positive effect on 'hard' renal outcomes. In contrast to the cardiovascular outcome trials, the renal outcome trial of canagliflozin, CREDENCE, assessed a hard renal endpoint as its primary endpoint and showed positive effects on these hard renal outcomes. In this review, we aim to highlight the renal outcome data from the cardiovascular outcome trials and the CREDENCE trial and understand the differences between their results.

38739122,Metabolomics Signature in Prediabetes and Diabetes: Insights From Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analysis.,"This study investigates the metabolic differences between normal, prediabetic and diabetic patients with good and poor glycaemic control (GGC and PGC). In this study, 1102 individuals were included, and 50 metabolites were analysed using tandem mass spectrometry. The diabetes diagnosis and treatment standards of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) were used to classify patients. The nearest neighbour method was used to match controls and cases in each group on the basis of age, sex and BMI. Factor analysis was used to reduce the number of variables and find influential underlying factors. Finally, Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to check the correlation between both glucose and HbAc1 as independent factors with binary classes. Amino acids such as glycine, serine and proline, and acylcarnitines (AcylCs) such as C16 and C18 showed significant differences between the prediabetes and normal groups. Additionally, several metabolites, including C0, C5, C8 and C16, showed significant differences between the diabetes and normal groups. Moreover, the study found that several metabolites significantly differed between the GGC and PGC diabetes groups, such as C2, C6, C10, C16 and C18. The correlation analysis revealed that glucose and HbA1c levels significantly correlated with several metabolites, including glycine, serine and C16, in both the prediabetes and diabetes groups. Additionally, the correlation analysis showed that HbA1c significantly correlated with several metabolites, such as C2, C5 and C18, in the controlled and uncontrolled diabetes groups. These findings could help identify new biomarkers or underlying markers for the early detection and management of diabetes.","Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism",2024-May,"Jabbar Al-Rikabi SA, Etemadi A, Morad MM, Nowrouzi A, Panahi GS, Mondeali M, Toorani-Ghazvini M, Nasli-Esfahani E, Razi F, Bandarian F",10,1710,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

From our electronic medical records, we retrieved clinical and biochemical details of 4555 individuals with childhood and adolescent onset diabetes (diagnosed below the age of 20 years) seen between 1992 and 2017. T1DM was diagnosed if there was history of ketoacidosis or fasting C-peptide <0.3 PMol/mL and stimulated C-peptide <0.6 PMol/mL or if insulin treatment was required from the time of diagnosis. T2DM was diagnosed based on absence of ketosis, or fasting C-peptide ≥0.6 PMol/mL and stimulated >1.0 PMoL/mL, or response to oral hypoglycemic agents for more than 2 years. We calculated the incidence rates of retinopathy (presence of at least one definite microaneurysm by retinal photography), nephropathy (urinary albumin excretion ≥30 μg/mg of creatinine) and neuropathy (vibration perception threshold ≥20 V) per 1000 person-years of follow up. Among the 4555 individuals with childhood and adolescent-onset diabetes, 71.4% had T1DM, 19.5% T2DM and 9.1% other forms of diabetes.

This study aimed to assess the incidence of PTDM in heart and lung transplant (HLT) patients and to review if the management of these patients is in accordance with the 2014 American Society of Transplantation guidelines. This was a retrospective study in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Data was collected from the patients who had undergone HLT. All patients who had a heart and/or lung transplant between 2005 and 2017 were identified. The majority of our patients had lung 111 (53.9%), heart 94 (45.6%) and combined heart/lung 1(0.5%) transplants. A total of 174 (84.5%) patients were screened for diabetes pre-transplantation. Two hundred five (99.9%) patients were screened for PTDM post-surgery. The cumulative incidence for PTDM was 19.4% (40/206). All patients with PTDM were on prednisolone, 32 (80%) on tacrolimus and 4 (10%) on cyclosporine. The cumulative incidence of post-transplant diabetes in our cohort was 19.4%.

37473453,Guidelines and Recommendations for Laboratory Analysis in the Diagnosis and Management of Diabetes Mellitus.,"Numerous laboratory tests are used in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus. The quality of the scientific evidence supporting the use of these assays varies substantially. An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for laboratory analysis in screening, diagnosis, or monitoring of diabetes. The overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations were evaluated. The draft consensus recommendations were evaluated by invited reviewers and presented for public comment. Suggestions were incorporated as deemed appropriate by the authors (see Acknowledgments). The guidelines were reviewed by the Evidence Based Laboratory Medicine Committee and the Board of Directors of the American Association of Clinical Chemistry and by the Professional Practice Committee of the American Diabetes Association. Diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous plasma or increased hemoglobin A1c (Hb A1c) in the blood. Glycemic control is monitored by the people with diabetes measuring their own blood glucose with meters and/or with continuous interstitial glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and also by laboratory analysis of Hb A1c. The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring, genetic testing, and measurement of ketones, autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide are addressed.

32774444,Research of Epidemic Big Data Based on Improved Deep Convolutional Neural Network.,"In recent years, with the acceleration of the aging process and the aggravation of life pressure, the proportion of chronic epidemics has gradually increased. A large amount of medical data will be generated during the hospitalization of diabetics. It will have important practical significance and social value to discover potential medical laws and valuable information among medical data. In view of this, an improved deep convolutional neural network (""CNN+"" for short) algorithm was proposed to predict the changes of diabetes. Firstly, the bagging integrated classification algorithm was used instead of the output layer function of the deep CNN, which can help the improved deep CNN algorithm constructed for the data set of diabetic patients and improve the accuracy of classification. In this way, the ""CNN+"" algorithm can take the advantages of both the deep CNN and the bagging algorithm. On the one hand, it can extract the potential features of the data set by using the powerful feature extraction ability of deep CNN. On the other hand, the bagging integrated classification algorithm can be used for feature classification, so as to improve the classification accuracy and obtain better disease prediction effect to assist doctors in diagnosis and treatment. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional convolutional neural network and other classification algorithm, the ""CNN+"" model can get more reliable prediction results.",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2020-,Wang W,1,1459,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The evidence supports theory-based intervention in promoting self-care behaviors. However, no systematic review was done to monitor these interventions and compare more effective constructs. This study was conducted to investigate the studies using self-care theories and introducing the most effective theories. This is a systematic review study during which some scientific databases including Scopus, Elsevier, Google scholar and PubMed were searched by using some key words like self-care or self-management, diabetes, theory or model. English articles from the start of 2013 up to the end of November 2020 were monitored. 20 articles were selected and studied based on eight theories which they used. These theories were: Social support theory, Health Belief Model, Heath Belief Model and Empowerment Theory, Empowerment Theory, Self-efficacy Theory, precede-proceed model, Self-regulation Theory, behavioral theory and Social Cognitive Theory. Four theories appeared to be more effective for the target behavior of present research: Social Support Theory and the combination of Empowerment Theory and Health Belief Model, Social Cognitive Theory and Self Efficacy Theory. Taken together, the findings of this systematic review suggest that interventions that go beyond individual determinants (such as changing knowledge and attitudes) to determinants of upper cognitive, motor, and social levels (such as the development of skills and competencies) they have led to raised self-care outcomes.",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2020-,"Zare S, Ostovarfar J, Kaveh MH, Vali M",4,1610,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38808694,An analysis of urodynamic parameters in diabetic and nondiabetic women.,"Diabetes is highly prevalent worldwide, with an estimated 536 million living with diabetes in 2021, and that number projected to increase to 783 million by 2045. Diabetic bladder dysfunction is thought to affect up to 60%-90% of individuals with diabetes and can significantly impact quality of life. Despite the prevalence of diabetic bladder dysfunction, the exact pathophysiological mechanism, and resulting clinical presentation, remains debated. Our objective was to compare urodynamic parameters between diabetic and nondiabetic women, assessing the impact of various markers of diabetes severity on bladder function. A retrospective chart review was conducted on female patients aged 18 and above who underwent urodynamic studies at a single tertiary care university hospital system from 2014 to 2020. Patients were categorized based on diabetes status, and diabetes severity including duration of disease, hemoglobin A1c levels, insulin dependence, and markers of end-organ dysfunction. Urodynamic variables, including compliance, bladder voided efficiency, bladder contractility index, postvoid residual, maximum flow rate, capacity, voided volume, and detrusor overactivity, were assessed by two independent reviewers. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the impact of diabetes and diabetic severity on urodynamic parameters. A total of 652 female patients were included in the study, of which, 152 (23.3%) had diabetes, with an average duration of diagnosis of 82.3 months. Diabetic women were older and had higher body mass index compared to nondiabetic women. Diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy were present in 18% and 54.6% of diabetic patients, respectively. Significant differences in urodynamic parameters were observed between diabetic and nondiabetic women, with diabetic women showing higher rates of detrusor overactivity (p = 0.01), particularly associated with increasing BMI (p = 0.03). However, classic markers of diabetes severity including duration, as well as markers of end-organ damage, showed mixed associations with urodynamic changes. Despite the prevalence of diabetic bladder dysfunction and its impact on patient quality of life, the exact mechanisms and clinical presentation remain elusive. Our study highlights the significant differences in urodynamic parameters between diabetic and nondiabetic women, emphasizing the need for further research into the relationship between diabetes and diabetic bladder dysfunction.",Neurourology and urodynamics,2024-Sep,"Burns RT, Arnold PJ, Song L, Moss KL, Powell CR",5,2468,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32970763,Heritability and complex segregation analysis of naturally-occurring diabetes in Australian Terrier Dogs.,"The Australian Terrier breed is the breed at highest risk for naturally-occurring diabetes mellitus in the United States, where it is 32 times more likely to develop diabetes compared to mixed breed dogs. However, the heritability and mode of inheritance of spontaneous diabetes in Australian Terriers has not been reported. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the heritability and mode of inheritance of diabetes in Australian Terriers. A cohort of related Australian Terriers including 383 Australian Terriers without diabetes, 86 Australian Terriers with spontaneous diabetes, and 14 Australian Terriers with an unknown phenotype, was analyzed. A logistic regression model including the effects of sex was formulated to evaluate the heritability of diabetes. The inheritance pattern of spontaneous diabetes in Australian Terriers was investigated by use of complex segregation analysis. Six possible inheritance models were studied, and the Akaike Information Criterion was used to determine the best model for diabetes inheritance in Australian Terriers, among the models deemed biologically feasible. Heritability of diabetes in Australian Terriers was estimated at 0.18 (95% confidence interval 0.0-0.67). There was no significant difference in the effect of males and females on disease outcome. Complex segregation analysis suggested that the mode of diabetes inheritance in Australian Terriers is polygenic, with no evidence for a large effect single gene influencing diabetes. It is concluded that in the population of Australian Terriers bred in the United States, a relatively small degree of genetic variation contributes to spontaneous diabetes. A genetic uniformity for diabetes-susceptible genes within the population of Australian Terriers bred in the Unites States could increase the risk of diabetes in this cohort. These findings hold promise for future genetic studies of canine diabetes focused on this particular breed.",PloS one,2020-,"Mui ML, Famula TR, Henthorn PS, Hess RS",4,1957,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Using the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Registry, we evaluated the validity and accuracy of provider-assigned diabetes type abstracted from medical records against etiologic criteria that included the presence of diabetes autoantibodies (DAA) and insulin sensitivity. Youth who were incident for diabetes in 2002-2006, 2008, or 2012 and had complete data on key analysis variables were included (n = 4001, 85% provider diagnosed type 1). The etiologic definition for type 1 diabetes was ≥1 positive DAA titer(s) or negative DAA titers in the presence of insulin sensitivity and for type 2 diabetes was negative DAA titers in the presence of insulin resistance. Provider diagnosed diabetes type correctly agreed with the etiologic definition of type for 89.9% of cases. Provider diagnosed type 1 diabetes was 96.9% sensitive, 82.8% specific, had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 97.0% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 82.7%. Provider diagnosed type 2 diabetes was 82.8% sensitive, 96.9% specific, had a PPV and NPV of 82.7% and 97.0%, respectively. Provider diagnosis of diabetes type agreed with etiologic criteria for 90% of the cases.

Diabetes is an epidemic in the United States, and the disease is associated with altered gut motility. As a result, we suspected that a significant number of patients referred for GES may have undiagnosed DM or pre-DM. Given that established procedure standards for GES require all patients to prepare with an 8-h fast, an opportunity is provided to measure the fasting blood glucose (FBG) in all individuals before they undergo the examination. <b>Methods:</b> The charts of patients undergoing GES were reviewed for a history of DM and correlated with FBG and GES results.

To develop machine learning (ML) models for risk assessment of MASLD occurrence in patients with DM. Feature selection determined the discriminative parameters, utilized to classify DM patients as those with and without MASLD. The performance of the multiple logistic regression model was quantified by sensitivity, specificity, and percentage of correctly classified patients, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Decision curve analysis (DCA) assessed the model's net benefit for alternative treatments. We studied 2000 patients with DM (mean age 58.85 ± 17.37 years; 48% women). Eight parameters: age, body mass index, type of DM, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, platelet count, hyperuricaemia, and treatment with metformin were identified as discriminative. The experiments for 1735 patients show that 744/991 (75.08%) and 586/744 (78.76%) patients with/without MASLD were correctly identified (sensitivity/specificity: 0.75/0.79). The area under ROC (AUC) was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.82-0.86), while DCA showed a higher clinical utility of the model, ranging from 30% to 84% threshold probability.

The main objective was to examine prescription patterns of glucose-lowering therapy among adults with PPDM compared with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In a Danish nationwide population-based cohort study, we identified all individuals with adult-onset diabetes in the period 2000-2018 and categorized them as having type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or PPDM. We ascertained diabetes incidence rates, clinical and demographic characteristics, and classifications and prescription patterns of glucose-lowering therapy and compared these parameters across diabetes subgroups. Among 398,456 adults with new-onset diabetes, 5,879 (1.5%) had PPDM, 9,252 (2.3%) type 1 diabetes, and the remaining type 2 diabetes (96.2%). The incidence rate of PPDM was 7.9 (95% CI 7.7-8.1) per 100,000 person-years versus 12.5 (95% CI 12.2-12.7) for type 1 diabetes (incidence rate ratio 0.6 [95% CI 0.6-0.7]; <i>P</i> < 0.001). A sizeable proportion of patients with PPDM were classified as having type 2 diabetes (44.9%) and prescribed sulfonylureas (25.2%) and incretin-based therapies (18.0%) that can potentially be harmful in PPDM.

37345245,Ketosis-prone Diabetes and Hypogonadism: A New Clinical Association to be Aware of ?,"Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) is an emerging entity, sharing features of both type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with KPD usually present with diabetic ketoacidosis without the classic phenotype of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. In most cases, they are Afro-American adults, who require insulin therapy for the management of acute decompensation, then usually encountering insulin-free remission for prolonged periods of time with diet or with non-insulin agents. Meanwhile, hypogonadism is a known condition that could be associated with higher risk of developing both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and could be a risk factor for decompensated diabetes. The association of KPD and hypogonadism is reported for the first time in literature. Here we report two peculiar cases of young African patients, affected by KPD and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, respectively Klinefelter's syndrome and primary ovarian failure. Both patients were treated promptly for the ketoacidosis with intravenous fluids combined with continuous insulin infusion, and then switched to subcutaneous regimen. After the correct clinical evaluation, oral antidiabetic drugs were added. KPD remains an under-recognized and under-diagnosed type of diabetes. As hypogonadism is strongly linked to dysmetabolic disorders, the evaluation of sex hormones should be performed at the onset of diabetes. Further studies should investigate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and its role in the development of KDP and its manifestations and complications.","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2023-,"Graziani A, Pollis RM, Bonora BM, Scaroni C, Sabbadin C",5,1547,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35958851,Cost-effectiveness of community diabetes screening: Application of Akaike information criterion in rural communities of Nigeria.,"The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing globally, and this requires several approaches to screening. There are reports of alternative indices for prediction of DM, besides fasting blood glucose (FBG) level. This study, investigated the ability of combination of biochemical and anthropometric parameters and orodental disease indicators (ODIs) to generate models for DM prediction, using Akaike information criterion (AIC) to substantiate health economics of diabetes screening. Four hundred and thirty-three subjects were enrolled in the study in Ndokwa communities, Delta State, Nigeria, and their glycaemic status was determined, using the CardioChek analyser<sup>®</sup> and previous data from the Prediabetes and Cardiovascular Complications Study were also used. The cost of screening for diabetes (NGN 300 = $0.72) in a not-for-profit organization/hospital was used as basis to calculate the health economics of number of individuals with DM in 1,000 participants. Data on the subjects' anthropometric, biochemical and ODI parameters were used to generate different models, using R statistical software (version 4.0.0). The different models were evaluated for their AIC values. Lowest AIC was considered as best model. Microsoft Excel software (version 2020) was used in preliminary analysis. The cost of identifying <2 new subjects with hyperglycemia, in 1,000 people was ≥NGN 300,000 ($ 716). A total of 4,125 models were generated. AIC modeling indicates FBG test as the best model (AIC = 4), and the least being combination of random blood sugar + waist circumference + hip circumference (AIC ≈ 34). Models containing ODI parameters had AIC values >34, hence considered as not recommendable. The cost of general screening for diabetes in rural communities may appear high and burdensome in terms of health economics.

Timely diagnosis of PPDM-A improves patient outcomes and the mitigation of burdens and costs. We aimed to determine risk factors prospectively and predictors of PPDM-A in China, focusing on giving personalized treatment recommendations. Here, we identify and evaluate the best set of predictors of PPDM-A prospectively using retrospective data from 820 patients with acute pancreatitis at four centers by machine learning approaches. We used the L1 regularized logistic regression model to diagnose early PPDM-A via nine clinical variables identified as the best predictors. The model performed well, obtaining the best AUC = 0.819 and F1 = 0.357 in the test set. We interpreted and personalized the model through nomograms and Shapley values. Our model can accurately predict the occurrence of PPDM-A based on just nine clinical pieces of information and allows for early intervention in potential PPDM-A patients through personalized analysis. Future retrospective and prospective studies with multicentre, large sample populations are needed to assess the actual clinical value of the model.",Scientific reports,2023-Mar,"Zhang J, Lv Y, Hou J, Zhang C, Yua X, Wang Y, Yang T, Su X, Ye Z, Li L",10,1209,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Embase and Medline databases were searched for studies reporting the incidence rate (IR) of diabetes-related amputations from 2010 to 2020. IR estimates of diabetes-related amputations with associated 95% confidence interval (CI) per 100,000 individuals with diabetes were calculated. 23 studies were included, reporting 505,390 diabetes-related lower extremity amputations. IR of minor amputations was 139.97 (95% CI 88.18-222.16) per 100,000 individuals with diabetes, among patients with type 1 diabetes was 148.59 (95% CI 65.00-339.68) and in type 2 diabetes was 75.53 (95% CI 29.94-190.54). IR of major amputations was 94.82 (95% CI 56.62-158.80) per 100,000 individuals with diabetes, among patients with type 1 diabetes was 100.76 (95% CI 53.71-189.01) and among type 2 diabetes was 40.58 (95% CI 11.03-149.28). There were 83.84 annual amputations (95% CI 41.67-168.65) per 100,000 women with diabetes and 178.04 (95% CI 81.16-390.55) per 100,000 men.

Objective of this paper was the evaluation of changes in the representation of expertise providing care for patients with DM (pDM) in the Czech Republic, based on data analysis from the National Register of Paid Health Services (NRHZS) 2010-2021. In the entire pDM group, the number of patients treated by a diabetologist (DIA) increased from 491,490 (57.0 %) to 537,430 (50.4 %), with a general practitioner (GP) from 27,719 (3.2 %) to 181,330 (17.0 %) and by internist (INT) from 172,918 (20.0 %) to 161,291 (15.1 %). In 2021, 57.9 % DIA, 17 % GP, 12.2 % INT were treated from the group treated with antidiabetics (813,873). In 2021, 84,345 were treated with insulin alone (87.2 % DIA), 129,127 were treated with a combination of insulin and non-insulin antidiabetics; 115,604 (91.6 %) in DIA, 322 (0.3 %) in GP and 7,983 (6.3 %) in INT. 603,331 treated only with non-insulin antidiabetic drugs, of which 281,929 (46.7 %) DIA, 137,744 (22.8 %) GP and 85,273 (14.1 %) INT.

33221965,One hundred years ago: the dawning of the insulin era.,"The dawn of the insulin era can be placed in 1921, when Banting and Best started their experiments which led, a year later, to the successful treatment of diabetes. They were preceded by the discoveries of the pancreatic cause of diabetes by Minkowski and von Mering in 1889 and of the islets by Paul Langerhans in 1869. The achievement of the first targeted treatment in medical history was a landmark of medical progress. However, it was accompanied by a mixture of human greatness and misery. Genius and recklessness, ambition and deception, camaraderie and rivalry, selflessness and pursuit of glory went along with superficial search of the existing literature, poor planning, faulty interpretation of results, failure to reproduce them, and misquoting of reports from other laboratories.

The potential factors influencing medication adherence and how they contribute to health behaviors have not been synthesized to date. This review synthesized qualitative studies that identified factors influencing medication adherence among adults living with diabetes and comorbidity. Twenty-eight findings were extracted and synthesized into four themes: perceived support, lack of knowledge, medication issues, and the importance of routine. The findings highlight the factors that support medication adherence and areas that can be targeted to support and promote medication adherence. The findings also support the potential role of healthcare providers in supporting people living with diabetes and comorbidity to adhere to and maintain medication regimes. Several factors were identified that are amenable to intervention within the clinical practice setting and have the potential to enhance medication adherence and improve health outcomes for people living with diabetes and comorbidities.

The study sample comprised 4240 participants from the Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) Study (mean±SD age = 66 ± 8). Arterial stiffness was assessed from 5 April 2011-6 November 2012 by way of aortic PWV (aPWV) and estimated carotid-femoral PWV (ecfPWV). Incident diabetes/prediabetes was determined by linkage to dispensed prescription and national hospital discharge registers. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the risk of diabetes/prediabetes in relation to chosen arterial stiffness measures both overall and over quartiles. During a mean±SD follow-up of 10.5 ± 0.4 years, 470 participants developed diabetes/prediabetes. Following adjustment for potential confounders, aPWV (hazard ratio (HR) per SD increase, 1.40, 95 % CI, 1.19-1.64) was associated with the incidence of diabetes. The risk of incident diabetes was, compared to the first quartile, higher in the fourth quartile of aPWV (HR, 1.98, 95 %CI, 1.26-3.11)(P<sub>trend</sub>=0.01).

33147904,Acute pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus: a review.,"Diabetes following acute pancreatitis (AP) is becoming increasingly recognized. It is unclear what subtype of diabetes mellitus (DM) occurs; however, type 3c diabetes mellitus (T3cDM) is gaining increasing recognition. T3cDM has differing pathophysiology than other subtypes of DM and therefore differing disease course and treatment. Current studies have examined the incidence and prevalence of DM following AP, and meta-analyses have shown around 15% develop DM at 1 year with an increasing proportion developing DM at 5 years. It has been observed that some patients have transient hyperglycemia following AP episode with a subset developing persistent impaired glucose metabolism; however, the exact timeline is not well defined. The data on risk factors for developing DM after AP is limited and mixed; however, it is likely that severity of AP may impact the propensity to develop DM. Screening guidelines have not been established following AP; however, screening 1-year post-event will likely capture a sizable proportion of newly developed DM. The endocrine and exocrine pancreas are closely linked, and studies have found significant overlap in dysfunction of both after AP. Finally, there are some data to suggest that diabetes predisposes patients to structural changes in the pancreas and increased risk of developing AP.",The Korean journal of internal medicine,2021-Jan,"Richardson A, Park WG",2,1335,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

32268561,Prevalence of Diabetic Retinopathy in Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients in North-East Poland.,"<i>Background and Objectives:</i> The global epidemic of diabetes, especially type 2 (DM2), is related to lifestyle changes, obesity, and the process of population aging. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most serious complication of the eye caused by diabetes. The aim of this research was to assess the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in north-east Poland. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: The eye fundus was assessed on the basis of two-field 50 degrees color fundus photographs that showed the optic nerve and macula in the center after the pupil was dilated with 1% tropicamide. <i>Results</i>: The experimental group included 315 (26%) patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) and 894 (74%) patients with DM2. DM1 patients were diagnosed with DR in 32.58% of cases, with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) in 24.44% of cases, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in 1.59% of cases, diabetic macular edema (DME) in 5.40% of cases, and PDR with DME in 0.95% of cases. DR was found in DM2 patients in 23.04% of cases, NPDR in 17.11% of cases, PDR in 1.01% of cases, DME in 4.81% of cases, and PDR with DME in 0.11% of cases. <i>Conclusions</i>: The presented study is the first Polish study on the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy presenting a large group of patients, and its results could be extrapolated to the whole country. Diabetic retinopathy was found in 25.48% of patients in the whole experimental group. The above results place Poland within the European average, indicating the quality of diabetic care offered in Poland, based on the number of observed complications.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2020-Apr,"Matuszewski W, Baranowska-Jurkun A, Stefanowicz-Rutkowska MM, Modzelewski R, Pieczyński J, Bandurska-Stankiewicz E",6,1651,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38980465,Clinical Outcomes of Rural Patients with Diabetes Treated by ECHO-Trained Providers Versus an Academic Medical Center.,"Despite clinical practice guidelines prioritizing cardiorenal risk reduction, national trends in diabetes outcomes, particularly in rural communities, do not mirror the benefits seen in clinical trials with emerging therapeutics and technologies. Project ECHO supports implementation of guidelines in under-resourced areas through virtual communities of practice, sharing of best practices, and case-based learning. We hypothesized that diabetes outcomes of patients treated by ECHO-trained primary care providers (PCPs) would be similar to those of patients treated by specialists at an academic medical center. Specialists from the University of New Mexico (UNM) launched a weekly diabetes ECHO program to mentor dyads consisting of a PCP and community health worker at ten rural clinics. We compared cardiorenal risk factor changes in patients with diabetes treated by ECHO-trained dyads to patients treated by specialists at the UNM Diabetes Comprehensive Care Center (DCCC). Eligible participants included adults with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes on insulin, or diabetes of either type with A1c > 9%. The primary outcome was change from baseline in A1c in the ECHO and DCCC cohorts. Secondary outcomes included changes in body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, cholesterol, and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR). Compared to the DCCC cohort (n = 151), patients in the ECHO cohort (n = 856) experienced greater A1c reduction (-1.2% vs -0.6%; p = 0.02 for difference in difference). BMI decreased in the Endo ECHO cohort and increased in the DCCC cohort (-0.2 vs. +1.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; p = 0.003 for difference in difference). Diastolic blood pressure declined in the Endo ECHO cohort only. Improvements of similar magnitude were observed in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in both groups. UACR remained stable in both groups.

38969978,"Evaluating diabetes care in primary healthcare centers in Abuja, Nigeria: a cross-sectional formative assessment.","Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are associated with high and rising burden of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is among the leading causes of NCD-related deaths worldwide and is a foremost public health problem in Nigeria. As part of National policy, Nigeria has committed to implement the World Health Organization (WHO) Package of Essential Non-communicable Disease interventions for primary care. Implementing the intervention requires the availability of essential elements, including guidelines, trained staff, health management information systems (HMIS), equipment, and medications, in primary healthcare centers (PHCs). This study assessed the availability of the DM component of the WHO package, and the readiness of the health workers in these PHCs to implement a DM screening, evaluation, and management program to inform future adoption and implementation. This cross-sectional formative assessment adapted the WHO Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) tool to survey 30 PHCs selected by multistage sampling for readiness to deliver DM diagnosis and care in Abuja, Nigeria, between August and October 2021. The SARA tool was adapted to focus on DM services and the availability and readiness indicator scores were calculated based on the proportion of PHCs with available DM care services, minimum staff requirement, diagnostic tests, equipment, medications, and national guidelines/protocols for DM care within the defined SARA domain. All 30 PHCs reported the availability of at least two full-time staff (median [interquartile range] = 5 [4-9]), which were mostly community health extension workers (median [interquartile range]) = 3 [1-4]. At least one staff member was recently trained in DM care in 11 PHCs (36%). The study also reported high availability of paper-based HMIS (100%), and DM screening services using a glucometer (87%), but low availability of DM job aids (27%), treatment (23%), and national guidelines/protocols (0%). This formative assessment of PHCs' readiness to implement a DM screening, evaluation, and management program in Abuja demonstrated readiness to integrate DM care into PHCs regarding equipment, paper-based HMIS, and nonphysician health workers' availability. However, strategies are needed to promote DM health workforce training, provide DM management guidelines, and supply essential DM medications.",BMC primary care,2024-Jul,"Orji IA, Baldridge AS, Ikechukwu-Orji MU, Banigbe B, Eze NC, Chopra A, Omitiran K, Iyer G, Odoh D, Alex-Okoh M, Reng R, Hirschhorn LR, Huffman MD, Ojji DB",14,2425,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

It is also associated with impaired beta-cell function in humans, but again the mechanisms are poorly understood. Mechanistic studies of the impact of smoking on carbohydrate metabolism mainly evaluated nicotine as the causal agent, and more rarely other tobacco constituents, making it impossible to conclude that the risk of diabetes is linked to the effects of nicotine alone. Active smoking also has negative impact on glycemic control in both type-1 and type-2 diabetic patients. It increases the risk of all-cause mortality and worsens the chronic complications of diabetes. Impact on microangiopathic complications in type-2 diabetic patients, however, is more controversial. Data on pharmacological and behavioral strategies for smoking cessation used in the general population are more sparse in diabetic patients, despite opportunities with recent therapeutic trials involving varenicline and GLP-1 analogues. It is essential for diabetic patients to stop smoking, and diabetologists must get involved in smoking cessation as they have done for many years in therapeutic education, which can easily include measures to help patients stop smoking.",Annales d'endocrinologie,2024-Dec,"Rouland A, Thuillier P, Al-Salameh A, Benzerouk F, Bahougne T, Tramunt B, Berlin I, Clair C, Thomas D, Le Faou AL, Vergès B, Durlach V",12,1286,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Unadjusted and adjusted linear regression was performed to determine the association between self-reported physical activity per week (min) and wearable device usage (users and nonusers) among people living with diabetes using survey analysis. 84.97 % (95 % CI [80.39, 88.89]) of participants were nonusers of wearable devices, while 15.03 % (95 % CI [11.11, 19.61]) were users. Across the sample, the average weekly physical activity was 427.39 mins (95 % Cl [356.43, 498.35]). Nonusers had a higher physical activity per week with 433.83 mins (95 % CI [353.59, 514.07]), while users only had 392.59 mins (95 % CI [253.48, 531.69]) of physical activity per week. However, the differences between the two groups were non-statistically significant (p=.61). In both adjusted and unadjusted linear regressions between physical activity per week and wearable device usage, statistically significant associations were not found (unadjusted: β=-41.24, p=.62; adjusted: β=-56.41, p=.59).

35409752,Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes in Poland.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive inherited monogenic disease in Caucasians. As medical technology progresses and the quality of patient care improves, the survival time of patients with CF has increased, which results in more frequent comorbidities such as cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). CFRD is the result of abnormal glucose metabolism characterized primarily by insulin deficiency, exacerbated periodically by insulin resistance. The aim of our study was to analyze the epidemiology of patients with CFRD in Poland on the basis of data collected from six CF treatment centers. Analyses were performed on 1157 CF patients who were treated at one of the six CF care centers. CFRD was diagnosed according to standard criteria. All data including demographics, types of CFTR mutations, CFRD duration, and microorganisms in the sputum were obtained from the patients' medical history. Our study indicates that the prevalence of CFRD in Poland is 12.9%. CFRD was most often diagnosed between the ages of 11 and 20 (60% of patients), while 23% of patients were diagnosed between 21 and 30 years of age. Furthermore, we observed that approximately 3-5% of patients under the age of 10 had CFRD. We found out that the type of mutation did not affect the frequency of CFRD development. Factors that increased the risk of developing CFRD include underweight and chronic <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection.

32071329,A cluster-randomized trial of the effectiveness of a triple-faceted intervention promoting adherence to primary care physician visits by diabetes patients.,"We aimed to assess whether a triple-faceted intervention program administered in the primary care setting could decrease the risk of insufficient adherence to primary care physician (PCP) appointments among this patient population. We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled study to assess the effects of a 1-year intervention. The primary outcome was insufficient adherence to regular PCP attendance for diabetes treatment, defined as failure to visit a PCP within 2 months of an original appointment date. The intervention consisted of mailing patient reminders of their PCP appointments, providing patients with health education aimed at lifestyle modification and benchmarking PCP procedures. Eleven municipal level district medical associations employing 192 PCPs were divided into two subregions for assignment to intervention and control clusters, with 971 and 1,265 patients assigned to the intervention and control groups, respectively. Primary outcome data were available for 2,200 patients. The intervention reduced insufficient adherence to regular PCP appointments by 63% (hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.58). In conclusion, a triple-faceted intervention program consisting of health education, appointment reminders, and physician benchmarking may decrease the risk of incomplete adherence to regular PCP appointments by diabetes patients.",Scientific reports,2020-Feb,"Noda M, Hayashino Y, Yamazaki K, Suzuki H, Goto A, Kato M, Izumi K, Kobayashi M",8,1381,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35283068,Moderately hyperglycemia as an independent prognostic factor for the worse outcome of COVID-19.,"Blood sugar (BS) has been proposed as a prognostic factor for COVID-19. In this historical cohort study we evaluated the association between admission time BS and COVID-19 outcome. First, hospitalized COVID-19 patients were divided into three groups; Non-diabetic patients with BS < 140 mg/dl (N = 394), non-diabetic patients with BS ≥ 140 mg/dl (N = 113) and diabetic patients (N = 315). Mortality, ICU admission, and length of hospital stay were compared between groups and odds ratio was adjusted using logistic regression. After adjustment with pre-existing conditions and drugs, it was shown that non-diabetic patients with BS ≥ 140 mg/dl are at increased risk of mortality (aOR 1.89 (0.99-3.57)) and ICU admission (aOR 2.62 (1.49-4.59)) even more than diabetic patients (aOR 1.72 (1.07-2.78) for mortality and aOR 2.28 (1.47-3.54) for ICU admission. Admission time hyperglycemia predicts worse outcome of COVID-19 and BS ≥ 140 mg/dl is associated with a markedly increase in ICU admission and mortality.",Primary care diabetes,2022-Jun,"Nateghi S, Gomari MM, Roudsari YJ, Foroughi A, Mansouri F, Shiva A, Nasrollahizadeh A, Nasiri Z, Faraji N",9,1009,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

However, in vitro studies and animal models do not always translate to the human disease, perhaps illustrated by the failure of many drug candidates in the clinical phase. Non-invasive biomedical imaging techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) offer tools for direct visualization and quantification of molecular processes in humans. Developments in this area potentially enable longitudinal in vivo studies of receptors and processes involved in diabetes guiding drug development and diagnosis in the near future.

34016607,Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults (LADA) Is Likely to Represent a Mixed Population of Autoimmune (Type 1) and Nonautoimmune (Type 2) Diabetes.,"Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is typically defined as a new diabetes diagnosis after 35 years of age, presenting with clinical features of type 2 diabetes, in whom a type 1 diabetes-associated islet autoantibody is detected. Identifying autoimmune diabetes is important since the prognosis and optimal therapy differ. However, the existing LADA definition identifies a group with clinical and genetic features intermediate between typical type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is unclear whether this is due to <i>1</i>) true autoimmune diabetes with a milder phenotype at older onset ages that initially appears similar to type 2 diabetes but later requires insulin, <i>2</i>) a disease syndrome where the pathophysiologies of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are both present in each patient, or <i>3</i>) a heterogeneous group resulting from difficulties in classification. Herein, we suggest that difficulties in classification are a major component resulting from defining LADA using a diagnostic test-islet autoantibody measurement-with imperfect specificity applied in low-prevalence populations. This yields a heterogeneous group of true positives (autoimmune type 1 diabetes) and false positives (nonautoimmune type 2 diabetes). For clinicians, this means that islet autoantibody testing should not be undertaken in patients who do not have clinical features suggestive of autoimmune diabetes: in an adult without clinical features of type 1 diabetes, it is likely that a single positive antibody will represent a false-positive result. This is in contrast to patients with features suggestive of type 1 diabetes, where false-positive results will be rare. For researchers, this means that current definitions of LADA are not appropriate for the study of autoimmune diabetes in later life. Approaches that increase test specificity, or prior likelihood of autoimmune diabetes, are needed to avoid inclusion of participants who have nonautoimmune (type 2) diabetes. Improved classification will allow improved assignment of prognosis and therapy as well as an improved cohort in which to analyze and better understand the detailed pathophysiological components acting at onset and during disease progression in late-onset autoimmune diabetes.",Diabetes care,2021-Jun,"Jones AG, McDonald TJ, Shields BM, Hagopian W, Hattersley AT",5,2251,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33970587,"Diabetes: Screening, Diagnosis, and Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes.","From 2013-2016, 34.5% of US adults had prediabetes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening all adults ages 40 to 70 years with overweight or obesity for abnormal blood glucose, and screening for gestational diabetes in pregnant women after 24 weeks. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screening all patients older than 45 years for prediabetes and diabetes, and screening earlier for patients with risk factors. Screening in younger patients is based on risk factors. The diagnostic criteria for prediabetes and diabetes require two abnormal test results from the same sample or from two separate samples, in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia or symptomatic hyperglycemia. Physical activity and healthy eating patterns continue to be the cornerstones of diabetes prevention. Although no drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for diabetes prevention, strong evidence supports the use of metformin in adults with prediabetes.

It is associated with several long-term consequences and higher hospitalization rates. To examine the profile of hospital admissions related to diabetes mellitus and the prescription rates of antidiabetic medications in England and Wales. This is an ecological study that was conducted for the period between April 1999 and April 2020 using publicly available hospitalisation data in England and Wales. Hospital admission data for patients of all ages was extracted from Hospital Episode Statistics in England and the Patient Episode Database for Wales. The difference between admission rates in 1999 and 2020, as well as the difference between diabetes mellitus medication prescription rates in 2004 and 2020, were assessed using the Pearson Chi-squared test. A Poisson regression model with robust variance estimation was used to examine the trend in hospital admissions. A total of 1,757,892 diabetes mellitus hospital admissions were recorded in England and Wales during the duration of the study. The hospital admission rate for diabetes mellitus increased by 15.2%. This increase was concomitant with an increase in the antidiabetic medication prescribing rate of 105.9% between 2004 and 2020. Males and those in the age group of 15-59 years had a higher rate of hospital admission. The most common causes of admissions were type 1 diabetes mellitus related complications, which accounted for 47.1% of all admissions. This research gives an in-depth overview of the hospitalization profile in England and Wales during the previous two decades. In England and Wales, people with all types of diabetes and related problems have been hospitalized at a high rate over the past 20 years.

32461042,Improving compliance with diabetes care using a novel mnemonic: A quality improvement project in an urban primary care clinic.,"The aim of this quality improvement project was to improve compliance with the delivery of multidimensional patient-centered diabetes care using a streamlined mnemonic based on established diabetes guidelines. Using the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) model for improvement, four rapid plan-do-study-act cycles primarily implemented different tests of change over eight weeks using a streamlined mnemonic - the LLaVES (lifestyle, laboratory tests, vaccination, examination, social/psychosocial) bundle for screening and case management of patients with diabetes. Secondary to the LLaVES bundle, tests of change were also conducted for clinic team members and patients. Team member engagement utilized a best-practice toolkit for effective communication. Patient engagement implemented validated models to evaluate knowledge of diabetes and stage of change. Data were analyzed using run charts to evaluate the impact of interventions on outcomes. Overall compliance was measured as the diabetes management compliance rate (DMCR), composed of LLaVES implementation, team engagement, and patient engagement scores. The diabetes management compliance rate increased by 72.2%, from a baseline of 49% to 84.4% in eight weeks. Team engagement increased from 76.6% to 92% while patient engagement increased from 70.4% to 87.4%. Diabetes management is complex and requires team and patient engagement to implement a structured and multidimensional process.

This Consensus Report presents the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Precision Medicine in Diabetes Initiative in partnership with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), including its mission, the current state of the field and prospects for the future. Expert opinions are presented on areas of precision diagnostics and precision therapeutics (including prevention and treatment) and key barriers to and opportunities for implementation of precision diabetes medicine, with better care and outcomes around the globe, are highlighted. Cases where precision diagnosis is already feasible and effective (i.e. monogenic forms of diabetes) are presented, while the major hurdles to the global implementation of precision diagnosis of complex forms of diabetes are discussed. The situation is similar for precision therapeutics, in which the appropriate therapy will often change over time owing to the manner in which diabetes evolves within individual patients. This Consensus Report describes a foundation for precision diabetes medicine, while highlighting what remains to be done to realise its potential.

Polyaniline (PAni) is a conductive polymer with a linear conjugated backbone with sequences of single C-C and double C=C bonds. This unique structure produces attractive features for the design of sensing systems such as conductivity, biocompatibility, environmental stability, tunable electrochemical properties, and antibacterial activity. PAni-based glucose sensors (PBGS) were actively developed in past years, using either enzymatic or non-enzymatic principles. In these devices, PAni played roles as a conductive material for electron transfer, biocompatible matrix for enzymatic immobilization, or sensitive layer for detection. In this review, we covered the development of PBGS from 2015 to the present, and it is not even exhaustive; it provides an overview of advances and achievements for enzymatic and non-enzymatic PBGB PBGS for self-monitoring and continuous blood glucose monitoring.

This narrative review examines the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management and identifies areas of future research to address the challenge posed by CAN. We conducted a comprehensive literature search using a range of sources, including the electronic databases PubMed Central, Google Scholar, OVID, and Open Athens, to search for studies on CAN, diabetes mellitus, lifestyle intervention, and cardiovascular risk. We set inclusion criteria to consider review articles or original research published in peer-reviewed journals that examined CAN in diabetes. Epidemiologic data indicate a varied prevalence of CAN in type 1 and 2 diabetes, with prevalences of 17% to 73%) depending on clinical and demographic factors. Indeed, duration of diabetes and hyperglycemia are the strongest risk factors for CAN development in type 1 diabetes. However, in type 2 diabetes, multifactorial risk factors, including obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, are associated with the development of CAN. Insulin resistance, which underpins type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, has a direct role in the pathogenesis of CAN. Lifestyle interventions, including dietary measures and tailored exercise programs, have been beneficial in improving cardiac autonomic function primarily measured through heart rate variability. In addition, weight loss through bariatric surgery also improves heart rate variability and may prevent or reduce CAN progression in people living with obesity and concomitant type 2 diabetes. For optimization in type 2 diabetes, both lifestyle and targeted pharmacologic interventions are required to achieve glycemic/metabolic targets, and weight loss is required to prevent or reverse early CAN or prevent the progression to definite and severe CAN. The focused use of diagnostic testing for CAN, including cardiac autonomic reflex testing in those at high risk of CAN, will enable earlier diagnosis. This testing will allow timely interventions at a reversible stage. Future research should examine targeted early diagnostic testing with subsequent intervention with a combination of lifestyle measures and newer pharmacotherapeutics (eg, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists), which have produced significant cardiovascular benefit in diabetes.",Clinical therapeutics,2022-Oct,"Williams S, Raheim SA, Khan MI, Rubab U, Kanagala P, Zhao SS, Marshall A, Brown E, Alam U",9,2497,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Education delivered during pregnancy aims to reduce this risk by reminding women to maintain dietary and lifestyle modifications after delivery. The primary objective of this study was to describe and analyze the feelings and daily lifestyle changes, including physical activity and dietary changes, among women who experienced gestational diabetes and the roles played by their general practitioners during follow-up. We conducted a qualitative study examining women's attitudes during the 6-12 months postpartum, after receiving a gestational diabetes diagnosis and associated education. All women participated in semi-structured, individual, telephone-based interviews. Out of 47 patients contacted, we interviewed 16 women. All interviewed women modified their behaviors, at least slightly, and described changes that included more balanced diets and the incorporation of mild physical activity. Lack of time, lack of awareness regarding the long-term risk of developing type 2 diabetes, resistance to long-term dietary changes, and cultural habits were identified as the primary barriers to long-term lifestyle modifications, whereas family support was found to be beneficial. The reported interactions between each woman and her physician appeared to be weak. Our study showed that educational attitudes and preventive interventions must be reinforced, especially during the long-term, and not only during the immediate postpartum period.

This review was completed by the end of March 2023, and the following keywords were used for the search: diabetic nephropathy, diabetic kidney disease, safety, efficacy, and antihyperglycemic therapies. The several concerns about the use of antihyperglycemic agents in treating diabetes in patients with DKD highlight the need for substantial efforts in educating both patients and healthcare practitioners in this regard. In addition, it is suggested that patients receive individualized treatments, considering the potential long-term benefits of each agent; this would entail prospectively modifying doses in line with the stage of DKD to prevent the progression of renal damage. As some classes of agents offer better renoprotective effects for patients with DKD, it would be wise for nephrologists and endocrinologists to collaborate to offer an antihyperglycemic regime for patients with DKD who are at a high risk of further progression. Further study is needed on the beneficial renal effects of specific classes of agents; more knowledge of their mechanisms and renoprotective effects may contribute to the development of novel treatments for patients with DKD.",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,2023-Dec,"Jairoun AA, Ping CC, Ibrahim B",3,1864,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37783422,Diagnostic criteria and etiopathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and its complications: Lessons from the Pima Indians.,"The Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has conducted prospective studies of diabetes and its complications in the Pima Indians living in Arizona, USA for over 50 years. In this review we highlight areas in which these studies provided vital insights into the criteria used to diagnose type 2 diabetes, the pathophysiologic changes that accompany the development of type 2 diabetes, and the course and determinants of diabetes complications-focusing specifically on diabetic kidney disease. We include data from our longitudinal population-based study of diabetes and its complications, studies on the role of insulin resistance and insulin secretion in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes, and in-depth studies of diabetic kidney disease that include measures of glomerular function and research kidney biopsies. We also focus on the emerging health threat posed by youth-onset type 2 diabetes, which was first seen in the Pima Indians in the 1960s and is becoming an increasing issue worldwide.","Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",2023-Mar,"Looker HC, Chang DC, Baier LJ, Hanson RL, Nelson RG",5,1085,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32013917,"Epidemiology of diabetes mellitus, pre-diabetes, undiagnosed and uncontrolled diabetes in Central Iran: results from Yazd health study.","Over the past few decades, the prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) has risen rapidly in Iran and other low and middle-income countries. We investigated the prevalence of DM, pre-diabetes, undiagnosed and uncontrolled diabetes and its relationship with some associated socioeconomic factors in the Yazd Greater Area in Iran. Yazd Health Study is a longitudinal study conducted to determine the prevalence of non-communicable disease and related risk factors. In a two-step cluster sampling, 10,000 adults aged 20-69 years (200 clusters) were selected. In the recruitment phase, DM was considered if the patients had been either diagnosed DM by a physician or had fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL. Chi square test was used for categorical variables to evaluate the differences and logistic regression model was applied to determine the predictors of diabetes.. P-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Of the 9965 individuals recruited, the crude self-reported prevalence of DM was 14.1% (95% CI: 13.4-14.7). The prevalence was higher in women than men (15.6 vs.12.4%), significantly. The age-standardized prevalence of DM was 8%. The prevalence was 14.9% in Yazd local people and 8.6% in those residents migrated from other provinces (P < 0.0001). We showed a significant association between DM prevalence and age, education, marital status, unemployment, insurance status, and positive family history (P < 0.0001). The prevalence of DM diagnosed by phycisians was 16.1% in participants (age-standardized prevalence: 8.3%). The subset analysis showed that 4.8% of patients were not aware of their disease. The prevalence of pre-diabetes was 25.8%. Of those with diabetes, 58.3% were not adequately controlled, which is not statistically significant with socio-economic status. The current study showed a high prevalence of DM in Yazd Greater Area which is closely related to some socio-demographic factors. The high prevalence of pre-diabetes is alarming. Effective strategies for DM prevention should be introduced. The majority of people with diabetes are aware, but half of them are not controlled. The ineffective care plan currently in use, should be reviewed. Patients needs to be encouraged to improve their lifestyle.

34922848,Relation between diabetes related distress and glycemic control: The mediating effect of adherence to treatment.,"Diabetes related distress (DRD) is a negative emotional reaction to stresses associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) and its management. This study estimated the burden of DRD and self-reported adherence to treatment (SRAT) among patients with DM and investigated their relationship with glycemic control. A cross sectional study of consented 157 diabetics was conducted using the17-item Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS). It measures distress at four subscales: Emotional Burden (EB), Physician-related (PD), Regimen-related (RD) and Interpersonal Distress (ID). SRAT was assessed using Morisky's scale. Glycemic control was assessed using the most recent HbA1c results. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used for adjustment of confounders and bootstrap Confidence Interval was used to test for the occurrence of mediating effect. Average age was 44.5 ± 16.0 years, 65% were females, 79% had type 2 DM and nearly 55% has had DM for more than 7 years and the average HbA1c was 8.9 ± 2.2%. Clinically significant DRD was reported by 37% of the participants, EB and RD in 40.8%, PD in 46.5%, and ID among 32.5%. Younger patients showed higher level of stress compared to older participants and patients with type 1 DM showed higher level of stress in all DRD domains. Only 46% of patients were defined as having satisfactory SRAT and improvement of SRAT significantly enhanced the glycemic control (r = -0.32, p < 0.01). DRD and low SRAT negatively correlated with HbA1c; increasing the DRD by one point may increase the HbA1c on average by 0.41 (C.I. 0.02-0.80) and will indirectly raise the HbA1c by 0.24 (C.I. 0.04-0.47) through the mediating effect of low SRAT. DRD and low SRAT are commonly reported among DM patients and both are indirectly correlated. The mediating effect of low SRAT highlights the clinical role of DRD and clarifies the process by which distress affect the outcome of DM management.",Primary care diabetes,2022-Apr,"Fayed A, AlRadini F, Alzuhairi RM, Aljuhani AE, Alrashid HR, Alwazae MM, Alghamdi NR",7,1912,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35236158,Diabetes mellitus and the causes of hospitalisation in people with heart failure.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with increased risk of hospitalisation in people with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, little is known about the causes of these events. Prospective cohort study of 711 people with stable HFrEF. Hospitalisations were categorised by cause as: decompensated heart failure; other cardiovascular; infection or other non-cardiovascular. Rates of hospitalisation and burden of hospitalisation (percentage of follow-up time in hospital) were compared in people with and without DM. After a mean follow-up of 4.0 years, 1568 hospitalisations occurred in the entire cohort. DM (present in 32% [<i>n</i>=224]) was associated with a higher rate (mean 1.07 vs 0.78 per 100 patient-years; <i>p</i><0.001) and burden (3.4 vs 2.2% of follow-up time; <i>p</i><0.001) of hospitalisation. Cause-specific analyses revealed increased rate and burden of hospitalisation due to decompensated heart failure, other cardiovascular causes and infection in people with DM, whereas other non-cardiovascular causes were comparable. Infection made the largest contribution to the burden of hospitalisation in people with and without DM. In people with HFrEF, DM is associated with a greater burden of hospitalisation due to decompensated heart failure, other cardiovascular events and infection, with infection making the largest contribution.",Diabetes & vascular disease research,2022-,"Malik A, Garland E, Drozd M, Palin V, Giannoudi M, Straw S, Jex N, Walker AM, Gierula J, Paton M, Witte KK, Kearney MT, Levelt E, Cubbon RM",14,1379,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37222505,Machine learning models for diabetic neuropathy diagnosis using microcirculatory parameters in type 2 diabetes patients.,"Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a primary cause of diabetic foot, early detection of DPN is essential. This study aimed to construct a machine learning model for DPN diagnosis based on microcirculatory parameters, and identify the most predictive parameters for DPN. Our study involved 261 subjects, including 102 diabetics with neuropathy (DMN), 73 diabetics without neuropathy (DM), and 86 healthy controls (HC). DPN was confirmed by nerve conduction velocity and clinical sensory tests. Microvascular function was measured by postocclusion reactive hyperemia (PORH), local thermal hyperemia (LTH), and transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO<inf>2</inf>). Other physiological information was also investigated. Logistic regression (LR) and other machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to develop the model for DPN diagnosis. Kruskal-Wallis Test (non-parametric) were performed for multiple comparisons. Several performance measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, were used to access the efficacy of the developed model. All the features were ranked based on the importance score to find features with higher DPN predictions. There was an overall decrease in microcirculatory parameters in response to PORH and LTH, as well as TcPO<inf>2</inf>, in DMN group compared to DM group and HC group. Random forest (RF) was found to be the best model, and achieved 84.6% accuracy along with 90.2% sensitivity and 76.7% specificity. RF_PF% of PORH was the main predictor of DPN. In addition, diabetic duration was also an important risk factor.

Data from a clinical registry of pregnant women presenting to an Edmonton diabetes clinic between 2002 and 2009 were linked and administrative health records. Three algorithms for identifying women with T1DM, T2DM, and GDM based on International Classification of Diseases---tenth revision (ICD-10) codes were assessed: delivery hospitalization records (Algorithm #1), outpatient clinics during pregnancy (Algorithm #2), and delivery hospitalization plus outpatient clinics during pregnancy (Algorithm #3). In a subset of women with clinic visits between 2005 and 2009, we examined the performance of an additional Algorithm #4 based on Algorithm #3 plus outpatient clinics in the 2 years before pregnancy. Using the diabetes clinical registry as the ""gold standard,"" we calculated true positive rates and agreement levels for the algorithms. The clinical registry included data on 928 pregnancies, of which 90 were T1DM, 89 were T2DM, and 749 were GDM. Algorithm #3 had the highest true positive rate for the detection of T1DM, T2DM, and GDM of 94%, 72%, and 99.9%, respectively, resulting in an overall agreement of 97% in diagnosis between the administrative databases and the clinical registry. Algorithm #4 did not provide much improvement over Algorithm #3 in overall agreement. An algorithm based on ICD-10 codes in the delivery hospitalization and outpatient clinic records during pregnancy can be used to accurately identify women with T1DM, T2DM, and GDM.",Canadian journal of diabetes,2023-Dec,"Ngwezi DP, Savu A, Yeung RO, Butalia S, Kaul P",5,1666,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37156671,"The association between a novel inflammatory biomarker, systemic inflammatory response index and the risk of diabetic cardiovascular complications.","Systemic inflammatory response index (SIRI) is a novel inflammatory biomarker. The relationship between SIRI and the risk of diabetic cardiovascular complications is still unclear. The purpose of our study was to address the correlation between SIRI and the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. A total of 8759 individuals were selected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2015-2020) in our study. Comparing with control (n = 6446) and pre-DM (n = 350) individuals, the DM patients (n = 1963) show the higher SIRI level (all P < 0.001) and prevalence of CVD (all P < 0.001). Furthermore, in a fully adjusted model, we observed the increase of tertiles of SIRI was a risk factor for CVD in DM patients (the middle tertile: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.13-3.13; the highest tertile: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.03-3.22; all P < 0.05), while the relationship between hypersensitive CRP (hs-CRP) and the risk of diabetic cardiovascular complications was not observed (all P > 0.05). Furthermore, the SIRI tertiles-CVD association was significant strongly in patients with high body mass index (BMI; >24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) than in those with a low BMI (≤24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, P for interaction = 0.045). Using restricted cubic splines, we observed a dose-response relation between lg SIRI and the risk of CVD in DM patients. The elevated SIRI was independently associated with the increased risk of CVD in the DM population with a high BMI (>24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and its clinical value is greater than hs-CRP.","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2023-Jul,"Lin K, Lan Y, Wang A, Yan Y, Ge J",5,1547,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37895057,Ubiquitin Proteasome System Role in Diabetes-Induced Cardiomyopathy.,"This study investigated modifications to the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and their relationship to heart complications. <i>db/db</i> mice heart tissues were compared with <i>WT</i> mice tissues using RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, and protein analysis to identify cardiac UPS modifications associated with diabetes. The findings unveiled a distinctive gene profile in the hearts of <i>db/db</i> mice with decreased levels of <i>nppb</i> mRNA and increased levels of <i>Myh7</i>, indicating potential cardiac dysfunction. The mRNA levels of <i>USP18</i> (deubiquitinating enzyme), <i>PSMB8</i>, and <i>PSMB9</i> (proteasome β-subunits) were down-regulated in <i>db/db</i> mice, while the mRNA levels of RNF167 (E3 ligase) were increased. Corresponding LMP2 and LMP7 proteins were down-regulated in <i>db/db</i> mice, and RNF167 was elevated in <i>Adult</i> diabetic mice. The reduced expression of LMP2 and LMP7, along with increased RNF167 expression, may contribute to the future cardiac deterioration commonly observed in diabetes. This study enhances our understanding of UPS imbalances in the hearts of diabetic mice and raises questions about the interplay between the UPS and other cellular processes, such as autophagy.

Hyperglycemia is associated with poor outcomes, and stability of glucose levels is an important factor in preoperative management. Diabetes presents a particular challenge since patients are often on multiple medications encompassing glycemic management and cardiovascular therapies. A PubMed search of published data and reviews on preoperative approaches in diabetes was conducted. Consensus opinion drives most of the guidelines and recommendations for management of diabetes in surgical patients. Pathophysiology is often complex with varying levels of glucose and surgical stress. Establishing well-controlled diabetes prior to surgical intervention should be standard practice in non-emergent procedures. We review the best practices for implementing preoperative assessment, with diabetes with a focus on diabetes medications. The management of a patient preoperatively varies by region and country. Institutions differ in approaches to preoperative evaluation and the establishment of consistent approaches would provide a platform for monitoring patient outcomes.

We sought to define the contemporary incidence of post-HT DM, evaluate risk factors for post-HT DM, and assess the impact of post-HT DM on major outcomes. The cohort included International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Thoracic Organ Transplant Registry adult primary HT-alone recipients, transplanted January 1995-June 2017, who survived to 1 y post-HT. DM status was characterized as (1) no DM pre-HT or post-HT; (2) pre-HT DM; or (3) post-HT DM (onset within 5 y of HT). Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to identify risk factors for post-HT DM onset, as well as risk factors for post-HT severe renal dysfunction and death/retransplantation. Of 26 263 eligible subjects, 57% had no DM pre-HT or post-HT, 22% had pre-HT DM, and 21% had new-onset post-HT DM. Risk factors for the development of post-HT DM included use of tacrolimus or steroids at 1 y post-HT, as well as higher recipient age, female sex, ischemic cardiomyopathy, higher body mass index, pre-HT dialysis, and pre-HT steroid use. Post-HT DM within 5 y was associated with increased subsequent severe renal dysfunction (hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.77-2.01) and death/retransplantation (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-1.45), compared with patients without post-HT DM.

There is a close relationship between insulin resistance (IR) and NAFLD, with a five-fold higher prevalence of NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) compared to that in patients without T2DM. IR is involved in the progression of disease conditions such as steatosis and NASH, as well as hepatic fibrosis progression. The mechanisms underlying these processes involve genetic factors, hepatic fat accumulation, alterations in energy metabolism, and inflammatory signals derived from various cell types including immune cells. In NASH-associated fibrosis, the principal cell type responsible for extracellular matrix production is the hepatic stellate cell (HSC). HSC activation by IR involves ""direct"" and ""indirect"" pathways.

Only a minority (approximately 15%) of the cases of diabetes during pregnancy represent women with pre-existing diabetes. Because of the rising prevalence of obesity and limited screening for diabetes in young women, there has been, globally, an increase in the diagnosis of previously unknown overt diabetes early in pregnancy; these women should be treated as women with pre-existing diabetes, as they may already have unrecognized complications (e.g., nephropathy and retinopathy).

DM can be present before transplant but post-transplant DM (PTDM) refers to diabetes that is diagnosed after solid organ transplantation. Despite its high prevalence, optimal treatment to prevent complications of PTDM is unknown. Medical therapy of pre-existent DM or PTDM after transplant is challenging because of frequent interactions between antidiabetic and immunosuppressive agents. There is also frequent need for medication dose adjustments due to residual kidney disease and a higher risk of medication side effects in patients treated with immunosuppressive agents. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have demonstrated a favorable cardio-renal profile in patients with DM without a transplant and hence hold great promise in this patient population although there is concern about the higher risk of urinary tract infections.

However, general practitioner and patient characteristics influence quality indicator performance. In Switzerland, no data on the pay-for-performance approach exists and the use of quality indicators has been marginal. The aim of this study was to describe quality indicator performance in diabetes care in Swiss primary care and to analyze associations of practice, general practitioner and patient covariates with quality indicator performance. For this cross-sectional study, we used medical routine data from an electronic medical record database. Data from 71 general practitioners and all their patients with diabetes were included. Starting in July 2018, we retrieved 12-month retrospective data about practice, general practitioner and patient characteristics, laboratory values, comorbidities and co-medication. Based on this data, we assessed quality indicator performance of process and intermediate outcomes for glycated hemoglobin, blood pressure, cholesterol and associations of practice, general practitioner and patient characteristics with individual and cumulative quality indicator performance. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using regression methods. We assessed 3,383 patients with diabetes (57% male, mean age 68.3 years). On average, patients fulfilled 3.56 (standard deviation: 1.89) quality indicators, whereas 17.2% of the patients fulfilled all six quality indicators. On practice and general practitioner level, we found no associations with cumulative quality indicator performance. On patient level, gender (ref = male) (OR: 0.83, CI: 0.78-0.88), number of treating general practitioners (OR: 0.94, CI: 0.91-0.97), number of comorbidities (OR: 1.43, CI: 1.38-1.47) and number of consultations (OR: 1.02, CI: 1.02-1.02) were associated with cumulative quality indicator performance.

31665258,Differential epigenetic factors in the prediction of cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients.,"Hyperglycaemia can strongly alter the epigenetic signatures in many types of human vascular cells providing persistent perturbations of protein-protein interactions both in micro- and macro-domains. The establishment of these epigenetic changes may precede cardiovascular (CV) complications and help us to predict vascular lesions in diabetic patients. Importantly, these epigenetic marks may be transmitted across several generations (transgenerational effect) and increase the individual risk of disease. Aberrant DNA methylation and imbalance of histone modifications, mainly acetylation and methylation of H3, represent key determinants of vascular lesions and, thus, putative useful biomarkers for prevention and diagnosis of CV risk in diabetics. Moreover, a differential expression of some micro-RNAs (miRNAs), mainly miR-126, may be a useful prognostic biomarker for atherosclerosis development in asymptomatic subjects. Recently, also environmental-induced chemical perturbations in mRNA (epitranscriptome), mainly the N6-methyladenosine, have been associated with obesity and diabetes. Importantly, reversal of epigenetic changes by modulation of lifestyle and use of metformin, statins, fenofibrate, and apabetalone may offer useful therapeutic options to prevent or delay CV events in diabetics increasing the opportunity for personalized therapy. Network medicine is a promising molecular-bioinformatic approach to identify the signalling pathways underlying the pathogenesis of CV lesions in diabetic patients. Moreover, machine learning tools combined with tomography are advancing the individualized assessment of CV risk in these patients. We remark the need for combining epigenetics and advanced bioinformatic platforms to improve the prediction of vascular lesions in diabetics increasing the opportunity for CV precision medicine.",European heart journal.

And experimental studies have revealed multiple signaling pathways that are triggered by copper shortages or copper overload in diabetic conditions. Moreover, studies show that treated with copper chelators improve vascular function, maintain copper homeostasis, inhibit cuproptosis, and reduce cell toxicity, thereby alleviating diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiomyopathy. However, the mechanisms reported in these studies are inconsistent or even contradictory. This review summarizes the precise and tight regulation of copper homeostasis processes, and discusses the latest progress in the association of diabetes and dietary copper/plasma copper. Further, the study pays close attention to the therapeutic potential of copper chelators and copper in diabetes and its complications, and hopes to provide new insight for the treatment of diabetes.",Molecular nutrition & food research,2023-Dec,"Chang W, Li P",2,1230,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The aim of this study was to comprehensively characterize women with prediabetes compared to women with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This was a retrospective cohort data from a single medical center treating women with pregestational prediabetes mellitus (PDM). Women were compared to pregestational overt type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Data were collected from 120 women in the PDM group and 86 women in the T2DM group. Baseline characteristics were comparable, albeit women in the PDM group arrived at medical attention significantly later, 55% after 15 weeks gestation. Women with PDM needed significantly less treatment to achieve glycemic control and glycated hemoglobin remained lower throughout pregnancy. Maternal and fetal outcomes were similar between groups, although significantly higher rates of macrosomia and neonatal jaundice were observed in the T2DM group. The lack of clear guidelines causes a delay in the first prenatal visit of women with PDM. Comparable pregnancy outcomes may tip the balance toward acceptance of early treatment. Establishing clear guidelines will enable primary caregivers to refer prediabetic women sooner for lifestyle modifications and treatment if needed.","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2023-Dec,"Schiller T, Barak O, Winter Shafran Y, Barak Sacagiu M, Cohen L, Vaisbuch E, Zornitzki T, Kirzhner A",8,1347,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The aim of this paper is to create a state of the nation report of diabetes in the UK. Diabetes UK collates information about diabetes from diverse sources. This paper synthesizes these data to create a national report. Some 7% of the UK population are now living with diabetes; approximately one million people have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, 40 000 children have diabetes and more than 3000 children are diagnosed every year. Forty-nine per cent of people with type 1 diabetes were offered structured education, but only 7.6% attended; the corresponding figures for type 2 diabetes were 90% and 10.4%, respectively. Among people with diabetes, 28% reported having issues obtaining medication or equipment for self-management. Fifty-seven per cent of people with type 1 diabetes and 42% with type 2 diabetes do not receive all eight annual health checks. Around 40% of people with diabetes have diminished psychological well-being. One-third of people have a microvascular complication at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is responsible for 530 myocardial infarctions and 175 amputations every week. The National Health Service spends at least £10 billion a year on diabetes, equivalent to 10% of its budget; 80% is spent treating complications. One in six hospital inpatients has diabetes.

31876542,Diabetic Kidney Disease: Past and Present.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) afflicting humans has been recognized as a disease for >3000 years. However, very little was known about its etiology and pathogenesis until about a century ago when increasing knowledge about anatomy and physiology of the human body gradually led to our understanding that the hormone insulin produced by the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas plays a crucial role in the metabolism of glucose and maintaining the blood sugar level within a normal range. DM is caused by inadequate insulin production (type 1) or insulin resistance (type 2). For thousands of years, DM has been considered as a disease of the kidney; however, with the understanding of the pathogenesis of DM, it became clear that diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a complication and not a cause of DM. DKD is associated with increased matrix expansion that manifests morphologically as a diffuse or nodular expansion of the mesangium and diffuse thickening of the glomerular and tubular basement membranes. Hyperglycemia plays a crucial role in the development of pathologic changes within the kidney. Once established, DKD usually undergoes a slow but relentless progression to end-stage renal disease. However, recent studies have shown that its progression can be slowed or even reversed by strict control of hyperglycemia. Morphologically, DKD may resemble several other glomerular diseases that must be ruled out before a definitive diagnosis. Patients with DM may also develop nondiabetic glomerular or interstitial diseases with or without DKD.

Univariate and multivariate regression-based analyses were conducted to determine association of various risk factors and PTDM in the two cohorts, as well as differences in glucometrics and insulin use across time points. There was a higher incidence of PTDM among liver versus kidney transplant recipients (30% vs. 19%) at 1-year post-transplant. Liver transplant recipients demonstrated a 337% higher odds association to PTDM (OR 3.37, 95% CI (1.38-8.25), p<0.01). 1-month FBG was higher in kidney patients (135 mg/dL vs 104 mg/dL; p < .01), while 1-month insulin use was higher in liver patients (61% vs 27%, p < .01). Age, BMI, insulin use, and inpatient FBG were also significantly associated with differential PTDM risk. Kidney and liver transplant patients have different PTDM risk profiles, both in terms of absolute PTDM risk as well as time course of risk.

IGT is a prediabetic state characterized by elevated blood glucose levels that do not meet the criteria for diabetes. The review explores the potential benefits of pitavastatin in reducing cardiovascular risk and improving lipid profiles in individuals with IGT. It also examines the glycemic effects of pitavastatin, including its impact on fasting blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, and beta-cell function. The review highlights the need for individualized treatment approaches, taking into account the patient's overall cardiovascular risk profile and glycemic control needs. While pitavastatin has shown modest improvements in glycemic control, it is not a substitute for lifestyle modifications or standard antidiabetic medications. Future directions for research include long-term follow-up studies, mechanistic investigations, and comparative analyses to further understand the glycemic effects of pitavastatin in IGT. Overall, this narrative review provides valuable insights for healthcare professionals involved in the management of individuals with IGT, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive approach to reduce cardiovascular risk and optimize glycemic control.",Current problems in cardiology,2023-Nov,"Arsh H, Ali A, Khenhrani RR, Simran F, Dino U, Tamang S, Manoj F, Bai S, Bai M, Panjwani GR, Kumar D, Rani D, Partab F, Malik J",14,1323,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Moreover, the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus is very high in Africa and approximates to around 62%. Nearly 75% of the total deaths due to diabetes are in individuals lesser than 60 years of age. The multifaceted disease of diabetes mellitus produces chronic complications such as, neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, microangiopathy etc. These patients of diabetes mellitus are more susceptible to infections due to compromised immune system. Hence these patients of diabetes mellitus and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 infections. The dual impact of pathophysiology of COVID-19 infections in diabetes mellitus may increase morbidity and mortality in these patients. Hence there is need of health awareness in diabetics as well in the high-risk group for diabetes such as persons with hypertension and obesity. The scarcity of health resources, shortage of trained medical personnel and disease burden of infectious and non-infectious diseases has laid a heavy impact on the economy in Africa and this has been further strained due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ability to predict future glucose values can further optimize such devices. In this study, we used machine learning to train models in predicting future glucose levels based on prior CGM and accelerometry data. We used data from The Maastricht Study, an observational population-based cohort that comprises individuals with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes. We included individuals who underwent >48h of CGM (n = 851), most of whom (n = 540) simultaneously wore an accelerometer to assess physical activity. A random subset of individuals was used to train models in predicting glucose levels at 15- and 60-minute intervals based on either CGM data or both CGM and accelerometer data. In the remaining individuals, model performance was evaluated with root-mean-square error (RMSE), Spearman's correlation coefficient (rho) and surveillance error grid. For a proof-of-concept translation, CGM-based prediction models were optimized and validated with the use of data from individuals with type 1 diabetes (OhioT1DM Dataset, n = 6). Models trained with CGM data were able to accurately predict glucose values at 15 (RMSE: 0.19mmol/L; rho: 0.96) and 60 minutes (RMSE: 0.59mmol/L, rho: 0.72). Model performance was comparable in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Incorporation of accelerometer data only slightly improved prediction. The error grid results indicated that model predictions were clinically safe (15 min: >99%, 60 min >98%). Our prediction models translated well to individuals with type 1 diabetes, which is reflected by high accuracy (RMSEs for 15 and 60 minutes of 0.43 and 1.73 mmol/L, respectively) and clinical safety (15 min: >99%, 60 min: >91%).

38060094,The Emerging Role of Prediabetes and Its Management: Focus on L-Arginine and a Survey in Clinical Practice.,"The worldwide impressive growth of metabolic disorders observed in the last decades, especially type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, has generated great interest in the potential benefits of early identification and management of patients at risk. In this view, prediabetes represents a high-risk condition for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases, and an ideal target to intercept patients before they develop type 2 diabetes gaining a prominent role even in international guidelines. For prediabetic individuals, lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of diabetes prevention, with evidence of about 50% relative risk reduction. Accumulating data also show potential benefits from pharmacotherapy. In this context, the only available data pertain to metformin as a pharmaceutical drug and vitamin D and L-arginine as nutraceuticals. L-arginine appears to be a very interesting tool in the clinical management of patients with pre-diabetes. In this review we summarize the current knowledge on the role of L-arginine in prediabetes as a potentially useful preventive strategy against the progression to type 2 diabetes, with a particular focus on the underlying molecular mechanisms and the past and ongoing trials. In this article we also report the interesting data about the perception of the prediabetic condition and its therapeutic management in the clinical practice in Italy. An early identification and a prompt management of people with prediabetes appears to be of paramount importance to prevent the progression to diabetes and avoid its cardiovascular consequences.",High blood pressure & cardiovascular prevention : the official journal of the Italian Society of Hypertension,2023-Nov,"Volpe M, Ferrera A, Piccinocchi R, Morisco C",4,1617,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36305978,Screening for diabetes in the adult population above the age of 20 years among inhabitants of rural agricultural and rural desert areas of Egypt.,"The present study focused on identifying the current prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in rural desert and rural agricultural areas of Egypt and comparing these findings to those of previous studies that reported lower prevalence rates of DM in rural desert versus rural agricultural areas. The study included a total of 15,000 participants aged 20 years or older; 10,000 were from rural agricultural areas and 5000 were from rural desert areas in Egypt. The prevalence of DM and impaired fasting glucose for each group was recorded, participants were interviewed, medical history was obtained, physical examinations were performed, and fasting plasma glucose was used for diagnosis of DM and IFG using American Diabetes Association criteria. The prevalence of DM was 12.7% in agricultural areas and 4.7% in desert areas. The prevalence of newly diagnosed cases was 15.8% and 9.9% in agricultural and desert areas, respectively. The prevalence of IFG was 11.14% in agricultural and 8.04% in desert areas. These results suggest that living in a rural area makes patients at a higher risk of developing DM (OR = 2.968 CI (2.570-3.428) p < 0.001) and IFG (OR = 1.43, CI (1.272-1.616), p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that increased age, living in agricultural areas, higher body mass index and positive family history of diabetes were the significant predictors affecting the prevalence of DM. The prevalence of DM, IFG, and overall dysglycemia (DM + IFG) in Egypt has generally increased in rural areas, with a lower prevalence in rural desert compared to rural agricultural areas.",Acta diabetologica,2023-Feb,"Arab MM, Elsewy FZ, Badrah MH, Fathalla RM, Abdou MS, Kassab HS",6,1600,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Furthermore, diabetic nephropathy (DN), a common complication in DM, is strongly associated with LV longitudinal myocardial function in T2DM patients, but its association with type 1 DM (T1DM) has not been fully investigated. We studied 125 asymptomatic T1DM patients with preserved LVEF, and 75 age-, gender-, LVEF-matched non-diabetic healthy controls. Two-dimensional speckle-tracking strain LV was used to assess longitudinal myocardial function as global longitudinal strain (GLS). GLS of T1DM patients was significantly lower than that of normal controls (19.7 ± 3.6% vs. 20.6 ± 1.8%, P = 0.049). GLS of T1DM patients with DN was significantly lower that of T1DM patients without DN (17.3 ± 3.7% vs. 20.2 ± 3.5%, P < 0.001), but that of T1DM patients without DN was similar compared to normal controls (20.6 ± 1.8% vs. 20.2 ± 3.5%, P = 0.37). Moreover, multiple regression analysis identified DN the independent determinant parameters for GLS of T1DM patients also correlated significantly with duration of T1DM. Impaired LV longitudinal myocardial function was observed in asymptomatic T1DM patients with preserved LVEF, and DN was associated with LV longitudinal myocardial dysfunction.

Ordinary least squares regression analyses were used to examine the associations among education, annual household income, diabetes onset, and diabetes management (Hba1c). <b>Results:</b> Education, but not income, was inversely associated with Hba1c in undiagnosed participants. Income, but not education, was inversely associated with Hba1c among diagnosed participants. <b>Discussion:</b> These results support the idea that education and income provide non-fungible social and economic resources that vary in their consequences for Hba1c level depending on whether someone has been diagnosed with diabetes.

A retrospective review of 3,568 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using a propensity score-matched (PSM) cohort analysis was carried out in two different age of onset groups (age 40 and 60 years). These groups were then subdivided into two groups, early-onset diabetes (EOD40 and EOD60; the onset age before 40 and 60 years, respectively) and late-onset diabetes (LOD40 and LOD60: the onset age after 40 and 60 years, respectively). Macrovascular and microvascular complications were analyzed before and after PSM. Patients categorized in both the early-onset disease (EOD) groups had a higher risk of developing macro- and microvascular complications before PSM. After PSM, no differences existed between the EOD and late-onset disease groups in the risk of macrovascular complications. Compared with the late-onset disease group, the odds ratio of having a microvascular complication of diabetic retinopathy, chronic kidney disease and diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the 40-year-old EOD group increased to 2.906, 1.967 and 1.672 (P < 0.05), respectively. The odds ratio of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the 60-year-old EOD group was 1.763 and 1.675 (P < 0.05), respectively.

Data were obtained from five rounds of the World Health Organization STEPwise approach to Surveillance (STEPS) cross-sectional surveys. Participants were 7665 and 93,733 adults with and without known diabetes, respectively, aged 25-65 years. We used logistic and linear regressions to assess the trends of risk factors. Individuals with known diabetes compared to those without the condition, experienced greater reductions in mean levels of systolic blood pressure (3.0 vs. 0.5 mmHg among women and 3.9 vs. 1.6 mmHg among men), diastolic blood pressure (6.4 vs. 5.11 mmHg in women and 3.3 vs. 1.8 mmHg in men), and non-HDL cholesterol (42.4 vs. 27.2 mg/dL among women and 30.3 vs. 21.0 mg/dL among men) throughout these years. Men with diabetes also showed a greater reduction in the prevalence of daily cigarette smoking compared to their non-diabetic counterparts (7.3% vs. 2.3%). Fasting plasma glucose decreased among subjects with diabetes but increased among those without diabetes. Significant increases were observed in proportions who met goals for blood pressure, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in both groups; however, almost half of diabetic subjects did not achieve risk factor goals in 2016.

31596548,Emerging trends and the clinical impact of food insecurity in patients with diabetes.,"Food insecurity is a major public health concern in the United States affecting 15 million households according to data in 2017 from the US Department of Agriculture. Food insecurity, or the inability to consistently obtain nutritious food, disproportionately affects socioeconomically disadvantaged households, as well as those with chronic diseases including diabetes mellitus (DM). This review article explores the literature over the past 10 years pertaining to the complex relationship between food insecurity, social determinants of health, and chronic disease with an emphasis on diabetes and glycemic control. Those with diabetes and food insecurity together have been shown to have worse glycemic control compared to those who are food secure, but it remains unclear exactly how food insecurity affects glycemic control. Prior interventional studies have targeted aspects of food insecurity in patients with diabetes but have reported variable outcomes with respect to improvement in glycemic control despite effectively reducing rates of food insecurity. Additionally, few data exist regarding long-term outcomes and diabetes-related complications in this population. It is likely that many factors at both the community and individual levels impact glycemic control outcomes in the setting of food insecurity. Further studies are needed to better understand these factors and to create multifaceted targets for future interventional studies aimed at improving glycemic control in this population.",Journal of diabetes,2020-Mar,"Flint KL, Davis GM, Umpierrez GE",3,1507,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We aimed to evaluate it in a prospective long-term follow-up study with 632 individuals with type 2 diabetes. BP-VVV parameters (systolic and diastolic standard deviations [SD] and variation coefficients) were measured during the first 24-months. Multivariate Cox analysis, adjusted for risk factors and mean BP levels, examined the associations between BP-VVV and the occurrence of microvascular (retinopathy, microalbuminuria, renal function deterioration, peripheral neuropathy) and macrovascular complications (total cardiovascular events [CVEs], major adverse CVEs [MACE] and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality). Improvement in risk discrimination was assessed by the C-statistic and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) index. Over a median follow-up of 11.3 years, 162 patients had a CVE (132 MACE), and 212 patients died (95 from cardiovascular diseases); 153 newly-developed or worsened diabetic retinopathy, 193 achieved the renal composite outcome (121 newly-developed microalbuminuria and 95 deteriorated renal function), and 171 newly-developed or worsened peripheral neuropathy. Systolic BP-VVV was an independent predictor of MACE (hazard ratio: 1.25, 95% CI 1.03-1.51 for a 1-SD increase in 24-month SD), but not of total CVEs, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and of any microvascular outcome. However, no BP-VVV parameter significantly improved cardiovascular risk discrimination (increase in C-statistic 0.001, relative IDI 0.9%). Systolic BP-VVV was an independent predictor of MACE, but it did not improve cardiovascular risk stratification. The goal of anti-hypertensive treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes shall remain in controlling mean BP levels, not on decreasing their visit-to-visit variability.",Cardiovascular diabetology,2020-May,"Cardoso CRL, Leite NC, Salles GF",3,1987,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The family physician program (FPP) proposed by WHO is a health strategy to provide primary health care and improve the community's awareness of non-communicable diseases. Since there was no clear focus on the causal effect of FPP on the prevalence, screening, and awareness of HTN and DM, the primary objective of this study is to determine the causal effect of FPP on these factors in Iran, which is an EMR country. We conducted a repeated cross-sectional design based on two independent surveys of 42,776 adult participants in 2011 and 2016, of which 2301 individuals were selected from two regions where the family physician program was implemented (FPP) and where it wasn't (non-FPP). We used an Inverse Probability Weighting difference-in-differences and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation analysis to estimate the average treatment effects on treated (ATT) using R version 4.1.1. The FPP implementation increased the screening (ATT = 36%, 95% CI: (27%, 45%), P-value < 0.001) and the control of hypertension (ATT = 26%, 95% CI: (1%, 52%), P-value = 0.03) based on 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines that these results were in keeping with JNC7. There was no causal effect in other indexes, such as prevalence, awareness, and treatment. The DM screening (ATT = 20%, 95% CI: (6%, 34%), P-value = 0.004) and awareness (ATT = 14%, 95% CI: (1%, 27%), P-value = 0.042) were significantly increased among FPP administered region. However, the treatment of HTN decreased (ATT = -32%, 95% CI: (-59%, -5%), P-value = 0.012).

To determine the prevalence, clinical features, and complications of common forms of genetically proven MODY seen at a tertiary diabetes centre in South India and compare them with matched individuals with T1D and T2D. Five hundred and thirty individuals identified as 'possible MODY' based on clinical criteria, underwent genetic testing for MODY. Diagnosis of MODY was confirmed based on pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants found using Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) and American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) criteria. The clinical profile of MODY was compared with individuals with type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes, matched for duration of diabetes. Retinopathy was diagnosed by retinal photography; nephropathy by urinary albumin excretion > 30 µg/mg of creatinine and neuropathy by vibration perception threshold > 20 v on biothesiometry.

Subgroup analysis was performed by glycemic status. Six clinical trials were included. Among 12 841 participants, the combined RR for cancer mortality comparing lifestyle interventions with usual care was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.81-1.10 using GLMM and 0.82-1.09 using random-effects model). Most studies had a low risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence was moderate. TSA showed that the cumulative Z curve reached futility boundary while total number did not reach detection boundary. Based on the limited data available, dietary and physical activity-based lifestyle interventions had no superiority to usual care on reducing cancer risk in populations with prediabetes and T2D.

32654398,"Role of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine in the homeostasis of metabolic organs, and its potential links with diabetes and its complications.","Recent studies using genetically manipulated mouse models have shown the pivotal role of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation) in the metabolism of multiple organs. The molecular mechanism involves the sensing of glucose flux by the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, which leads to the adjustment of cellular metabolism to protect against changes in the environment of each organ through O-GlcNAcylation. More recently, not only glucose, but also fluxes of amino acids and fatty acids have been reported to induce O-GlcNAcylation, affecting multiple cellular processes. In this review, we discuss how O-GlcNAcylation maintains homeostasis in organs that are affected by diabetes mellitus: skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver and pancreatic β-cells. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of O-GlcNAcylation in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms whereby cellular homeostasis is maintained, despite changes in metabolic flux, these studies might provide new targets for the treatment and prevention of diabetes and its complications.",Journal of diabetes investigation,2021-Feb,"Morino K, Maegawa H",2,1104,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38928130,Targeting Protein Kinases to Protect Beta-Cell Function and Survival in Diabetes.,"The prevalence of diabetes is increasing worldwide. Massive death of pancreatic beta-cells causes type 1 diabetes. Progressive loss of beta-cell function and mass characterizes type 2 diabetes. To date, none of the available antidiabetic drugs promotes the maintenance of a functional mass of endogenous beta-cells, revealing an unmet medical need. Dysfunction and apoptotic death of beta-cells occur, in particular, through the activation of intracellular protein kinases. In recent years, protein kinases have become highly studied targets of the pharmaceutical industry for drug development. A number of drugs that inhibit protein kinases have been approved for the treatment of cancers. The question of whether safe drugs that inhibit protein kinase activity can be developed and used to protect the function and survival of beta-cells in diabetes is still unresolved. This review presents arguments suggesting that several protein kinases in beta-cells may represent targets of interest for the development of drugs to treat diabetes.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024-Jun,Dalle S,1,1039,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Self-management training and education of diabetes are critical in diabetes care and management. It is essential that patients with diabetes must have a comprehensive understanding of the nature of the disease, risk factors, complications, and possible treatment modalities to attenuate the complications. Over the last few years, DM in Saudi Arabia has been rapidly growing at an alarming rate. It has affected around one-fifth of the adult population, and by 2030, the numbers are predicted to rise further and exceed more than double the present number. An estimated tenfold increase has been reported over the past three decades in Saudi Arabia. However, there has not been much research focusing on understanding the knowledge and awareness of DM in Saudi Arabia as compared to developed nations. This review aims to present an overview of the current knowledge and awareness level of DM among the population of Saudi Arabia through an extensive review of the currently available literature. The review findings could be of immense assistance to the government, healthcare systems, educational institutions, and researchers to develop evidence-based programs, policies, and guidelines towards increasing the knowledge and awareness about diabetes and its management, so that early detection and management can be ensured to control the escalating burden of diabetes in Saudi Arabia.",Current diabetes reviews,2021-,"Robert AA, Al Awad AD, Al Dawish MA",3,1561,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

31676569,CTRP13 Preserves Endothelial Function by Targeting GTP Cyclohydrolase 1 in Diabetes.,"Endothelial dysfunction plays a crucial role in the progress of diabetic vasculopathy. C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein 13 (CTRP13) is a secreted adipokine that can ameliorate atherosclerosis and vascular calcification. However, the role of CTRP13 in regulating endothelial function in diabetes has yet to be explored. In this study, CTRP13 treatment improved endothelium-dependent relaxation in the aortae and mesenteric arteries of both <i>db/db</i> mice and streptozotocin-injected mice. CTRP13 supplement also rescued the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation ex vivo in the <i>db/db</i> mouse aortae and in high glucose (HG)-treated mouse aortae. Additionally, CTRP13 treatment reduced reactive oxygen species overproduction and improved nitric oxide (NO) production and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) coupling in the aortae of diabetic mice and in HG-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Mechanistically, CTRP13 could increase GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) expression and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) levels to ameliorate eNOS coupling. More importantly, CTRP13 rescued HG-induced inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) activity. Increased PKA activity enhanced phosphorylation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and its recruitment to the GCH1 promoter, thus activating GCH1 transcription and, ultimately, endothelial relaxation. Together, these results suggest that CTRP13 preserves endothelial function in diabetic mice by regulating GCH1/BH4 axis-dependent eNOS coupling, suggesting the therapeutic potential of CTRP13 against diabetic vasculopathy.",Diabetes,2020-Jan,"Wang C, Chao Y, Xu W, Liang M, Deng S, Zhang D, Huang K",7,1593,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

37436529,A cohort follow-up study for diabetic retinopathy screening incidence in the North Denmark Region.,"To evaluate diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening incidence in a universal healthcare system. Registry-based cohort study based on a Danish regional population from 2009 to 2018. Individuals with diabetes were identified by medication. Screening attendance was estimated by surrogate measures using local and nationwide databases reported by cumulative incidence. 18,832 patients were included. By the end of the first year, the cumulative incidence of screening for DR was 60.2% and by the end of the second year 74.2%. The cumulative incidence was 93.9% overall, 97.7% for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and 93.4% for patients with type 2 diabetes. Screening proportions per 1, 2 and 5 years were calculated. Females, patients with T1D, and patients attending screening at hospitals had a higher Hazard Ratio of 1.084, 1.157, and 1.573, respectively. The Cochran-Armitage trend test indicated increased screening frequency from 2009 to 2018. Validation of DR screening was done at hospitals with a mean positive predictive value of 86.78%. Cumulative incidence curves showed a small right shift when censoring the first, second and third screening visits. Nearly all patients were screened for DR over a 5-year timespan. Female patients with T1D who attended screening at hospitals were significantly more likely to be screened.

This observational study included all episodes of DKA from April 2014 to September 2020 in a UK tertiary care hospital. Data were collected on diabetes type, demographics, biochemical and clinical features at presentation, and DKA management. From 786 consecutive DKA, 583 (75.9%) type 1 diabetes and 185 (24.1%) type 2 diabetes episodes were included in the final analysis. Those with type 2 diabetes were older and had more ethnic minority representation than those with type 1 diabetes. Intercurrent illness (39.8%) and suboptimal compliance (26.8%) were the two most common precipitating causes of DKA in both cohorts. Severity of DKA as assessed by pH, glucose and lactate at presentation was similar in both groups. Total insulin requirements and total DKA duration were the same (type 1 diabetes 13.9 units (9.1-21.9); type 2 diabetes 13.9 units (7.7-21.1); p=0.4638). However, people with type 2 diabetes had significantly longer hospital stay (type 1 diabetes: 3.0 days (1.7-6.1); type 2 diabetes: 11.0 days (5.0-23.1); p<0.0001). In this population, a quarter of DKA episodes occurred in people with type 2 diabetes. DKA in type 2 diabetes presents at an older age and with greater representation from ethnic minorities. However, severity of presentation and DKA duration are similar in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, suggesting that the same clinical management protocol is equally effective.

35435085,The Risk for Developing Vision Threatening Diabetic Retinopathy is Influenced by Heredity to Diabetes.,"<b>Purpose:</b> Clustering of vision threatening diabetic retinopathy within specific families can be the result of similarities in life style but may also be due to a common genetic background. An evaluation of the role of heredity for the development of diabetic retinopathy may help adjusting control intervals in screening program to each patient's individual risk profile.<b>Methods:</b> Survival analysis was used to study whether family history of diabetes among men and women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes together with the degree of heredity could be added as risk factors to improve the prediction of the risk for developing proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and diabetic macular edema (DME). The study was conducted on data from 12,281 patients followed in the Aarhus area, Denmark, from 1 January 2003 to 1 July 2019.<b>Results:</b> The risk for developing PDR was significantly reduced 2-11 years after known onset of diabetes in the presence of female family members with type 1 diabetes, and the risk for developing DME significantly increased 4-24 years after onset of diabetes in the presence of family members with type 2 diabetes of any sex. These hereditary factors were independent of other studied risk factors such as previous cataract surgery, age of onset of diabetes, metabolic regulation and blood pressure.<b>Conclusions:</b> The presence of family members with diabetes affects the risk for developing vision threatening diabetic retinopathy and affects the risk for developing PDR and DME differently. This evidence may help individualizing the control intervals in screening programmes for diabetic retinopathy.",Current eye research,2022-Sep,Bek T,1,1650,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Existing interventions were identified from a systematic review and our own gray literature search. We then characterized interventions using the Behavior Change Wheel, a framework to inform and drive behavior change, and matched interventions to behavioral targets, audiences, and identified barriers and facilitators. Feedback from the CPEG DKA prevention working group was incorporated into the intervention plan. We identified 27 interventions. Our proposed target behaviors are: (1) prompt recognition of symptoms of diabetes in children; (2) urgent attendance to medical care with a request for an office-based test for diabetes; and (3) rapid confirmation of diagnosis and urgent consultation with pediatric diabetes experts. We initially identified four possible intervention functions including education, training, environment restructuring, and enablement. Feedback from the working group favored education intervention functions including symptom recognition messages targeting parents, caregivers, teachers, and providers and messages about how to make a rapid diagnosis and need for urgent referral targeting providers.

Macrophages are crucial effector cells that play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of diabetic wounds, through their polarization into distinct functional phenotypes. The field of epigenetics has emerged as a rapidly advancing research area, as this phenomenon has the potential to markedly affect gene expression, cellular differentiation, tissue development and susceptibility to disease. Understanding epigenetic mechanisms is crucial to further exploring disease pathogenesis. A growing body of scientific evidence has highlighted the pivotal role of epigenetics in the regulation of macrophage phenotypes. Various epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modification and non‑coding RNAs, are involved in the modulation of macrophage phenotype differentiation in response to the various environmental stimuli present in diabetic wounds. The present review provided an overview of the various changes that take place in macrophage phenotypes and functions within diabetic wounds and discussed the emerging role of epigenetic modifications in terms of regulating macrophage plasticity in diabetic wounds.

We conducted surveys of 1) US CF center directors and 2) Endocrinologists affiliated with the CFF-sponsored EnVision program to characterize CFRD screening practices, describe provider perceived barriers to screening, and identify strategies for improving screening. The surveys queried OGTT protocols, alternate screening strategies, and perceived barriers to screening. CF center characteristics and procedures for coordinating OGTTs were compared between centers achieving ≥50% versus <50% OGTT completion. Endocrinologists received additional questions regarding OGTT interpretation and management. The survey response rate was 18% (51/290) from CF Centers and 63% (25/40) from Endocrinologists. The majority (57%) of CF centers utilized 2 OGTT timepoints (0,120 min). The majority (72%) of Endocrinologists utilized 3 timepoints (0,60,120 min). Four percent of CF centers and 8% of Endocrinologists utilized other timepoints. Forty-nine percent of CF centers reported ≥50% OGTT completion in the past year. Completion of ≥50% OGTT was 5 times more likely when patient reminders were consistently provided (p = 0.017). Both CF Centers and Endocrinologists employed alternative screening strategies including HbA1c (64%, 92%), fasting plasma glucose (49%, 67%), continuous glucose monitoring (30%, 58%), and home fingerstick monitoring (55%, 50%).

However, there is limited collaboration and referrals between these two groups of health professionals. To investigate whether diabetic providers are addressing the importance of oral care in the management of diabetes and whether dental care providers are advising their patients with diabetes about the importance of glycaemic control. Descriptive statistics was used to report data collected from 720 patients with diabetes using a closed-end questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis revealed the factors significantly impacting whether participants received advice from healthcare providers. The majority of participants did not receive advice from either diabetes (84%) or dental (75%) care providers regarding the reciprocal nature of diabetes and periodontitis.

35904746,Newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for cardiocerebrovascular events in primary aldosteronism.,"To explore the prevalence and clinical significance of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients with primary aldosteronism (PA). Investigating the risk factors for cardiocerebrovascular disease (CCVD) will guide strategies for reducing CCVD in patients with PA. We retrospectively included 729 PA patients without DM and conducted oral glucose tolerance tests. We found that 15.0% of PA patients had newly diagnosed DM. The DM prevalence increased with elevated aldosterone levels [OR = 3.20 (1.77, 5.78), P value < 0.001]. The rate of CCVD in newly diagnosed diabetic PA patients was higher than that in nondiabetic PA patients at diagnosis (11.9% vs. 5.0%, P = 0.005). Furthermore, multivariate logistic analysis revealed that HT duration [1.055 (1.002,1.111), P = 0.041] and newly diagnosed DM [2.600 (1.072,6.303), P = 0.034] were significantly associated with CCVD in PA patients. The prevalence of newly diagnosed DM in PA patients was higher than that in the general population. Aldosterone level was an independent risk factor for DM not for CCVD. CCVD was correlated with longer HT duration and newly diagnosed DM. Therefore, it is crucial to screen DM at the diagnosis in PA patients.",Endocrine,2022-Sep,"Zhang C, Jiang Y, Su T, Jiang L, Zhou W, Zhong X, Wu L, Wang W",8,1204,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36286346,Prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can remain undiagnosed for many years, during which micro- and macro-vascular complications may develop. This study aimed to assess the worldwide prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. We systematically searched electronic databases for relevant studies published from inception to 01 January 2022. Selected studies reported the prevalence of DR among patients with newly diagnosed T2DM, specifying the case definition used. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to derive the pooled prevalence. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were used to investigate variations in the prevalence estimates in terms of available variables. Data from 77 studies including 99,847 patients with newly diagnosed T2DM were included from 26 countries. The pooled prevalence of DR among patients with newly diagnosed T2DM was 13.1% (95% CI, 11.1%-15.1%; I<sup>2</sup>  = 97.0%). DR was higher in clinic-based samples compared with community-based samples (15.0%, 95% CI = 12.4%-17.8% vs. 11.5%, 95% CI = 8.9%-14.5%; p = 0.05; I<sup>2</sup>  = 97.0%) and was higher in countries in the WHO African 19.2% (95% CI, 14.6%-24.3%; I<sup>2</sup>  = 76.0%), South-East Asia 15.4% (95% CI, 10.0%-21.6%; I<sup>2</sup>  = 79.1%), and European 15.0% (95% CI, 11.2%-19.2%; I<sup>2</sup>  = 82.0%) regions. A higher proportion of female patients was significantly associated with a lower prevalence of DR in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. We observed that the prevalence of DR in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM has remained unchanged over time. Globally, DR is a prevalent complication among patients with newly diagnosed T2DM indicating the importance of establishing effective strategies to promote regular screening for the early diagnosis of T2DM alongside routine ophthalmic assessment at the time of T2DM diagnosis to reduce the burden of vision-threatening retinopathy.",Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews,2023-Jan,"Cai K, Liu YP, Wang D",3,1927,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35972261,Effect of State-Led Delivery System and Payment Reforms on Population-Level Detection and Management of Diabetes.,"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services State Innovation Models (SIM) initiative has invested more than $1 billion to test state-led delivery system and payment reforms that can affect diabetes care management. We examined whether SIM implementation between 2013 and 2017 was associated with diagnosed diabetes prevalence or with hospitalization or 30-day readmission rate among diagnosed adults. The quasiexperimental design compared study outcomes before and after the SIM initiative in 12 SIM states versus five comparison states using difference-in-differences (DiD) regression models of 21,055,714 hospitalizations for adults age ≥18 years diagnosed with diabetes in 889 counties from 2010 to 2017 across the 17 states. For readmission analyses, comparative interrupted time series (CITS) models included 11,812,993 hospitalizations from a subset of nine states. Diagnosed diabetes prevalence changes were not significantly different between SIM states and comparison states. Hospitalization rates were inconsistent across models, with DiD estimates ranging from -5.34 to -0.37 and from -13.16 to 0.92, respectively. CITS results indicate that SIM states had greater increases in odds of 30-day readmission during SIM implementation compared with comparison states (round 1: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.07; 95% CI 1.04, 1.11; P < 0.001; round 2: AOR 1.06; 95% CI 1.03, 1.10; P = 0.001). The SIM initiative was not sufficiently focused to have a population-level effect on diabetes detection or management. SIM states had greater increases in 30-day readmission for adults with diabetes than comparison states, highlighting potential unintended effects of engaging in the multipayer alignment efforts required of state-led delivery system and payment reforms.",Diabetes care,2022-Oct,"Rodriguez HP, Fulton BD, Phillips AZ, Rubio K",4,1770,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33967016,A 5-year assessment of the epidemiology and natural history of possible diabetes in remission.,"Type 2 diabetes is considered a chronic and progressive disease. The term diabetes in remission has no consensus definition and the question whether diabetes ""remission"" or ""cure"" can achieve any long-term benefits in people with type 2 diabetes remains unclear. The aim of our study was a review of our district wide diabetes population to determine the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of those who had a diagnosis of diabetes but did not meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes at the point of assessment in 2014 and then to review their diabetes outcomes over a 5-year time frame. In a whole population based non-interventional epidemiological study amongst 17,308 people with diabetes, we identified 991 with diet treated type 2 diabetes who met the baseline criteria for diabetes in remission (HbA1c < 48 mmol/mol (6.5%)). Over the next 5 years, 385 (39%) people had a cumulative HbA1c attainment of <48 mmol/mol (6.5%) and remained free of diabetes medication. In this erstwhile remission group only 130 (13%) were free of any vasculopathy, whilst 255 (26%) had some form of micro or macrovascular disease, of which 64 people had been without micro or macrovascular vascular complications at baseline. Only 20 people had a HbA1c consistently ≤37 mmol/mol (5.7%) who were free of diabetes vascular complications and of diabetes medication. The definition of 'diabetes in remission' remains unclear most especially regarding the inclusion of baseline prevalent or incident macro or microvascular disease, the durability of potential remission is poor, and the likelihood of cure is remote.",Primary care diabetes,2021-Aug,"Gillani SMR, Raghavan R, Singh BM",3,1605,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32156282,Health-related quality of life and associated factors among patients with diabetes mellitus at the University of Gondar referral hospital.,"Diabetes mellitus, which has a wide range of effects on the physical, social and psychological aspects of the well-being of a person, is a common and challenging chronic disease that causes a significant rate of morbidity and mortality. However, studies in our country, by and large, focused on the impact of the disease in terms of mortality and morbidity alone. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and associated factors of diabetic patients at the University of Gondar referral hospital, Ethiopia. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted at the University of Gondar referral hospital from April to May 2017. A generic World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to measure the HRQOL. The data were analyzed by Stata version 12. Multiple Linear Regression analysis with P-value 0.05 was used to measure the degree of association between HRQOL and independent variables. A total of 408 patients with Diabetes Mellitus were included in the study. The HRQOL scores for physical, psychological, social and environmental domains were 50.9, 54.5, 55.8 and 47.3, respectively. Diabetes-related complications had a significant association with all except the psychological domain. Higher HRQOL was associated with exercising, following the recommended diet, foot care, sensible drinking and the absence of co-morbidities. However, old age, unemployment and being single and widower had a significant association with lower HRQOL. The environmental and physical domains of HRQOL scores were the lowest compared to the social and psychological domains. Old age and living in rural area had a significant association with a lower HRQOL, whereas the absence of diabetes-related complications, exercising, general diet and foot care had a significant association with better HRQOL of patients. Therefore, strong advice on the recommended lifestyle is important, and old patients and rural dwellers should get due attention. In addition, the prevention of diabetes-related complications is important to improve the patient HRQOL which is an important outcome measurement from the patient's perspective related to the impact of the disease. Therefore, including HRQOL assessment as part of routine management is necessary.",Health and quality of life outcomes,2020-Mar,"Aschalew AY, Yitayal M, Minyihun A",3,2317,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38718275,Impact of Gender on Chronic Complications in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes: Evidence From a Cross-Sectional Study.,"This study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence of diabetes complications between men and women with Type 2 diabetes (T2D), as well as how gender relates to these complications. In this cross-sectional study, complications of diabetes, including coronary artery disease (CAD), retinopathy, neuropathy and diabetic kidney disease (DKD), were evaluated in 1867 participants with T2D. Additionally, baseline characteristics of the individuals, including anthropometric measurements, metabolic parameters and the use of dyslipidaemia drugs and antihyperglycaemic agents, were assessed. Gender differences in complications were examined using the chi-squared test. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to investigate the relationship between gender and T2D complications, with and without adjusting for the characteristics of the studied population. In the studied population, 62.1% had at least one complication, and complications were 33.5% for DKD, 29.6% for CAD, 22.9% for neuropathy and 19.1% for retinopathy. The prevalence of CAD and neuropathy was higher in men. However, DKD and retinopathy were more prevalent among women. Odds ratios of experiencing any complication, CAD and retinopathy in men compared with women were 1.57 (95% CI: 1.27-2.03), 2.27 (95% CI: 1.72-2.99) and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.52-0.98), respectively, after adjusting for demographic factors, anthropometric measures, metabolic parameters and the consumption of dyslipidaemia drugs and antihyperglycaemic agents. The prevalence of diabetes complications was significantly higher in men with diabetes, highlighting the need for better treatment adherence. CAD was associated with the male gender, whereas retinopathy was associated with the female gender. Men and women with diabetes should be monitored closely for CAD and retinopathy, respectively, regardless of their age, diabetes duration, anthropometric measures, laboratory findings and medications.","Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism",2024-May,"Mokhtarpour K, Yadegar A, Mohammadi F, Aghayan SN, Seyedi SA, Rabizadeh S, Esteghamati A, Nakhjavani M",8,1939,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We constructed a new diabetes index using logistic regression (LR) and calculated the probability of diabetes in the validation sets. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and Cox regression analysis to measure the performance of the internal and external validation sets, respectively. We constructed a gender-specific diabetes prediction model, having a resultant AUROC of 0.93 and 0.94 for men and women, respectively. Based on this probability, we classified participants into five groups and analyzed cumulative incidence from the KoGES dataset. Group 5 demonstrated significantly worse outcomes than those in other groups. Our novel model for predicting diabetes, based on two large-scale population-based cohort studies, showed high sensitivity and selectivity.

Spotlight AQ, a novel ""smart"" adaptive patient questionnaire, is designed to improve consultations by rapidly identifying patient priorities and presenting these in the context of best-practice care pathways to aid consultations. We aimed to determine Spotlight AQ's feasibility in routine care. The Spotlight prototype tool was trialed at three centers: two UK primary care centers and one US specialist center (June-September 2020). Participants with type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) completed the questionnaire prior to their routine consultations. Results were immediately available and formed the basis of the clinical discussion and decision-making within the clinic visit. A convenience sample of 49 adults took part, <i>n</i>=31 T1D, (<i>n</i>=18 female); and <i>n</i>=18 T2D (<i>n</i>=10 male, <i>n</i>=4 female, <i>n</i>=4 gender unreported).

Despite the Indonesian Government's ongoing effort to impose regulation for collaborative TB-DM management, the involvement of private primary care providers (PPCs) has not been considered before the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to capture the PPCs' existing practices and explore their challenges, opportunities, and potential roles in the collaborative TB-DM services and control. A descriptive qualitative research design was used to collect data. Two Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 13 healthcare workers (HCWs) from different private clinics and eight private/solo general practitioners (GPs) from Yogyakarta City, Indonesia. We triangulated these data with data from FGDs of HCWs community health centers (CHCs) and in-depth interviews of three regional health regulators, five hospitals staff members, and a representative of national health insurance. The discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and subjected to thematic analysis. PPCs have not been initiated into the implementation of the collaborative TB-DM programme. The themes identified in this study were health system-related barriers, knowledge and perception of HCWs, lack of implementation of bi-directional screening, and needs of multisector role. The potential roles identified for PPCs include involvement in health promotion, bi-directional screening, patient referral, and data reporting according to the TB-DM programme indicators. However, more thorough improvement of PPCs' capacity and logistic supplies are needed to provide comprehensive TB treatment. Although PPCs' involvement in implementing collaborative TB-DM services has yet to be considered, their potential role should not be neglected. Therefore, it is essential to increase their involvement by enhancing their capacity and improving the Public-Private Mix.

One set comprised 62 easily accessible examination results of commonly used variables from a tertiary university hospital. The second set comprised 27 of the 62 variables included in the national routine health checkups. Gradient boosting and random forest algorithms were used to develop the models. Internal validation was performed using the stratified 10-fold cross-validation method. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) for the 62-variable DM model making 12-month predictions for subjects without diabetes was the largest (0.928) among those of the eight DM prediction models. The ROC-AUC dropped by more than 0.04 when training with the simplified 27-variable set but still showed fairly good performance with ROC-AUCs between 0.842 and 0.880. The accuracy was up to 11.5% higher (from 0.807 to 0.714) when fasting glucose was included.

35936377,Analysis and Recognition of Clinical Features of Diabetes Based on Convolutional Neural Network.,"Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic noncommunicable disease, the main manifestation of which is the long-term high blood sugar level in patients due to metabolic disorders. However, due to excessive reliance on the clinical experience of ophthalmologists, our diagnosis takes a long time, and it is prone to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. In recent years, with the development of deep learning, its application in the auxiliary diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy has become possible. How to use the powerful feature extraction ability of deep learning algorithm to realize the mining of massive medical data is of great significance. Therefore, under the action of computer-aided technology, this paper processes and analyzes the retinal images of the fundus through traditional image processing and convolutional neural network-related methods, so as to achieve the role of assisting clinical treatment. Based on the admission records of diabetic patients after data analysis and feature processing, this paper uses an improved convolutional neural network algorithm to establish a model for predicting changes in diabetic conditions. The model can assist doctors to judge the patient's treatment effect by using it based on the case records of inpatient diagnosis and treatment and to predict the risk of readmission of inpatients after discharge. It also can help to judge the effectiveness of the treatment plan.

32938319,Impact of a Pharmacist-Driven Protocol to Improve Guideline-Concordant Prescribing of Diabetes Medications in Patients With Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease: A Pilot Study.,"To determine whether a pharmacist-driven protocol improves guideline-concordant prescribing of diabetes medications in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). A retrospective pre- and post-intervention study was conducted at a university-based family medicine clinic. A pharmacist-driven protocol was implemented which involved the creation of an algorithm recommending specific diabetes medications in patients with ASCVD. An in-service presentation reviewing the algorithm and process for referral of eligible patients to an appointment with a clinical pharmacist was delivered to providers. Clinical pharmacist appointments focus was on improving diabetes management and initiating cardiovascular risk-reducing medications if appropriate. A total of 234 patients were screened, and 108 met inclusion criteria. Upon completion of patient outreach, 34% were scheduled with a pharmacist. Forty-three percent of patients (16 of 37) attended the appointment. Of those, 31% were initiated on an evidence-based regimen indicated for diabetes and ASCVD. In comparing pre- to post-implementation of the pharmacist-driven protocol, the rate of guideline-concordant prescribing increased by 48% (3.8% to 5.6%). Implementation of a pharmacist-driven protocol can increase guideline-concordant prescribing. However, further exploration of patient- and system-level barriers is necessary to implement such a program more broadly.",Journal of pharmacy practice,2022-Feb,"Freudenberg DL, Covington LP, Young RB, Lopez ND, Patel MV, MacLaughlin EJ",6,1440,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We examined whether visits to a primary care clinic up to a month prior to diagnosis of new onset diabetes affected ketoacidosis rates. Retrospective chart review of children who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2014. Data collection included demographics, age at diagnosis, number of visits to the primary care clinic during the month prior the diagnosis, relevance to diabetes and outcome of those visits and the presence of ketoacidosis at diagnosis. We examined the relationship between the rate of ketoacidosis at diagnosis and the number of visits in the clinic, and to the demographic characteristics. Of 159 patients, 115 visited their clinic in the month prior to diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. The rate of ketoacidosis at diagnosis was similar between those who visited the clinic and those who did not (37.4% compared to 38.6%). There was no difference in ketoacidosis rates between the different ethnic and socio-economic groups. Medical encounters in the month prior to diagnosis of type 1 diabetes did not reduce ketoacidosis rates in children.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",2021-Mar,"Yona A, Haim A, Friger M, Chechik TG, Loewenthal N, Hershkovitz E",6,1186,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Having a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a potent risk factor for the later development of T2DM. To explore the characteristics of women diagnosed with GDM in a single centre and their follow up for progression to T2DM. A retrospective cohort study using anonymised data of one hundred and fifty four (154) women with GDM receiving maternity care at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (OUHFT) in 2010 and their follow up until 2018. The prevalence of GDM in women delivering in Oxfordshire in 2010 was 3.4%. 70% of pregnant women were overweight or obese (with 51% being obese) at booking. Gestational weight gain (GWG) was excessive in 29% of women, when compared to Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines. Almost a quarter of women (23.4%) had no follow up after delivery. Over a median follow up of 3.5 years (range 0-8 years) nearly one in six (16.9%) of the total cohort (22% of those tested) went on to develop T2DM. 74% of women with GDM were multiparous, and 65% of nulliparous women were tested compared to 81% of multiparous women. There was a significant difference between multiparous women (53.8%) compared to nulliparous women (46.2%) developing T2DM (p=0.01). There was no significant difference in BMI (p=0.866) or GWG (p=0.83) in women who progressed to T2DM versus those who did not. The risk of T2DM after GDM is substantial however, follow up rates of this population is poor. Subsequent screening of women with GDM and their management crosses secondary and primary care with scope for improvement in counselling of women of the importance of annual reviews, in data collection and follow up in both obstetrics and general practice. The implementation of a recall system, an education programme for general practitioners and/or a registry of women diagnosed with GDM could be useful to identify those at high risk of developing T2DM as well as providing a platform for the potential development of interventions to prevent progression to T2DM after GDM.",Primary care diabetes,2020-Dec,"Walker E, Flannery O, Mackillop L",3,2079,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33153226,Role of Phosphodiesterase in the Biology and Pathology of Diabetes.,"Glucose metabolism is the initiator of a large number of molecular secretory processes in β cells. Cyclic nucleotides as a second messenger are the main physiological regulators of these processes and are functionally divided into compartments in pancreatic cells. Their intracellular concentration is limited by hydrolysis led by one or more phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes. Literature data confirmed multiple expressions of PDEs subtypes, but the specific roles of each in pancreatic β-cell function, particularly in humans, are still unclear. Isoforms present in the pancreas are also found in various tissues of the body. Normoglycemia and its strict control are supported by the appropriate release of insulin from the pancreas and the action of insulin in peripheral tissues, including processes related to homeostasis, the regulation of which is based on the PDE- cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway. The challenge in developing a therapeutic solution based on GSIS (glucose-stimulated insulin secretion) enhancers targeted at PDEs is the selective inhibition of their activity only within β cells. Undeniably, PDEs inhibitors have therapeutic potential, but some of them are burdened with certain adverse effects. Therefore, the chance to use knowledge in this field for diabetes treatment has been postulated for a long time.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020-Nov,"Kilanowska A, Ziółkowska A",2,1337,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This remains true despite initiation of renal replacement therapy. As such, we were interested in identifying any potential differences in access durability and postoperative outcomes in diabetic patients who receive arteriovenous fistulas versus grafts for hemodialysis. Diabetic patients undergoing their first arteriovenous (AV) access creation surgery in the Vascular Quality Initiative from January 2011 to January 2022 were included in our study. After exclusions, the study included two groups: those receiving AV fistulas and those receiving AV grafts for hemodialysis. Demographic characteristics were summarized and compared between these two groups using chi-square analysis or unpaired <i>t</i>-test. After propensity score matching was conducted, the effect of procedure type on functional patency, along with secondary outcomes including wound infection were assessed using chi-square analysis. A total of 20,159 diabetic patients who used their hemodialysis access were included in our study; 16,205 received AV fistulas while 3954 received AV grafts. Patients receiving AV grafts were more likely to be older, female, and have higher pre-operative catheter usage. After propensity score matching, patients who received AV grafts had a shorter time-to-use their conduit (50 vs 166 days, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), however, patients who received AV fistulas were more likely to have longer functional patency use for hemodialysis when compared to those who received AV grafts (mean survival time: 3.3 vs 2.9 years, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). These results were consistent between diabetics with insulin-dependent or insulin-independent diabetes. Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus had an increased risk for significantly inferior clinical outcomes related to newly created AV grafts, including lower rates of mid-term functional patency and higher rates of worse post-operative outcomes when compared to diabetics who received AV fistulas.",The journal of vascular access,2025-Sep,"Cleary CM, Wu R, Amankwah KS, Boutrous ML",4,2095,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate complete blood count and blood smear alterations and to describe their relationship with, and incidence of comorbid diseases in, diabetic dogs. Three-hundred twelve diabetic dogs, 286 dogs diagnosed with systemic, nondiabetic illnesses, and 506 healthy dogs were identified during the study period. Groups were compared using contingency tables and logistic regression. Associations between statistically significant complete blood count and blood smear alterations and comorbidities were evaluated using multivariable analysis. High-grade codocytosis and anisocytosis were identified more frequently in diabetic dogs, whereas high-grade reactive lymphocytosis and keratocytosis were identified less frequently (P < .001). Diabetic dogs with high-grade codocytosis had lower red blood cell, hemoglobin, hematocrit and higher white blood cell counts (P < .001). Diabetic ketoacidosis was diagnosed more frequently in diabetic dogs with high-grade codocytosis when compared with those with low-grade codocytosis (P < .001) or when compared with any other cell morphologic alterations.

Distinctive data for diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) and related complications were retrieved from national databases. The prevalence of diabetes was higher in people with ID than in the general population (9.9% versus 6.6%). Largest differences were seen in younger age groups. Women with ID had diabetes more often than men with ID. Complications were less common in people with ID than in the general population (IR 58.6 vs. 70.4). In particular, cardiological complications were noted less, while surgical interventions and hospitalization occurred more often. Although diabetes was 1.5 times more prevalent in people with ID than in other people, related complications were less common, followed different patterns and were more severe than in the general population.

We performed a single center, observational study in a cohort of 238 DM patients (mean age ± SD 52.15 ± 17.27 years, 54% female) as a part of the Silesia Diabetes-Heart Project. Having gathered patients' medical history, demographic data, laboratory test results, results from the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (assessing diabetic peripheral neuropathy) and Ewing's battery examination (determining the presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy), we managed use a ML approach to predict the occurrence of overt CVD on the basis of five most discriminative predictors with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86 (95% CI 0.80-0.91). Those features included the presence of past or current foot ulceration, age, the treatment with beta-blocker (BB) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi). On the basis of the aforementioned parameters, unsupervised clustering identified different CV risk groups. The highest CV risk was determined for the eldest patients treated in large extent with ACEi but not BB and having current foot ulceration, and for slightly younger individuals treated extensively with both above-mentioned drugs, with relatively small percentage of diabetic ulceration. Using a ML approach in a prospective cohort of patients with DM, we identified important factors that predicted CV risk. If a patient was treated with ACEi or BB, is older and has/had a foot ulcer, this strongly predicts that he/she is at high risk of having overt CVD.",Cardiovascular diabetology,2023-Aug,"Kwiendacz H, Wijata AM, Nalepa J, Piaśnik J, Kulpa J, Herba M, Boczek S, Kegler K, Hendel M, Irlik K, Gumprecht J, Lip GYH, Nabrdalik K",13,1722,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34773673,Diabetes management in the face of adversity: Experiences of asylum-seekers in Belgian reception centres.,"Diabetes poses a heavy burden on patients due to its progressive and chronic nature; it requires continuous management to promote a high-quality and long life. Disease management is especially challenging in emergency settings. We examined how displaced people with diabetes experienced managing their illness before and throughout the process of fleeing their home communities and seeking resettlement in Europe. We designed an interview instrument with closed- and open-ended questions about diabetes diagnosis and management before fleeing the home country, during migration, stays in transit countries and reception in the European Union. We interviewed 20 asylum-seekers living in Belgian reception centres with diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Primary topics emerging from interviews were availability, accessibility, and quality. Belgium was described as a setting with high availability, accessibility and quality of diabetes management components (medication, tools, care) compared with other settings before and during migration. Even in Belgium, maintaining a healthy diet as an asylum-seeker was difficult. Other concerns such as safety, other health issues and the asylum request itself often outweighed diabetes management. Displaced people in non-Western countries need attention for nutrition and diabetes medicine, so aid agencies should consider providing for those needs. For people seeking asylum in the West and living in temporary facilities, care should be paid to the dietary options available for those with diabetes.

The 2-year follow-up has provided new insights on the frequency of ADEs, including severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), during use of FLASH. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The RELIEF study included 31,446 PwDT1 and 41,027 PwDT2 with a first delivery of FreeStyle Libre (FSL) between August 1 and December 31, 2017. Hospitalizations for DKA, severe hypoglycemia, diabetes-related coma, and hyperglycemia were recorded for the 12 months before and 24 months after FSL initiation. Persistence of the FSL system use was estimated through a Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Change in usual blood glucose monitoring was estimated through acquisition of blood glucose test strips. <b><i>Results:</i></b> In the 2 years after FSL initiation, hospitalizations for ADEs were reduced by 49% and by 48% in PwDT1 or PwDT2, respectively, driven by reductions in DKA. After 2 years, 88% of patients persisted with the system and estimated mean consumption of blood glucose test strips had fallen after 2 years by -82% and by -84% in type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Use of FSL consistently reduces the rates of hospitalization for ADEs, mainly DKA, 2 years after initiation, confirming this is not a transitory effect.

To enable the optimal resource allocation across different prevention and treatment policies for the management of T2D-related complications, detailed cost estimates related to the complications of T2D are needed. Therefore, the objective of the study was to provide reliable and sufficiently detailed real-world estimates of costs associated with different T2D complications in a Finnish university hospital setting. A cohort of T2D patients living in the catchment area of a university hospital during 2012 and 2016 was identified from the comprehensive national FinDM diabetes database for longitudinal assessment of T2D associated complication treatment costs. Data on patient-level events were extracted from the FinDM data and complemented with all accountable services and related detailed costing data gathered from the university hospital's electronic patient information systems by using unique personal identity codes. Patients were screened for their first diagnoses of complications using the same national quality registry definitions as in the FinDM database. Multivariable gamma regression model with a log link function was applied to study the association between baseline factors and complication costs. In addition, an interactive online tool was developed to create predicted costs for complication costs with selected baseline factors. A total of 27 255 prevalent and incident patients with T2D were identified from the national FinDM register. Finally, a total of 16 148 complication episodes for 7 895 patients were included in the cost analyses. The mean estimated one-year hospital treatment costs of T2D-related complication varied from 6 184 to 24 507 euros per complication. Regression analyses showed that coexisting conditions are significantly associated with initial and recurrent complication costs. The study shows updated Finnish cost estimates and their main cost drivers for T2D-related complications treated in the university hospital setting.

Whether this is true in Emilia-Romagna region in recent years is unknown and the aim of this study is to describe the role of educational level both on diabetes prevalence and health outcomes among the adult population with and without diabetes enrolled in the Emilian Longitudinal Study. Inequalities in diabetes prevalence were evaluated through standardised estimates and prevalence ratios by educational level and inequalities in outcomes through standardised hospitalisation and mortality ratios and rate ratios by educational level. The lower the education the greater the diabetes prevalence; such differences were larger among women and younger age groups. Diabetes conferred a higher risk of hospitalisation and mortality; those outcomes also presented a social gradient with the less educated bearing the higher risk. However, educational differences were slightly stronger among the disease-free subjects, especially in the case of mortality. In both genders, inequalities tended to disappear with age. This study confirms that diabetes increases the risk of unfavourable outcomes, but does not increase social inequalities in outcomes as might be expected. Similarly to what has been previously shown, it is likely that the protective effect of diabetes on the negative health effects of the low social position is attributable to the disease integrated care approach.","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2020-Aug,"Bartolini L, Caranci N, Gnavi R, Di Girolamo C",4,1620,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global public health emergency and patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) are disproportionately affected, exhibiting more severe outcomes. Recent studies have shown that metformin is associated with improved outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and DM and may be a potential candidate for drug repurposing. We aimed to investigate the effects of metformin on outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and DM. Databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, Clinicaltrials.gov and Cochrane library) were searched up to 10 April 2021 for studies reporting data on metformin use in COVID-19 patients with DM. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Certainty of evidence was rated using the GRADE approach. The primary outcome was mortality reported as odds ratio (OR). A random-effects meta-analysis was carried out on both unadjusted and adjusted ORs. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020221842. In total, 2 916 231 patients from 32 cohort studies were included in the quantitative and qualitative synthesis. The meta-analysis showed that metformin was significantly associated with lower mortality in COVID-19 patients with DM in both unadjusted (OR 0.61 [95% confidence interval: 0.53-0.71], P < .00001, I<sup>2</sup>  = 70%) and adjusted (OR 0.78 [95% confidence interval: 0.69-0.88], P < .00001, I<sup>2</sup>  = 67%) models. Poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients with DM can be attributed to inadequate glycaemic control and weakened immune responses.

We aimed to assess the association between obesity and macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes. This study consisted of 111,830 patients (age range: 1-106) with diabetes including 10,641 T1D (3187 obese [38.2% men] and 7454 non-obese [45.5% men]) and 101,189 T2D (51,873 obese [27.5% men] and 49,316 non-obese [33.4% men]) from the National Program for Prevention and Control of Diabetes (NPPCD-2021) in Iran, who attended academic tertiary care outpatient clinics from February 2016 to April 2021. A pooled logistic regression model was used to examine the association between obesity and diabetic complications. Among patients with T1D, a significant association was found between obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD), neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy (OR= 1.75, 1.56, 1.80 and 1.92, P-value= 0.001, 0.004, 0.001 and <0.001, respectively). In T2D, a statistically significant association was found between obesity and CVD, neuropathy and nephropathy (OR= 1.63, 1.98, 1.21, respectively, P-values <0.001). Obesity was independently associated with CVD, neuropathy and nephropathy in patients with T1D and T2D and with retinopathy only in T1D, to different degrees. The association between obesity and retinopathy and neuropathy was the strongest among T1D and T2D, respectively.

The initial publications on this condition began appearing in the second half of the 1990s and quite surprisingly, the search for new NDM genes is still ongoing with great vigor. Between 2018 and early 2024, six brand new NDM-genes have been discovered (CNOT1, FICD, ONECUT1, PDIA6, YIPF5, ZNF808) and three genes known to cause different diseases were identified as NDM-genes (EIF2B1, NARS2, KCNMA1). In addition, NDM cases carrying mutations in three other genes known to give rise to diabetes during childhood have been also identified (AGPAT2, BSCL2, PIK3R1). As a consequence, the list of NDM genes now exceeds 40. This genetic heterogeneity translates into many different mechanism(s) of disease that are being investigated with state-of-the-art methodologies, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and human embryonic stem cells (hESC) manipulated with the CRISPR technique of genome editing. This diversity in genetic causes and the pathophysiology of diabetes dictate the need for a variety of therapeutic approaches. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview on recent achievements in all aspects of this area of research.",Journal of diabetes investigation,2024-Dec,"Barbetti F, Deeb A, Suzuki S",3,1287,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

36932771,Pre-Ramadan diabetes risk stratification and patient education.,"The fast (Sawm) is one of the religious obligations ""Pillars"" of Islam. The target audience of pre-Ramadan diabetes risk stratification and pre-education are the healthcare providers (particularly the Primary care physicians), diabetic patients and community members including general public. As per IDF-DAR (International Diabetes Federation & Diabetes and Ramadan International Alliance) guideline, it is advisable that healthcare providers should arrange pre-Ramadan session (appointment) at least 6-8 weeks prior to Ramadan quantify/stratify the patient risk category and educate all the diabetic patients on Ramadan aspects of Diabetes Mellitus. Diabetic patients are classified in to three risk groups (very high risk, moderate risk and low risk) based on specific patient characteristics. The physician should estimate the effect of fast on the patient, whether he will be able to fast or not, and the patient will estimate his ability and endurance to fast. The mode of Pre-Ramadan diabetes patient education could be group sessions or one to one consultation. Patient education should include information on risks, glucose monitoring, nutrition, exercise and medication adjustment. Studies have shown that pre-Ramadan counseling reduces the incidence of hypoglycaemia. Altering the drug dosage, dietary counseling and patient education, together with regular blood glucose monitoring enables the patients to fast without major complications. Patients classified as very high/high risk including T1DM and pregnant women with diabetes need close medical supervision and focused Ramadan-specific education if they insist on fasting. With the correct advice and support from healthcare providers most people with T2DM can fast safely during Ramadan.",JPMA.

33606663,Differences between transient neonatal diabetes mellitus subtypes can guide diagnosis and therapy.,"Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is caused by activating mutations in ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes (KATP/TNDM) or by chromosome 6q24 abnormalities (6q24/TNDM). We wanted to assess whether these different genetic aetiologies result in distinct clinical features. Retrospective analysis of the Italian data set of patients with TNDM. Clinical features and treatment of 22 KATP/TNDM patients and 12 6q24/TNDM patients were compared. Fourteen KATP/TNDM probands had a carrier parent with abnormal glucose values, four patients with 6q24 showed macroglossia and/or umbilical hernia. Median age at diabetes onset and birth weight were lower in patients with 6q24 (1 week; -2.27 SD) than those with KATP mutations (4.0 weeks; -1.04 SD) (P = 0.009 and P = 0.007, respectively). Median time to remission was longer in KATP/TNDM than 6q24/TNDM (21.5 weeks vs 12 weeks) (P = 0.002). Two KATP/TNDM patients entered diabetes remission without pharmacological therapy. A proband with the ABCC8/L225P variant previously associated with permanent neonatal diabetes entered 7-year long remission after 1 year of sulfonylurea therapy. Seven diabetic individuals with KATP mutations were successfully treated with sulfonylurea monotherapy; four cases with relapsing 6q24/TNDM were treated with insulin, metformin or combination therapy. If TNDM is suspected, KATP genes should be analyzed first with the exception of patients with macroglossia and/or umbilical hernia. Remission of diabetes without pharmacological therapy should not preclude genetic analysis. Early treatment with sulfonylurea may induce long-lasting remission of diabetes in patients with KATP mutations associated with PNDM.

This study aims to identify the medical expenses of patients with diabetes in different regions of China and examine the differences in inpatient medical expenses and the impacts of them on these patients. This study is a longitudinal analysis of medical expenses for inpatients with diabetes for different years; horizontal analysis of medical expenses among different regions; and literature review. Data were derived from China's Medical Insurance Department database. We selected inpatients with diabetes in the eastern, central, and western regions of China for the period 2013-2015 and randomly selected data through systematic sampling. Among the 4150 patients with diabetes considered in this study, the patients' medical expenses were found to differ significantly across regions, years, ages, medical insurance types, medical institution levels, total medical expenses, medical insurance fund payments, and out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses. In addition, there were significant differences in total medical expenses for male and female patients. Furthermore, medical insurance type, patients' age, medical institution level, and year significantly influenced total medical expenses. Inpatients with diabetes in different regions exhibited significant differences in total medical expenses, medical insurance fund payments, and OOP expenses. China should invest more in chronic disease treatment in its central and western regions, narrow the regional differences in medical expenses, and endeavor to ensure equity in the availability and cost of medical services.

The usual factors causing alkalemia were not found in our patients. This entity may manifest in both newly diagnosed and treated patients. The first patient, an 8 year male presented with features of DKA, was diagnosed for the first time as type 1 DM, but was found to have alkalemia. The second patient, a 7 year female was a known case of Type 1 DM on insulin, who presented with dehydration and alkalemia. Both were treated with hydration and insulin and made complete recovery.

37448463,Optimizing strategies to identify high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.,"The success of diabetes prevention based on early treatment depends on high-quality screening. This study compared the diagnostic properties of currently recommended screening strategies against alternative score-based rules to identify those at high risk of developing diabetes. The study used data from ELSA-Brasil, a contemporary cohort followed up for a mean (standard deviation) of 7.4 (0.54) years, to develop risk functions with logistic regression to predict incident diabetes based on socioeconomic, lifestyle, clinical, and laboratory variables. We compared the predictive capacity of these functions against traditional pre-diabetes cutoffs of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h plasma glucose (2hPG), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) alone or combined with recommended screening questionnaires. Presenting FPG > 100 mg/dl predicted 76.6% of future cases of diabetes in the cohort at the cost of labeling 40.6% of the sample as high risk. If FPG testing was performed only in those with a positive American Diabetes Association (ADA) questionnaire, labeling was reduced to 12.2%, but only 33% of future cases were identified. Scores using continuously expressed clinical and laboratory variables produced a better balance between detecting more cases and labeling fewer false positives. They consistently outperformed strategies based on categorical cutoffs. For example, a score composed of both clinical and laboratory data, calibrated to detect a risk of future diabetes ≥20%, predicted 54% of future diabetes cases, labeled only 15.3% as high risk, and, compared to the FPG ≥ 100 mg/dl strategy, nearly doubled the probability of future diabetes among screen positives. Currently recommended screening strategies are inferior to alternatives based on continuous clinical and laboratory variables.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2023-,"Bracco PA, Schmidt MI, Vigo A, Mill JG, Vidigal PG, Barreto SM, Sander MF, da Fonseca MJM, Duncan BB",9,1809,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34352986,Management of Cardiovascular Risk in Perimenopausal Women with Diabetes.,"Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of mortality in women and men with diabetes. Due to age and worsening of risk factors over the menopausal transition, risk of coronary heart disease events increases in postmenopausal women with diabetes. Randomized studies have conflicted regarding the beneficial impact of estrogen therapy upon intermediate cardiovascular disease markers and events. Therefore, estrogen therapy is not currently recommended for indications other than symptom management. However, for women at low risk of adverse events, estrogen therapy can be used to minimize menopausal symptoms. The risk of adverse events can be estimated using risk engines for the calculation of cardiovascular risk and breast cancer risk in conjunction with screening tools such as mammography. Use of estrogen therapy, statins, and anti-platelet agents can be guided by such calculators particularly for younger women with diabetes. Risk management remains focused upon lifestyle behaviors and achieving optimal levels of cardiovascular risk factors, including lipids, glucose, and blood pressure. Use of pharmacologic therapies to address these risk factors, particularly specific hypoglycemic agents, may provide some additional benefit for risk prevention. The minimal benefit for women with limited life expectancy and risk of complications with intensive therapy should also be considered.",Diabetes & metabolism journal,2021-Jul,Kim C,1,1399,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Information from medical records and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measured on admission was retrospectively used to screen for diabetes and prediabetes defined according to standard criteria. Overall rate of diabetes undiagnosed at admission and diabetes still undiagnosed at SU discharge were 9.7% and 6.7% but age-specific prevalence peaked up to 12.0% and 9.0% after age 80. At admission, the proportion of all undiagnosed diabetes on total diabetes cases was one out of every two cases before age 60 and three out of every four cases after age 80. In these same age intervals, one out of every three diabetes cases was still undiagnosed at SU discharge. Regardless of age, about three out of ten patients with acute stroke had prediabetes. Less than 2% of these patients had a prediabetes diagnosis before or after SU admission. In patients with acute stroke, diabetes is substantially underdiagnosed before age 60 and after age 80.

32558488,PPAR-α Agonist Fenofibrate Ameliorates Oxidative Stress in Testicular Tissue of Diabetic Rats.,"Oxidative stress has the potential to induce impotence, especially in diabetic patients. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) agonists can potentiate antioxidants in a wide variety of tissues. However, no available evidence exists showing a direct antioxidant effect on testicular tissue in the setting of diabetes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether PPAR-α agonists can act directly to protect testicular tissue from oxidative damage. Male Wistar rats (180-200 g) were randomly allocated into four groups: normal control (N), normal treated (NF), diabetic (D), and diabetic treated (DF) (n = 6 for each group). Diabetes was induced by a single intravenous injection of streptozotocin STZ (40 mg/kg). Two treatment groups (diabetic and nondiabetic) were treated with fenofibrate daily for 8 weeks (80 mg/kg orally). At the end of 8 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and blood and testicular tissue samples collected. Nitrate, malondialdehyde, and glutathione levels, and the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes were evaluated. The data were analyzed via two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with P < 0.05 taken as significant. Diabetes significantly augmented free radicals, as attested by an increase in nitrate levels in testicular tissue, reduced activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes, and enhanced malondialdehyde content. These changes lead to oxidative stress in testicular tissues. Treatment with fenofibrate in the diabetic group improved oxidative stress by potentiation of antioxidant elements and a reduction in nitrate and malondialdehyde production. Diabetes has a potent effect in promoting the development of oxidative damage in testicular tissue. The PPAR-a agonist fenofibrate improves the redox state and may prevent oxidative stress in the setting of diabetes-induced oxidative stress.",Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression,2020-,"Yaribeygi H, Mohammadi MT, Jamialahmadi T, Sahebkar A",4,1883,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Using nationally available data and existing clinical and demographic information from members participating in cardiometabolic V1C programs, a microsimulation approach was used to estimate potential reduction in onset of disease sequelae and associated gross savings (ie, excluding the cost of V1C programs) in health care costs. Members of each program were propensity matched to similar records in the combined 2012-2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey files based on age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and diagnosis status of diabetes and/or hypertension. V1C program-attributed changes in clinical outcomes combined with baseline biometric levels and other risk factors were used as inputs to model disease onset and related gross health care costs. Across the V1C programs, sustained improvements in weight loss, hemoglobin A1c, and blood pressure levels were estimated to reduce incidence of modeled disease sequelae by 2% to 10% over the 5 years following enrollment. As a result of sustained improvement in biometrics and reduced disease onset, the estimated gross savings in medical expenditures across the programs would be $892 to $1342 after 1 year, and cumulative estimated gross medical savings would be $2963 to $4346 after 3 years and $5221 to $7756 after 5 years. In addition, high program engagement was associated with greater health and economic benefits.

Increased S1P can lead to tissue fibrosis that is also one of the pathways for developing diabetic cardiomyopathy. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) increase S1P in cells. The study is aimed at using aminoguanidine (AG) as an AGEs blocker drug to prevent diabetic cardiomyopathy. <i>Materials and methods.</i> 210 rats were enrolled in the study. Diabetes mellitus type-2 was induced, and rats were divided into AG treated diabetic and nondiabetic groups. The heart histology was assessed with Masson's trichrome and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Cardiac function was measured with transthoracic echocardiography. S1P level and SphK1 gene expression were measured by western-blot and RT-qPCR, respectively. Results showed that S1P level increases in diabetes, and its augmentation in cardiac tissue with K6PC-5 leads to cardiac fibrosis. 50 and 200 mg/kg of AG prevented cardiac fibrosis, but 100 mg/kg had no significant preventive effect. AG suppressed the SphK1 gene expression and reduced the fibrotic effect of S1P. AG preserved cardiac function by keeping ejection fraction and fractional shortening within the normal range in diabetic rats. AG has a suppressor effect on SphK1 gene expression besides its AGEs blocker role. AG is a potential drug to use in diabetic patients for preventing the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Other drugs that have AGEs or S1P blocker effects are a good choice for diabetic cardiomyopathy prevention.",Cardiovascular therapeutics,2022-,"Heydari AH, Fathi M, Heydari S, Heidari ME",4,1538,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Functionally, circRNAs have been elucidated to soak up microRNAs (miRNAs) and RNA binding proteins (RBPs), serve as protein scaffolds, maintain mRNA stability, and regulate gene transcription and translation. Notably, circRNAs are strongly implicated in the regulation of β-cell functions, insulin resistance, adipocyte functions, inflammation as well as oxidative stress via acting as miRNA sponges and RBP sponges. Basic and clinical studies have demonstrated that aberrant alterations of circRNAs expressions are strongly associated with the initiation and progression of diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications.

Of the 1709 patients without a previous diagnosis of DM, 1092 (67%) patients had either an FPG or HbA1c recorded, of which 441 (41%) met criteria for pre-diabetes and 97 (9%) met criteria for probable diabetes, corresponding to 19% and 4% of the entire cohort, respectively. Patients with HF and diabetes were more often treated with diuretics and beta blockers compared with non-DM patients (64% vs 42%, p<0.001 and 88% vs 83%, p<0.001, respectively). There was no difference in DM treatment between HF phenotypes. DM and pre-diabetes are common in this HF population with 50% of patients having either known DM, probable DM or pre-diabetes. Patients with HF and DM are more often treated with common HF medications.

31917119,Prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in patients with diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"We aimed to determine pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in patients with diabetes and to explore the impacts of research variables on prevalence estimates. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and Scopus from onset up to July 2018 to identify articles investigating the prevalence of DPN. Random-effects models were used to calculate the pooled prevalence of DPN. The heterogeneity of the study was estimated with the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. The publication bias was described by Egger's test and funnel plot. A total of 29 studies with a total of 50,112 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that the pooled prevalence of DPN was 30% (95% confidence interval, CI 25-34%). The pooled prevalence of DPN among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus was higher than patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (31.5%, 95% CI 24.4-38.6% vs 17.5%, 95% CI 4.8-30.2%). The pooled prevalence of DPN of studies involving a mixed type of diabetes mellitus was 24.8% (95% CI 13.1-36.5%, I<sup>2</sup>=99.1%).

36924001,Continuing the quality improvement of an electronic personal health record and interactive website for people with diabetes in Scotland (My Diabetes My Way).,"eHealth applications have the potential to enable patients to take more control over managing their own health, helping to delay and prevent complications. My Diabetes My Way (MDMW) is an electronic personal health record/educational platform available to people with diabetes in Scotland. This study aims to assess user experience with respect to demographic subgroups, examine effectiveness of previous improvements made to the platform and inform its ongoing development. All active MDMW users (22,665) were invited to take part in a questionnaire combining Likert scale and free-response items relating to system utility. Likert responses were used to generate a 'utility score'. This was used in regression analyses to determine predictors of system utility scoring. Free-response answers were analysed thematically and themes were generated. A total of 4713 (21%) MDMW users responded to the questionnaire. Most agreed that MDMW helps them to track changes over time, prepare for face-to-face consultations, remember information discussed in consultations and reduced the need to contact their general practitioner. Free-response answers showed that users valued earlier enhancements made to the site (e.g. linking Fitbit data), and highlighted areas needing further improvement. Evidence of the 'digital divide' was seen in respondent demographics, and some users mentioned 'lack of digital skills' as a barrier to engaging with the platform. User experience of MDMW was positive. Users agreed with statements that MDMW facilitates diabetes self management. Several areas of potential improvement were identified, including linking more wearable device data, and assisting/directing users to gain the digital skills required to engage fully with MDMW.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2023-Jul,"Shields C, Conway NT, Allardice B, Wake DJ, Cunningham SG",5,1758,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This was a cross-sectional analysis of participants with diabetes and poor glycemic control in an ongoing trial (n = 353). We compared the prevalence of unmet needs, self-care behaviors, and diabetes outcomes in successive cohorts of enrollees surveyed pre-pandemic (prior to March 11, 2020, n = 182), in the early stages of the pandemic (May-September, 2020, n = 75), and later (September 2020-January 2021, n = 96) stratified by income and gender. Adjusted multivariable regression models were used to examine trends. More participants with low income reported food insecurity (70% vs. 83%, p < 0.05) and needs related to access to blood glucose supplies (19% vs. 67%, p < 0.05) during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels. In adjusted models among people with low incomes, the odds of housing insecurity increased among participants during the early pandemic months compared with participants pre-pandemic (OR 20.2 [95% CI 2.8-145.2], p < 0.01). A1c levels were better among participants later in the pandemic than those pre-pandemic (β = -1.1 [95% CI -1.8 to -0.4], p < 0.01), but systolic blood pressure control was substantially worse (β = 11.5 [95% CI 4.2-18.8, p < 0.001). Adults with low-incomes and diabetes were most impacted by the pandemic. A1c may not fully capture challenges that people with diabetes are facing to manage their condition; systolic blood pressures may have worsened and problems with self-care may forebode longer-term challenges in diabetes control.",Primary care diabetes,2022-Feb,"Patel MR, Zhang G, Leung C, Song PXK, Heisler M, Choe HM, Mehdipanah R, Shi X, Resnicow K, Rajaee G, Piette JD",11,1695,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36253327,Estimating willingness to pay for diabetes complications.,"Maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for a health benefit is connected to perceived value. This two-center study aims to analyse diabetic patients' WTP for obtaining a specific preventive treatment package to reduce severe diabetic complications and determine the factors that impact this value. This cross-sectional research included 557 diabetics from two cities in Iran. The WTP for a preventative package minimising major diabetes complications (cardiovascular, renal, ocular, and diabetic foot) by 50% and 100% was tested using eight scenarios. The Diabetes Attitude Scoring Questionnaire (DAS-3) was used to examine patient attitudes toward diabetes. To determine WTP, a two-stage hurdle method was used. The level of significance was fixed to 0.05. Around 80% of 557 people interviewed (mean age 47.54) stated they wanted to pay for a diabetes prevention package. This package's WTP varied from 169.4 to $374.5 depending on the complication and degree of risk reduction. The largest value diabetic patients willing to pay for preventative packages that reduce the chance of blindness was reported, while the lowest cost was stated for the diabetic foot. WTP is influenced by wealth, location of study, marital status, and attitude toward special training, but not by the type of diabetes, inpatient or outpatient setting, or the complications diabetes patients are impacted by. Patients' diabetes attitudes were mainly negative. The score of the attitude of patients towards diabetes was generally suboptimal. Most diabetic patients were willing to pay for a preventive package and this value was not affected by the type of diabetes and its severity. Our research found that diabetic individuals are willing to pay the most for a preventative package that reduces the chance of blindness, and the least for diabetic foot care. WTP can help health officials allocate resources and manage budgets. The attitude of diabetic patients toward diabetes still needs further interventional research, however.",Primary care diabetes,2022-Dec,"Ghahramani S, Sepehrpoor M, Kazerooni AR, Jahromi AT, Khoshsoroor D, Barzegar D, Seifooripour R, Moradi N, Roodsarabi F, Manzouri A, Sayari M",11,2003,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Data from 175,628 individuals with diabetes in the Health Improvement Network were used to assess the risk of STDR across Townsend Deprivation Index quantiles using Cox proportional hazard regression. Among individuals with T1D, the risk of STDR was three times higher (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.67, 95% CI 1.05-7.78) in the most deprived quintile compared with the least deprived quintile. In T2D, the most deprived quintile had a 28% higher risk (aHR 1.28; 95% CI 1.15-1.43) than the least deprived quintile. Increasing socioeconomic deprivation is associated with a higher risk of developing STDR in people with diabetes.

32250529,Using RWE research to extend clinical trials in diabetes: An example with implications for the future.,"Although randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) are seen as the gold standard for evidence in clinical medicine, a number of considerations are increasing the use of real-world data (RWD) to generate evidence. A series of methodological challenges must be overcome in order for such real-world evidence (RWE) to gain acceptance. In diabetes, RWE faces some particular issues that have limited its development. As the natural history of diabetes progresses, patients' disease changes over time and treatments will be modified as a result. This evolving disease and treatment pattern requires application of methods that account for such changes over time. Research developing RWE in diabetes and other conditions has sometimes been subject to important biases, and researchers should be aware of, and take steps to mitigate potential for bias in order to enhance the evidence produced. We review a RWE study that replicated and extended evidence provided by a RCT regarding the effects of weekly exenatide relative to basal insulin (glargine or detemir) to illustrate a potential application of RWE. This study observed a 0.7% decrease in HbA1C for weekly exenatide relative to a 0.5% decrease in HbA1C for the comparator along with a 2 kg weight loss for weekly exenatide relative to a 0.25 kg weight gain, effects that were close to those from the RCT. Further, the RWE study was able to extend results to patient populations that were not well represented in the RCT. Despite numerous challenges, RWE can be used to complement evidence from RCTs.","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2020-Apr,"Seeger JD, Nunes A, Loughlin AM",3,1546,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

38719663,Relationship between fibrosis-4 score and microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most prevalent chronic liver disease globally and is linked to augmented susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular disease, and microvascular complications inherent to DM, such as nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) scoring system, a noninvasive tool, is useful for predicting the extent of liver fibrosis across diverse pathologies. This study aimed to assess the potential predictive role of FIB-4 scores in microvascular complications associated with diabetes. The medical records of patients with type 2 DM admitted to our endocrinology clinic between February 2019 and December 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Parameters including demographic attributes, fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, thrombocyte levels, and microvascular complications were recorded. The FIB-4 score was computed, and patients were categorized based on these scores (<1.3 and ≥ 1.3). The analysis included 312 patients with a median age of 60 (50-68 years); 39.7 % were men. The median duration of diabetes was 10 years (5-20 years), and the median FIB-4 score was 0.93 (0.63-1.34). Neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy were observed in 50.6 %, 31.4 %, and 34 % of the patients, respectively. Although the FIB-4 score did not differ significantly between patients with and without neuropathy or retinopathy, patients with nephropathy exhibited higher FIB-4 scores. Notably, patients with FIB-4 scores ≥ 1.3 demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of nephropathy. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that higher FIB-4 scores were significantly associated with an increased risk of nephropathy. The FIB-4 score is a cost-effective and straightforward tool with potential applicability in predicting nephropathy in individuals with type 2 DM.",Arab journal of gastroenterology : the official publication of the Pan-Arab Association of Gastroenterology,2024-Aug,"Erdogan BT, Tam AA, Baser H, Cuhaci Seyrek FN, Polat SB, Ersoy R, Topaloglu O, Cakir B",8,1893,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34319011,Emerging Targets in Type 2 Diabetes and Diabetic Complications.,"Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic, chronic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and elevated blood glucose levels. Although a large drug portfolio exists to keep the blood glucose levels under control, these medications are not without side effects. More importantly, once diagnosed diabetes is rarely reversible. Dysfunctions in the kidney, retina, cardiovascular system, neurons, and liver represent the common complications of diabetes, which again lack effective therapies that can reverse organ injury. Overall, the molecular mechanisms of how type 2 diabetes develops and leads to irreparable organ damage remain elusive. This review particularly focuses on novel targets that may play role in pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Further research on these targets may eventually pave the way to novel therapies for the treatment-or even the prevention-of type 2 diabetes along with its complications.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2021-Sep,"Demir S, Nawroth PP, Herzig S, Ekim Üstünel B",4,908,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This study was based on the 1999-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database and included 6,891 patients with DM for cross-sectional analysis. Multivariate adjusted models and restricted cubic spline (RCS) models were employed to assess the association between the insulin resistance index and the risk of DN. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the impact of different population characteristics. The results indicated that higher quartiles of METS-IR, TyG, TG/HDL, and TyG-BMI were associated with a significantly increased risk of DN. After adjusting for multiple covariates, including gender, age, and race, the associations between these indices and the risk of DN remained significant, with corresponding odds ratios (ORs) of 1.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29-1.76), 2.06 (95% CI: 1.77-2.40), 1.61 (95% CI: 1.38-1.88), and 1.57 (95% CI: 1.35-1.84), with all P-values less than 0.001. RCS analysis indicated a nonlinear relationship between these indices and the risk of DN. The TyG index exhibited a highly consistent association with the risk of DN in all models. Non-insulin-based insulin resistance indices are significantly associated with the risk of DN. The TyG index is a superior tool for assessing the risk of DN. These indices can assist in identifying patients at risk of DN, thereby enabling the implementation of more effective preventive and therapeutic strategies.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,"Zhang F, Han Y, Mao Y, Li W",4,1642,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Admission to residential aged care (RAC) can create many interruptions to usual food choices and diabetes self-management, and we know little about the concerns of the emerging ageing population. This is a qualitative study employing focus groups and inductive thematic analysis involving 18 older adults with diabetes between the ages of 60 and 88, living in their own homes within an Australian city. Focus groups were recruited on a sequential basis and progressively analysed using an inductive process until data saturation was reached. Focus groups were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim for thematic analysis. Three key themes were generated: autonomy, individualised dietary management and the food service system. Older adults speculated that they would want a collaborative approach to maintain their health in ageing and to self-manage their diabetes while feasible. Participants wanted autonomy over food choices, flexible meal timings and quality meals. There was a significant anxiety that aged care staff and existing food service systems in RAC could not support these preferences. Community-dwelling older adults with diabetes would highly value aged care services that facilitated autonomy, individualised nutrition support and flexibility, but feared this will not be feasible. The introduction of new diabetes and RAC guidelines may require an implementation plan to include the full food service system, from staff education to meal preparation, ordering and service.",Australasian journal on ageing,2022-Sep,"Farrer O, Miller M, Yaxley A, Walton K",4,1632,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Prevalence of diabetic nephropathy, and retinopathy, in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is declining, but it is not known if this is true also for diabetic neuropathy. To investigate the relationship between large fibre diabetic neuropathy and other diabetic complications. Neuropathy, defined here as large fibre neuropathy, was assessed by measuring vibration perception thresholds at four different frequencies on the sole of the foot, using a standard VibroSense Meter and/or neuropathic symptoms, in 599 individuals with T1DM. Retinopathy status was graded using the International Clinical Disease Severity Scale. Grade of albuminuria and previous history of any macrovascular complications were registered. Diabetic individuals without retinopathy had similar vibration thresholds as age- and gender-matched control participants without diabetes, whereas those without microalbuminuria had higher thresholds than controls. Two individuals out of 599 (0.3%) had microalbuminuria, but not retinopathy or neuropathy, and 12/134 (9%) without retinopathy had signs of neuropathy. Totally 119/536 (22%) of the patients without microalbuminuria had neuropathy. Vibration thresholds increased with the rising severity of retinopathy and grade of albuminuria. In a multinomial logistic regression analysis, neuropathy was associated with retinopathy (OR 2.96 [1.35-6.49], p=0.007), nephropathy (OR 6.25 [3.21-12.15]; p=6.7×10-8) and macrovascular disease (OR 2.72 [1.50-4.93], p=0.001). Despite recent changes in the incidence of diabetic complications, the onset of large fibre neuropathy follows that of retinopathy but precedes the onset of nephropathy in T1DM.","Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association",2023-Apr,"Lindholm E, Ekman L, Elgzyri T, Lindholm B, Löndahl M, Dahlin L",6,1713,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Library, Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Database, Google Scholar, and PROSPERO were searched from inception to 2018. Studies published in English evaluating the effect of pharmacist interventions on diabetes outcomes were included. Two independent reviewers were involved in screening of titles and abstracts, selection of studies, and methodological quality assessment. Seven SRs were included in the study. Three of them included only randomized controlled trials, while the rest involved other study designs. Educational interventions by clinical pharmacists within the healthcare team were the most common types of interventions reported across all SRs. Pharmacist's interventions compared to usual care resulted in favorable significant improvements in hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>), fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, body mass index, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein and triglycerides in more than 50% of the SRs. Improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> was the mostly reported clinical outcome of pharmacist intervention in the literature (reported in six SRs). Pharmacist's interventions led to significant cost-saving ($8-$85,000 per person per year), cost-utility, and cost-benefit (benefit-to-cost ratio range from 1:1 to 8.5:1) versus usual care. Pharmacist's interventions improved patients' quality of life (QoL) in three SRs; however, no conclusion can be drawn due to the use of diverse QoL assessment tools. Most SRs support the benefit of pharmacist care on diabetes-related clinical, humanistic, and economic outcomes in primary care settings. Improvements in diabetes outcomes can significantly reduce the burden of diabetes on healthcare system. Hence, the incorporation of pharmacists into multidisciplinary diabetes care teams is beneficial and should be strongly considered by clinicians and health policymakers.",Primary care diabetes,2020-Oct,"Abdulrhim S, Sankaralingam S, Ibrahim MIM, Awaisu A",4,2201,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

For over 40 years, glucose biosensors have been used for diabetes management. Measurement of blood glucose is an indirect method for calculating the insulin administration dosage, which is critical for insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Research and development efforts aiming towards continuous-insulin-monitoring biosensors in combination with existing glucose biosensors are expected to offer a more accurate estimation of insulin sensitivity, regulate insulin dosage and facilitate progress towards development of a reliable artificial pancreas, as an ultimate goal in diabetes management and personalised medicine. Conventional laboratory analytical techniques for insulin detection are expensive and time-consuming and lack a real-time monitoring capability. On the other hand, biosensors offer point-of-care testing, continuous monitoring, miniaturisation, high specificity and sensitivity, rapid response time, ease of use and low costs. Current research, future developments and challenges in insulin biosensor technology are reviewed and assessed.

36722309,Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state and cerebral thrombophlebitis in paediatrics: A case report.,"Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) is a known complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus; however, carbonated carbohydrate fluid intake may precipitate a more severe presentation of type 1 diabetes mellitus with hyperosmolar state. The management of these patients is not easy and can lead to severe complications such as cerebral venous thrombosis. We present the case of a 21-month-old boy admitted for consciousness disorders revealing a hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state on a new-onset type 1 diabetes and who developed cerebral venous thrombosis. Emergency physicians should be aware of HHS in order to start the appropriate treatment as early as possible and to monitor the potential associated acute complications. This case highlights the importance of decreasing very gradually the osmolarity in order to avoid cerebral complications. Cerebral venous thrombosis in HHS paediatric patients is rarely described, and it is important to recognize that not all episodes of acute neurological deterioration in HHS or diabetic ketoacidosis are caused by cerebral oedema.","Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism",2023-Mar,"Injeyan M, Baron S, Lauzier B, Gaillard-Le Roux B, Denis M",5,1075,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

In addition to being a leading cost of kidney failure, diabetes causes a host of secondary hyperglycemic-related complications including gastroparesis and orthostatic hypotension. While pancreas transplantation has been established as an effective treatment for diabetes, providing long-term normoglycemia in recipients, the secondary complications of diabetes mellitus persist complicating the post-operative course of an otherwise successful pancreas transplantation. This review describes the mechanism and impact of diabetic gastroparesis and orthostatic hypotension in the post-operative course of pancreas transplant patients and analyzes the various treatment modalities, based on current data and extensive experience at our institution, to treat these respective complications. While gastroparesis and orthostatic hypotension remain challenging post-operative conditions, the establishment of institutional protocols and step-up treatment algorithms can help define more effective therapies.",Clinical transplantation,2021-May,"Cerise A, Chen JM, Powelson JA, Lutz AJ, Fridell JA",5,1146,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This study assesses the extent of screening for DM complications among individuals with type 2 DM attending primary health facilities in rural Eastern Cape (EC), SA. The study adopted a descriptive, cross-sectional design and obtained data from 372 individuals with type 2 diabetes attending six selected primary healthcare centres (PHCs) in two EC districts. Demographic and clinical data were obtained through questionnaire-based interviews and reviews of medical records. We assessed the extent of screening for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), fasting lipogram, eye examination, foot examination and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the past year. Participants mean age was 62 (standard deviation [s.d.] ± 11) years, and their mean duration of diagnosis was 9 (s.d. ± 8) years. In the past year, HbA1c result was available for 71 (19.1%) of the participants; 60 (16.1%) had eGFR results, while only 33 (8.9%) had documented lipid results. In total, 52 (14.0%) had carried out eye examinations, while only 9 (2.3%) had undergone foot examinations in the past year. About two-thirds of the participants (59.9%) had not undergone any form of complication screening in the past year, and none had undergone the complete screening panel. The coverage of screening for DM complications was low across all indicators. Studies to understand barriers to and facilitators of DM complications screening at PHCs are required. Also, interventions to improve diabetes complication screening in the region are needed and should target the primary healthcare providers.",South African family practice : official journal of the South African Academy of Family Practice/Primary Care,2022-Apr,"Owolabi EO, Goon DT, Ajayi AI, Adeniyi OV, Chu KM",5,1715,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39546942,'Online boundary-work': How people with diabetes negotiate what counts as legitimate knowledge in Facebook peer support groups.,"People with chronic conditions such as diabetes use social media to interact with peers. While these online interactions allow them to exchange advice and gain insight into how others cope with their condition, concerns about 'misinformation' being shared are persistently raised, especially among medical professionals. Rather than assessing whether information shared on social media is 'correct' from a clinical perspective, we explore how people with diabetes negotiate what counts as legitimate knowledge as they interact in Facebook groups. Empirically, we draw on a six-month observation of interactions in two Danish Facebook groups for people with type 1 and 2 diabetes, including a data sample of 300 posts and 7797 comments. Observations were carried out in 2021. Guided by the concept of boundary-work (Gieryn, 1983), we analyse how members of the Facebook groups demarcate legitimate knowledge from what they deem illegitimate, enacted as they scrutinise peer advice and knowledge claims. We refer to this ongoing process as 'online boundary-work' and draw out three distinct negotiations, specifying how group members (a) recognise sharing of personal experiences as useful but do not necessarily accept them as valid forms of self-management advice, (b) support each other in evaluating medical issues but delegate certain treatment decisions and responsibility to professionals and (c) do not necessarily agree on the most accurate answer but mobilise scientific or professionally managed sources to legitimise or question claims. Our work contributes to the science and technology studies (STS) literature on how social media facilitates a collective space for people with chronic conditions to 'diagnose' issues in daily self-management and reflect on solutions, especially through sharing personal experiences. By demonstrating how these activities involve an ongoing, collective task of negotiating what counts as legitimate knowledge, we elucidate the effort people with diabetes put into upholding peer support groups as digital spaces for solidarity and knowledge useful to daily self-management. However, as we highlight, online boundary-work does not necessarily result in consensus, prevent certain types of advice from being shared or guarantee that answers are considered useful to members or 'correct' from a clinical perspective.",Social science & medicine (1982),2024-Dec,"Kjærulff EM, Nexø MA, Papoutsi C, Langstrup H",4,2359,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38812811,Combination therapy is it in the future for successfully treating peripheral diabetic neuropathy?,"In 2022, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 11.3% of the United States population, 37.3 million people, had diabetes and 38% of the population had prediabetes. A large American study conducted in 2021 and supported by many other studies, concluded that about 47% of diabetes patients have peripheral neuropathy and that diabetic neuropathy was present in 7.5% of patients at the time of diabetes diagnosis. In subjects deemed to be pre-diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance there was a wide range of prevalence estimates (interquartile range (IQR): 6%-34%), but most studies (72%) reported a prevalence of peripheral neuropathy ≥10%. There is no recognized treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) other than good blood glucose control. Good glycemic control slows progression of DPN in patients with type 1 diabetes but for patients with type 2 diabetes it is less effective. With obesity and type 2 diabetes at epidemic levels the need of a treatment for DPN could not be more important. In this article I will first present background information on the ""primary"" mechanisms shown from pre-clinical studies to contribute to DPN and then discuss mono- and combination therapies that have demonstrated efficacy in animal studies and may have success when translated to human subjects. I like to compare the challenge of finding an effective treatment for DPN to the ongoing work being done to treat hypertension. Combination therapy is the recognized approach used to normalize blood pressure often requiring two, three or more drugs in addition to lifestyle modification to achieve the desired outcome. Hypertension, like DPN, is a progressive disease caused by multiple mechanisms. Therefore, it seems likely as well as logical that combination therapy combined with lifestyle adjustments will be required to successfully treat DPN.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,Yorek M,1,1872,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Although, the pathogenic mechanisms behind the AF and DM comorbidity are still vague, it is now clear that DM precipitates AF occurrence. DM also affects the clinical course of established AF; it is associated with significant increase in the incidence of stroke, AF recurrence, and cardiovascular mortality. The impact of DM on AF management and prognosis has been adequately investigated. However, evidence on the relative impact of glycemic control using glycated hemoglobin levels is scarce. This review assesses up-to-date literature on the association between DM and AF. It also highlights the usefulness of glycated hemoglobin measurement for the prediction of AF and AF-related adverse events. Additionally, this review evaluates current anti-hyperglycemic treatment in the context of AF, and discusses AF-related decision-making in comorbid DM.

35644783,A Scoping Review of Foot Screening in Adults With Diabetes Mellitus Across Canada.,"Regular foot screening by a knowledgeable health-care provider is the cornerstone of ulcer and amputation prevention in people with diabetes. However, information on foot screening practices among Canadians with diabetes remains sparse. Therefore, we sought to synthesize available data on the frequency and approach to diabetic foot screening across Canada. We conducted a scoping review by searching MEDLINE and Embase databases, alongside a grey literature search, for both English- and French-language reports. Data on patients' demographics, setting as well as the frequency of and approach to foot screening were abstracted. Title and abstract screening, full-text review and data abstraction were conducted in duplicate, with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. The search yielded 21 reports including information on diabetic foot screening practices in Canada. In a consolidated study sample of 13,388 Canadians with diabetes, 7,277 (53%) reported receiving a foot examination by a health-care provider at least once in the past year. The majority of reports did not provide information on the demographics of patients being screened or details on the approach to foot screening. No report mentioned the use of a triage algorithm applied to the results of foot screening. In this work, we identified the limited frequency and uncertain quality of diabetic foot screening across Canada.

38714097,Incremental Healthcare Costs of Diabetes Mellitus in a Middle-Income Country Using Administrative Healthcare Data.,"To estimate the incremental medical cost of diabetes mellitus using information from administrative databases in Colombia. We carried out a retrospective cohort study with administrative health databases from Colombian population affiliated in the contributory health insurance scheme. We used an operative definition to select the cohort with diabetes. Incremental cost and cost ratio of diabetes were estimated using an inverse probability weighting of treatment approach to find the causal effect of having the disease. Weights were calculated by a propensity score method using a Random Forest model. The flexibility of this machine learning algorithm allows to have a better specification and bias reduction. Additionally, we reported incremental costs and cost ratios with confidence intervals using bootstrapping and analyzed costs by age groups and complications associated with diabetes. The estimated prevalence of diabetes was 2834 per 100 000 cases, in 2018. The group with diabetes was comprised 634 015 people and the control group 1 524 808. The calculated annual direct medical cost was $860, for which the incremental cost was $493 and the cost ratio 2.34. The incremental annual cost for some type of complication ranges from $1239 to $2043, renal complication being the most expensive. Incremental cost by age groups ranges from $347 to $878, being higher in younger people. Although the cost of diabetes in Colombia ranges among the global averages and is similar to other Latin-American countries, a greater incremental cost was found in patients with renal, circulatory, and neurologic complications.",Value in health regional issues,2024-Sep,"Castro-Villarreal S, Miksi S, Beltrán-Ostos A, Valencia CF",4,1622,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This study included 174,546 patients. The relationship between introducing chronic disease management in a region and the self-awareness of disease status was analyzed using a generalized estimating equation model. Poisson regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of policy adoption on medication adherence and risk-reduction behavior in patients with hypertension and diabetes. Finally, we used a difference-in-differences model to assess the net effectiveness of policies. Overall, regions with policies implemented showed more condition awareness and drug adherence than those without; however, this was only significant in regions where patients and physicians were incentivized. Risk-reduction behavior for patients with diabetes was higher in regions with policies implemented than in those without. The policy had a net effect of significantly and non-significantly increasing disease awareness and medication adherence, respectively. Chronic disease management policies at the primary care level that incentivized both patients and physicians improved patient self-management. However, the effects on patients with diabetes and hypertension differed.

39501153,Endothelial dysfunction in prediabetes and diabetes mellitus in patients with normal coronary arteries.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global health issue associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Endothelial dysfunction is a known precursor to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, and its role in the pathogenesis of DM complications is well-documented. There is limited information in the evaluation of endothelial function in prediabetic patients using flow-mediated dilation (FMD), and studies have not excluded patients with known atherosclerosis or coronary artery disease. Thus, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the endothelial functions using FMD from the brachial artery of DM and prediabetes patients who had normal coronary arteries. This study included 73 participants: 25 with DM, 25 with prediabetes, and 23 normoglycemic controls, all with normal coronary arteries on angiography. FMD measurements were conducted following established protocols, and statistical analysis was performed using standard methods to compare FMD levels among groups. The groups were comparable in clinical and demographic characteristics, except for fasting plasma glucose levels. Significant differences in FMD levels were observed: 10.1% in the DM group, 16.5% in the prediabetes group, and 14.8% in the control group (P = 0.004). Diabetic patients had significantly lower FMD levels than both prediabetic and normoglycemic individuals. No significant difference in FMD was found between prediabetic and control groups. Diabetic patients exhibited significant endothelial dysfunction compared to normoglycemic individuals, while prediabetic patients did not show similar dysfunction. These findings suggest a window of opportunity in the prediabetic stage for early intervention to prevent advanced endothelial dysfunction. ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN15351014. Registry date: 23/09/2024.

35993472,A Strategic Investigation on Diabetic Nephropathy; Its Conceptual Model and clinical Manifestations: A Review.,"Diabetes is a major health issue, and its complications can lead to various health problems. Nephropathy has been recognised since the 1930s, when Kimmelstiel and Wilson first reported the characteristic nodular glomerulosclerosis lesions in diabetic kidneys. Diabetic nephropathy (DN), commonly known as diabetic kidney disease, is a condition in which people with diabetes have excessive quantities of urine albumin excretion, diabetic glomerular lesions, and a reduction in their glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Type 1 diabetes (autoimmune -cell destruction and absolute insulin insufficiency), type 2 diabetes (relative insulin deficit and resistance), and others are the three forms of diabetes (e.g., pancreatic disease). Diabetes nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal failure worldwide. Much research has been conducted in both basic science and clinical therapies to enhance the understanding of the mechanism of diabetic nephropathy and expand available therapeutics. Diabetic nephropathy prevention continues to rely on screening for microalbuminuria and treating hyperglycemia. However, several studies suggest that managing diabetic kidney disease is more challenging. Despite comparable hyperglycemic management, some studies suggest that the incidence of renal problems varies by patient. As a result, there has been a great deal of interest in studying the inherent renal protective effects of various antihyperglycemic drugs. This study aims to provide information about the diabetic kidney disease conceptual model, pathogenesis, screening, and diagnosis. It will also address the treatment and prevention of diabetic nephropathy, focusing on comparing the mechanisms, safety profiles, and efficacy of different antihyperglycemic medications.",Current diabetes reviews,2023-,"Wal P, Tyagi S, Pal RS, Yadav A, Jaiswal R",5,1802,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

33121986,Implicating the effect of ketogenic diet as a preventive measure to obesity and diabetes mellitus.,"Obesity and diabetes are the two major metabolic complications linked with bad eating habits and the sedentary (lazy) lifestyle. In the worst-case situation, metabolic problems are a causative factor for numerous other conditions. There is also an increased demand to control the emergence of such diseases. Dietary and lifestyle improvements contribute to their leadership at an elevated level. The present review, therefore, recommends the use of the ketogenic diet (KD) in obesity and diabetes treatment. The KD involves a diet that replaces glucose sugar with ketone bodies and is effective in numerous diseases, such as metabolic disorders, epileptic seizures, autosomal dominant polycystic disease of the kidney, cancers, peripheral neuropathy, and skeletal muscle atrophy. A lot of high profile pathways are available for KD action, including sustaining the metabolic actions on glucose sugar, suppressing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, altering homeostasis of the systemic ketone bodies, contributing to lowering diabetic hyperketonemia, and others. The KD regulates the level of glucose sugar and insulin and can thus claim to be an effective diabetes approach.

35759735,The Diabetes Prevention Gap And Opportunities To Increase Participation In Effective Interventions.,"To understand the current state of prediabetes burden and treatment in the US, we examined recent trends in prediabetes prevalence, testing, and access to preventive resources. We estimated 13.5 percent prevalence of diagnosed prediabetes in the overall US adult population, using national survey data. Although prediabetes prevalence increased by 4.8 percentage points from 2010 to 2020, access to preventive resources remained low. The most effective intervention for diabetes prevention, known as the National Diabetes Prevention Program, remained woefully undersupplied and underused. There are only 2,098 National Diabetes Prevention Program-recognized providers nationally, and only 3 percent of adults with prediabetes have participated in the program. We suggest three actions to augment prevention efforts: increase payment for prevention interventions to avoid supply distortions, improve data integration and patient follow-up, and extend coverage and broaden access for preventive interventions. These actions, which would require policy-level changes, could lower the barriers to prevention.",Health affairs (Project Hope),2022-Jul,"Alva ML, Chakkalakal RJ, Moin T, Galaviz KI",4,1104,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33212375,Anti-inflammatory phytochemicals for the treatment of diabetes and its complications: Lessons learned and future promise.,"Diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2) and its various complications continue to place a huge burden on global medical resources, despite the availability of numerous drugs that successfully lower blood glucose levels. The major challenging issue in diabetes management is the prevention of various complications that remain the leading cause of diabetes-related mortality. Moreover, the limited long-term durability of monotherapy and undesirable side effects of currently used anti-diabetic drugs underlie the urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. Phytochemicals represent a rich source of plant-derived molecules that are of pivotal importance to the identification of compounds with therapeutic potential. In this review, we aim to discuss recent advances in the identification of a large array of phytochemicals with immense potential in the management of diabetes and its complications. Given that metabolic inflammation has been established as a key pathophysiological event that drives the progression of diabetes, we focus on the protective effects of representative phytochemicals in metabolic inflammation. This paper also discusses the potential of phytochemicals in the development of new drugs that target the inflammation in the management of diabetes and its complications.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2021-Jan,"Kong M, Xie K, Lv M, Li J, Yao J, Yan K, Wu X, Xu Y, Ye D",9,1296,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

38526612,A muscarinic receptor antagonist reverses multiple indices of diabetic peripheral neuropathy: preclinical and clinical studies using oxybutynin.,"Preclinical studies indicate that diverse muscarinic receptor antagonists, acting via the M<sub>1</sub> sub-type, promote neuritogenesis from sensory neurons in vitro and prevent and/or reverse both structural and functional indices of neuropathy in rodent models of diabetes. We sought to translate this as a potential therapeutic approach against structural and functional indices of diabetic neuropathy using oxybutynin, a muscarinic antagonist approved for clinical use against overactive bladder. Studies were performed using sensory neurons maintained in vitro, rodent models of type 1 or type 2 diabetes and human subjects with type 2 diabetes and confirmed neuropathy. Oxybutynin promoted significant neurite outgrowth in sensory neuron cultures derived from adult normal rats and STZ-diabetic mice, with maximal efficacy in the 1-100 nmol/l range. This was accompanied by a significantly enhanced mitochondrial energetic profile as reflected by increased basal and maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity. Systemic (3-10 mg/kg/day s.c.) and topical (3% gel daily) oxybutynin reversed paw heat hypoalgesia in the STZ and db/db mouse models of diabetes and reversed paw tactile allodynia in STZ-diabetic rats. Loss of nerve profiles in the skin and cornea of db/db mice was also prevented by daily topical delivery of 3% oxybutynin for 8 weeks. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled interventional trial was performed in subjects with type 2 diabetes and established peripheral neuropathy. Subjects received daily topical treatment with 3% oxybutynin gel or placebo for 6 months. The a priori designated primary endpoint, significant change in intra-epidermal nerve fibre density (IENFD) in skin biopsies taken before and after 20 weeks of treatments, was met by oxybutynin but not placebo. Secondary endpoints showing significant improvement with oxybutynin treatment included scores on clinical neuropathy, pain and quality of life scales. This proof-of-concept study indicates that muscarinic antagonists suitable for long-term use may offer a novel therapeutic opportunity for treatment of diabetic neuropathy.

33668000,Nanotherapeutic approach to treat diabetic foot ulcers using tissue-engineered nanofiber skin substitutes: A review.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease associated with long-term multisystem complications, among which nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are recognized as major cause of morbidity and mortality. Treating DFUs with surgical procedures such as synthetic or biological skin grafts or skin substitutes has several limitations, where none of the currently available skin substitutes is ideal. OVID/Medline and PubMed databases were searched using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) or Title/Abstract words (""diabetic foot ulcers"", ""skin substitutes"", and ""nanofibers""), to identify published research studies on DFUs and nanofibers. Electrospinning nanotechnology is being used in the biomedical field to produce polymeric nanofibers impregnated with drugs for wound healing, burns and diabetic ulcers. Those nanofibers also enable seeding of cells into them and culturing them in vitro to synthesize tissue-like structures. Knowing the advantages of generating patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and organoids in three-dimension (3D), including skin organoids, it is worth mingling these technologies to develop tissue-engineered biological skin substitutes. Nanofiber-skin substitutes hold promise for treatment of patients suffering from DFUs and inspire novel strategies that could be applied to other organ systems as well, introducing a new era of ""regenerative and personalized medicine"".",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2021-,"Bahmad HF, Poppiti R, Alexis J",3,1432,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36792169,"Knowledge, attitude, and practice toward pre-diabetes among the public, patients with pre-diabetes and healthcare professionals: a systematic review.","The prevalence of pre-diabetes is increasing globally, affecting an estimated 552 million people by 2030. While lifestyle interventions are the first line of defense against progression toward diabetes, information on barriers toward pre-diabetes management and how to overcome these barriers are scarce. This systematic review describes the publics' and healthcare professionals' knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) toward pre-diabetes and determines the barriers toward pre-diabetes management. A systematic search for studies examining KAP towards pre-diabetes was conducted in six databases from inception to September 2022. Studies that quantitatively assessed at least two KAP elements using questionnaires were included. The quality of studies was assessed using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Barriers and enablers were identified and mapped onto the Capability, Motivation, and Behaviour model to identify factors that influence behavior change. Twenty-one articles that surveyed 8876 participants were included in this review. Most of the reviews (n=13) were directed to healthcare professionals. Overall, positive attitudes toward diabetes prevention efforts were observed, although there were still knowledge deficits and poor behavior toward pre-diabetes management. Barriers and enablers were detected at patients (eg, goals and intention), healthcare professionals (eg, clinical judgement) and system (eg, access and resources) levels. The use of different survey instruments to assess KAP prevented a head-to-head comparison between studies. Most studies conducted among patients were from middle-income countries, while among healthcare professionals (HCPs) were from high-income countries, which may produce some biasness. Nevertheless, the development of pre-diabetes intervention should focus on: (1) increasing knowledge on pre-diabetes and its management; (2) imparting practical skills to manage pre-diabetes; (3) providing resources for lifestyle management; (4) improving the accessibility of lifestyle management programs; and (5) other HCPs and human support to pre-diabetes management.",BMJ open diabetes research & care,2023-Feb,"Teoh KW, Ng CM, Chong CW, Bell JS, Cheong WL, Lee SWH",6,2171,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38065628,Post-transplant diabetes mellitus: Findings in nutritional status and body composition.,"Weight gain and changes in body composition are associated with the onset of diabetes after kidney transplantation, and detailing these changes can help prevent this situation. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation and changes in the nutritional status and body composition in patients with diabetes one year from surgery. This survey was a single-center, prospective cohort study. Twenty-nine patients over 18 years old who underwent isolated kidney transplantation, without diabetes, were included and followed up for one year. At hospital discharge after transplantation and one year later, anthropometric (weight, height and abdominal circumference), body composition (electrical bioimpedance), routine biochemical and dietary intake assessments were performed. Most of the patients were male (75%), and the mean age was 48.0±11.8 years old. In the first-year post-surgery 27.6% of patients had DM and the diagnosis was made, on average, 4 months after transplantation. The group with diabetes had, from the beginning to the end of the study, greater weight and body fat, especially abdominal fat. The non-diabetic group, after one year, showed an increase in phase angle, body weight and body masses, more pronounced of fat-free mass, when compared with fat mass gain. Both groups showed weight gain, but in the non-diabetic group these changes can be interpreted as an improvement in the nutritional profile. Metabolic abnormalities associated with immunosuppression and eating habits, combination that maintains increased the risk for diabetes for long time, keeping this group with priority in nutritional care.","Endocrinologia, diabetes y nutricion",2023-Dec,"Pereira Barretto L, Moreira Gomes P, Rossin Guidorizzi N, Moyses Neto M, Almeida Romao E, Garcia Chiarello P",6,1672,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The aim of the present work is to review the most up-to-date novelties in terms of CFRD diagnosis and therapy. This review is timely and relevant because it allows an update for the early and correct classification of glucose abnormalities in cystic fibrosis and because it favours an appropriate therapeutic approach. Confirm that Oral Glucose Tolerance Test is still the diagnostic gold standard despite the advent of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems; this latter is spreading very rapidly, however, to date, there is still no strong evidence to hypothesize the use of CGM for diagnostic purposes. CGM has indeed proven to be very useful in managing and guiding CFRD therapy. Tailored and personalized insulin therapy is still the recommended therapy for children and adolescents with CFRD, although nutritional intervention and oral hypoglycaemic treatment are equally important and efficacious. Finally CFTR modulators have allowed the increase of the life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients and have proven effective not only in improving the pulmonary function and the nutritional status but also the glucose control.",Current opinion in pediatrics,2023-Aug,"Schiaffini R, Pampanini V",2,1300,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This study aimed to explore perceptions of healthcare providers across Europe concerning 1) the impact of covid-19 on delivery of diabetes care; 2) impact of changes in diabetes care on experienced workload; 3) experiences with video consultation in diabetes care. Cross-sectional survey among healthcare providers in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Turkey, Ukraine and Sweden, with a focus on primary care. The survey was completed by 180 healthcare providers. During the COVID-19 pandemic 57.1% of respondents provided less diabetes care and 72.8% observed a negative impact on people with diabetes. More than half of respondents (61.9%) expressed worries to some extent about getting overloaded by work. Although the vast majority considered their work meaningful (85.6%). Almost half of healthcare providers (49.4%) thought that after the pandemic video-consultation could be blended with face-to-face contact. Less diabetes care was delivered and a negative impact on people with diabetes was observed by healthcare providers. Despite healthcare providers' feeling overloaded, mental wellbeing seemed unaffected. Video consultations were seen as having potential. Given the remaining covid-19 risks and from the interest of proactive management of people with diabetes, these findings urge for further exploration of incorporating video consultation in diabetes care.",Primary care diabetes,2023-Apr,"Van Grondelle SE, Van Bruggen S, Rauh SP, Van der Zwan M, Cebrian A, Seidu S, Rutten GEHM, Vos HMM, Numans ME, Vos RC",10,1431,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37963648,Patient-reported outcome measures in diabetes outpatient care: a scoping review.,"Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are increasingly used in clinical diabetes care to increase patient involvement and improve healthcare services. The objectives were to identify instruments used to measure PROs in outpatient diabetes clinics and to investigate the use of these PRO measures alongside the experiences of patients and healthcare personnel in a clinical setting. A scoping review was conducted according to the framework of Arksey and O'Malley with scoping searches of Cinahl, EMBASE, Medline and Health and Psychosocial Instruments. Studies reporting on adults with diabetes in a clinical setting where the PRO measure response directly affected patient care were eligible for inclusion. In total, 35 197 citations were identified, of which 7 reports presenting 4 different PRO measures were included in the review. All four of the included items measured psychosocial aspects of diabetes, and three included elements of the Problem Areas in Diabetes scale. All the patients were satisfied with the use of PRO measures in clinical care, whereas the level of satisfaction among healthcare personnel with PRO measures varied within and among studies. The limited number of eligible studies in this review suggests that research on PRO measures for diabetes outpatient care is scarce. Patients welcome the opportunity to express their concerns through the systematic collection of PRO measures, and some healthcare personnel value the broader insight that PRO measures provide into the impact of diabetes on patients' lives. However, the heterogeneity among services and among patients challenges the implementation of PRO measures. Research is needed to explore how PRO measures in clinical outpatient care affect healthcare personnel workflow. https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/46AHC.",BMJ open diabetes research & care,2023-Nov,"Torbjørnsen A, Jensen AL, Singstad T, Weldingh NM, Holmen H",5,1803,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The aims of this systematic review are to investigate the evidence for the diagnosis and subsequent treatment, to clarify the objective methods for determining remission and to evaluate the evidence for the prevention of re-activation in people with CNO, DM and intact skin. We performed a systematic review based on clinical questions in the following categories: Diagnosis, Treatment, Identification of Remission and Prevention of Re-Activation in people with CNO, DM and intact skin. Included controlled studies were assessed for methodological quality and key data from all studies were extracted. We identified 37 studies for inclusion in this systematic review. Fourteen retrospective and observational studies relevant to the diagnosis of active CNO with respect to clinical examination, imaging and blood laboratory tests in patients with DM and intact skin were included. We identified 18 studies relevant to the treatment of active CNO. These studies included those focused on offloading (total contact cast, removable/non-removable knee high devices), medical treatment and surgical treatment in the setting of active CNO. Five observational studies were identified regarding the identification of remission in patients who had been treated for active CNO. We did not identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria for the prevention of re-activation in patients with DM and intact skin who had been previously treated for active CNO and were in remission.

The reported incidence of NODAT varies from 14 to 37% in renal transplant recipients worldwide; however, NODAT is yet to be studied in the Irish renal transplant population. Primary aims of this project were to estimate the incidence, to determine associated risk factors and to assess the long-term consequences of NODAT on graft survival and patient survival in the Irish renal transplant population. Retrospective data collection of 415 renal transplant recipients over a 12-year period was performed to record presence of NODAT, patient characteristics and perioperative management. Preoperative screening was reviewed in a subgroup of patients to determine concordance with the International Consensus Guidelines. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier survival functions estimating NODAT detection over time, graft and patient survival. Risk factor association was determined using Cox proportional-hazards models. NODAT incidence was 10.2% in the first 5 years of post-transplant. Risk factors for developing NODAT were recipient age and body weight. Risk of NODAT was highest in the first year of post-transplant and conferred decreased patient survival; however, it did not significantly affect graft survival. Only seven patients of a subgroup of 21 patients who developed NODAT had preoperative testing for diabetes. NODAT incidence in the Irish renal transplant population is slightly below international figures.

36604111,<i>TXNIP</i> DNA methylation is associated with glycemic control over 28 years in type 1 diabetes: findings from the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC) study.,"DNA methylation (DNAme) has been cross-sectionally associated with type 2 diabetes and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in the general population. However, longitudinal data and data in type 1 diabetes are currently very limited. Thus, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in an observational type 1 diabetes cohort to identify loci with DNAme associated with concurrent and future HbA1cs, as well as other clinical risk factors, over 28 years. Whole blood DNAme in 683 597 CpGs was analyzed in the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications study of childhood onset (<17 years) type 1 diabetes (n=411). An EWAS of DNAme beta values and concurrent HbA1c was performed using linear models adjusted for diabetes duration, sex, pack years of smoking, estimated cell type composition variables, and technical/batch covariates. A longitudinal EWAS of subsequent repeated HbA1c measures was performed using mixed models. We further identified methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) for significant CpGs and conducted a Mendelian randomization. DNAme at cg19693031 (Chr 1, <i>Thioredoxin-Interacting Protein</i> (<i>TXNIP</i>)) and cg21534330 (Chr 17, <i>Casein Kinase 1 Isoform Delta</i>) was significantly inversely associated with concurrent HbA1c. In longitudinal analyses, hypomethylation of cg19693031 was associated with consistently higher HbA1c over 28 years, and with higher triglycerides, pulse rate, and albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) independently of HbA1c. We further identified 34 meQTLs in <i>SLC2A1/SLC2A1-AS1</i> significantly associated with cg19693031 DNAme. Our results extend prior findings that <i>TXNIP</i> hypomethylation relates to worse glycemic control in type 1 diabetes by demonstrating the association persists over the long term. Additionally, the associations with triglycerides, pulse rate, and ACR suggest <i>TXNIP</i> DNAme could play a role in vascular damage independent of HbA1c. These findings strengthen potential for interventions targeting TXNIP to improve glycemic control in type 1 diabetes through its role in <i>SLC2A1</i>/glucose transporter 1-mediated glucose regulation.",BMJ open diabetes research & care,2023-Jan,"Miller RG, Mychaleckyj JC, Onengut-Gumuscu S, Orchard TJ, Costacou T",5,2135,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32613289,Importance of Identifying Novel Biomarkers of Microvascular Damage in Type 1 Diabetes.,"Microvascular complications of type 1 diabetes, which primarily include diabetic kidney disease, retinopathy, and neuropathy, are characterized by damage to the microvasculature of the kidney, retina, and neurons. The pathogenesis of these complications is multifactorial, and several pathways are implicated. These complications are often silent during their early stages, and once symptoms develop, there might be little to be done to cure them. Thus, there is a strong need for novel biomarkers to identify individuals at risk of microvascular complications at an early stage and guide the implementation of new therapeutic options for preventing their development and progression. Recent advancements in proteomics, metabolomics, and other 'omics' have led to the identification of several potential biomarkers of microvascular complications. However, biomarker discovery has met several challenges and, up to now, there are no new biomarkers that have been implemented into clinical practice.

To compare claims with diabetes specialists for youths with type 1 vs type 2 diabetes and the association between specialist claims with multidisciplinary and acute care utilization. This cross-sectional study used Optum Clinformatics Data Mart commercial claims. Individuals included in the study were youths younger than 19 years with type 1 or 2 diabetes as determined by a validated algorithm and prescription claims. Data were collected for youths with at least 80% enrollment in a commercial health plan from December 1, 2018, to December 31, 2019. Statistical analysis was performed from September 2022 to January 2024. The primary outcome was the number of ambulatory claims from an endocrine and/or diabetes physician or advanced practice clinician associated with a diabetes diagnosis code; secondary outcomes included multidisciplinary and acute care claims. Claims were analyzed for 4772 youths (mean [SD] age, 13.6 [3.7] years; 4300 [90.1%] type 1 diabetes; 472 [9.9%] type 2 diabetes; 2465 [51.7%] male; 128 [2.7%] Asian, 303 [6.4] Black or African American, 429 [9.0%] Hispanic or Latino, 3366 [70.5%] non-Hispanic White, and 546 [11.4%] unknown race and ethnicity). Specialist claims were lower in type 2 compared with type 1 diabetes (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.61 [95% CI, 0.52-0.72]; P < .001) in propensity score-weighted analyses. The presence of a comorbidity was associated with increased specialist claims for type 1 diabetes (IRR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.03-1.10]) and decreased claims for type 2 diabetes (IRR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.67-0.87]). Pooling diagnosis groups and adjusted for covariates, each additional specialist claim was associated with increased odds of a claim with a diabetes care and education specialist (odds ratio [OR], 1.31 [95% CI, 1.25-1.36]), dietitian (OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.09-1.19]), and behavioral health clinician (OR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.12-1.20]). For acute care claims, each additional specialist claim was associated with increased odds of admission (OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.11-1.24]) but not for emergency claims (OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.98-1.82]). This cross-sectional study found that youths with type 2 diabetes were significantly less likely to have specialist claims despite insurance coverage, indicating other barriers to care, which may include medical complexity.

39425096,Altered RBC deformability in diabetes: clinical characteristics and RBC pathophysiology.,"Reduced red blood cell deformability (RBCD) is associated with diabetic vascular complications, but early pathophysiological RBC changes and predictive demographic and clinical factors in populations with diabetes are unclear. An understanding of early diabetes-specific RBC changes associated with impaired RBCD is essential in investigating mechanisms that predispose to diabetic vascular complications. We conducted an outpatient cross-sectional study of participants in a well-controlled diabetes cohort (N81) and nondiabetic controls (N78) at the National Institutes of Health. First, between-group differences in RBCD measures were assessed with shear stress-gradient ektacytometry. Differences in structural RBC parameters were assessed using osmotic gradient ektacytometry and NaCl osmotic fragility. Functional RBC changes were assessed using hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation: p50. All shear-stress gradient RBCD measures were significantly altered in the diabetes cohort vs. nondiabetic controls, even after adjustment for confounding covariates (p < 0.001). Adjusted for diabetes-status and demographic factors, significant predictors of reduced RBCD included older age, Black race, male gender, hyperglycemia, and vascular complications (all p < 0.05). Reduced RBCD was also associated with aberrant osmotic-gradient parameters, with a left-shift on osmotic gradient profile indicative of dehydrated RBCs in diabetes. A structure-function relationship was observed with reduced RBCD associated with reduced osmotic fragility (P < 0.001) and increased hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation (P < 0.01). Findings suggest impaired RBCD incurs similar demographic and clinical risk factors as diabetic vascular disease, with early pathophysiological RBC changes indicative of disordered RBC hydration in diabetes. Findings provide strong evidence for disordered oxygen release as a functional consequence of reduced RBCD.

35619802,Integrated Management of Diabetes and Tuberculosis in Rural India - Results From a Pilot Study.,"The World Health Organization and International Union against Tuberculosis (TB) recommends screening patients with TB for Diabetes Mellitus (DM) at the initiation of treatment. There are few pilot studies which screen TB patients for DM, but none of them have documented the feasibility of managing TB patients with DM in the Indian healthcare setting. Operational research is needed to determine the best way to manage individuals with both conditions. This pilot study aimed to develop, and field test an integrated, multidisciplinary program addressing the management of individuals with TB and DM and other associated chronic conditions in the Indian primary healthcare setting. This pilot study used a randomized controlled trial design with mixed-methods evaluation and was conducted in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, a southern state of India. All the 120 patients newly diagnosed with TB from 10 participating villages were screened for DM and associated cardiovascular risk factors. Non-physician health workers were trained to follow-up patients for a period of 8 months to encourage treatment adherence, monitor treatment response including blood glucose levels and provide lifestyle advice. The intervention was well-accepted by the providers and patients. However, there were no statistically significant variations observed for mean blood glucose levels (mean [SD]: 5.3 [-23.3 to 33.8]) of patients for both intervention and control group participants in this feasibility study.

32115378,"Evaluation of the relationship among foot wound risk, foot self-care behaviors, and illness acceptance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.","Due to insufficient data in primary care, this study was designed to assess the influence of patient's foot self-care behaviors and illness acceptance on the risk of developing diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) in adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). This is a descriptive study with a clinical assessment element. Data were collected using a number of validated psychometric questionnaires that assess the participant's foot self care behavior, acceptance of Illness, symptoms and neuropathy. The study included 246 patients diagnosed with type 2 DM attending a designated family health center in Konya, Turkey. In the present study, there was a significant difference between DFSBS scores and gender and whether the patients resided in urban or rural areas (p < 0.05). A significant difference between AIS score and gender, educational status, social security, place of residence, and economic status of the participants was observed (p < 0.05). According to the results of regression analysis, gender, frequency of physician control visit (monthly), and foot care training predicted the DFSBS score, whereas gender, education, economic status, presence of other non-infectious diseases, hospitalization in the previous year, and OTNS results predicted the AIS score. Furthermore, the AIS and OTNS scores predicted the MNSI-Q score. In the family health centers, individuals who are at risk must be initially identified and efforts should be made to prevent complications and increase illness acceptance.",Primary care diabetes,2020-Oct,"Şahin S, Cingil D",2,1515,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33957141,Interdisciplinary assessment and diagnostic algorithm: The role of the diabetologist.,"In recent years, many studies have revealed the importance of heart failure (HF) development in type 2 diabetes (T2D), which increases the morbidity and mortality during the course of diabetes. In this context, it became important to emphasize the role of both cardiologists and diabetologists in the early diagnosis and further adequate treatment of HF in T2D. While HF appears in two major forms, with reduced or preserved ejection fraction (EF), namely HFrEF and HFpEF, it became important to define the optimal approach to the diagnostics. Regarding HFrEF, the role of cardiological methods remained dominant, while the complexity of early diagnosis requires nowadays more active participation of diabetologists. The absence of abundant symptoms and echocardiographic findings imposed the need for the use of risk markers based on metabolic variables and low-grade inflammation parameters. Following that unmet need, numerous studies have defined the possible relationship between metabolic variables in diabetes and the risk for HF. Moreover, attempts have been made to integrate biochemical and clinical parameters into risk score engines and some of them gave promising results. However, the follow-up studies in T2D subjects are needed to determine the clinical relevance of these new approaches.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,2021-Jun,Lalic NM,1,1304,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Patients who attended the Auckland Diabetes Centre (ADC) between July 2018 and July 2019 were invited via text message (SMS) to register their interest in being contacted for future health research projects and medical training. Consenting adults were enrolled in the Auckland Diabetes Centre Volunteer Database (ADCVD) and sent a survey on the acceptability of various types of research and factors influencing participation. Relationships between ADCVD enrolment and other variables were determined using Fisher's exact test. Qualitative data were coded to generate key themes using an inductive approach. Of 2,884 patients contacted, 527 were enrolled in the ADCVD (response rate: 18.3%); and of these, 176 completed surveys (response rate: 33.3%). Most respondents were NZ European (n=92, 52.3%), male (n=125, 70.6%), and from the least deprived areas (n=35, 19.9%). The type of research did not affect interest. Motivations to participate centred around a hope to improve their own diabetes and that of future generations.

32097907,Recent Epidemiological Status of Ocular and Other Major Complications Related to Diabetes Mellitus in Japan.,"To investigate the epidemiological status of diabetes mellitus (DM)-related complications in Japan. The subjects were 3.11 million Japanese individuals who were registered in the Japanese claim database between 2005 and 2014. Subjects with a diagnosis associated with codes related to DM and/or DM-related complications as classified by the International Classification of Diseases version 10 and those who were prescribed any therapeutic agents for DM were considered to have DM. The status of ocular, renal, and neural complications was investigated. A total of 66,923 patients with DM were included. The prevalence of subjects with DM was 3.8% in 2005 and 4.2% in 2014. The most frequent complication was diabetic retinopathy (23.6%, 95% CI: 21.7-25.5%), followed by diabetic nephropathy (14.8%, 95% CI: 14.0-15.6%) and diabetic neuropathy (4.9%, 95% CI: 4.5-5.3%). Among the subjects with ocular complications, 1.8% had proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 1.1% had diabetic macular edema (DME), 0.3% had neovascular glaucoma, and 1.5% had vitreous hemorrhage. Only DME significantly increased during the study period. The frequencies of the ocular and neural complications significantly decreased, while that of renal complications significantly increased during the study period. Ocular complications were the most common DM-related major complications in Japan. Notably, DME significantly increased in recent years.",Ophthalmologica. Journal international d'ophtalmologie.

37937649,"Awareness of the diagnosis, treatment, and control of diabetes mellitus in Brazil.","To estimate the proportions of awareness, treatment, and control of diabetes mellitus (DM) in the Brazilian adult population. This is a cross-sectional study, with data from a representative sample of the Brazilian population, taken from the National Health Survey(PNS 2014/2015). Outcomes were defined based on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements, self-reported DM diagnosis, and use of hypoglycemic agents or insulin. The proportion of DM awareness, treatment, and control was estimated according to sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, and access to health services, and their respective 95% confidence intervals. DM prevalence in the Brazilian population was of 8.6% (95%CI: 7.8-9.3): 68.2% (95%CI: 63.9-72.3) were aware of their diagnosis, 92.2% (95%CI: 88.6-94.7) of those who were aware were undergoing drug treatments, and, of these, 35.8% (95%CI: 30.5-41.6) had controlled HbA1c levels. The proportions of DM awareness, control, and treatment were lower in men aged 18 to 39 years, individuals with low education, without health insurance, and beneficiaries of the Bolsa Família program. Approximately one in ten Brazilians has DM. A little more than half of this population is aware of their diagnosis, a condition measured by HbA1c dosage and clinical diagnosis. Among those who know, the vast majority are undergoing drug treatments. However, less than half of these have their HbA1c levels controlled.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between GV metrics and the risk of developing DPN. Nine studies totaling 3,649 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. A significant association was found between increased GV, as indicated by metrics including standard deviation (SD) with OR and 95% CI of 2.58 (1.45-4.57), mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) with OR and 95% CI of 1.90 (1.01-3.58), mean of daily difference (MODD) with OR and 95% CI of 2.88 (2.17-3.81) and the incidence of DPN. Our findings support a link between higher GV and an increased risk of DPN in patients with diabetes. These findings highlight the potential of GV metrics as indicators for the development of DPN, advocating for their inclusion in diabetes management strategies to potentially mitigate neuropathy risk.

38265639,Yoga or Mindfulness on Diabetes: Scoping Review for Theoretical Experimental Framework.,"About one in 11 adults worldwide suffers from diabetic disease with constantly increasing prevalence; from the 529 million patients registered in 2021, the number of people with diabetes was predicted to rise to approximately 1.31 billion in 2050. In Italy, 5.9% of the population is diabetic, with a higher prevalence with increasing age and in the South of the country. Yoga and Mindfulness could represent a valid support for the care of diabetic subjects especially in a stressful caring context such as the Covid-19 pandemic. A scoping review was conducted to achieve the goals of the study. Yoga or Mindfulness interventions on diabetic subjects were specifically analyzed and qualitative-quantitative data collected in the selected randomized controlled trials were extensive for possible meta-analysis. The review was conducted by two independent practitioners and a third one was consulted in case of conflict. The PRISMA method was used for both the selection and reporting of the studies to be included. Specific PICOS and search strategies have been developed on PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO databases. Included in the review were: randomised controlled trials, full dissertation articles and papers in English with a time limit on May 31, 2022. The Review included 22 studies; 12 on Mindfulness, 9 on Yoga and one about both disciplines; among these, one studied patients with Type 1 Diabetes, 14 with Type 2 Diabetes, 6 with both and one with Gestational Diabetes. Only one paper studied adolescent subjects while the other 21 focused on a range of adult subjects. The studies showed that Yoga and Mindfulness have strong potential not only on stress management, but also on clinical-metabolic parameters. The recent Covid-19 pandemic has certainly redesigned a new way of treating and managing chronic diseases, such as diabetes. An increasingly fragile population, and with the growing need to reduce overall stress levels, could find alternative practices in Yoga and Mindfulness to support conventional therapies.",Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita,2024-,"Cangelosi G, Acito M, Grappasonni I, Nguyen CTT, Tesauro M, Pantanetti P, Morichetti L, Ceroni E, Benni A, Petrelli F",10,2030,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Although it is well-accepted that local inflammation leads to a progressive loss of functional beta cell mass that eventually causes the onset of the disease, the development of islet inflammation remains unclear. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the cell type-specific molecular response of primary human pancreatic cells exposed to an inflammatory environment. We identified a duct subpopulation presenting a unique proinflammatory signature among all pancreatic cell types.

36012395,Fast Tacrolimus Metabolism Does Not Promote Post-Transplant Diabetes Mellitus after Kidney Transplantation.,"Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) after kidney transplantation induced by tacrolimus is an important issue. Fast tacrolimus metabolism, which can be estimated by concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratio, is associated with increased nephrotoxicity and unfavorable outcomes after kidney transplantation. Herein, we elucidate whether fast tacrolimus metabolism also increases the risk for PTDM. Data from 596 non-diabetic patients treated with tacrolimus-based immunosuppression at the time of kidney transplantation between 2007 and 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. The median follow-up time after kidney transplantation was 4.7 years (IQR 4.2 years). Our analysis was complemented by experimental modeling of fast and slow tacrolimus metabolism kinetics in cultured insulin-producing pancreatic cells (INS-1 cells). During the follow-up period, 117 (19.6%) patients developed PTDM. Of all patients, 210 (35.2%) were classified as fast metabolizers (C/D ratio < 1.05 ng/mL × 1/mg). Fast tacrolimus metabolizers did not have a higher incidence of PTDM than slow tacrolimus metabolizers (p = 0.496). Consistent with this, insulin secretion and the viability of tacrolimus-treated INS-1 cells exposed to 12 h of tacrolimus concentrations analogous to the serum profiles of fast or slow tacrolimus metabolizers or to continuous exposure did not differ (p = 0.286). In conclusion, fast tacrolimus metabolism is not associated with increased incidence of PTDM after kidney transplantation, either in vitro or in vivo. A short period of incubation of INS-1 cells with tacrolimus using different concentration profiles led to comparable effects on cell viability and insulin secretion in vitro. Consistent with this, in our patient, collective fast Tac metabolizers did not show a higher PTDM incidence compared to slow metabolizers.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022-Aug,"Jehn U, Wiedmer N, Boeckel GR, Pavenstädt H, Thölking G, Reuter S",6,1827,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33431598,Service user and community clinician design of a partially virtual diabetic service improves access to care and education and reduces amputation incidence.,"Design of an integrated diabetes service based on needs of service users (persons living with diabetes) and community clinicians in a semirural low-income health district of the UK. One hundred and eighty-five service users engaged through public meetings, questionnaires and focus groups. General practice staff contributed views through workshops and questionnaires. Analysis of feedback indicated service user needs for better access to education, dietary advice and foot care. General practice staff endorsed these views and requested regular access to secondary care in the community. Seven hundred persons registered with diabetes attended eight well-being events in the community. From 2017 virtual practice multidisciplinary patient reviews, virtual referral of foot cases and non-face-to-face helplines were developed. A National Health Service (NHS) approved 'App' and web-based personalized education support for those recently diagnosed with diabetes was introduced. Engagement in education for those recently diagnosed with diabetes increased from 5% to 71%. Weight and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels before and 6 months after starting the program were 99.4±25 and 95.5±24.2 kg and 59.3±16 and 54.8±12.9 mmol/mol, respectively, p=0.00003 and 0.003. Of those engaging at well-being events, 44 had missed regular follow-up. One hundred and seventy-five cases were reviewed virtually with practice staff by the secondary care team avoiding referral to the hospital diabetic clinic. One hundred and seventy-six referrals were made to the virtual multidisciplinary diabetic foot team clinic. Major amputation incidence declined from 13 to 3 major procedures/10 000 per annum and minor amputation from 26 to 18/10 000. Percentage bed day occupancy by persons with diabetes fell significantly in the district general hospital. Integrated community-based diabetes care delivery has been achieved with partially virtual reviews.

The study included 40 DM and 38 non-DM patients. The DM status, HbA1c levels, baseline fasting blood glucose (FBG) level, and post-injection 1-, 7-, 15-, and 21-day FBG levels were evaluated retrospectively. The FBG levels were significantly higher 1 and 7 day after the glucocorticoid injection as compared with the baseline levels (P = 0.001 and <0.001, respectively). The increase was greatest in DM patients and then returned to baseline levels 15-day post-injection. In terms of the mean difference in post-injection and baseline FBG levels, the increase on day 1 was statistically significantly greater in the DM group as compared with that in the non-DM group (P = 0.01). Linear regression model showed that only the baseline FBG level predicted the glucose level 1-day post-treatment (β = 0.839, P < 0.01). Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections can safely be administered as a treatment for adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder in patients with well-controlled DM. Baseline FBG levels may predict peak blood glucose levels in patients with well-controlled DM. We recommend that DM patients with adhesive capsulitis should undergo frequent monitoring of blood glucose in the 2 week following intraarticular glucocorticoid injection treatment.",Nigerian journal of clinical practice,2021-Feb,"Akin-Takmaz S, Babaoglu G, Başar H, Baltacı B",4,1505,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35046015,Diabetic hand: prevalence and incidence of diabetic hand problems using data from 1.1 million inhabitants in southern Sweden.,"'The diabetic hand' has traditionally referred to hand complications due to diabetes mellitus (DM), including trigger finger (TF) and Dupuytren's disease (DD). Recent publications have also proposed DM as a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), ulnar nerve entrapment (UNE), and possibly osteoarthritis (OA) of the first carpometacarpal (CMC-1) joint. This study aimed to explore prevalence and incidence of diabetic hand complications among the population in southern Sweden. Approximately 1.1 million inhabitants in the region of Skåne aged ≥18 years, whereof 50 000 with DM, were included. Data on incident CTS, UNE, TF, DD, and OA of the CMC-1 joint between 2004 and 2019 were collected from the Skåne Healthcare Register and cross-linked with the National Diabetes Register. Prevalences on December 31, 2019 and 10-year incidence ratios were calculated for type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and the population without DM, stratified for sex. Prevalence ratios and incidence rate ratios with 95% CIs were used for group comparisons. The prevalences of all five studied diagnoses were higher in both men and women with T1D and T2D (p<0.01) and both T1D and T2D had more concomitant prevalent diagnoses (p<0.0001). The 10-year incidence rates of all diagnoses were higher among T1D and T2D (p<0.0001), except OA of the CMC-1 joint in men with T1D (p=0.055). CTS, UNE, and possibly also OA of the CMC-1 joint should be included together with TF and DD when referring to 'the diabetic hand'. The incidence of hand disorders was up to eight times higher among T1D, and both T1D and T2D had more concomitant prevalent diagnoses compared with the population without DM. Future studies should elucidate the pathophysiology behind diabetic hand complications to enable development of effective preventive measures in patients with diabetes.",BMJ open diabetes research & care,2022-Jan,"Rydberg M, Zimmerman M, Gottsäter A, Svensson AM, Eeg-Olofsson K, Dahlin LB",6,1855,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

37828591,"Patient's experiences of diabetes care at a tertiary health facility in Lilongwe, Malawi.","Little is known about experiences of rural people with diabetes care at a tertiary health facility in low-income settings. Understanding their experiences is essential for developing effective diabetes care interventions. The study employed a qualitative narrative inquiry. Participants were identified at a diabetes clinic at a tertiary-level healthcare facility. Ten participants from the rural areas attending the diabetes clinic were purposively selected. Data were collected through in-depth interviews in the privacy of the homes of the study participants and analysis was done using the Riessman approach to thematic narrative analysis. In this study, the following four themes emerged: (1) the long pathway to a diagnosis of diabetes; (2) Poverty-related hardships and diabetic clinic attendance; (3) The impact of health worker attitudes and behavior on diabetes care; and (4) Low resources and their impact on self-management. Rural-based patients living with diabetes encounter enormous challenges as they access diabetes care. One of the challenges is delayed diagnosis of diabetes. There is a need to introduce point-of-care (POC) testing to improve diabetes diagnosis. In addition, there is a need to strengthen awareness campaigns among the population so that people are well informed about the signs and symptoms of diabetes to promote early diagnosis.

Combined diagnostic models incorporating clinical and biomarker information have recently been developed that can aid classification, but they have not been validated using pancreatic pathology. We evaluated a clinical diagnostic model against histologically defined type 1 diabetes. We classified cases from the Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) biobank as type 1 (n = 111) or non-type 1 (n = 42) diabetes using histopathology. Type 1 diabetes was defined by lobular loss of insulin-containing islets along with multiple insulin-deficient islets. We assessed the discriminative performance of previously described type 1 diabetes diagnostic models, based on clinical features (age at diagnosis, BMI) and biomarker data [autoantibodies, type 1 diabetes genetic risk score (T1D-GRS)], and singular features for identifying type 1 diabetes by the area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic (AUC-ROC). Diagnostic models validated well against histologically defined type 1 diabetes. The model combining clinical features, islet autoantibodies and T1D-GRS was strongly discriminative of type 1 diabetes, and performed better than clinical features alone (AUC-ROC 0.97 vs. 0.95; P = 0.03). Histological classification of type 1 diabetes was concordant with serum C-peptide [median < 17 pmol/l (limit of detection) vs. 1037 pmol/l in non-type 1 diabetes; P < 0.0001]. Our study provides robust histological evidence that a clinical diagnostic model, combining clinical features and biomarkers, could improve diabetes classification. Our study also provides reassurance that a C-peptide-based definition of type 1 diabetes is an appropriate surrogate outcome that can be used in large clinical studies where histological definition is impossible.

Considering the high number of expats from different ethnicity a more thorough approach is necessary. Unfortunately, there are very few studies addressing this issue. The study uses the chi-square test to investigate the dependence of the progression of DNP on ethnic origin. The study uses Pearson Correlation to find the association between three prevalent scales used for the measurement of painful diabetes peripheral neuropathy. Student t-test was used further to investigate the significance of the association. With a p-value (0.004) and p-value (0.015), the study concludes that DPN risk is dependent on the ethnic origin of the residents. The study further found that there is a significant association between three scales for measuring painful diabetes peripheral neuropathy (pDNP), Douleur Neuropathique en 4 questions (DN4), Neurological Symptoms Score (NSS), and Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANNS). The p-value for all pairwise comparisons for the strength of association between scales was found significant at the level of significance 0.05. The study concludes that the risk of DNP is high in Arab-origin residents in UAE and the reasons behind the finding need to be empirically tested to customize its management.

34987478,The Role of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells-Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles in Diabetes and Its Chronic Complications.,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are applied in regenerative medicine of several tissues and organs nowadays by virtue of their self-renewal capabilities, multiple differentiation capacity, potent immunomodulatory properties, and their ability to be favourably cultured and manipulated. With the continuous development of ""cell-free therapy"" research, MSC-derived small extracellular vesicles (MSC-sEVs) have increasingly become a research hotspot in the treatment of various diseases. Small extracellular vesicles (SEVs) are membrane vesicles with diameters of 30 to 150 nm that mediate signal transduction between adjacent or distal cells or organs by delivering non-coding RNA, protein, and DNA. The contents and effects of sEVs vary depending on the properties of the originating cell. In recent years, MSC-sEVs have been found to play an important role in the occurrence and development of diabetes mellitus as a new way of communication between cells. Diabetes mellitus is a common metabolic disease in clinic. Its complications of the heart, brain, kidney, eyes, and peripheral nerves are a serious threat to human health and has been a hot issue for clinicians. MSC-sEVs could be applied to repair or prevent damage from the complications of diabetes mellitus through anti-inflammatory effects, reduction of endoplasmic reticulum-related protein stress, polarization of M2 macrophages, and increasing autophagy. Therefore, we highly recommend that MSC-sEVs-based therapies to treat diabetes mellitus and its chronic complication be further explored. The analysis of the role and molecular mechanisms of MSC-sEVs in diabetes and its related complications will provide new idea and insights for the prevention and treatment of diabetes.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2021-,"Li FX, Lin X, Xu F, Shan SK, Guo B, Lei LM, Zheng MH, Wang Y, Xu QS, Yuan LQ",10,1742,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Regular users of analgesics included those using prescription analgesics ≥ 15 days per month at least 6 times over 2 years after the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (baseline). The effectiveness of analgesics in patients with diabetes was evaluated using metformin adherence and three models: model 1 was adjusted for age and sex; model 2 was further adjusted for body mass index (BMI), exercise, cholesterol, hypertension, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI); and model 3 was further adjusted for analgesics. Based on stringent extraction criteria, the sample had a cancer incidence of 4.6%. The hazard ratios of models 1 and 2 were 0.830 and 0.865, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for all variables, including acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen, was 0.871 (model 3). Regular use of analgesics by patients with diabetes decreased their risk of subsequent cancer development in this large national cohort.

34155045,Individual and combined contributions of age-specific and sex-specific pulse pressure and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity to the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus.,"We aimed to investigate the individual and combined effects of age-specific and sex-specific pulse pressure (PP) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) on the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus. Participants in the Kailuan study cohort who were ≥20 years old, participated in follow-up assessments and underwent baPWV measurements in 2010-2011, 2012-2013, and 2014-2015 were studied. The participants were allocated to four groups according to their PP and baPWV status, each categorized as high or normal, according to age-specific and sex-specific median values. Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore the individual and combined effects of PP and baPWV on the incidence of diabetes mellitus. There were 18 619 participants who were followed for 4.27±1.91 years. A total of 877 new cases of diabetes were identified, and the incidence density was 11.03/1000 per year. Using the normal PP and normal baPWV group as the reference group, the multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95% CIs for diabetes mellitus in the high PP and high baPWV groups were 1.08 (0.93 to 1.25) and 1.64 (1.41 to 1.90), respectively. Compared with the normal PP/baPWV group, the HR and 95% CI for diabetes in the normal PP/high baPWV, the high PP/normal baPWV, and high PP/baPWV groups were 1.66 (1.35 to 2.05), 1.09 (0.86 to 1.37), and 1.74 (1.43 to 2.13), respectively. High baPWV was independently associated with a higher risk of diabetes mellitus, and individuals with both high baPWV and high PP were at a still higher risk of diabetes mellitus.",BMJ open diabetes research & care,2021-Jun,"Wu Y, Han X, Gao J, Wang Y, Zhu C, Huang Z, Xing A, Chen S, Ma Y, Zheng M, Liu Q, Tian Y, Wu S",13,1548,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37016424,"BMI Trajectories in Late Middle Age, Genetic Risk, and Incident Diabetes in Older Adults: Evidence From a 26-Year Longitudinal Study.","This study investigated the association between body mass index (BMI) trajectories in late middle age and incident diabetes in later years. A total of 11,441 participants aged 50-60 years from the Health and Retirement Study with at least 2 self-reported BMI records were included. Individual BMI trajectories representing average BMI changes per year were generated using multilevel modeling. Adjusted risk ratios (ARRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated. Associations between BMI trajectories and diabetes risk in participants with different genetic risks were estimated for 5,720 participants of European ancestry. BMI trajectories were significantly associated with diabetes risk in older age (slowly increasing vs. stable: ARR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.54; rapidly increasing vs. stable: ARR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.25, 1.79). This association was strongest for normal-initial-BMI participants (slowly increasing: ARR = 1.34, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.88; rapidly increasing: ARR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.37, 3.11). Participants with a higher genetic liability to diabetes and a rapidly increasing BMI trajectory had the highest risk for diabetes (ARR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.67, 2.76). These findings confirmed that BMI is the leading risk factor for diabetes and that although the normal BMI group has the lowest incidence rate for diabetes, people with normal BMI are most sensitive to changes in BMI.",American journal of epidemiology,2024-May,"Luo Y, Liu Z, Luo J, Li R, Wei Z, Yang L, Li J, He L, Su Y, Peng X, Hu X",11,1398,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35331118,Diagnostic Dilemmas and Current Treatment Approaches in Latent Onset Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults: A Concise Review.,"Latent Onset Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) is an autoimmune disorder between T1DM and T2DM and is often misdiagnosed as T2DM due to its late-onset. The disease is characterized by β-cell failure and slow progression to insulin dependence. Early diagnosis is significant in limiting disease progression. C-peptide levels and autoantibodies against β-cells are the most critical diagnostic biomarkers in LADA. The review aims to provide an overview of the biomarkers used to diagnose LADA, and the following treatment approaches. We have summarized LADA's pathophysiology and the autoantibodies involved in the condition, diagnostic approaches, and challenges. There are clear shortcomings concerning the feasibility of autoantibody testing. Finally, we have explored the treatment strategies involved in the management of LADA. In conclusion, the usual management includes treatment with metformin and the addition of low doses of insulin. Newer oral hypoglycaemic agents, such as GLP-1RA and DPP-4 inhibitors, have been brought into use. Since the disease is not entirely understood at the research level and in clinical practice, we hope to encourage further research in this field to assess its prevalence.

35938768,A multi-faceted approach improves inpatient diabetes care at a tertiary hospital.,"The results of the National Diabetes Inpatient Audit in 2013 showed that the Royal London Hospital had performed worse than the national average in several domains. The aim of this study was to improve inpatient diabetes care at the Royal London Hospital. A multi-faceted intervention was designed via a Commission for Quality and Innovation workstream which spanned from April 2014 to March 2016. The National Diabetes Inpatient Audit results of 2013, 2016 and 2019 were compared to look at the outcomes and analyse the changes brought about by the intervention. There were statistically significant improvements in medication errors, prescription errors, glucose management errors and insulin errors in 2016 and 2019 as compared to 2013. More inpatients with diabetes were visited by the diabetes team, received foot assessment and patient feedback improved in both 2016 and 2019 as compared to 2013. A multi-faceted approach led to significant improvements in patient outcomes and experience, resulting in Royal London Hospital performing well above the national average in the National Diabetes Inpatient Audit in 2016 and 2019.

Data from the NHIS-HEALS cohort between 2002 and 2015 were longitudinally analyzed. Subjects were divided into three groups: metformin non-users with diabetes mellitus (DM), metformin users with DM, and no DM group. CRC was defined using the ICD-10 code (C18.0-C20.0) at the time of admission. Cox proportional hazard regression models were adopted after stepwise adjustment for confounders to investigate the association between metformin usage and colorectal cancer risk. During the follow-up period, of the total 323,430 participants, 2341 (1.33%) of the 175,495 males and 1204 (0.81%) of the 147,935 females were newly diagnosed with CRC. The estimated cumulative incidence of CRC was significantly different among the three groups based on Kaplan-Meier's survival curve (p values < 0.05 in both sexes). Compared with metformin non-users, hazard ratios (95% CIs) of metformin users and the no DM group were 0.66 (0.51-0.85) and 0.72 (0.61-0.85) in males and 0.59 (0.37-0.92) and 0.93 (0.66-1.29) in females, respectively, after being fully adjusted.

34913986,Diabetic kidney disease in children and adolescents: an update.,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), previously encountered predominantly in adult patients, is rapidly gaining center stage as a childhood morbidity and one that pediatric nephrologists are likely to encounter with increasing frequency. This is in large part due to the obesity epidemic and the consequent rise in type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, as well as the more aggressive diabetes phenotype in today's youth with more rapid β-cell decline and faster development and progression of diabetes-related complications along with lower responsiveness to the treatments used in adults. DKD, an end-organ complication of diabetes, is at the very least a marker of, and more likely a predisposing factor for, the development of adverse cardiovascular outcomes and premature mortality in children with diabetes. On an optimistic note, several new therapeutic approaches are now available for the management of diabetes in adults, such as GLP1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and DPP4 inhibitors, that have also been shown to have a favorable impact on cardiorenal outcomes. Also promising is the success of very low-energy diets in inducing remission of diabetes in adults. However, the addition of these pharmacological and dietary approaches to the management toolbox of diabetes and DKD in children and adolescents awaits thorough assessment of their safety and efficacy in this population. This review outlines the scope of diabetes and DKD, and new developments that may favorably impact the management of children and young adults with diabetes and DKD.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2022-Nov,"Lopez LN, Wang W, Loomba L, Afkarian M, Butani L",5,1566,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39078862,A systematic review on the level of risk perception of diabetes mellitus: The role of environmental factor.,"Risk perception plays important role in motivating preventive health behaviours. The objective of this systematic review was to explore the level of diabetes risk perception among individuals with and without apparent risk for diabetes, and to consider the effect of environmental factors on the level of diabetes risk perception. This systematic review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The literature search was carried out through PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Original articles written in English and published between 2013 and 2023 were considered. Study quality was appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Narrative synthesis was undertaken due to methodological heterogeneity in the included studies. A total of 13 cross-sectional studies, two randomized controlled trials, two cohort studies, two mixed methods studies and one quasi-experiment with a control group were included. An overall low level of diabetes risk perception was reported particularly in those without apparent risk for diabetes. The 20 included studies reported widely varied measures for calculating diabetes risk perception. The influence of environmental factors on the risk perception of diabetes was highlighted. The use of study-specific and non-validated measures in the included studies weakens the authors' ability to compare across studies. The role of language and publication bias within this systematic review should be acknowledged as we included only English-language studies published in peer-reviewed journals. Another limitation is the exclusion of dimensions of risk perception such as optimistic bias as search terms. The overall low risk perception of diabetes calls for urgent need of public health interventions to increase the risk perception of diabetes. In the future, researchers should ensure the validity and reliability of the measures being used. The influence of environmental factors on the diabetes risk perception indicates that diabetes preventive interventions targeting environmental factors may be effective in increasing the risk perception of diabetes.",PloS one,2024-,"Jane Ling MY, Ahmad N, Noor Aizuddin A, Ja'afar MH",4,2163,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36372965,Understanding the planning and preparation for diabetes self-management of grey nomads when travelling in rural and remote Australia: An exploratory survey.,"Many older Australians with chronic health conditions, including diabetes, are taking to the road in a recreational vehicle following retirement and are colloquially known as grey nomads. This exploratory online survey aimed to ascertain the issues on the road for grey nomads with diabetes and their experiences of self-management of their diabetes whilst in rural and remote regions of Australia. Following ethical approval and piloting, an online survey was distributed through social media sites used by grey nomads and those with diabetes. From the closed and open-ended responses from travelers with diabetes in rural and remote areas, the demographics of this cohort were explored, as well as their self-management of diabetes. A total of 103 grey nomads with diabetes responded and 81 completed all survey questions. There was wide variation in the respondents' answers in regard to their self-management including their preparation for travel; their knowledge of diabetes and accessing health-care services; their management of illness; and their experiences whilst travelling including the effects of COVID-19. It was identified that there was a need for an increase in preparation prior to travel, and several important checks were identified for this planning specific to rural and remote areas of Australia, including the expectations of health services in these regions.

35041752,A Clinical Update on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) traditionally refers to abnormal glucose tolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. GDM has long been associated with obstetric and neonatal complications primarily relating to higher infant birthweight and is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for future maternal and offspring cardiometabolic disease. The prevalence of GDM continues to rise internationally due to epidemiological factors including the increase in background rates of obesity in women of reproductive age and rising maternal age and the implementation of the revised International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups' criteria and diagnostic procedures for GDM. The current lack of international consensus for the diagnosis of GDM reflects its complex historical evolution and pragmatic antenatal resource considerations given GDM is now 1 of the most common complications of pregnancy. Regardless, the contemporary clinical approach to GDM should be informed not only by its short-term complications but also by its longer term prognosis. Recent data demonstrate the effect of early in utero exposure to maternal hyperglycemia, with evidence for fetal overgrowth present prior to the traditional diagnosis of GDM from 24 weeks' gestation, as well as the durable adverse impact of maternal hyperglycemia on child and adolescent metabolism. The major contribution of GDM to the global epidemic of intergenerational cardiometabolic disease highlights the importance of identifying GDM as an early risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, broadening the prevailing clinical approach to address longer term maternal and offspring complications following a diagnosis of GDM.",Endocrine reviews,2022-Sep,"Sweeting A, Wong J, Murphy HR, Ross GP",4,1735,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Although exercise is beneficial in diabetes, previous studies have showed contradictory and inconclusive results on how it effects DR. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In this before-after clinical trial, 40 patients with diabetic retinopathy were enrolled by convenient sampling method in Shahid Labbafinejad Hospital in Tehran during 2021-2022. Before the intervention, central macular thickness (CMT, microns) measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fasting blood sugar (FBS, mg/dl) were obtained. Then, patients took part in a 12-week moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (3 sessions per week, each session 45 min). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 26.0. Out of 40 examined patients, 21 (52.5 %) were male and 19 (47.5 %) were female. The mean age of the patients was 50.8 years. The mean rank of FBS (mg/dl) significantly decreased from 21.12 before the exercise to 8.75 after the exercise (p < 0.001). Also, the mean rank of CMT (microns) showed a significant decrease from 21.11 before the intervention to 16.20 after the exercise (p < 0.001). There was a significant positive correlation between patients' age and FBS (mg/dl) before (rho = 0.457, p = 0.003) and after (rho = 0.365, p = 0.021) the intervention. Also, a significant positive correlation was found between patients' age and CMT (microns) before (rho = 0.525, p = 0.001) and after (rho = 0.461, p = 0.003) moderate exercise.

39375857,Individualized treatment of diabetes mellitus in older adults.,"The population of older adults with diabetes mellitus is growing but heterogeneous. Because geriatric syndromes, comorbidity or multimorbidity, the complexity of glucose dynamics, and socioeconomic conditions are associated with the risk of severe hypoglycemia and mortality, these factors should be considered in individualized diabetes treatment. Because cognitive impairment and frailty have similar etiologies and risk factors, a common strategy can be implemented to address them through optimal glycemic control, management of vascular risk factors, diet, exercise, social participation, and support. To prevent frailty or sarcopenia, optimal energy intake, adequate protein and vitamin intake, and resistance or multi-component exercise are recommended. For hypoglycemic drug therapy, it is important to reduce hypoglycemia, to use sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, taking into account the benefits for cardiovascular disease and the risk of adverse effects, and to simplify treatment to address poor adherence. Glycemic control goals for older adults with diabetes should be set according to three categories, based on cognitive function and activities of daily living, using the Dementia Assessment Sheet for Community-based Integrated Care System 8-items. This categorization can be used to determine treatment strategies for diabetes when combined with the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA). Based on the CGA, frailty prevention, treatment simplification, and social participation or services should be implemented for patients in Category II and above. Measures against hypoglycemia and for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease should also be promoted. Treatment based on categorization and CGA by multidisciplinary professionals would be an individualized treatment for older adults with diabetes.

Retinal photographs were reviewed by an ophthalmologist for the presence and stage of DR, as well as for additional nondiabetic findings. The following grading categories of DR were used: without DR, mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR), moderate NPDR, severe non-proliferative NPDR, proliferative DR (PDR), clinically significant macular edema (CSME) and ungradable finding. Severe NPDR, PDR and CSME were classified as vision-threatening DR. Out of 1428 DM patients, 27 were diagnosed with type 1 DM and 1401 with type 2 DM, 353 of them had newly diagnosed type 2 DM. Without DR category was recorded in 85.2% of all eyes screened, 2.8% were ungradable, and 12% showed varying stages of DR.

The use of new antidiabetic medications in the prevention and treatment of diabetic kidney disease is a growing area of research interest. We sought to characterize the risk of developing a composite kidney outcome among patients receiving a new antidiabetic medication of the SGLT-2i, GLP-1ra, and DPP-4i drug classes. We conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE to identify randomized trials observing kidney safety endpoints associated with the use of new antidiabetic medications. Two independent reviewers selected the 7 eligible studies for analysis. Included studies were published between January 2013 and March 2020, conducted with adult participantss, published full-text in English, and observed composite kidney outcomes. A network meta-analysis was conducted within a Bayesian framework using a fixed-effects model with uninformative priors. A qualitative assessment of transitivity was conducted to ensure similar distribution of potential modifiers across studies. Included studies were generally comparable in mean age, glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and mean duration of T2DM at baseline. Compared with placebo, dapagliflozin was associated with the greatest reduction in risk of developing the composite kidney outcome (hazard ratio 0.53; 95% credible interval, 0.43-0.66) followed by empagliflozin, canagliflozin, semaglutide, and liraglutide. Linagliptin did not show a significant reduction in risk of the outcome. This analysis was limited by the scarcity of data for kidney safety endpoints in large, randomized clinical trials.

36197636,Progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus induced by overnutrition.,"Prediabetes has developed into a global pandemic, its prevalence increasing year by year. Although lifestyle changes are advocated as the basis for prediabetes treatment, some patients fail to choose or adhere to appropriate interventions. The basis for selecting an appropriate intervention is determining the stage and cause of the disease. In this review, we aimed to examine the various types and disease processes of prediabetes caused by overnutrition, the present review supporting the hypothesis that overnutrition-induced hyperinsulinemia precedes insulin resistance (IR) and independently causes β-cell dysfunction. Tissue insulin resistance is the main feature of prediabetes with the crosstalk between tissues promoting the formation of systemic insulin resistance. Finally, both β-cell dysfunction induced by hyperinsulinemia or IR and reduced β-cell mass can lead to abnormal insulin secretion and contribute to development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Hence, overnutrition can cause multiple prediabetes phenotypes resulting in development of T2DM through different trajectories. Future diagnosis and treatment should therefore more carefully consider the disease phenotype and stage of development in patients with prediabetes to reduce the incidence of T2DM.","Hormones (Athens, Greece)",2022-Dec,"Zhang Y, Shen T, Wang S",3,1282,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We assessed the diagnostic performance of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA<sub>1c</sub> as alternatives to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)-derived 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG) using sensitivity and specificity in 263 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) from a clinical trial. Between visits at 6, 12, and 24 months after transplantation, 28%-31% of patients switched glycemic category (normal glucose tolerance [NGT], IGT/IFG, PTDM). Correlations of FPG and HbA<sub>1c</sub> against 2hPG were lower at 6 months (r = 0.59 [FPG against 2hPG]; r = 0.45 [HbA<sub>1c</sub> against 2hPG]) vs. 24 months (r = 0.73 [FPG against 2hPG]; r = 0.74 [HbA<sub>1c</sub> against 2hPG]). Up to 69% of 2hPG-defined PTDM cases were missed by conventional HbA<sub>1c</sub> and FPG thresholds. For prediabetes, concordance of FPG and HbA<sub>1c</sub> with 2hPG ranged from 6%-9%. In conclusion, in our well-defined randomized trial cohort, one-third of KTRs switched glycemic category over 2 years and although the correlations of FPG and HbA<sub>1c</sub> with 2hPG improved with time, their diagnostic concordance was poor for PTDM and, especially, prediabetes.

31934549,Diabetes: What Challenges Lie Ahead for Vietnam?,"Economic development and social environment changes influence disease patterns ranging from infectious diseases to noncommunicable diseases, and diabetes is one of the seven causes leading to death and disability in Vietnam. The purpose of this research is to present an overview of the challenges related to diabetes prevention in Vietnam and to find effective ways for the prevention and control of diabetes, as well as to improve the quality of life among diabetes patients. The literature review was conducted using a variety of databases, such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Vietnamese data sources, and papers published in the Vietnamese language. For the searches, we used keywords such as ""Diabetes,"" ""Prevention,"" and ""Prevalence of Diabetes."" With the increasing prevalence of diabetes, there are approximately 5.76 million people with diabetes currently living in Vietnam. The age-adjusted comparative prevalence of diabetes in the population of Vietnam was approximately 6% in 2017. This review suggests that the government needs to establish social security and policy programs aimed at reducing social risk factors and the burden of healthcare costs for diabetes treatment in older people. In addition, attention should be paid to the management and control of diabetes-related diseases, with an emphasis on new techniques for early diagnosis and treatment. Simultaneously, the health system should ensure that diabetes patients living in rural areas and belonging to ethnic minorities can access better healthcare services to improve their health and decrease their risk for chronic disease and death.",Annals of global health,2020-Jan,"Ngoc NB, Lin ZL, Ahmed W",3,1628,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36872136,Reducing Sitting Time in Type 1 Diabetes: Considerations and Implications.,"Sedentary behaviours are ubiquitous in modern society, with Western populations spending approximately 50% of their waking hours in low levels of energy expenditure. This behaviour is associated with cardiometabolic derangements and increased morbidity and mortality. In individuals living with or at risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), ""breaking up"" sedentariness by interrupting prolonged periods of sitting has been shown to acutely improve glucose management and cardiometabolic risk factors related to diabetes complications. As such, current guidelines recommend interrupting prolonged periods of sitting with short, frequent activity breaks. However, the evidence underpinning these recommendations remains preliminary and is focussed on those with or at risk of developing T2D, with little information regarding whether and how reducing sedentariness may be effective and safe in those living with type 1 diabetes (T1D). In this review, we discuss the potential application of interventions that target prolonged sitting time in T2D within the context of T1D.",Canadian journal of diabetes,2023-Apr,"Alobaid AM, Dempsey PC, Francois M, Zulyniak MA, Hopkins M, Campbell MD",6,1073,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38706530,Diabetes complications and cognitive function in young adults with youth-onset type 1 or type 2 diabetes: the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study.,"People with type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) who also have diabetes complications can have pronounced cognitive deficits. It remains unknown, however, whether and how multiple diabetes complications co-occur with cognitive dysfunction, particularly in youth-onset diabetes. Using data from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study cohort, a prospective longitudinal cohort, we examined clustering of complications and their underlying clinical factors with performance on cognitive tests in young adults with youth-onset T1D or T2D. Cognition was assessed via the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery. The main cognitive variables were age-corrected scores for composite fluid cognition and associated cognitive subdomains. Diabetes complications included retinopathy, microalbuminuria, and peripheral neuropathy (PN). Lipids, systolic blood pressure (SBP), hemoglobin A1c, and other clinical factors were included in the analyses. Clustering was applied separately to each group (T1D=646; T2D=165). A three-cluster(C) solution was identified for each diabetes type. Mean values and frequencies of all factors were compared between resulting clusters. The average age-corrected score for composite fluid cognition differed significantly across clusters for each group (p<0.001). People with T1D and the lowest average fluid cognition scores had the highest frequency of self-reporting at least one episode of hypoglycemia in the year preceding cognitive testing and the highest prevalence of PN. Persons with T2D and the lowest average fluid cognition scores had the highest SBP, the highest central systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and highest prevalence of PN. These findings highlight shared (PN) and unique factors (hypoglycemia in T1D; SBP in T2D) that could be targeted to potentially mitigate cognitive issues in young people with youth-onset diabetes.",Pediatric diabetes,2023-,"Shapiro ALB, Bellatorre A, Dabelea D, Stafford JM, D'Agostino R, Shah AS, Urbina EM, Barrett CE, Pihoker C, Marcovina S, Liese AD, Mottl AK, Jensen ET, Wilkening G",14,1862,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35201556,The Impact of Diet on Bone and Fracture Risk in Diabetes.,"The purpose of this review is to summarize the recently published scientific evidence on the effects of diet on diabetes and skeletal health. The impact of diet on overall health has been a growing topic of interest among researchers. An inappropriate eating habit is a relatively modified risk factor for diabetes in adults. Parallel with the significant increase in the incidence of diabetes mellitus worldwide, many studies have shown the benefits of lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise for people with, or at risk of developing, diabetes. In the last years, accumulating evidence suggests that diabetes is a risk factor for bone fragility. As lifestyle intervention represents an effective option for diabetes management and treatment, there is potential for an effect on bone health. Healthy lifestyle is critical to prevent bone fragility. However, more studies are needed to fully understand the impact of diet and weight loss on fracture risk in diabetics.",Current osteoporosis reports,2022-Feb,"Faraj M, Napoli N",2,981,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
31584372,A Molecular Approach on the Protective Effects of Mangiferin Against Diabetes and Diabetes-related Complications.,"Diabetes and its related complications are now a global health problem without an effective therapeutic approach. There are many herbal medicines which have attracted much attention as potential therapeutic agents in the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications due to their multiple targets. The aim of this study is to review available knowledge of mangiferin focusing on its mode of action. Mangiferin was extensively reviewed for its antidiabetic activity using online database like Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar as well as some offline textbooks. A critical discussion based on the mechanism of action and the future perspectives is also given in the present manuscript. Mangiferin is a natural C-glucoside and mainly obtained from its primary source, the leaves of mango tree (Mangifera indica L.). Therapeutic and preventive properties of mangiferin include antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antiallergic, neuroprotective, and cognition-enhancing effects. It dissolves well in water, so it can be easily extracted into infusions and decoctions and hence, a number of researches have been made on the therapeutic effect of this molecule. Recently, mangiferin has been proved to be an effective remedy in diabetes and diabetes-related complications. It is a beneficial natural compound for type 2 diabetes mellitus as it improves insulin sensitivity, modulates lipid profile and reverts adipokine levels to normal. This study concludes that mangiferin has the potential to treat diabetes and it can be developed as a therapeutic agent for diabetes and the complications caused by diabetes.",Current diabetes reviews,2020-,"Aswal S, Kumar A, Chauhan A, Semwal RB, Kumar A, Semwal DK",6,1624,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The intervention group included patients with diabetes who participated in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing during their initial dental screening appointment. The participants whose HbA1c value was ≤ 9.0% were expedited into the scheduling queue for the next comprehensive examination appointment. Health literacy was assessed regarding patients' understanding of the connection between oral health and diabetes. The mean number of days between screening and treatment plan development was decreased by 38.4%. Of the participants in the intervention group with an HbA1c value ≤ 9.0%, 44% rated their understanding of the connection between diabetes and gum disease as ""poor"", whereas 86% of the patients who were ineligible due to an HbA1c value ≥ 9.1% rated their understanding as ""very good"" or ""excellent"". Patients with diabetes will continue to benefit from this quality improvement project to minimize barriers to dental care and improve overall health outcomes as this intervention is adopted as a permanent practice change. The need has been highlighted for comprehensive education in practice settings concerning medical and dental collaboration, and patient awareness of the interrelationship between diabetes mellitus and oral disease. An increase in oral examinations, assessment of routine oral health behaviors, and referral to dental providers from the primary care setting is warranted.",Journal of dental education,2022-Oct,"Baxter M, Hardin-Fanning F, Witt C",3,1644,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Exercise is being increasingly recommended as part of the therapeutic regimen for DM but the management of different forms of physical activity is difficult for individuals with diabetes, trainers, and physicians. Regular exercise can improve health and well-being, helping individuals to achieve their target lipid profile, body composition, cardio-respiratory fitness, and glycemic goals. People with diabetes tend to be as inactive as the general population, with a large percentage of individuals not achieving the minimum amount of recommended physical activity levels. Indeed, several barriers to exercise exist for persons with diabetes, including sports eligibility, multi-modality management of diabetic athletes, and inadequate knowledge about adequate type and intensity of exercise. The aim of the present review is to provide the current understanding of mechanisms, recommendations, and beneficial effects of different modalities of exercise for the treatment of DM.",Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology,2022-Sep,"Palermi S, Iacono O, Sirico F, Modestino M, Ruosi C, Spera R, De Luca M",7,1076,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38863921,"Prevailing Food Intake, Physical Activity and Health Beliefs in a Rural Agricultural Community in the Philippines: Factors to Consider Prior to a Diabetes Prevention Program.","A diabetes prevention program is being proposed in the rural agricultural town of San Juan, Batangas, Philippines. This study aims to determine the prevailing level of food intake, physical activity, and health beliefs prior to any intervention. Adults were recruited via random sampling with proportional allocation. Interviews were done to determine food intake and physical activity. Small group discussions were held to determine prevailing health beliefs. The average energy intake (1,547 kcal/d) is only 72% of the recommended values for Filipinos. Only 12% of the respondents achieved the recommended energy intake. Carbohydrates comprise a large part (71%) of calorie intake. A majority (91%) already have moderate to high levels of physical activity. There are prevailing health beliefs that need to be considered when dietary modifications and physical activity interventions are to be done. Internationally recommended diabetes prevention interventions such as reducing calorie intake and increasing physical activity may not be directly applicable here. We recommend that the features of a diabetes prevention program for this locale must include the following: 1) introduction of affordable plant sources of proteins; 2) decreasing the proportion of rice as a source of carbohydrates in the diet; 3) maintaining the level of physical activity; and 4) being sensitive to the prevailing health beliefs.",Journal of the ASEAN Federation of Endocrine Societies,2024-,"Sandoval MA, Paz-Pacheco E, Cañete E, Patal P, Cating-Cabral MT, Lantion-Ang FL, Paterno E, Juban N, Jimeno C",9,1413,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The prevalence and pattern of delayed diagnosis of DM were defined using the Thai Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for Diabetes, 2017, and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2017. The cut-off time for FPG level confirmation of 3 months was used to evaluate delayed diagnoses and associated factors. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with delayed diagnoses. <b>Results:</b> Of 260 participants, 96.9% and 85.4% had delayed diagnoses as defined by the Thai CPG and the ADA, respectively. Factors significantly associated with delayed diagnosis were hypertension, non-cash insurance, and >10 years of physician experience. <b>Conclusion:</b> Undiagnosed diabetes and diagnosis delay should be a concern in tertiary settings.

38486325,Screening for Coronary Artery Disease in Asymptomatic Pilots with Diabetes Mellitus.,"<b>INTRODUCTION:</b> Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a cause of death in 75% of patients with diabetes. Its often asymptomatic nature delays diagnosis. In aeronautics, it can cause in-flight incapacitation, beyond which it represents a major fear for the medical expert. Screening for CAD is still a topical subject with the advent of new cardiovascular (CV) risk biomarkers and more effective screening tests. We report the experience of the Aeromedical Expertise Center of Rabat in this screening of diabetic pilots, with a recommendations review.<b>METHODS:</b> A prospective study over 1 yr included diabetic pilots who benefited from systematic screening for CAD after a CV risk stratification. Coronary angiography is performed if a screening test is positive. Subsequent follow-up is carried out in consultation with the attending physician with regular evaluation in our center.<b>RESULTS:</b> There were 38 pilots included in our study. The average age was 55 ± 4.19 yr and about 73% had a high CV risk. CAD was detected in 4 cases (10.52%) who had abnormal resting electrocardiograms and required revascularization with the placement of active stents. Approximately 75% of pilots with CAD returned to fly through a waiver with restrictions.<b>DISCUSSION:</b> Screening for coronary disease in diabetics is controversial, and current recommendations are not unanimous. In our study, the screening did not identify coronary diabetic pilots who could benefit from bypass surgery. Nevertheless, coronary disease was diagnosed, justifying grounding to preserve flight safety, which is an absolute priority in aviation medicine.<b>Zerrik M, Moumen A, El Ghazi M, Smiress FB, Iloughmane Z, El M'hadi C, Chemsi M. <i>Screening for coronary artery disease in asymptomatic pilot with diabetes mellitus</i>.

Discrepancies were resolved by a third author. The review included observational studies investigating the relationship between CAN and DPN in individuals with DM. Initially, out of 1165 studies, only 16 were selected, with 42.8 % involving volunteers with one type of diabetes, 14.3 % with both types of diabetes and 14.3 % not specify the type. The total number of volunteers was 2582, mostly with type 2 DM. It was analyzed that there is a relationship between CAN and DPN. It was observed that more severe levels of DPN are associated with worse outcomes in autonomic tests. Some studies suggested that the techniques for evaluating DPN might serve as risk factors for CAN.

A total of 11,103 people of either sex older than 60 years were enrolled from 17 districts of Shanghai. The EQ-5D-3L was used to assess the HRQoL of older people. The Wilcoxon rank sum test and t-test were used to compare the difference in HRQoL between people with or without diabetes. After univariate regression, multiple linear regression and ordinal logistic regression were conducted to evaluate the influence of diabetes mellitus and other confounding variables on the EQ VAS scores and on the five dimensions of the EQ-5D. Twelve percent of all participants had diabetes mellitus, and the proportion was almost the same between men and women. The EQ VAS scores of people with diabetes mellitus were approximately 3.70 points lower than those of people without diabetes (95% CI = -4.40,  -2.99, p < 0.001) after adjusting for confounding variables. People with diabetes mellitus had increased problems with mobility (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.33, 1.85), self-care (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.35, 2.01), usual activities (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.51, 2.11), pain/discomfort (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.24, 1.64), and anxiety/depression (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.07, 1.64).

39213491,"Etiopathogenesis and Management of Prameha Poorvaroopa (Prediabetes), Prameha and Madhumeha (Diabetes Mellitus): An Ancient Perspective.","Prameha was identified in 1552 BCE as a Maharoga (major disease), one of the eight grave diseases of Ancient medical history. Initial days of recognition labeled Prameha as a rich man's disease, as found prevalent among people of higher socio-economic background. This fact was thereby linked with the diagnosis of diabetes and the invention of iron in the Iron Age, as wealthy part of the population who initiated consumption of newly harvested rice and wheat were found majorly diagnosed. Gradually, with the knowledge sought from Rigveda, Atharvaveda, Ayurveda, and Samhitas, the causes and types were identified, and further search conducted in Ayurveda resulted in denominating Prameha based on the body constitution and predominant dosha with its etiology in lifestyle and dietary factors, which, in the current scenario is known as diabetes mellitus. The objective of the current review is to find out and collate the information sought from published ancient literature on the origin and classification of Prameha with etiological factors. Articles published between 1982 and 2021 in scientific domain was searched using several keywords in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Google, to find treatment approaches adopted by ancient medics to manage Prameha, Madhumeha, and Prameha Poorvaroopa. Classical literature was reviewed to understand the traditional approaches applied in the context of scientific interpretations. Content of this scriptural review was derived mainly from Rigveda, Atharvaveda, Ayurveda, Sushrutha Samhita, Charaka Samhita, Bhela Samhita, Harita Samhita, and Papillad Samhita.

34784864,An Insight into the Polymeric Nanoparticles Applications in Diabetes Diagnosis and Treatment.,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a type of chronic metabolic disease that has affected millions of people worldwide and is known with a defect in the amount of insulin secretion, insulin functions, or both. This deficiency leads to an increase in the amounts of glucose, which could be accompanied by long-term damages to other organs such as eyes, kidneys, heart, and nervous system. Thus, introducing an appropriate approach for diagnosis and treatment of different types of DM is the aim of several researches. By the emergence of nanotechnology and its application in medicine, new approaches were presented for these purposes. The object of this review article is to introduce different types of polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs), as one of the most important classes of nanoparticles, for diabetic management. To achieve this goal, at first, some of the conventional therapeutic and diagnostic methods of DM will be reviewed. Then, different types of PNPs, in two forms of natural and synthetic polymers with different properties, as a new method for DM treatment and diagnosis will be introduced. In the next section, the transport mechanisms of these types of nano-carriers across the epithelium, via paracellular and transcellular pathways will be explained. Finally, the clinical use of PNPs in the treatment and diagnosis of DM will be summarized. Based on the results of this literature review, PNPs could be considered one of the most promising methods for DM management.",Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,2023-,"Dehghani P, Rad ME, Zarepour A, Sivakumar PM, Zarrabi A",5,1474,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

A random sample from the Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II cohort (n = 360) was invited to participate. Knowledge was assessed using 10 multiple-choice questions covering how diabetes affects the eyes, frequency of ophthalmic screening, risk factors, prevention, available treatments, and prognosis. DR was assessed from fundus photographs. Multiple linear regression was used to identify independent associates of the knowledge score (KS). We included 264 participants (mean ± SD age 72.1 ± 9.2 years, 56.8% male, median [IQR] diabetes duration 15.4 [11.1-22.3] years). The mean ± SD KS out of 10 was 5.3 ± 1.8. Most (67%) participants knew diabetes can affect the eye and lead to blindness. Only 13.6% knew that DR screening intervals depend on risk factors. Those with moderate non-proliferative DR (NPDR) or worse had a better knowledge score (B = 1.37,P = 0.008) after adjusting for age (B = -0.03, P = 0.004) and education beyond primary school (B = 1.75, P < 0.001).

32006343,Targeting Glycoproteins as a therapeutic strategy for diabetes mellitus and its complications.,"Glycoproteins are organic compounds formed from proteins and carbohydrates, which are found in many parts of the living systems including the cell membranes. Furthermore, impaired metabolism of glycoprotein components plays the main role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of glycoprotein levels in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. All relevant papers in the English language were compiled by searching electronic databases, including Scopus, PubMed and Cochrane library. The keywords of glycoprotein, diabetes mellitus, glycan, glycosylation, and inhibitor were searched until January 2019. Glycoproteins are pivotal elements in the regulation of cell proliferation, growth, maturation and signaling pathways. Moreover, they are involved in drug binding, drug transportation, efflux of chemicals and stability of therapeutic proteins. These functions, structure, composition, linkages, biosynthesis, significance and biological effects are discussed as related to their use as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its complications. The findings revealed several chemical and natural compounds have significant beneficial effects on glycoprotein metabolism. The comprehension of glycoprotein structure and functions are very essential and inevitable to enhance the knowledge of glycoengineering for glycoprotein-based therapeutics as may be required for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its associated complications.

33813248,Burden of increased blood glucose due to modifiable risk factors among men in India.,"Worldwide, many diabetes cases are occurring mainly due to lifestyle risk factors. Hence, to quantify and compare the attributable burden of key modifiable risk factors associated with increased Blood Glucose (BG) among Indian states and districts. The study used the National Family Health Survey (2015-16) data to estimate Population Attributable Risk (PAR) for increased BG (>140 mg/dl) among men aged 15-54 years in 640 districts of 36 States/Union Territories (UTs), India. We have considered three key modifiable factors such as high Body Mass Index (BMI), use of tobacco and alcohol. Population Attributable Risk techniques were employed to address the attributable burden of increased blood glucose due to modifiable risk factors. Substantial variations were found in the burden of increased BG due to high BMI, alcohol and tobacco use in India. The overall burden of increased BG due to high BMI, tobacco and alcohol in India was 28.5%, 2.1% and 6.4%, respectively. Regional variations in BG were found in high BMI, tobacco and alcohol consumption groups. The high burden of increased BG related to the above key modifiable risk factors mostly seen in North-Eastern' districts due to alcohol, Southern and Northern' districts was due to high BMI. However, the higher burden due to tobacco was reported in Central, Eastern and North-Eastern' districts. Three modifiable risk factors are contributing significantly to increased BG among men. Since there are regional differences in their contributions, state/district, specific targeted interventions may be necessary to control increased BG among men in India.",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2021-,"Biradar RA, Singh DP, Prasad JB",3,1618,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Higher cumTyG (HR, 2.02; 95 % CI, 1.70-2.41), but not greater TyG variability alone, was significantly associated with increased prediabetes risk. In the diabetes development subcohort, 379 participants developed diabetes over a 3.0-year follow-up. Higher cumTyG (HR, 3.54; 95 % CI, 2.29-5.46), but not greater TyG variability alone, was significantly associated with increased diabetes risk. The ""cumTyG+variability"" combination had the highest predictive value for prediabetes and diabetes beyond a single baseline TyG measurement. Higher cumTyG exposure independently predicts prediabetes and diabetes incidence. Coexisting cumTyG and variability could further yield incrementally greater risks.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,2024-Nov,"Wang Y, Liu L, Yang P, Li Y, Zhou Y, Yang S, Chen K, Deng S, Zhu X, Liu X, Wang C",11,1466,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This web-based cross-sectional study was conducted between June 2023 and January 2024 at Heilongjiang Provincial Hospital. A self-designed questionnaire was developed to collect demographic information of patients with diabetes mellitus and hyperuricemia, and assess their knowledge, attitudes and practices toward disease self-management. A total of 482 participants were enrolled in this study, among them, 364 (75.52%) were male, 235 (48.76%) were aged between 40 and 59 years, 226 (46.89%) had a body mass index (BMI) ranging from 24 to 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 337 (69.92%) had received a diagnosis of diabetes for a duration of 2 years or more, while 245 (50.83%) had been diagnosed with hyperuricemia for a similar duration. Their median (range) knowledge, attitude and practice scores were 10.00 (9.00, 11.00) (possible range: 0-12), 38.00 (36.00, 40.00) (possible range: 9-45), and 30.00 (26.00, 34.75) (possible range: 10-50), respectively. The path analysis demonstrated that knowledge had direct effects on attitude (<i>β</i> = 0.508, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and attitude had direct effects on practice (<i>β</i> = 0.448, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Additionally, there was an indirect effect of knowledge on practice mediated through attitude, with a path coefficient of 0.228 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). This study demonstrates that patients with diabetes mellitus and hyperuricemia exhibit relatively proficient responses to certain items within the KAP dimensions. However, it also exposes a certain degree of inadequacy in the KAP level toward disease management. Interventions should focus on improving patients' understanding of their conditions while fostering positive attitudes, ultimately translating into better self-management practices.",Frontiers in public health,2024-,"Wang D, Liu Z, Liu Y, Zhao L, Xu L, He S, Duan B",7,1896,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Diabetes mellitus is a serious and growing problem worldwide, and its prevalence continues to grow; it is the 12th leading cause of death. An association between diabetes mellitus and cancer has been suggested for more than 100 years. Diabetes is a common disease diagnosed among patients with cancer, and evidence indicates that approximately 8-18% of patients with cancer have diabetes, with investigations suggesting an association between diabetes and some particular cancers, increasing the risk for developing cancers such as pancreatic, liver, colon, breast, stomach, and a few others. Breast and colorectal cancers have increased from 20% to 30% and there is a 97% increased risk of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or endometrial cancer. On the other hand, a number of cancers and cancer therapies increase the risk of diabetes mellitus. Complications due to diabetes in patients with cancer may influence the choice of cancer therapy. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of the associations between diabetes mellitus and cancer are still unknown. The aim of this review is to summarize the association of diabetes mellitus with selected cancers and update the evidence on the underlying mechanisms of this association.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024-Jul,"Pliszka M, Szablewski L",2,1310,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

During Hajj the pattern and amount of their meal, fluid intake and physical activity are markedly altered. Many people with diabetes insist on doing the Hajj duty, thereby creating a medical challenge for themselves and their health care providers. It is therefore important that medical professionals be aware of the potential risks that may be associated with Hajj. People with diabetes may face many health hazards during Hajj including but not limited to the killer triad which might occur during Hajj: Hypoglycemia, Foot injury and Infections.

Although this has improved cancer care but so has the increase in the incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) including endocrinopathies. ICI-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) is a rare irAE with an approximate incidence of 1%. Due to paucity of data in literature about ICI-induced DM, we conducted a study to report the incidence and characteristics of new onset and worsening of DM in patients treated with ICIs. We conducted a retrospective review of patients who received ICIs during 10-year period. We identified patients with newly diagnosed DM and worsening of preexisting DM. Among 2,477 patients who received one or multiple ICIs, 14 patients developed new onset DM and 11 patients experienced worsening of pre-existing DM. Median time to new onset or worsening DM from ICI treatment initiation was ∼ 12 weeks. Median hemoglobin A1c was 6.2% at baseline and 8.5% at the onset of ICI-induced DM. Seven patients presented with diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA), all in the new onset group. (p = 0.02) No significant difference was observed between two groups regarding personal history of autoimmune disorder or family history of DM. (p greater than 0.05) Positive autoantibodies were found in three patients [two with Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD65) antibodies and one with insulin autoantibodies (IAA)].

33279099,Psychobiology of Appetite and Food Reward in Adults with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes: Is there a Role for Exercise?,"Hyperglycemia is the defining feature of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and results from deficient insulin production, impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake or both. It is now well established that hyperglycemia results in profound metabolic complications, but the effect of diabetes and its associated metabolic effects on homeostatic and hedonic appetite control has received less attention. Inappropriate food choices and excess food intake might promote weight gain, further exacerbating the metabolic consequences of T1D and T2D. The need to control blood glucose through diet, physical activity and/or medication as a consequence of impaired insulin secretion and/or sensitivity adds a further level of physiological and behavioural complexity to the processes underlying food choice and appetite control. Alterations in appetite-related processes have been noted in people with T2D, but the effect of T1D on appetite is largely unexplored. Peripheral neuroendocrine signalling appears disrupted in people with T2D, and brain regions involved in the central modulation of appetite might display central insulin resistance. However, it is difficult to isolate the consequences of T2D from those of obesity. Health-care policy advocates the use of physical activity as a means of preventing and treating T2D via the promotion of weight loss and its independent influence on insulin sensitivity. Exercise-induced perturbations to energy balance can elicit biological and behavioural compensation that attenuates weight loss, and diabetes pathophysiology might alter the strength of such compensation. However, the effect of exercise on appetite in people living with diabetes has yet to be fully explored.",Canadian journal of diabetes,2020-Dec,"Hopkins M, Beaulieu K, Finlayson G",3,1730,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Until now, little is known about the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in gastroenterology inpatients. To improve detection of undiagnosed diabetes, a routine screening procedure for gastroenterology inpatients, based on hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurement, was established. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the implemented diabetes screening. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed according to the guideline of the German Diabetes Association in patients with an HbA<sub>1c</sub> of ≥6.5% anld/or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥126 mg/dL. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for undiagnosed diabetes. Within a 3-month period, 606 patients were eligible for a diabetes screening. Pre-existing diabetes was documented in 120 patients (19.8 %), undiagnosed diabetes was found in 24 (3.9%), and 162 patients (26.7%) met the definition for prediabetes. Steroid medication use, age, and liver cirrhosis due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) were identified as risk factors for undiagnosed diabetes. The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in gastroenterology inpatients is markedly elevated in comparison to the general population, and a substantial number of inpatients are in a prediabetic status, underlining the need for diabetes screening. In addition to previously described risk factors of patient age and steroid medication use, we identified PSC-related liver cirrhosis (but not liver cirrhosis due to another etiology) as an independent risk factor for undiagnosed diabetes.",Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie,2022-Sep,"Fründt T, Schröder N, Hölzemer A, Pinnschmidt H, de Heer J, Behrends BC, Renne T, Lautenbach A, Lohse AW, Schrader J",10,1818,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39170741,Polyunsaturated fatty acids and diabetic microvascular complications: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies and clinical trials have implicated polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in potentially safeguarding against diabetic microvascular complication. Nonetheless, the causal nature of these relationships remains ambiguous due to conflicting findings across studies. This research employs Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the causal impact of PUFAs on diabetic microvascular complications. We identified instrumental variables for PUFAs, specifically omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, using the UK Biobank data. Outcome data regarding diabetic microvascular complications were sourced from the FinnGen Study. Our analysis covered microvascular outcomes in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, namely diabetic neuropathy (DN), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). An inverse MR analysis was conducted to examine the effect of diabetic microvascular complications on PUFAs. Sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the robustness of the results. Finally, a multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis was conducted to determine whether PUFAs have a direct influence on diabetic microvascular complications. The study indicates that elevated levels of genetically predicted omega-6 fatty acids substantially reduce the risk of DN in type 2 diabetes (odds ratio (OR): 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.47-0.82, <i>p</i> = 0.001). A protective effect against DR in type 2 diabetes is also suggested (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.62-0.92, <i>p</i> = 0.005). MVMR analysis confirmed the stability of these results after adjusting for potential confounding factors. No significant effects of omega-6 fatty acids were observed on DKD in type 2 diabetes or on any complications in type 1 diabetes. By contrast, omega-3 fatty acids showed no significant causal links with any of the diabetic microvascular complications assessed. Our MR analysis reveals a causal link between omega-6 fatty acids and certain diabetic microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes, potentially providing novel insights for further mechanistic and clinical investigations into diabetic microvascular complications.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,"Liu B, Liu R, Gu Y, Shen X, Zhou J, Luo C",6,2118,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Devastating macrovascular complications (cardiovascular disease) and microvascular complications (such as diabetic kidney disease, diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy) lead to increased mortality, blindness, kidney failure and an overall decreased quality of life in individuals with diabetes. Clinical risk factors and glycaemic control alone cannot predict the development of vascular complications; numerous genetic studies have demonstrated a clear genetic component to both diabetes and its complications. Early research aimed at identifying genetic determinants of diabetes complications relied on familial linkage analysis suited to strong-effect loci, candidate gene studies prone to false positives, and underpowered genome-wide association studies limited by sample size. The explosion of new genomic datasets, both in terms of biobanks and aggregation of worldwide cohorts, has more than doubled the number of genetic discoveries for both diabetes and diabetes complications.

Here, we evaluated and compared their prospective associations with the development of sight-threatening DR (STDR), another important diabetic microvascular complication. Baseline serum AFABP, PEDF, and FGF21 levels were measured in 4760 Chinese individuals with type 2 diabetes and without STDR at baseline. The associations of these biomarkers with incident STDR were analyzed using Cox regression analysis. Among these 4760 participants (mean diabetes duration of 11 years and ≥ 50% with nonproliferative DR at baseline), 172 participants developed STDR over a median follow-up of 8.8 years. Participants with incident STDR had comparable baseline serum FGF21 levels but significantly higher baseline serum AFABP and PEDF levels (both P < .001) than those without. However, in multivariable Cox regression analysis, only serum AFABP remained independently associated with incident STDR (hazard ratio 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05-1.55; P = .013). The addition of serum AFABP to a clinical model of conventional STDR risk factors including diabetes duration, glycemic control, albuminuria, and baseline DR status significantly improved the c statistics (P < .001), net reclassification index (P = .0027), and integrated discrimination index (P = .033) in predicting incident STDR among participants without DR or with mild DR at baseline.

In-hospital screening for hyperglycaemia may present a valuable opportunity for early diabetes diagnosis by identifying at-risk individuals. This systematic review investigates the extent to which random blood glucose testing in acute and inpatient hospital settings predicts undiagnosed diabetes. Two databases were systematically searched for studies in which adult patients received an in-hospital random blood glucose test, followed by a diagnostic HbA1c test. The primary outcome was the proportion of hyperglycaemic individuals diagnosed with diabetes by HbA1c. A total of 3245 unique citations were identified, and 12 were eligible for inclusion. Ten different blood glucose thresholds, ranging from 5.5 to 11.1 mmol/L, were used to detect hyperglycaemia, indicating that there is no consistent clinical definition for hyperglycaemia. The proportion of participants with hyperglycaemia in each study ranged from 3.3% to 62.1%, with a median (Q<sub>1</sub> , Q<sub>3</sub> ) of 34.5% (5.95%, 61.1%).

Meta-analysis was not possible due to substantial heterogeneity between study protocols. All studies consistently identified a proportion of hyperglycaemic hospital patients as having a diabetes-range HbA1c, showing that in-hospital blood glucose screening can facilitate diabetes diagnosis. The proportion of hyperglycaemic participants with undiagnosed diabetes varied substantially, indicating a need for further research and consistency in defining in-hospital hyperglycaemia.

39541789,Diabetes and the associated complications: The role of antioxidants in diabetes therapy and care.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). Poorly managed diabetes can lead to complications affecting multiple organ systems. Antioxidants play a crucial role in reducing oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), primarily triggered by uncontrolled high blood sugar levels in diabetes. Antioxidants like vitamin C, E, selenium, and alpha-lipoic acid, when used as supplements, have shown promise in reducing oxidative stress markers and improving antioxidant status in laboratory and animal studies and diabetic patients. Antioxidant supplementation may help reduce the risk of diabetic complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, antioxidants also have anti-inflammatory properties, which could be beneficial in reducing inflammation associated with diabetes. Antioxidant supplementation has been shown to enhance endothelial function, insulin sensitivity, and glucose metabolism, thereby aiding in glycemic control and overall diabetic management. Combining antioxidants with certain medications may have therapeutic benefits, such as effectively neutralizing free radicals and enhancing the regulation of antioxidant defense systems. This review presents an update on diabetes, the sources of free radical generation, the body's natural defense mechanisms, the clinical evidence regarding using antioxidants in managing diabetic complications, and the potential new therapeutic approaches. Overall, antioxidant supplementation may offer some benefits in managing diabetic complications.

Early diagnosis and timely management is vital in preventing the progression of the disease which may require amputation. Conventional methods take a long time for healing. This study aims to compare negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) and conventional saline dressings in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) healing. This prospective randomized study was conducted in 45 patients with grade 1 and 2 DFUs. 22 patients in group A received NPWT and 23 patients in group B received saline dressings. The formation of granulation tissue, reduction in ulcer size, duration of hospital stay and time for complete healing of wounds were assessed. The formation of granulation tissue (91.14 vs 52.61%, p < 0.001) and reduction in ulcer size (40.78 vs 21.18%, p = 0.008) at 14 days was significantly more in group A.

Orem self-care model can reduce the diabetic symptoms and improve the quality of life, self-efficacy and self-care in these patients.",Investigacion y educacion en enfermeria,2024-Mar,"Jandaghian Bidgoli M, Jamalnia S, Pashmforosh M, Shaterian N, Darabiyan P, Rafi A",6,1170,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35229798,Nondiabetic Renal Pathology in Biopsies of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients: Changing Trends and the Clinical Factors Predicting These Lesions.,"The underlying histopathology of diabetic kidney disease is classically described as diabetic glomerulosclerosis (DGS). Over the years, it has been noted that kidney biopsies in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are revealing lesions other than DGS because of the changing natural history of diabetic kidney disease. A retrospective study of all kidney biopsies in T2DM patients over a three-year period submitted to the Pathology Departments of Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad, and Yashoda Hospitals, Secunderabad, India, was analyzed. The clinical data were analyzed for the type of biopsy lesions and the clinical predictors of nondiabetic renal pathology in these biopsies. The result of this study was compared with another study published by one of the authors in 2006. A total of 1029 biopsies were obtained from the records. Pure DGS was seen in 341 (33.1%) and nondiabetic renal lesions were seen in 482 (46.8%) biopsies. The most common histological lesion in the isolated nondiabetic renal disease group was interstitial nephritis (acute and chronic). Incidence of minimal change disease and membranous nephropathy is significantly less in the current cohort. The factors which were predictive of isolated nondiabetic lesions were short duration of diabetes and renal failure (unexplained/rapid deterioration). 66.9% of biopsies show nondiabetic-renal lesion histopathology in T2DM patients. This offers the clinician an opportunity to consider specific treatment wherever possible.","Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",2021-,"Kumar R, Anandh U, Gowrishankar S, Gupta K, Jadhav S",5,1496,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38859547,Closing the policy gap in diabetes care for individuals with advanced CKD.,"The co-existence of diabetes and CKD poses significant challenges to healthcare systems, current frameworks often inadequately address the complex needs of individuals with both conditions. Recognising these gaps, we introduced a new diabetes care model for people with advanced CKD in renal satellite units.This paper aims to evaluate this new diabetes model care. We conducted a prospective audit of a new integrated diabetes kidney care model. Data were presented as mean ± SD or counts/percentages, and pre- and post-intervention differences were assessed using paired samples t-tests. A total of 291 individuals with diabetes and advanced CKD stages 4 or 5, or undergoing haemodialysis, were included. The mean age was 68.5 (±13.0) years, 58.4% were males. Nearly half of the cohort had four or more long-term conditions, while two-thirds experienced mild/severe frailty. Only 6% were receiving ongoing diabetes care from secondary care diabetes specialist services. For patients with CKD not receiving dialysis, comparing pre- and post-intervention, there were improvements in HbA1c (-13.0 mmol/mol, p < 0.001), SBP (-13.7 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), and weight (-2.9 kg, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, there was an increase in guideline-directed therapies, with notable usage of SGLT2i (62.9%) and GLP1-RA (28.4%), while access to diabetes technology increased to 89%. This new model of care resulted in improved metabolic outcomes, increased utilisation of guideline-directed therapies, and enhanced access to diabetes technologies. However, the model also revealed significant unmet clinical needs in areas such as access to diabetes care, diabetes eye screening and foot surveillance.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2025-Feb,"Habte-Asres HH, Rosenthal M, Nitsch D, Wheeler DC",4,1681,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34489872,Roles and Mechanisms of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 Inhibitors in Vascular Aging.,"Vascular aging is characterized by alterations in the constitutive properties and biological functions of the blood vessel wall. Endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are indispensability elements in the inner layer and the medial layer of the blood vessel wall, respectively. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, as a hypoglycemic agent, play a protective role in reversing vascular aging regardless of their effects in meliorating glycemic control in humans and animal models of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through complex cellular mechanisms, including improving EC dysfunction, promoting EC proliferation and migration, alleviating EC senescence, obstructing EC apoptosis, suppressing the proliferation and migration of VSMCs, increasing circulating endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) levels, and preventing the infiltration of mononuclear macrophages. All of these showed that DPP4 inhibitors may exert a positive effect against vascular aging, thereby preventing vascular aging-related diseases. In the current review, we will summarize the cellular mechanism of DPP4 inhibitors regulating vascular aging; moreover, we also intend to compile the roles and the promising therapeutic application of DPP4 inhibitors in vascular aging-related diseases.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2021-,"Cao F, Wu K, Zhu YZ, Bao ZW",4,1289,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38800472,Meta-analysis shows that mesenchymal stem cell therapy can be a possible treatment for diabetes.,"This meta-analysis includes the systematic literature review and meta-analysis involving clinical trials to assess the efficacy and safety of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation for treating T1DM and T2DM. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov, and Cochrane Library for ""published"" research from their inception until November 2023. Two researchers independently reviewed the studies' inclusion and exclusion criteria. Our meta-analysis included 13 studies on MSC treatment for diabetes. The MSC-treated group had a significantly lower HbA1c at the last follow-up compared to the baseline (MD: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.33 to 1.57, <i>P</i>-value: 0.003< 0.05), their insulin requirement was significantly lower (MD: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.31, <i>P</i>-value: 0.002< 0.05), the level of FBG with MSC transplantation significantly dropped compared to baseline (MD: 1.78, 95% CI: -1.02 to 4.58, <i>P</i>-value: 0.212), the FPG level of the MSC-treated group was significantly lower (MD: -0.77, 95% CI: -2.36 to 0.81, <i>P</i>-value: 0.339 > 0.05), and the fasting C-peptide level of the MSC-treated group was slightly high (MD: -0.02, 95% CI: -0.07 to 0.02, <i>P-</i>value: 0.231 > 0.05). The transplantation of MSCs has been found to positively impact both types of diabetes mellitus without signs of apparent adverse effects.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,"Habiba UE, Khan N, Greene DL, Ahmad K, Shamim S, Umer A",6,1356,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34057150,Circular RNAs in cancer and diabetes.,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNA molecules formed by the back splicing process. Compared to linear mRNA molecules they are more stable. CircRNA acts as miRNA sponges, regulates translation, epigenetic alterations, etc. However, the most significant aspect of circRNAs has been its role in regulating the hallmark of cancer and diabetes mellitus. Several circRNAs are extensively expressed in individuals with cancer and diabetics. Dysregulated expression of various circRNAs plays a crucial part in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the present review, we present the current understanding of cricRNAs biogenesis, regulatory mechanisms, reviews of recent findings and circRNA as potential biomarker.",Journal of genetics,2021-,"Hatibaruah A, Rahman M, Agarwala S, Singh SA, Shi J, Gupta S, Paul P",7,734,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36921945,Effect of general health checks on the treatment of chronic diseases: accounting for self-selection in the retrospective cohort study using Korea National Health Insurance data.,"This study examines the effect of general health checks on the detection and treatment of diabetes and hypertension with controlling for the self-selection problem of undergoing general health checks. Retrospective observational cohort study. Sample Research Database offered by Korean National Health Insurance Service, between 2002 and 2013. Two datasets, focusing on diabetes and hypertensions one by one, are constructed. The number of participants for the datasets is 133 329 (diabetes) and 101 738 (hypertension), respectively. A bivariate probit model with selection was adopted to investigate the impact of general health checks on the diagnosis of critical chronic diseases. The dependent variable was an indicator variable denoting whether a participant has been treated for diabetes (or hypertension) or not for the first time during the sample period. An indicator variable that indicates whether that participant is eligible for free general health checks or not in the focal year (year of the first treatment or last year in the sample) was used as instrument variables to control for the self-selection problem of undergoing general health checks. We found that there exists substantial self-selection between undergoing general health checks and diagnosis for chronic diseases. The correlations between the unobserved factors influencing the decisions to obtain general health checks and those determining the detection of chronic diseases are highly significant and positive (ie, 0.188 (p<0.001) in diabetes and 0.220 (p<0.001) in hypertension). We confirmed that these positive, significant correlations generate upward bias in the estimated effect of general health checks on the detection and treatment of diabetes (0.312 (p<0.001) when self-selection ignored but 0.099 (p<0.001) when self-selection considered) and hypertension (0.293 (p<0.001) when self-selection ignored but insignificant when self-selection considered). The effect of general health checks and people's self-selection behaviour may differ by socio-economic characteristics of individuals. The general health check is effective in detecting chronic diseases among low-income individuals rather than high-income individuals, implying that general health checks are contributing to helping medically underprivileged low-income people detect and treat their chronic diseases. High-income individuals showed stronger self-selection behaviour than low-income individuals and this may overstate the effect of general health checks if the self-selection is overlooked, particularly among high-income individuals. Self-selection due to unobserved factors between undergoing general health checks and diagnosis of chronic diseases are substantial. After accounting for this, the effect of general health checks on the detection and treatment of diabetes and hypertension is insignificant or marginal. The increases in the treatments of the two diseases following general health checks are 1% and insignificant in diabetes and hypertension, respectively.",BMJ open,2023-Mar,"Yoon S, Jun DB, Park S",3,3034,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
