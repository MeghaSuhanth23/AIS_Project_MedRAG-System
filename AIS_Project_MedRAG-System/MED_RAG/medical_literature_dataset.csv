32370835,Artificial Intelligence in Cardiology: Present and Future.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is a nontechnical, popular term that refers to machine learning of various types but most often to deep neural networks. Cardiology is at the forefront of AI in medicine. For this review, we searched PubMed and MEDLINE databases with no date restriction using search terms related to AI and cardiology. Articles were selected for inclusion on the basis of relevance. We highlight the major achievements in recent years in nearly all areas of cardiology and underscore the mounting evidence suggesting how AI will take center stage in the field. Artificial intelligence requires a close collaboration among computer scientists, clinical investigators, clinicians, and other users in order to identify the most relevant problems to be solved. Best practices in the generation and implementation of AI include the selection of ideal data sources, taking into account common challenges during the interpretation, validation, and generalizability of findings, and addressing safety and ethical concerns before final implementation. The future of AI in cardiology and in medicine in general is bright as the collaboration between investigators and clinicians continues to excel.",Mayo Clinic proceedings,2020-May,"Lopez-Jimenez F, Attia Z, Arruda-Olson AM, Carter R, Chareonthaitawee P, Jouni H, Kapa S, Lerman A, Luong C, Medina-Inojosa JR, Noseworthy PA, Pellikka PA, Redfield MM, Roger VL, Sandhu GS, Senecal C, Friedman PA",17,1201,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
34338485,Machine learning for cardiology.,"This paper reviews recent cardiology literature and reports how artificial intelligence tools (specifically, machine learning techniques) are being used by physicians in the field. Each technique is introduced with enough details to allow the understanding of how it works and its intent, but without delving into details that do not add immediate benefits and require expertise in the field. We specifically focus on the principal Machine learning based risk scores used in cardiovascular research. After introducing them and summarizing their assumptions and biases, we discuss their merits and shortcomings. We report on how frequently they are adopted in the field and suggest why this is the case based on our expertise in machine learning. We complete the analysis by reviewing how corresponding statistical approaches compare with them. Finally, we discuss the main open issues in applying machine learning tools to cardiology tasks, also drafting possible future directions. Despite the growing interest in these tools, we argue that there are many still underutilized techniques: while neural networks are slowly being incorporated in cardiovascular research, other important techniques such as semi-supervised learning and federated learning are still underutilized. The former would allow practitioners to harness the information contained in large datasets that are only partially labeled, while the latter would foster collaboration between institutions allowing building larger and better models.",Minerva cardiology and angiology,2022-Feb,"Arfat Y, Mittone G, Esposito R, Cantalupo B, DE Ferrari GM, Aldinucci M",6,1510,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
32216916,Evaluation for Heart Transplantation and LVAD Implantation: JACC Council Perspectives.,"Timely referrals for transplantation and left ventricular assist device implantation play a key role in favorable outcomes in patients with advanced heart failure. Nonetheless, evaluation usually occurs at advanced heart failure centers and is obscured from referring physicians. The purposes of this review are to explain the decision-making process for candidacy for advanced therapies and to describe the potential impact of the new organ allocation algorithm on center decision making. The document first addresses the signs of advanced heart failure, specifically focusing on the importance of the syndrome of low cardiac output as a key feature of advanced heart failure, and then summarizes the evaluation as a 3-step process addressing the following questions: 1) Is transplantation or durable assist device placement indicated? 2) Are there contraindications to either intervention? 3) How can one choose between transplantation and left ventricular assist device implantation if advanced therapies are indicated and not contraindicated?",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2020-Mar,"Guglin M, Zucker MJ, Borlaug BA, Breen E, Cleveland J, Johnson MR, Panjrath GS, Patel JK, Starling RC, Bozkurt B",10,1046,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

39127953,2024 Update to the 2020 ACC/AHA Clinical Performance and Quality Measures for Adults With Heart Failure: A Report of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Joint Committee on Performance Measures.,"This document describes performance measures for heart failure that are appropriate for public reporting or pay-for-performance programs and is meant to serve as a focused update of the ""2020 ACC/AHA Clinical Performance and Quality Measures for Adults With Heart Failure: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Performance Measures."" The new performance measures are taken from the ""2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines"" and are selected from the strongest recommendations (Class 1 or Class 3). In contrast, quality measures may not have as much evidence base and generally comprise metrics that might be useful for clinicians and health care organizations for quality improvement but are not yet appropriate for public reporting or pay-for-performance programs. New performance measures include optimal blood pressure control in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and the use of guideline-directed medical therapy in hospitalized patients. New quality measures include the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure with mildly reduced and preserved ejection fraction, the optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy prior to intervention for chronic secondary severe mitral regurgitation, continuation of guideline-directed medical therapy for patients with heart failure with improved ejection fraction, identifying both known risks for cardiovascular disease and social determinants of health, patient-centered counseling regarding contraception and pregnancy risks for individuals with cardiomyopathy, and the need for a monoclonal protein screen to exclude light chain amyloidosis when interpreting a bone scintigraphy scan assessing for transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis.",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2024-Sep,"Kittleson MM, Breathett K, Ziaeian B, Aguilar D, Blumer V, Bozkurt B, Diekemper RL, Dorsch MP, Heidenreich PA, Jurgens CY, Khazanie P, Koromia GA, Van Spall HGC",13,2066,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

34895982,Artificial intelligence and cardiology: Current status and perspective.,"The development of artificial intelligence (AI) began in the mid-20th century but has been rapidly accelerating in the past decade. Reflecting the development of digital health over the past few years, this trend is also seen in medicine. The field of cardiovascular medicine uses a wide variety and a large amount of biosignals, so there are many situations where AI can contribute. The development of AI is in progress for all aspects of the healthcare system, including the prevention, screening, and treatment of diseases and the prediction of the prognosis. AI is expected to be used to provide specialist-level medical care, even in a situation where medical resources are scarce. However, like other medical devices, the concept and mechanism of AI must be fully understood when used; otherwise, it may be used inappropriately, resulting in detriment to the patient. Therefore, it is important to understand what we need to know as a cardiologist handling AI. This review introduces the basics and principles of AI, then shows how far the current development of AI has come, and finally gives a brief introduction of how to start the AI development for those who want to develop their own AI.",Journal of cardiology,2022-Mar,"Nakamura T, Sasano T",2,1199,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

39298665,2024 updated European Heart Rhythm Association core curriculum for physicians and allied professionals: a statement of the European Heart Rhythm Association of the European Society of Cardiology.,"Heart rhythm management is a continuously evolving sub-speciality of cardiology. Every year, many physicians and allied professionals (APs) start and complete their training in cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) or electrophysiology (EP) across the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) member countries. While this training ideally ends with an EHRA certification, the description of the learning pathway (what, how, when, and where) through an EHRA core curriculum is also a prerequisite for a successful training. The first EHRA core curriculum for physicians was published in 2009. Due to the huge developments in the field of EP and device therapy, this document needed updating. In addition, a certification process for APs has been introduced, as well as a recertification process and accreditation of EHRA recognized training centres. Learning pathways are more individualized now, with Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) to monitor learning progression of trainees. The 2024 updated EHRA core curriculum for physicians and APs describes, for both CIED and EP, the syllabus, OSATS, training programme and certification, and recertification for physicians and APs and stresses the importance of continued medical education after certification. In addition, requirements for accreditation of training centres and trainers are given. Finally, suggested reading lists for CIED and EP are attached as online supplements.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",2024-Nov,"Trines SA, Moore P, Burri H, Gonçalves Nunes S, Massoullié G, Merino JL, Paton MF, Porta-Sánchez A, Sommer P, Steven D, Whittaker-Axon S, Yorgun H, Arribas F, Claude Deharo J, Steffel J, Wolpert C",16,1463,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Despite the recent frenzy and uptick in AI research over the past decade, the integration of AI into medical practice is in its early stages. Cardiology stands to benefit due to its many diagnostic modalities and diverse treatments. AI methods have been applied to various domains within cardiology: imaging, electrocardiography, wearable devices, risk prediction, and disease classification. While many AI-based approaches have been developed that perform equal to or better than the state-of-the-art, few prospective randomized studies have evaluated their use.

32284113,Nuclear Cardiology in Asia.,"Nuclear cardiology for patients with ischemic heart disease and cardiac failure is expanding in Asia, although quite heterogeneously. In Asia, Israel showed the highest utilization with more than 1000 scans/100,000 inhabitants a year followed by Korea, Japan, UAE, Turkey, Australia (250-999 scans/100,000). Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Jordan, Lebanon, Iran, and Pakistan practiced 60-99 scans/100,000. Most of South East Asian countries, China, India, and Bangladesh practiced 1-50 scans/100,000 per year. Countries in Central Asia, Mongolia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Lao, Myanmar, Nepal, and Bhutan showed limited use or no nuclear cardiology practice. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in Asia was characterized by more frequent use of <sup>201</sup>Tl, less use of weight-based <sup>99m</sup>Tc dosing, and a trend toward a lower rate of stress-only imaging. Accordingly, the effective dose in nuclear cardiology practices was higher than those of the rest of the world. <sup>99</sup>Mo-<sup>99m</sup>Tc generators are available in most countries, relying mainly on the global supply chain because there is little supply chain beyond countries within the region. In practice, the threshold values of left ventricular ejection fraction, end-systolic volume, and end-diastolic volume between normal and pathologic states were set based on the regional normal database in China and Japan because these values were dependent on age, gender, and body weight. The purpose of the MPI SPECT study was to evaluate myocardial ischemia in symptomatic patients with chest pain, effects of percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass-graft, and cardiac function in patients with chronic heart failure. The ability of <sup>99m</sup>Tc-based MPI for predicting hard cardiac events was confirmed in Asian inhabitants with low risk of ischemic heart disease. Human resource development of nuclear medicine professional and public awareness of nuclear medicine is key issues to promote nuclear cardiology in Asia. International organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and academic organizations in the region such as Asia Oceania Federation of Nuclear Medicine and Biology, Asia Regional Cooperative Council for Nuclear Medicine, East Asia Nuclear Medicine Association, and Arab Society of Nuclear Medicine have an important role in addition to national Societies of Nuclear Medicine in each country and region.",Seminars in nuclear medicine,2020-May,"Hatazawa J, Sabih D, Li Y, Pradhan PK, Paez D",5,2425,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

A structured and approved questionnaire was circulated to national delegates of Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology in 33 European countries. Delegates from 30 countries (91%) responded. Paediatric cardiology was not recognised as a distinct speciality by the respective ministry of Health in seven countries (23%). Twenty countries (67%) have formally accredited paediatric cardiology training programmes, seven (23%) have substantial informal (not accredited or certified) training, and three (10%) have very limited or no programme. Twenty-two countries have a curriculum. Twelve countries have a national training director. There was one paediatric cardiology centre per 2.66 million population (range 0.87-9.64 million), one cardiac surgical centre per 4.73 million population (range 1.63-10.72 million), and one training centre per 4.29 million population (range 1.63-10.72 million population). The median number of paediatric cardiology fellows per training programme was 4 (range 1-17), and duration of training was 3 years (range 2-5 years). An exit examination in paediatric cardiology was conducted in 16 countries (53%) and certification provided by 20 countries (67%). Paediatric cardiologist number is affected by gross domestic product (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.41). Training varies markedly across European countries. Although formal fellowship programmes exist in many countries, several countries have informal training or no training. Only a minority of countries provide both exit examination and certification.

34987062,Diagnostic reasoning in cardiovascular medicine.,"Research in cognitive psychology shows that expert clinicians make a medical diagnosis through a two step process of hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing. Experts generate a list of possible diagnoses quickly and intuitively, drawing on previous experience. Experts remember specific examples of various disease categories as exemplars, which enables rapid access to diagnostic possibilities and gives them an intuitive sense of the base rates of various diagnoses. After generating diagnostic hypotheses, clinicians then test the hypotheses and subjectively estimate the probability of each diagnostic possibility by using a heuristic called anchoring and adjusting. Although both novices and experts use this two step diagnostic process, experts distinguish themselves as better diagnosticians through their ability to mobilize experiential knowledge in a manner that is content specific. Experience is clearly the best teacher, but some educational strategies have been shown to modestly improve diagnostic accuracy. Increased knowledge about the cognitive psychology of the diagnostic process and the pitfalls inherent in the process may inform clinical teachers and help learners and clinicians to improve the accuracy of diagnostic reasoning.

35165744,PATIENT AND STAFF DOSES FOR VARIOUS INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY AND CARDIOLOGY EXAMINATIONS IN TURKEY.,"This study aims to determine the radiation doses of patients and staff during different interventional radiology and cardiology examinations. Dose measurements for interventional radiology examinations were performed in Ibn-i Sina Hospital of Ankara University using Siemens Artis-Zee medical imaging system. Patient dose measurement was carried out for interventional cardiology examinations in Cardiology Department of TOBB-ETU University, Medical Faculty Hospital using Philips Allura Centron interventional X-ray system. Patient doses were obtained in terms of kerma area product (KAP) and cumulative air kerma (CAK) from KAP meter attached to the angiography system. Performance tests of the angiography system were performed before patient dose measurements. Staff dose measurements were carried out with thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLD-100) placed in certain areas on the staff. Patient dose measurements were performed for 15 different interventional radiology examinations on a total of 431 patients and for four different cardiology examinations on a total of 299 patients. Monte Carlo based PCXMC 2.0 program was used to calculate patient effective doses. Lower extremity arteriography was the most common examination with a mean KAP value of 30 Gy cm2 and mean effective dose value of 1.2 mSv for total number of 194 patients. Mean KAP values calculated for coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention, electrophysiological procedures and radiofrequency cardiac ablation examinations were 62.8, 162.8, 16.7 and 70.6 Gy cm2, respectively. Radiologist, nurse and technician effective dose normalised to the unit KAP of patient dose were 0.15, 0.11 and 0.14 μSv Gy-1 cm-2. Similarly, cardiologist, nurse and technician effective dose normalised to the unit KAP of patient dose were 0.22, 0.15 and 0.09 μSv Gy-1 cm-2.

35171443,Artificial Intelligence to Improve Risk Prediction with Nuclear Cardiac Studies.,"As machine learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) continues to revolutionize the way in which we analyze data, the field of nuclear cardiology provides fertile ground for the implementation of these complex analytics. This review summarizes and discusses the principles regarding nuclear cardiology techniques and AI, and the current evidence regarding its performance and contribution to the improvement of risk prediction in cardiovascular disease. There is a growing body of evidence on the experimentation with and implementation of machine learning-based AI on nuclear cardiology studies both concerning SPECT and PET technology for the improvement of risk-of-disease (classification of disease) and risk-of-events (prediction of adverse events) estimations. These publications still report objective divergence in methods either utilizing statistical machine learning approaches or deep learning with varying architectures, dataset sizes, and performance.

35908002,Application of Medical Knowledge Graphs in Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine: A Brief Literature Review.,"A knowledge graph is defined as a collection of interlinked descriptions of concepts, relationships, entities and events. Medical knowledge graphs have been the most recent advances in technology, therapy and medicine. Nowadays, a number of specific uses and applications rely on knowledge graphs. The application of the knowledge graph, another form of artificial intelligence (AI) in cardiology and cardiovascular medicine, is a new concept, and only a few studies have been carried out on this particular aspect. In this brief literature review, the use and importance of disease-specific knowledge graphs in exploring various aspects of Kawasaki disease were described. A vision of individualized knowledge graphs (iKGs) in cardiovascular medicine was also discussed. Such iKGs would be based on a modern informatics platform of exchange and inquiry that could comprehensively integrate biologic knowledge with medical histories and health outcomes of individual patients. This could transform how clinicians and scientists discover, communicate and apply new knowledge. In addition, we also described how a study based on the comprehensive longitudinal evaluation of dietary factors associated with acute myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease used a knowledge graph to show the dietary factors associated with cardiovascular diseases in Nurses' Health Study data. To conclude, in this fast-developing world, medical knowledge graphs have emerged as attractive methods of data storage and hypothesis generation. They could be a major and effective tool in cardiology and cardiovascular medicine and play an important role in reaching effective clinical decisions during treatment and management of patients in the cardiology department.",Advances in therapy,2022-Sep,"Wang H, Zu Q, Lu M, Chen R, Yang Z, Gao Y, Ding J",7,1757,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Key studies from the 2024 ESC Congress highlight advances in (CVD) management. Apolipoprotein A-1 infusions reduced risk in acute myocardial infarction patients with high LDL cholesterol. Plozasiran cut triglycerides and apolipoprotein C-III levels, lowering pancreatitis risk. A 14-year study linked smoking among youth to cardiac abnormalities. Baseline hsCRP, LDL-C, and Lp(a) were strong predictors of 30-year outcomes in women. Alternative LDL-lowering strategies matched high-intensity statins in effectiveness of LDL-C lowering and reduced diabetes risk. Early combination lipid lowering therapy improved outcomes post-myocardial infarction. Nordic and Mediterranean diets were linked to lower atherosclerotic CVD risk. The findings from the 2024 ESC Congress highlight significant advancements in CVD prevention, including novel lipid-lowering therapies, biomarker-based risk prediction, and lifestyle interventions.

Training-specific fears have been described in paediatric cardiology fellows but also have not been studied at multiple time points. This study aimed to measure burnout, training-specific fears, and professional fulfilment in paediatric cardiology fellows with the attention to time of year and year-of-training. This survey-based study included the Professional Fulfillment Index and the Impact of Events Scale as well as an investigator-designed Fellow Fears Questionnaire. Surveys were distributed at three-time points during the academic year to paediatric cardiology fellows at a large Midwestern training programme. Fellow self-reported gender and year-of-training were collected. Descriptive analyses were performed. 10/17 (59%) of fellows completed all surveys; 60% were female, 40% in the first-year class, 40% in the second-year class, and 20% in the third-year class. At least half of the fellows reported burnout at each survey time point, with lower mean professional fulfilment scores. The second-year class, who rotate primarily in the cardiac ICU, had higher proportions of burnout than the other two classes. At least half of fellows reported that they ""often"" or ""always"" worried about not having enough clinical knowledge or skills and about work-life balance. Paediatric cardiology fellows exhibit high proportions of burnout and training-specific fears.

Such pre-existing and developing cardiovascular diseases pose some of the greatest risks of morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer. Addressing the complex cardiovascular needs of these patients has become increasingly important, resulting in an imperative for an intersecting discipline: cardio-oncology. Over the past decade, there has been a remarkable rise of cardio-oncology clinics and service lines. This development, however, has occurred in a vacuum of standard practice and training guidelines, although these are being actively pursued.

33843546,Medical education and training within congenital cardiology: current global status and future directions in a post COVID-19 world.,"Despite enormous strides in our field with respect to patient care, there has been surprisingly limited dialogue on how to train and educate the next generation of congenital cardiologists. This paper reviews the current status of training and evolving developments in medical education pertinent to congenital cardiology. The adoption of competency-based medical education has been lauded as a robust framework for contemporary medical education over the last two decades. However, inconsistencies in frameworks across different jurisdictions remain, and bridging gaps between competency frameworks and clinical practice has proved challenging. Entrustable professional activities have been proposed as a solution, but integration of such activities into busy clinical cardiology practices will present its own challenges. Consequently, this pivot towards a more structured approach to medical education necessitates the widespread availability of appropriately trained medical educationalists, a development that will better inform curriculum development, instructional design, and assessment. Differentiation between superficial and deep learning, the vital role of rich formative feedback and coaching, should guide our trainees to become self-regulated learners, capable of critical reasoning yet retaining an awareness of uncertainty and ambiguity. Furthermore, disruptive innovations such as ""technology enhanced learning"" may be leveraged to improve education, especially for trainees from low- and middle-income countries. Each of these initiatives will require resources, widespread advocacy and raised awareness, and publication of supporting data, and so it is especially gratifying that Cardiology in the Young has fostered a progressive approach, agreeing to publish one or two articles in each journal issue in this domain.",Cardiology in the young,2022-Feb,"McMahon CJ, Tretter JT, Redington AN, Bu'Lock F, Zühlke L, Heying R, Mattos S, Krishna Kumar R, Jacobs JP, Windram JD",10,1838,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Yet, the adoption of unexplainable AI systems for cardiovascular imaging still raises significant legal and ethical challenges. We focus in particular on challenges posed by the unexplainable character of deep learning and other forms of sophisticated AI modelling used for cardiovascular imaging by briefly outlining the systems being developed in this space, describing how they work, and considering how they might generate outputs that are not reviewable by physicians or system programmers. We suggest that an unexplainable tendency presents 2 specific ethico-legal concerns: (1) difficulty for health regulators; and (2) confusion about the assignment of liability for error or fault in the use of AI systems.

In cardiology, particularly through electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, AI has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce the time needed for diagnosis. This systematic review explores the integration of AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) in ECG analysis, focusing on their impact on predictive diagnostics and treatment support in cardiology. A systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 framework, using four high-impact databases to identify studies from 2014 to -2024. The inclusion criteria included English-language journal articles and research papers that focused on AI applications in cardiology, specifically ECG analysis. Records were screened, duplicates were removed, and final selections were made on the basis of their relevance to AI-ECG integration for cardiac health. The review included 46 studies that met the inclusion criteria, covering diverse AI models such as CNNs, RNNs, and hybrid models. These models were applied to ECG data to detect and predict heart conditions such as arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. These findings indicate that AI-driven ECG analysis improves diagnostic accuracy and provides significant support for early diagnosis and personalized treatment. AI technologies, especially ML and DL, enhance ECG-based cardiology diagnostics by increasing accuracy, reducing diagnosis time, and supporting timely interventions and personalized care. Continued research in this area is essential to refine algorithms and integrate AI tools into clinical practice for improved patient outcomes in cardiology.",International journal of medical informatics,2025-Mar,"Oke OA, Cavus N",2,1741,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

35767021,Simulation Based Mastery Learning of Transesophageal Echocardiography.,"Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) education is part of pediatric cardiology fellow training. Simulation-based mastery learning (SBML) is an efficient and valuable education experience. The aim of this project was to equip trainees with the basic knowledge and skill required to perform a pediatric TEE. The secondary aim was to assess the utility of using SBML for pediatric TEE training. The target group is trainees from pediatric cardiology and cardiac anesthesia who participated in a TEE bootcamp. A baseline knowledge pretest was obtained. The knowledge session consisted of preparation via reading material, viewing recorded lectures and completing an iterative multiple-choice examination, which was repeated until a minimum passing score of 90% was achieved. The skills session involved a review of TEE probe manipulation and image acquisition, followed by rapid cycle deliberate practice using simulation to acquire TEE skills at 3 levels, advancing in complexity from level 1 to level 3. Eight individuals (7 pediatric cardiology fellows at varying training levels and one anesthesia attending) participated in the TEE bootcamp. All reached a minimum knowledge post test score of at least 90% before the skills session. All subjects reached mastery in TEE probe manipulation. All reached mastery in image acquisition for the skill level that they attempted (level 1-8/8, level 2-8/8, level 3-4/4, with 4 participants not attempting level 3). A TEE bootcamp using SBML is a powerful medical education strategy. SBML is a rigorous approach that can be used to achieve high and uniform TEE learning outcomes among trainees of different training levels and backgrounds.",Pediatric cardiology,2023-Mar,"Koenig P, Patel S, Cohen ER, Hauck A, Husain N, McGaghie WC",6,1681,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
37394485,Worldwide variation in cardiovascular magnetic resonance practice models.,"The use of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) for diagnosis and management of a broad range of cardiac and vascular conditions has quickly expanded worldwide. It is essential to understand how CMR is utilized in different regions around the world and the potential practice differences between high-volume and low-volume centers. CMR practitioners and developers from around the world were electronically surveyed by the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) twice, requesting data from 2017. Both surveys were carefully merged, and the data were curated professionally by a data expert using cross-references in key questions and the specific media access control IP address. According to the United Nations classification, responses were analyzed by region and country and interpreted in the context of practice volumes and demography. From 70 countries and regions, 1092 individual responses were included. CMR was performed more often in academic (695/1014, 69%) and hospital settings (522/606, 86%), with adult cardiologists being the primary referring providers (680/818, 83%). Evaluation of cardiomyopathy was the top indication in high-volume and low-volume centers (p = 0.06). High-volume centers were significantly more likely to list evaluation of ischemic heart disease (e.g., stress CMR) as a primary indicator compared to low-volume centers (p < 0.001), while viability assessment was more commonly listed as a primary referral reason in low-volume centers (p = 0.001). Both developed and developing countries noted cost and competing technologies as top barriers to CMR growth. Access to scanners was listed as the most common barrier in developed countries (30% of responders), while lack of training (22% of responders) was the most common barrier in developing countries. This is the most extensive global assessment of CMR practice to date and provides insights from different regions worldwide. We identified CMR as heavily hospital-based, with referral volumes driven primarily by adult cardiology. Indications for CMR utilization varied by center volume. Efforts to improve the adoption and utilization of CMR should include growth beyond the traditional academic, hospital-based location and an emphasis on cardiomyopathy and viability assessment in community centers.",Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,2023-Jul,"Sierra-Galan LM, Estrada-Lopez EES, Ferrari VA, Raman SV, Ferreira VM, Raj V, Joseph E, Schulz-Menger J, Chan CWS, Chen SSM, Cheng Y, De Lara Fernandez J, Terashima M, Albert TSE",14,2311,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
34742860,Beyond Wellness Monitoring: Continuous Multiparameter Remote Automated Monitoring of Patients.,"The pursuit of more efficient patient-friendly health systems and reductions in tertiary health services use has seen enormous growth in the application and study of remote patient monitoring systems for cardiovascular patient care. While there are many consumer-grade products available to monitor patient wellness, the regulation of these technologies varies considerably, with most products having little to no evaluation data. As the science and practice of virtual care continues to evolve, clinicians and researchers can benefit from an understanding of more comprehensive solutions capable of monitoring multiple biophysical parameters (eg, oxygen saturation, heart rate) continuously and simultaneously. These devices, herein referred to as continuous multiparameter remote automated monitoring (CM-RAM) devices, have the potential to revolutionise virtual patient care. Through seamless integration of multiple biophysical signals, CM-RAM technologies can allow for the acquisition of high-volume big data for the development of algorithms to facilitate early detection of negative changes in patient health status and timely clinician response.

37327916,Pediatric Cardiology Condolence Letter Writing: Does a Fellowship Curriculum Impact Practice?,"Condolence letter (CL) writing after the death of a child is an important opportunity for humanism. Pediatric cardiology fellowship training now recognizes the importance of palliative care, but rarely includes CL education, despite its fragile patient population. To address this professionalism gap, a formal CL writing curriculum was created and implemented in a pediatric cardiology fellowship. This study investigated the impact of the curriculum on pediatric cardiology CL writing, and broader CL practices and beliefs. Pediatric cardiology fellows at a high volume urban academic program from 2000 to 2022 were divided into two cohorts (exposure to CL curriculum [2014-2022] vs. no exposure [2000-2013]) and responded by anonymous electronic multiple choice and open ended survey to assess the CL curriculum and describe current CL practices and beliefs. Impact of curriculum elements was determined by ordinal ranking. A 5-point Likert scale was used to report physician behaviors. Chi-square tests of independence were utilized for group comparisons. The overall survey response rate was 59% (63/107). Cardiologists who participated in the curriculum (64%, 35/55) were more likely to report writing CLs (80% vs. 40%; P < 0.01). Impactful curriculum elements included the opportunity for all fellows to contribute to a CL (78%) and identifying a primary fellow to write the CL (66%). A majority (>75%) of curriculum participants agreed that formal teaching increased their frequency, ability, and comfort in writing CLs.

39001698,Current status and future directions in artificial intelligence for nuclear cardiology.,"Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is one of the most commonly ordered cardiac imaging tests. Accurate motion correction, image registration, and reconstruction are critical for high-quality imaging, but this can be technically challenging and has traditionally relied on expert manual processing. With accurate processing, there is a rich variety of clinical, stress, functional, and anatomic data that can be integrated to guide patient management. PubMed and Google Scholar were reviewed for articles related to artificial intelligence in nuclear cardiology published between 2020 and 2024. We will outline the prominent roles for artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to provide motion correction, image registration, and reconstruction. We will review the role for AI in extracting anatomic data for hybrid MPI which is otherwise neglected. Lastly, we will discuss AI methods to integrate the wealth of data to improve disease diagnosis or risk stratification.

Health care efforts across the world have been diverted to tackling the pandemic since early 2020. Hospitals and health care systems have undertaken major restructuring in an effort to deliver health care to an increasing number of patients affected by COVID-19. Although great focus has been placed on treating those individuals suffering from COVID-19, clinicians must simultaneously balance caring for patients who are not actively infected. In anticipation of an exponential increase in COVID-19 cases, health care systems developed strategies to channel available resources to meet the rapidly rising demands of COVID-19. This change was noticed significantly in the field of invasive cardiology as well. Many cardiac catheterization and electrophysiology (EP) laboratories canceled elective procedures to limit the burden on hospital resources and preserve personal protective equipment (PPE). Major societies published guidance statements delineating patient selection for procedures during the exponential phase of the pandemic growth. Patient care was triaged and those waiting for elective procedures were managed with expectant care or noninvasive approaches to preserve hospital resources and personnel.

An understanding of the basics of AI applications, their development, and challenges to their clinical implementation is important for clinicians to fully appreciate the possibilities of AI. Such a foundation would ensure that clinicians have a good grasp and realistic expectations for AI in medicine and prevent discrepancies between the promised and real-world impact. When quantifying the track record for AI applications in cardiology, we found that a substantial number of AI systems are never deployed in clinical practice, although there certainly are many success stories. Successful implementations shared the following: they came from clinical areas where large amount of training data was available; were deployable into a single diagnostic modality; prediction models generally had high performance in external validation; and most were developed as part of collaborations with medical device manufacturers who had substantial experience with implementation of new clinical technology. When looking into the current processes used for developing AI-based systems, we suggest that expanding the analytic framework to address potential deployment and implementation issues at project outset will improve the rate of successful implementation, and will be a necessary next step for AI to achieve its full potential in cardiovascular medicine.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2022-Feb,"Manlhiot C, van den Eynde J, Kutty S, Ross HJ",4,1490,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
36216603,"Representation of Women in Internal Medicine Specialties in North America, the United Kingdom, and Australasia: Cardiology's Outlier Status and the Importance of Diversity.","Decades of research demonstrate the value of workplace diversity. Reports from individual countries show that women are underrepresented in internal medicine workforces. However, large pooled international studies are not available. This study investigates the current representation of women in the internal medicine workforce internationally and identifies specialties in which underrepresentation is evident. Peer-reviewed studies, government reports, and medical association reports were used to determine proportions of specialists and doctors training in internal medical specialties and in comparator surgical specialties. Data were available from Australia, Canada, England, New Zealand, the United States, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. A total of 380,263 doctors were studied, including 268,822 practicing specialist physicians (also known as attendings or consultants) and 53,226 doctors in internal medicine specialty training programs (also known as residents, fellows, advanced trainees, or specialist registrar trainees). Among practicing physician specialists, the rate of representation of women was 35% (95,195/268,822, p <0.001). Among trainees, the rate of representation of women was 43% (22,728/53,226, p <0.001). Among physician specialties evaluated, cardiology (15%, 4,152 of 27,328), gastroenterology (20%, 3,765 of 18,893), and respiratory/critical care (24%, 5,255 of 21,870) had the lowest representations of women compared with men (p <0.001 for all). Cardiology and particularly the subspecialty of interventional cardiology were clear outliers as the internal medicine specialties with the lowest representation of women at practicing specialist and trainee levels. In conclusion, this study is the largest international study of women in internal medicine specialties. It found that cardiology, gastroenterology, and respiratory/critical care specialties have the most substantial underrepresentation of women.

Cardiovascular clinician and trainee knowledge and comfort with this topic, and the extent of implementation of an interdisciplinary approach to cardio-obstetrics, are unknown. Methods and Results We aimed to assess the current state of cardio-obstetrics knowledge, practices, and services provided by US cardiovascular clinicians and trainees. A survey developed in conjunction with the American College of Cardiology was circulated to a representative sample of cardiologists (N=311), cardiovascular team members (N=51), and fellows in training (N=139) from June 18, 2020, to July 29, 2020. Knowledge and attitudes about the provision of cardiovascular care to pregnant patients and the prevalence and composition of cardio-obstetrics teams were assessed. The widest knowledge gaps on the care of pregnant compared with nonpregnant patients were reported for medication safety (42%), acute coronary syndromes (39%), aortopathies (40%), and valvular heart disease (30%). Most respondents (76%) lack access to a dedicated cardio-obstetrics team, and only 29% of practicing cardiologists received cardio-obstetrics didactics during training. One third of fellows in training reported seeing pregnant women 0 to 1 time per year, and 12% of fellows in training report formal training in cardio-obstetrics. Conclusions Formalized training in cardio-obstetrics is uncommon, and limited access to multidisciplinary cardio-obstetrics teams and large knowledge gaps exist among cardiovascular clinicians.

TTE is a cost-effective first-line imaging modality to evaluate the cardiac remodeling due to long-term, intense training, previously known as the athlete's heart, and to rule out the presence of conditions at risk of sudden cardiac death, including cardiomyopathies, coronary artery anomalies, congenital, aortic and heart valve diseases. Moreover, TTE is useful for distinguishing physiological cardiac adaptations during intense exercise from pathological behavior due to an underlying CVD. In this expert opinion statement endorsed by the Italian Society of Sports Cardiology, we discussed common clinical scenarios where a TTE is required and conditions falling in the grey zone between the athlete's heart and underlying cardiomyopathies or other CVD.

Despite this, cardiology research commonly comes from affluent regions. This study assessed the authorship trends from LICs/LMICs in cardiology journals listed in PubMed from 2000 to 2022. The World Bank list was used to classify countries. The total number of articles published in the 138 cardiology journals was 529,359. The percentage of articles that included at least one author affiliated with LICs/LMICs institutions was 0.11 % and 2.23 %, respectively. Over the last decade, there has been an increase in the author's representation from LICs/LMICs; however, it is uneven, with some countries experiencing more significant increases (Zambia, Yemen, and Uganda for LICs, and India, Iran, and Lebanon for LMICs). Our findings highlight the inequity of research publication and invite our community to reflect on the need to develop strategies to improve representation from LICs/LMICs.",Current problems in cardiology,2024-Aug,"De Oliveira-Gomes D, Guilliod C, Gebran K, Martinez de Majo A, Lombardo G, Garcia R, Abadi V, Gulati M",8,1036,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
38521708,Artificial Intelligence in Nuclear Cardiology: An Update and Future Trends.,"Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), using either single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET), is one of the most commonly ordered cardiac imaging tests, with prominent clinical roles for disease diagnosis and risk prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI) could potentially play a role in many steps along the typical MPI workflow, from image acquisition through to clinical reporting and risk estimation. AI can be utilized to improve image quality, reducing radiation exposure and image acquisition times. Once images are acquired, AI can help optimize motion correction and image registration during image reconstruction or provide direct image attenuation correction. Utilizing these image sets, AI can segment a number of anatomic features from associated computed tomographic imaging or even generate synthetic attenuation imaging. Lastly, AI may play an important role in disease diagnosis or risk prediction by combining the large number of potentially important clinical, stress, and imaging-related variables. This review will focus on the most recent developments in the field, providing clinicians and researchers with a timely update on the field. Additionally, it will discuss future trends including applications of AI during multiple points of the typical MPI workflow to maximize clinical utility and methods to maximize the information that can be obtained from hybrid imaging.",Seminars in nuclear medicine,2024-Sep,"Miller RJH, Slomka PJ",2,1439,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
33133355,Maintenance of Competence in Cardiovascular Training and Practices: Worth the Effort?,"Americans expect their doctors to have the competence to deliver high-quality care and expect safeguards to be in place that assure their doctors are competent. However, competence requires knowledge, and people have trouble assessing their own knowledge and level of competence. Because external assessment is required, several organizations have taken on the roles of defining and assuring medical competence. For example, professional organizations such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC) have developed consensus documents that define core competencies for cardiologists. External organizations such as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) have defined training requirements for cardiologists, and the ABIM has developed a process to certify that physicians maintain their competence, although the process has generated considerable criticism from the profession. Recently, the ACC and ABIM have worked together to make the certification process less onerous and more meaningful.

32646264,Bias and Loss to Follow-Up in Cardiovascular Randomized Trials: A Systematic Review.,"Background Loss to follow-up (LTFU) is common in randomized controlled trials. However, its potential impact on primary outcomes from cardiovascular randomized controlled trials is not known. Methods and Results We conducted a prospective systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42019121959) for randomized controlled trials published in 8 leading journals over 5 years from January 2014 to December 2018. Extent, reporting, and handling of LTFU data were recorded, and the proportion of a trial's primary outcome results that lose statistical significance was calculated after making plausible assumptions for the intervention and control arms. These assumptions could drive differential treatment effects between the groups considering relative event incidence between LTFU participants and those included in the primary outcome. We identified 117 randomized controlled trials of which 91 (78%) trials reported LTFU, 23 (20%) reported no LTFU, and 3 (3%) trials did not report on whether LTFU occurred. The median percentage of study participants lost to follow-up was 2% (interquartile range, 0.33%-5.3%). Only 10 trials (9%) had a low cluster of risk factors for impairment in trial quality. The percentage of trials losing statistical significance varied from 2% when the relative event incidence for LTFU between the randomized groups was 1 for the intervention arm and 1.5 for the control arm to 16% when the relative event incidence was 3 for the intervention arm and 1 for the control arm. Conclusions Almost 1 in 6 (16%) cardiovascular randomized trials published in leading journals may have a change in the primary outcome if plausible assumptions are made about differential event rates of participants lost to follow up. There is scope for improvement arising from LTFU in randomized trials in cardiovascular medicine.

36440543,The development and efficacy of a paediatric cardiology fellowship online preparatory course.,"The transition from residency to paediatric cardiology fellowship is challenging due to the new knowledge and technical skills required. Online learning can be an effective didactic modality that can be widely accessed by trainees. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of a paediatric cardiology Fellowship Online Preparatory Course prior to the start of fellowship. The Online Preparatory Course contained 18 online learning modules covering basic concepts in anatomy, auscultation, echocardiography, catheterisation, cardiovascular intensive care, electrophysiology, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and cardiac surgery. Each online learning module included an instructional video with pre-and post-video tests. Participants completed pre- and post-Online Preparatory Course knowledge-based exams and surveys. Pre- and post-Online Preparatory Course survey and knowledge-based examination results were compared via Wilcoxon sign and paired t-tests. 151 incoming paediatric cardiology fellows from programmes across the USA participated in the 3 months prior to starting fellowship training between 2017 and 2019. There was significant improvement between pre- and post-video test scores for all 18 online learning modules. There was also significant improvement between pre- and post-Online Preparatory Course exam scores (PRE 43.6 ± 11% versus POST 60.3 ± 10%, p < 0.001). Comparing pre- and post-Online Preparatory Course surveys, there was a statistically significant improvement in the participants' comfort level in 35 of 36 (97%) assessment areas. Nearly all participants (98%) agreed or strongly agreed that the Online Preparatory Course was a valuable learning experience and helped alleviate some anxieties (77% agreed or strongly agreed) related to starting fellowship. An Online Preparatory Course prior to starting fellowship can provide a foundation of knowledge, decrease anxiety, and serve as an effective educational springboard for paediatric cardiology fellows.",Cardiology in the young,2023-Oct,"Motonaga KS, Sacks L, Olson I, Balasubramanian S, Chen S, Peng L, Feinstein JA, Silverman NH, Hanley FL, Axelrod DM, Krawczeski CD, Arunamata A, Kwiatkowski DM, Ceresnak SR",14,1990,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

39084856,"Cerebral angiography in outpatient endovascular centers: roadmap and lessons learned from interventional radiology, cardiology, and vascular surgery.","A growing proportion of percutaneous procedures are performed in outpatient centers. The shift from hospitals to ambulatory surgery centers and office-based laboratories has been driven by a number of factors, including declining reimbursements, increased patient demand, and competition for hospital resources. This transition has been dominated by the interventional radiology, cardiology, and vascular surgery fields. Cerebral angiography, in contrast, is still performed almost exclusively in a hospital-based setting, despite sharing many features with other endovascular procedures commonly performed in outpatient centers. As interest grows in performing cerebral angiography in outpatient endovascular centers, much can be learned from the decades of experience that our interventional colleagues have in the outpatient setting. In this article we examine the outpatient experience of other interventional fields and apply key principles to evaluate the prospect of outpatient neurointervention. The literature suggests that cerebral angiography can feasibly be performed in an outpatient center in both private and academic settings, as some groups have begun to do. Outpatient endovascular centers have helped to improve the patient experience, liberate inpatient resources, and control costs in other interventional fields, and might offer neurointerventionalists an opportunity to do the same.",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,2024-Jul,"Silva MA, Peterson EC",2,1405,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

The frequency of citation of a particular article is used to gauge its contribution and impact on the clinical world of practice and research. A thorough search of the literature showed a lack of bibliometric analysis on atrial fibrillation (AF). Thereby the main purpose of this study is to pinpoint the trend of the top 100 cited articles on AF. In June 2019, 2 databases, Scopus and Web of Science, were used to acquire the articles published on AF, which belonged to various genres including medicine, medical and interventional cardiology, electrophysiology, and thoracic surgery. The data were thoroughly reviewed and analyzed by 2 reviewers with regards to the number of citations for each article, publications per area, document type, first author name, country of origin, institute of origin, and year of publication. Approval of the Institutional Board Review was not required as we used publically available data retrospectively. The number of citations in the top 100 articles ranged from 622 to 6,641 times with an average citation of 1041.3 per article.

35411842,A multimedia paediatric cardiology assessment tool for medical students and general paediatric trainees: development and validation.,"Understanding how cardiovascular structure and physiology guide management is critically important in paediatric cardiology. However, few validated educational tools are available to assess trainee knowledge. To address this deficit, paediatric cardiologists and fellows from four institutions collaborated to develop a multimedia assessment tool for use with medical students and paediatric residents. This tool was developed in support of a novel 3-dimensional virtual reality curriculum created by our group. Educational domains were identified, and questions were iteratively developed by a group of clinicians from multiple centres to assess understanding of key concepts. To evaluate content validity, content experts completed the assessment and reviewed items, rating item relevance to educational domains using a 4-point Likert scale. An item-level content validity index was calculated for each question, and a scale-level content validity index was calculated for the assessment tool, with scores of ≥0.78 and ≥0.90, respectively, representing excellent content validity. The mean content expert assessment score was 92% (range 88-97%). Two questions yielded ≤50% correct content expert answers. The item-level content validity index for 29 out of 32 questions was ≥0.78, and the scale-level content validity index was 0.92. Qualitative feedback included suggestions for future improvement. Questions with ≤50% content expert agreement and item-level content validity index scores <0.78 were removed, yielding a 27-question assessment tool.

Nevertheless, its adoption and development are challenging. This review aims to provide an overview of current literature pertaining to the implementation of VBHC models used in cardiology, with a focus on cardiac electrophysiology. This scoping review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis for Scoping Reviews. The records included in this publication were relevant documents published in PubMed, Mendeley, and ScienceDirect. The search criteria were publications about VBHC in the field of cardiology and electrophysiology published between 2006 and 2023. The implementation of VBHC models in cardiology and electrophysiology is still in its infant stages. There is a clear need to modify the current organizational structure in order to establish cross-functional teams with the patient at the centre of care. The adoption of new reimbursement schemes is crucial to moving this process forward. The implementation of technologies for data analysis and patient management, among others, poses challenges to the change process. New VBHC models have the potential to improve the care process and patient experience while optimizing the costs. The implementation of this model has been insufficient mainly because it requires substantial changes in the existing infrastructures and local organization, the need to track adherence to guidelines, and the evaluation of the quality of life improvement and patient satisfaction, among others.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",2024-Aug,"Osoro L, Zylla MM, Braunschweig F, Leyva F, Figueras J, Pürerfellner H, Merino JL, Casado-Arroyo R, Boriani G",9,1679,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Gender disparities are striking in interventional cardiology (IC) and electrophysiology (EP) and in leadership. Left atrial appendage closure with the WATCHMAN device, as a novel procedure, is a lens into inequities. The purpose of this study was to identify the characteristics and prevalence of women (1) as early WATCHMAN implanters and (2) in related leadership. Data were collected on WATCHMAN implanters and hospitals from January 2017 to December 2018. The gender of physicians in leadership positions was identified via survey as Director of IC, Director of EP, and Chief of Cardiology. The Firth logistic model controlling for covariates modeled the rare event of a woman implanter. Data were obtained for 100% of the cohort. Men comprised 97% of implanters (860/886). No differences in subspecialty or implants by gender were observed. There were 414 hospitals performing WATCHMAN: 24% academic, 97% urban, and most medium/large size (94%). EP made up 61% of implanters. Only 4.8% of hospitals had women in selected leadership roles. Women represented <1% of Directors of IC and only 2.6% of both Directors of EP and Chiefs of Cardiology. Hospitals with a woman in leadership had a 4 times greater odds of a woman implanter (odds ratio 4.24; 95% confidence interval 1.16-15.41; P = .028).

34032156,Core Cardiology Training Symposium (COCATS) Standards and Board Certifications: Implications for Fellows-in-Training Seeking Employment.,"The Core Cardiology Training Symposium (COCATS) standards are recommendations endorsed by the American College of Cardiology to assist cardiology fellowship program training directors in curricular design. In addition to seeking COCATS standards as evidence of proficiency in cardiovascular skills, Fellows-In-Training (FITs) often pursue board certifications to maximize their hiring potential. The costs and barriers with COCATS standards and board certification processes are not insignificant, however the degree to which the job marketplace demands them has not been well characterized. The intent of this investigation study was to estimate the demand for COCATS standards and board certification in cardiology job advertisements. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of job listings on the American College of Cardiology's ""Cardiology Careers"" page, to establish how often advanced COCATS standards and certifications are requested. Of a total of 314 total cardiology job postings (including 133 academic positions), only eight (2.5%) job postings explicitly noted COCATS standards. Aside from American Board of Internal Medicine subspecialty certification, only 8.60% required certification in another cardiology related board certification. Despite the perception that COCATS standards and subspecialty certifications are vital to the cardiology job application process, our analysis suggests that few job postings require them. Concern regarding COCATS standards and subspecialty certification of FITs may be out of proportion to the relevance of these achievements on the current job market.",Evaluation & the health professions,2022-Dec,"Betageri O, Winchester D",2,1603,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
36223091,Professional Preferences and Perceptions of Cardiology Among Internal Medicine Residents: Temporal Trends Over the Past Decade.,"Internal medicine residents' professional development preferences were discordant with their perceptions of cardiology in a survey circulated a decade ago; no contemporary data exist. This information is important for effective recruitment and retention of a highly talented and diverse future cardiology workforce. To identify residents' professional development preferences and cardiology perceptions, in relation to specialty choice, and compare the findings with those from a decade prior. The original survey from the 2010 study was updated and sent to US internal medicine programs. Respondents (ie, internal medicine residents) rated 38 professional development preferences and 20 cardiology perceptions. Data were collected in 2020 and compared with survey results from the prior 2010 study. Multivariable models were created for specialty choice using scaled independent variables dichotomized using the top 2 options; categorical variables were recoded into binary variables for analysis. Multivariable models were used to determine the association of demographic characterisitcs and survey responses with prospective career choice. Responses were examined by total group, by gender, by self-reported consideration of entering cardiology as a profession, and by comparison with a decade prior both as a group and by gender. A total of 840 residents (mean [SD] age, 29.24 [2.82] years; 49.8% male; 55.4% White) completed the survey. The survey incorporated a 5-point Likert scale of 1 (not important) to 5 (extremely important) for some of the questions, with additional questions on demographic characteristics. The most important professional development preferences by descending Likert score were as follows: positive role models (4.56), stimulating career (3.81), and family friendly (3.78). The cardiology perception statements with the highest agreement were as follows: interferes with family life during training (3.93) and having met positive role models or having positive views of cardiovascular disease as a topic (3.85). Multivariable analysis yielded a 22-element model predicting cardiology as career choice. Compared with the 2010 survey, the findings of this survey indicated increased importance of work-life balance components for both male and female residents, with a greater change in male residents. Contemporary residents were more likely than their predecessors to agree with negative perceptions of cardiology. This survey study found that both male and female residents place a high value on support for optimal work-life balance; these preferences have intensified over the past decade and factor into career choice. Negative perceptions of cardiology persist and, in some aspects, are worsening.

34534619,Opening the Black Box: The Promise and Limitations of Explainable Machine Learning in Cardiology.,"Many clinicians remain wary of machine learning because of longstanding concerns about ""black box"" models. ""Black box"" is shorthand for models that are sufficiently complex that they are not straightforwardly interpretable to humans. Lack of interpretability in predictive models can undermine trust in those models, especially in health care, in which so many decisions are- literally-life and death issues. There has been a recent explosion of research in the field of explainable machine learning aimed at addressing these concerns. The promise of explainable machine learning is considerable, but it is important for cardiologists who may encounter these techniques in clinical decision-support tools or novel research papers to have critical understanding of both their strengths and their limitations. This paper reviews key concepts and techniques in the field of explainable machine learning as they apply to cardiology. Key concepts reviewed include interpretability vs explainability and global vs local explanations. Techniques demonstrated include permutation importance, surrogate decision trees, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations, and partial dependence plots. We discuss several limitations with explainability techniques, focusing on the how the nature of explanations as approximations may omit important information about how black-box models work and why they make certain predictions. We conclude by proposing a rule of thumb about when it is appropriate to use black- box models with explanations rather than interpretable models.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2022-Feb,"Petch J, Di S, Nelson W",3,1565,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Cardiologists are embracing simulation to master complex techniques in interventional cardiology, to manage crisis situations and unusual complications and to develop medical teamwork. Simulation methods in cardiology include high-fidelity simulators, clinical scenarios, serious games, hybrid simulation and virtual reality. Simulation involves all fields of cardiology: transoesophageal echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, coronary angioplasty and electrophysiology. Beyond purely technical issues, simulation can also enhance communication skills, by using standardized patients, and can improve the management of situations related to the announcement of serious diseases. In this review of recent literature, we present existing simulation modalities, their applications in different fields of cardiology and their advantages and limitations. Finally, we detail the growing role for simulation in the teaching of medical students following the recent legal obligation to use simulation to evaluate medical students in France.",Archives of cardiovascular diseases,2021-Jan,"Pezel T, Coisne A, Bonnet G, Martins RP, Adjedj J, Bière L, Lattuca B, Turpeau S, Popovic B, Ivanes F, Lafitte S, Deharo JC, Bernard A",13,1424,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
38621242,Cardiology: What You May Have Missed in 2023.,"Cardiology and all its subspecialties continue to push the envelope in developing new treatment strategies for a wide variety of diseases. After screening more than 1300 articles, we highlight a selection of important cardiology articles published in 2023. Starting with prevention, we note articles that look at the effect of semaglutide in patients with obesity as well as a first-in-class drug, bempedoic acid, on cardiovascular outcomes. We have also examined new evidence comparing conservative management with invasive management of frail, older patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). In patients with cardiac arrest secondary to NSTEMI, another article examines the rationale for expedited transfer to a cardiac arrest center. The STREAM-2 (Strategic Reperfusion in Elderly Patients Early After Myocardial Infarction) trial builds on looking at half-dose thrombolysis in older populations with STEMI. Emphasis is placed on guideline-directed medical therapy before hospital discharge in those with heart failure. In addition, in patients with stable symptomatic coronary artery disease, initial noninvasive testing using coronary computed tomography angiography may be a viable option compared with invasive strategies. More details have emerged on anticoagulation strategies in those with device-detected atrial fibrillation. Finally, transcatheter approaches to treat both mitral and tricuspid regurgitation have also been included.",Annals of internal medicine,2024-May,"Alfraih A, Tago A, Lacombe M, Kussmaul WG",4,1473,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
37721424,Principles of artificial intelligence and its application in cardiovascular medicine.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a rapidly developing field. Its use can improve diagnosis and therapy in many areas of medicine. Despite this enormous progress, many physicians perceive it as a black box and are skeptical about it. This review will present the basics of machine learning. Different classifications of artificial intelligence, such as supervised versus unsupervised and discriminative versus generative AI, are given. Analogies to human intelligence are discussed as far as algorithms are oriented toward it. In the second step, the most common models like random forest, k-means clustering, convolutional neural network, and transformers will be presented in a way that the underlying idea can be understood. Corresponding medical applications in cardiovascular medicine will be named for all models, respectively. The overview is intended to show that the term artificial intelligence covers a wide range of different concepts. It should help physicians understand the principles of AI to make up one's minds about its application in cardiology. It should also enable them to evaluate results obtained with AI's help critically.",Clinical cardiology,2024-Jan,"Wieneke H, Voigt I",2,1154,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
33444775,"The importance of capillary distribution in supporting muscle function, building on Krogh's seminal ideas.","Krogh's Nobel prize for insightful studies into the physiology of capillaries heralded a revolution in understanding that continues today. The view of passive conduits has been replaced by capillaries recognised as a key element in haemodynamic control, offering both a site where changes in tissue demand are sensed and a driver of integrated vascular responses. In addition, the capillary bed is known to play an important role in metabolic, hormonal and immune homeostasis. Not surprisingly, therefore, microvascular dysfunction is a hallmark of many central and peripheral diseases, leading to widespread morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is growing interest in how best to specifically target this organ-system by means of effective angiotherapies. Underpinning a lot of our current understanding of capillary physiology has been a recognition of functional heterogeneity among different microvascular beds. In addition, there is increasing awareness of the role that spatial heterogeneity plays in determining both physiological and pathological outcomes that has led to an appreciation that quality, rather than just quantity of microvascular supply is important. This has required a re-appraisal of the methods used to determine both the extent and topology of the capillary network, with the benefit of facilitating new ways of exploring dynamic regulation of capillary supply and its potential consequences.","Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

Differing viewpoints exist regarding the optimal pathway for CCC training. Currently, all proposed CCC training pathways involve permutations of individual training years culminating in subspecialty certification across multiple disciplines; however, there are significant disadvantages to these training paradigms. We propose an innovative, pragmatic approach to CCC training through tailored subspecialty training in advanced heart failure and transplant cardiology (AHFTC), using elective time to enrich AHFTC training with skills and experiences necessary to become a highly skilled critical care cardiologist. The completion of this pathway would lead to completion of AHFTC training with a novel designation: distinction in critical care cardiology.",Journal of cardiac failure,2022-Feb,"Carnicelli AP, Blumer V, Genovese L, Gage A, Agarwal R, Lakdawala NK, Bohula E, Katz JN",8,1012,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

The application of AI development is currently in its early stages, nevertheless new technologies have proven to be a promising concept, particularly considering IC showing great impact on patient safety, risk stratification and outcomes during the whole therapeutic process. The primary goal is to achieve the integration of multiple cardiac imaging modalities, establish online decision support systems and platforms based on augmented and/or virtual realities, and finally to create automatic medical systems, providing electronic health data on patients. In a simplified way, two main areas of AI utilization in IC may be distinguished, namely, virtual and physical. Consequently, numerous studies have provided data regarding AI utilization in terms of automated interpretation and analysis from various cardiac modalities, including electrocardiogram, echocardiography, angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography as well as data collected during robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention procedures.

Currently, there is no clear perception about the needs in cardiac electrophysiology and pacing among early-career cardiologists. To address these concerns, the Young Committee of the Italian Association of Arrhythmology and Cardiac Pacing (AIAC) carried out a survey among those under the age of 40 years to obtain detailed information on practical activities and formal lessons during the fellowship in cardiology and their satisfaction and proficiency level at the end of the fellowship. We obtained 334 answers to the survey. In invasive cardiac electrophysiology and pacing, the percentage of participants attending the activity for a longer time (3-6 months) is lower compared with those in noninvasive subspecialties. About 40% of participants did not receive lessons on interventional cardiology, cardiac electrophysiology and pacing. On the contrary, 71% of participants received an adequate number of lessons on clinical arrhythmology. The vast majority of the participants expressed satisfaction for the education received in the echocardiographic, cardiac interventional laboratories and clinical arrhythmology, but about half of the participants were unsatisfied with the education received in cardiac electrophysiology and pacing. In interventional arrhythmology, the majority of the participants declare their lack of proficiency with two peaks for more complex procedures, namely interventional electrophysiology procedures (82%) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) procedures (76%). The present survey among Italian early-career cardiologists suggests that the majority of participants consider themselves not confident in performing cardiac electrophysiology and pacing procedures. Due to the complexity of the treatment for heart rhythm disorders and the long learning curve, structured additional training in cardiac electrophysiology and pacing procedures is required after cardiology fellowship.","Journal of cardiovascular medicine (Hagerstown, Md.)",2021-Oct,"Russo V, Nesti M, Brunacci M, Tola G, Santobuono VE, Dendramis G, Picciolo G, Lucciola MT, D'Onofrio A, Ricci R, de Ponti R",11,2110,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Yet, costs of attending these conferences represent a major barrier, particularly for trainees and participants from low-middle-income countries (LMICs). Our study aimed to analyze the registration fees of major cardiology conferences worldwide. We included conferences organized by international cardiovascular societies and those representing global regions. We did not include individual national or institutional conferences due to inability to systematically identify them. We collected 2024 registration fees from official conference websites, taking 2023 or 2022 fees if unavailable, and categorized them according to career stage and society membership status. Where specified, we chose 'early-bird' fees. All fees were converted to US dollars according to currency exchange rates per the International Monetary Fund on December 4, 2023, or if unavailable, per the last reported US Treasury Data. Other data collected included host country, virtual option availability, and LMIC discounts. 30 (65.2 %) conferences provided discounts for medical students, regardless of membership status, while 1 (2.2 %) provided discounts only for student-members. 36 (78.2 %) conferences offered discounts for residents/fellows, while 2 (4.3 %) offered discounts only for resident/fellow-members. Median fees for students and residents/fellows with membership were $255 and $287 (in US dollars), respectively while median fees for non-members were $303.5 and $397, respectively. 31 (67.4 %) conferences provided discounts for staff- members. Median fees for staff were $701 and $800 for members and non-members, respectively. Only 12 (26.1 %) conferences mentioned a virtual component, with 11 offering discounted registration compared with in-person rates. 7 (15.2 %) conferences had special in-person fees for LMIC-based registrants. 5 offered the same discounted rate regardless of training stage, while 2 offered additional discounts for trainees. We found that conference registration costs were substantial, including for trainees, with only a minority of conferences providing discounted rates for LMICs. Professional societies must reduce registration costs, potentially by implementing a tiered system based on training stage and country of origin.

The personality of J.E. Purkynje caused this field to reach unprecedented peak at the very beginning of its modern history. The development of experimental cardiology after the death of the great scholar was certainly not linear. Just when it seemed to be raising its head, the German occupation came. Its second hopeful awakening was delayed for a long time by forty years of isolation. The significant limitation of foreign contacts gradually led to the loss of hopefully developing contacts, to professional isolation and lagging behind the stormy development of world science.

32278664,Local Diagnostic Reference Levels in Interventional Radiology.,"Interventional cardiology procedures, during which live images are acquired, involve exposure to x-rays. The use of fluoroscopy can cause high radiation doses to patients and operators because of the prolonged duration of x-ray emission. For this reason, special attention and constant vigilance represent challenges for commissions and groups of experts in the field. The purpose of this study is to establish local diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for these procedures, to improve radiological practice, and to optimize radiation doses. This work was carried out in two university hospitals and two private medical facilities in Rabat, the capital of Morocco, during the period 2017-2018. The study concerns 657 interventional cardiology procedures (457 coronary angiography [CA] and 200 percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [PTCA]), performed by 11 cardiologists on different installations in 5 catheterization rooms. The data collected for each procedure were patient age, height and weight, dosimeter indicators in terms of dose area product (P<sub>KA</sub>), total air kerma at the reference point (K<sub>ar</sub>), fluoroscopy time (FT), and the number of frames, together with the primary beam parameters as kV and total mAs. The proposed DRLs were set from the 75th percentile of the P<sub>KA</sub> and FT. The mean of P<sub>KA</sub> for CA and PTCA procedures were 29.2 Gy∗cm<sup>2</sup> and 70.4 Gy∗cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, the mean of fluoroscopy time were 4.0 min and 12.17 min for 334 and 685 frames, respectively. Results for the local DRLs were 37.3 and 87.1 Gy cm<sup>2</sup> for P<sub>KA</sub> and 4.48 and 16.15 min for FT, corresponding to CA and PTCA procedures.

37186563,Systematic basic and advanced resuscitation training in medical students and fellows: a proposal from the Working Group on Cardiovascular Urgences and Emergencies of the Italian Society of Cardiology.,"Sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in Europe. High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and guidelines compliance of rescuers have been associated with better outcomes after cardiac arrest. However, wide variability in attempting bystander CPR manoeuvres has been reported. Educational programmes for teaching CPR to medical students and fellows are highly advisable in this context. However, there is no homogeneity regarding the CPR education offered by academic institutions. We surveyed 208 Italian medical students and 162 fellows in cardiology regarding the educational offer and needs in CPR. Among the 11 medical schools surveyed, 8 (73%) offer basic (BLS) courses but only 3 (38%) with formal certification of 'BLS provider', while none offers advanced (ACLS/ALS) courses. Among the 30 specialization schools in cardiology surveyed, 10 (33%) offer a BLS course (6 with formal certification of 'BLS provider'), and 8 (27%) offer an ACLS/ALS course (5 with formal certification).

39506730,Study protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial on simulation-based communication training for pediatric cardiology trainees (SIMUL-CHD).,"Effective physician-patient communication is crucial to compassionate healthcare, particularly when conveying life-altering diagnoses such as those associated with congenital heart diseases. Despite its importance, medical practitioners often face challenges in communicating effectively. Because of these gaps, we aim to introduce a simulation-based training protocol to improve pediatric cardiology trainee's communication skills. This study will be conducted in collaboration with associations supporting caregivers of children with congenital heart disease. It strives to demonstrate how specific training programs can efficiently foster humanistic, patient-centered care in standard medical practice. This multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial will be conducted in pediatric cardiac units and simulation centers of across 10 universities in France. The study population comprises pediatric cardiologists in training (including pediatric cardiac fellows or specialist assistants). The SIMUL-CHD intervention will consist of simulation-based training with standardized patients, focusing on improving communication skills for pediatric cardiology trainees during diagnostic counselling. Patients and caregivers have been recruited from a National Patient Association named ""Petit Cœur de Beurre"". The primary outcome is the quality of physicians' communication skills. The evaluation committee, which will review video recordings of the sessions, will be blinded to which participants received simulation-based training (group of interest) and which received theory-based training (control group). Secondary outcomes are the effect of SIMUL-CHD on empathy and anxiety levels in young pediatric cardiologists. Baseline scores pre and post-intervention will be compared, and skill improvement resulting from the intervention measured. Simulation-based training has proven efficacy in teaching technical skills in various scenarios however its application to communication skills in pediatric cardiology remains unexplored. The involvement of experienced parents provides a unique perspective, incorporating their profound understanding of the emotional challenges and specific hurdles faced by families dealing with congenital heart disease. This trial is registered with the OSF registry (registered https://osf.io/ed78q ).",BMC medical education,2024-Nov,"Padovani P, Hauet Q, Lefort B, Chauviré-Drouard A, Letellier M, Bergé M, Marguin G, Titos M, Grain A, Babonneau ML, Michon CC, Trosdorf M, Lejus-Bourdeau C, Lwin N, Picot MC, Amedro P, Baruteau AE",17,2339,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

To evaluate the global needs and potential inequities as it relates to cardiac implantable electronic devices. ARROW (Assessment of Rhythm Resources arOund the World) is an online survey about cardiac implantable electronic devices, sent electronically to physicians within the field of Cardiology, Pediatric Cardiology, Electrophysiology and Pediatric Electrophysiology. ARROW received 42 responders from 28 countries, 50% from low-/middle-income regions. The main differences between low-/middle- and high-income regions include availability of expertise on paediatric electrophysiology (50% versus 93%, p < 00.5) and possibility to perform invasive procedures (35% versus 93%, p < 0.005). Implant of devices in low-income areas relies significantly on patient's resources (71%). The follow-up of the devices is on the hands of paediatric cardiologist/electrophysiologist in higher resources centres (93% versus 50%, p < 0.05). The ARROW survey represents an initial assessment of the geographical characteristics in the field of Pediatric Electrophysiology. The next step is to make this ""state of the art"" more extensive to other aspects of the expertise. The relevance of collecting this data before the World Congress of Pediatric Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery (WCPCCS) in 2023 in Washington DC was emphasised in order to share the resulting information with the international community and set a plan of action to assist the development of arrhythmia services for children within developing regions of the world.",Cardiology in the young,2022-Dec,"Gonzalez Corcia MC, Cohen MI, Paul T, Skinner JR, Shah M",5,1679,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
32608175,Improving cardiology fellow education of right heart catheterization using a simulation based curriculum.,"Medical procedures are traditionally taught informally at patients' bedside through observation and practice using the adage ""see one, do one, teach one."" This lack of formalized training can cause trainees to be unprepared to perform procedures independently. Simulation based education (SBE) increases competence, reduces complications, and decreases costs. We developed, implemented, and evaluated the efficacy of a right heart catheterization (RHC) SBE curriculum. The RHC curriculum consisted of a pretest, video didactics, deliberate practice, and a posttest. Pre-and posttest skills examinations consisted of a dichotomous 43-item checklist on RHC skills and a 14-item hemodynamic waveform quiz. We enrolled two groups of fellows: 6 first-year, novice cardiology fellows at Northwestern University in their first month of training, and 11 second- and third-year fellows who had completed traditional required, level I training in RHC. We trained the first-year fellows at the beginning of the 2018-2019 year using the SBE curriculum and compared them to the traditionally-trained cardiology fellows who did not complete SBE. The SBE-trained fellows significantly improved RHC skills, hemodynamic knowledge, and confidence from pre- to posttesting. SBE-trained fellows performed similarly to traditionally-trained fellows on simulated RHC skills checklists (88.4% correct vs. 89.2%, p = .84), hemodynamic quizzes (94.0% correct vs. 86.4%, p = .12), and confidence (79.4 vs. 85.9 out of 100, p = .15) despite less clinical experience. A SBE curriculum for RHC allowed novice cardiology fellows to achieve level I skills and knowledge at the beginning of fellowship and can train cardiology fellows before patient contact.",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2021-Feb,"Davidson LJ, Chow KY, Jivan A, Prenner SB, Cohen ER, Schimmel DR, McGaghie WC, Barsuk JH, Wayne DB, Sweis RN",10,1726,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

We use the perspective of a physician who is underrepresented in medicine (URiM), and has chosen to pursue a career in pediatric cardiology, to initiate an analysis of the current path toward pediatric cardiology and the factors in undergraduate and graduate medical education which could currently be optimized to improve diversity in training. We argue that a lack of diversity among physicians leads to worse patient outcomes, and we describe steps to improve representation in the field. In order to improve representation in pediatric cardiology, we must reflect upon our current practices and implement systemic changes within cardiology training program recruitment and retention practices. These changes should include continuous mentorship of URiM trainees interested in cardiology and prioritization of research that investigates social determinants of health which may disproportionally affect minority patients.",Pediatric cardiology,2024-Aug,"Ezeoke OM, Williams J, Ogueri V, Hills BK",4,1036,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
39549830,New horizons in nuclear cardiology: Imaging of peripheral arterial disease.,"Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) is characterized by impairment of blood flow associated with arterial stenosis and frequently coexisting microvascular disease and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Current diagnostic modalities have limited accuracy in early diagnosis, risk stratification, preprocedural assessment, and evaluation of therapy and are focused on the detection of obstructive atherosclerotic disease. Early diagnosis and assessment of both large vessels and microcirculation may improve risk stratification and guide therapeutic interventions. Single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography imaging have been shown to be accurate to detect changes in perfusion in preclinical models and clinical disease, and have the potential to overcome limitations of existing diagnostic modalities, while offering novel information about perfusion, metabolic, and molecular processes. This review provides a comprehensive reassessment of radiotracer-based imaging of PAD in preclinical and clinical studies, emphasizing the challenges that arise due to the complex physiology in the peripheral vasculature. We will also highlight the latest advancements, underscoring emerging artificial intelligence and big data analysis, as well as clinically relevant areas where the field could advance in the next decade.",Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology,2025-Apr,"Callegari S, Mena-Hurtado C, Smolderen KG, Thorn S, Sinusas AJ",5,1381,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

35272659,Developing a curriculum to improve cardiology fellows' training in pregnancy and cardiovascular disease.,"Exposure to pregnant women with cardiovascular disease (CVD) during cardiology fellowship training is limited and without a standard curriculum in the United States. The authors sought to evaluate a dedicated curriculum to teach management of CVD in pregnancy to improve general cardiology fellowship training. The authors developed a dedicated CVD in pregnancy curriculum for the general cardiology fellows at a large academic medical center in the fall of 2019. Fellows' knowledge was assessed via a board-style examination and exposure and attitudes related to the care of pregnant women with CVD were evaluated with a needs assessment questionnaire before and after the curriculum. Of the 17 fellows who participated in the curriculum, 12 completed the needs assessment pre-curriculum and 9 post-curriculum. The mean (SD) number of pregnant women with CVD cared for by each fellow in the inpatient and outpatient settings were 0.75 (1.29) and 0.56 (0.73), respectively. After the curriculum, all fellows reported awareness of available resources to treat pregnant women with CVD, while a majority disagreed that they receive regular exposure to pregnant patients with CVD in their training. The authors observed significant increases in fellows' confidence in their knowledge of normal cardiovascular physiology of pregnancy, physical exam skills, and ability to care for pregnant women with valvular disease and arrhythmias from pre to post-curriculum. A total of 15 fellows completed the board-style exam pre-curriculum and 15 post-curriculum. Fellows' performance on the board-style examination improved slightly from before to after the curriculum (64.0 to 75.3% correct, p = 0.02). A dedicated curriculum improved cardiology fellows' knowledge to recognize and treat CVD in pregnancy and improved confidence in caring for this unique patient population.",BMC medical education,2022-Mar,"Maxner B, Hansra B, Sibai D, Moinul S, Panella L, Jeha J, Fiore C, Dumont T, Lauring J, Aurigemma G, Harrington CM, Kovell LC",12,1862,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Some surveys have been performed in other countries, but in Portugal, the situation is largely unknown. An online survey on perceptions of cardiology and professional preferences was sent to 1371 members of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology, of whom 18.2% completed the survey. We included 219 cardiologists or cardiology trainees, of whom 50.2% were female, with decreasing proportions from younger to older age groups, in which males still predominate. Women are less often married and more frequently childless, particularly those working in an invasive subspecialty, where they represent only 16% of all respondents working in these areas. Men's perception is that women do not choose these areas due to family reasons, radiation concerns and difficult working conditions, but from the female perspective, male dominance, lack of female role models and restricted access are the main barriers. Women consider it is difficult for them to obtain a leadership role, but men do not think the same (75.5% vs. 27.5%). In Portugal, females predominate in younger age groups, suggesting a paradigm change. Women are less frequently married and more frequently childless, particularly women working in invasive subspecialties. Women consider that it is more difficult for them to obtain a leadership role.

34674817,Burnout and Well-Being Among Cardiology Fellowship Program Directors.,"The third annual Cardiovascular Diseases (CV) Fellowship Program Directors (PDs) Survey sought to understand burnout and well-being among CV fellowship PDs. Physician burnout is a common phenomenon. Data on burnout among cardiologists, specifically CV PDs, remain limited. The survey contained 8 questions examining satisfaction, stress, and burnout among CV fellowship PDs. Burnout was defined based on the self-reported presence of ≥1 symptom of burnout, constant feelings of burnout, or complete burnout. Survey response rate was 57%. Most respondents were men (78%) and 54% represented university-based programs. Eighty percent reported satisfaction with their current job as PD, and 96% identified interactions with fellows as a driver of their satisfaction. Forty-five percent reported feeling a great deal of stress from their job. Stress was higher among women PDs, early-career PDs, and PDs of larger and university-based programs. Twenty-one percent reported some symptoms of burnout, and only 36% reported enjoyment without stress or burnout. Rates of enjoyment without stress or burnout were higher among men and late-career PDs, PDs of smaller programs, and PDs of community-based programs. Seventeen percent of PDs reported a high likelihood of resigning in the next year, of which the most common reason was the tasks of PDs were becoming overwhelming. Most CV fellowship PDs are satisfied with their position, but stress and burnout remain common. Women PDs, early-career PDs, and PDs of larger, university-based programs demonstrate more adverse markers of well-being.

38233041,Cardiology researchers' practices and perceived barriers to open science: an international survey.,"Open science is a movement and set of practices to conduct research more transparently. Implementing open science will significantly improve public access and supports equity. It also has the potential to foster innovation and reduce duplication through data and materials sharing. Here, we survey an international group of researchers publishing in cardiovascular journals regarding their perceptions and practices related to open science. We identified the top 100 'Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine' subject category journals from the SCImago journal ranking platform. This is a publicly available portal that draws from Scopus. We then extracted the corresponding author's name and email from all articles published in these journals between 1 March 2021 and 1 March 2022. Participants were sent a purpose-built survey about open science. The survey contained primarily multiple choice and scale-based questions for which we report count data and percentages. For the few text-based responses we conducted thematic content analysis. 198 participants responded to our survey. Participants had a mean response of 6.8 (N=197, SD=1.8) on a 9-point scale with endpoints, not at all familiar (1) and extremely familiar (9), when indicating how familiar they were with open science. When asked about where they obtained open science training, most participants indicated this was done on the job self-initiated while conducting research (n=103, 52%), or that they had no formal training with respect to open science (n=72, 36%). More than half of the participants indicated they would benefit from practical support from their institution on how to perform open science practices (N=106, 54%). A diversity of barriers to each of the open science practices presented to participants were acknowledged. Participants indicated that funding was the most essential incentive to adopt open science. It is clear that policy alone will not lead to the effective implementation of open science.

35291997,An e-learning pediatric cardiology curriculum for Pediatric Postgraduate trainees in Rwanda: implementation and evaluation.,"Access to pediatric sub-specialty training is a critical unmet need in many resource-limited settings. In Rwanda, only two pediatric cardiologists are responsible for the country's clinical care of a population of 12 million, along with the medical education of all pediatric trainees. To strengthen physician training opportunities, we developed an e-learning curriculum in pediatric cardiology. This curriculum aimed to ""flip the classroom"", allowing residents to learn key pediatric cardiology concepts digitally before an in-person session with the specialist, thus efficiently utilizing the specialist for additional case based and bedside teaching. We surveyed Rwandan and US faculty and residents using a modified Delphi approach to identify key topics in pediatric cardiology. Lead authors from Rwanda and the USA collaborated with OPENPediatrics™, a free digital knowledge-sharing platform, to produce ten core topics presented in structured videos spanning 4.5 h. A mixed methods evaluation was completed with Rwandan pediatric residents, including surveys assessing knowledge, utilization, and satisfaction. Qualitative analysis of structured interviews was conducted using NVivo. Among the 43 residents who participated in the OPENPediatrics™ cardiology curriculum, 33 (77%) completed the curriculum assessment. Residents reported using the curriculum for a median of 8 h. Thirty-eight (88%) reported viewing the curriculum on their personal or hospital computer via pre-downloaded materials on a USB flash drive, with another seven (16%) reporting viewing it online. Twenty-seven residents viewed the course during core lecture time (63%). Commonly reported barriers to utilization included lack of time (70%), access to internet (40%) and language (24%). Scores on knowledge assessment improved from 66.2% to 76.7% upon completion of the curriculum (p < 0.001) across all levels of training, with most significant improvement in scores for PGY-1 and PGY-2 residents. Residents reported high satisfaction with the visuals, engaging presentation, and organization of the curriculum. Residents opined the need for expanded training material in cardiac electrocardiogram and echocardiogram and requested for slower narration by foreign presenters. Video-based e-learning via OPENPediatrics™ in a resource-limited setting was effective in improving resident's knowledge in pediatric cardiology with high levels of utilization and satisfaction. Expanding access to digital curriculums for other pediatric sub-specialties may be both an effective and efficient strategy for improving training in settings with limited access to subspecialist faculty.",BMC medical education,2022-Mar,"Rusingiza E, Alizadeh F, Wolbrink T, Mutamba B, Vinci S, Profita EL, Rulisa S, DelSignore L, Solis J, Geggel R, Wilson K",11,2657,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

The section on medical therapy of chronic coronary syndromes patients shows some inconsistency between text and the suggested scheme as well as contradictions with recommendations of regulatory agencies. It is not immediate to appreciate what is good and what is not so good in guidelines, which are often read in a hurry.

Although improved early detection and treatment have increased the survival rates, cardiotoxic treatment and inadequate management of cardiovascular risk factors have resulted in cardiovascular disease (CVD) being one of the leading causes of non-cancer-related death and disability among cancer survivors. International guidelines outline the standards of care for CVD risk surveillance and management. However, Australian cardio-oncology policies and clinical guidelines are limited. There is increasing growth of cardio-oncology research in Australia and support from leading Australian professional bodies and advocacy and research networks, including the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand, the Clinical Oncology Society of Australia, the National Heart Foundation of Australia, and the Australian Cardiovascular Alliance (ACvA). Thus, opportunities to drive multidisciplinary cardio-oncology initiatives are growing, including grant funding, position statements, and novel research to inform new policies. The ACvA has a unique flagship structure that spans the translational research pipeline from drug discovery to implementation science. This article aims to highlight how multidisciplinary cardio-oncology innovations could intersect with the seven ACvA flagships, and to showcase Australian achievements in cardio-oncology thus far. We summarise eight key priority areas for future cardio-oncology research that emerged. These strategies will strengthen cardio-oncology research and care in Australia, and drive new guidelines, policies, and government initiatives to ensure equity in health outcomes for all cardio-oncology patients.","Heart, lung & circulation",2024-May,"Singleton AC, Redfern J, Diaz A, Koczwara B, Nicholls SJ, Negishi K, La Gerche A, Playford D, Conyers R, Cehic DA, Garvey G, Williams TD, Hunt L, Doyle K, Figtree GA, Ngo DTM, Sverdlov AL",17,1768,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

An attempt was made to reach the current cardiology FITs across all programs of the U.S. via email. An anonymous questionnaire was created consisting of 14 questions. Questions posed were regarding factors affecting each participant's interest in or lack of pursuing an EP fellowship. Descriptive statistics of the responses were performed. A total of 26% (35/134) respondents expressed their interest in applying to an EP fellowship. The most common reasons to apply to EP were: Interest in EP, procedural specialty, and work-life balance. Of the 99 respondents that were not applying to EP, the most common reasons not to apply were: Less interest in EP, two-year training duration, and complexity of the specialty. The top reasons for the fellows to believe there is a dearth of EP FITs were: two-year training duration, lack of interest in EP, and the complexity of the specialty. The changes that would encourage EP fellowship interest were: More exposure to EP training during general cardiology fellowship, shortening the EP training duration, and having more information available regarding employment opportunities. The study was able to identify factors responsible for vacancies in EP fellowship positions from the view of current cardiology FITs. Stakeholders at the national level involved in framing policies related to fellowship education would be able to utilize this information to address the shortage of EP FITs and increase recruitment to EP fellowships.",Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE,2022-Aug,"Patel H, Zughaib M, Rajpurohit D, Whitler C, Kalaba F, Bradley C, Zughaib M",7,1746,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
38388330,Competency based medical education in nuclear cardiology: A tale of two axes.,"Across medical specialties, including nuclear cardiology, competency based medical education (CBME) changes the emphasis of learning from a time or experiential emphasis to a proficiency focused approached. Plotted on a learning-curve graph the emphasis on learning has shifted from the duration/ volume-based x-axis to the performance-based y-axis. It has proven difficult to establish y-axis-based standards within nuclear cardiology to assess learning. As such there is a paucity of data to verify current experiential training targets and only recently is data emerging that seeks to find CBME targets by which proficiency (y-axis units) can be evaluated. Initial reports from such CBME-oriented studies indicate that in current nuclear cardiology practice, the number of studies required to achieve competency is dependent upon the chosen measure of competency that is assessed (summed stress score versus % LV ischemia), the case mix, and the modality being learnt (PET versus SPECT). Recent findings have also suggested that prior levels of experiential training may be an underestimation of the number of supervised studies learners need to interpret before they achieve competency. Nuclear cardiology training has adopted the concept of CBME and is progressing toward a more modern approach to trainee assessment. This brief review provides the background, current requirements and insights into new developments in nuclear cardiology training.",Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences,2024-Jun,"Small GR, Chow BJW",2,1453,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

This study evaluated cardiac auscultation skills in veterinary students and compared their abilities to recent veterinary graduates, referral hospital veterinary surgeons and veterinary cardiologists or cardiology residents. In addition it compared their self-predicted quiz scores to their actual scores, evaluating if they could accurately predict their own performance level. A digital recording device was used to record auscultation sounds from 12 different patients with a diagnosis confirmed by a board-certified veterinary cardiologist. The sound files and associated phonocardiograms were uploaded to a video sharing website. A cloud-based online multiple-choice quiz was generated and shared with final year veterinary students, recent veterinary graduates, referral hospital veterinary surgeons and veterinary cardiologists or cardiology residents. There were 128 participants: 51 final year veterinary students, 62 recent veterinary graduates, and 10 referral hospital veterinary surgeons and five veterinary cardiologists or cardiology residents. No difference was found between the cardiac auscultation skills of recent veterinary graduates and final year veterinary students. Veterinary students' self-predicted scores were lower than actual scores. Recent veterinary graduates did not perform better than final year veterinary students in this study, suggesting that auscultation skills do not continue to improve in the first few years after graduation. Efforts should be made to maximise students' learning in cardiac auscultation skills.

39280999,A Vision For the Future of Cardiovascular Medicine Practise in Ghana: Inspiration From the Yale-New Haven Health System.,"The Ghana Physicians and Surgeons Foundation (GPSF) of North America sponsors Ghanaian clinical fellows to undertake an eight-weeklong clinical observation with the Yale University School of Medicine and Yale-New Haven Health (YNHH) annually, through the Residents in Training Educational Stipend (RITES) programme. This offers the opportunity to appreciate new perspectives in clinical care to improve Ghana's healthcare standard. The cardiovascular medicine workforce at the YNHH is heterogenous, with significant reliance on non-doctor cadres of health workers who demonstrate competence. This is contrasted from the Ghanaian system which despite having a poorer physician-patient ratio, is heavily dependent on doctors. Technological advancements are minimal in Ghana, posing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges which are otherwise minimised at the YNHH. A strong patient-centred culture, coupled with a coordinated emergency response system that ensures appropriate timely transfers, culminate in good care and outcomes. Ideas on how the experience can be translated to Ghanaian clinical practise in cardiovascular medicine, after participating in the RITES programme, are shared in this paper with an emphasis on task sharing, strengthening emergency response systems and improving technological sophistication through capacity building, mentorship and improved health financing.",Global heart,2024-,"Asamoah KT, Beasley MH",2,1387,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
39106529,The future of education in Preventive Cardiology: a statement of the European Association of Preventive Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology.,"In recent years, major advances in our understanding of risk factors implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), in available tools for early detection of CVD, and in effective interventions to prevent subclinical or clinically manifest disease, have led to an increasing appreciation of prevention as a major pillar of cardiovascular (CV) medicine. Preventive Cardiology has evolved into a dynamic sub-speciality focused on the promotion of CV health through all stages of life, and on the management of individuals at risk of developing CVD or experiencing recurrent CV events, through interdisciplinary care in different settings. As the level of knowledge, specialized skills, experience, and committed attitudes related to CV prevention has exceeded core cardiology training, the European Association of Preventive Cardiology (EAPC) has placed major emphasis on continuous education and training of physicians and allied professionals involved in CV prevention, with the aim of setting standards for practice and improving quality of care. The EAPC recognizes the need for a comprehensive educational offer across different levels of training (from core cardiology to sub-speciality to expert training) as well as the need for interdisciplinary approaches that will promote synergies among allied professionals involved in CV prevention. This statement by the EAPC aims to highlight current gaps and unmet needs and to describe the framework to help standardize, structure, and deliver comprehensive, up-to-date, interactive, and high-quality education using a combination of traditional and novel educational tools. The document aims to form the basis for ongoing refinements of the EAPC educational offer, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that new evidence in the field will translate to better CV practice and improved outcomes for our patients.",European journal of preventive cardiology,2024-Nov,"Koskinas KC, Wilhelm M, Halle M, Biffi A, Cavarretta E, Davos CH, Frederix I, Gaber MH, Hansen D, Jones JL, Malhotra A, Papadakis M",12,1874,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
34719260,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Cardiovascular Science: Anticipating Problems and Potential Solutions: A Presidential Advisory From the American Heart Association.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had worldwide repercussions for health care and research. In spring 2020, most non-COVID-19 research was halted, hindering research across the spectrum from laboratory-based experimental science to clinical research. Through the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021, biomedical research, including cardiovascular science, only gradually restarted, with many restrictions on onsite activities, limited clinical research participation, and the challenges associated with working from home and caregiver responsibilities. Compounding these impediments, much of the global biomedical research infrastructure was redirected toward vaccine testing and deployment. This redirection of supply chains, personnel, and equipment has additionally hampered restoration of normal research activity. Transition to virtual interactions offset some of these limitations but did not adequately replace the need for scientific exchange and collaboration. Here, we outline key steps to reinvigorate biomedical research, including a call for increased support from the National Institutes of Health. We also call on academic institutions, publishers, reviewers, and supervisors to consider the impact of COVID-19 when assessing productivity, recognizing that the pandemic did not affect all equally. We identify trainees and junior investigators, especially those with caregiving roles, as most at risk of being lost from the biomedical workforce and identify steps to reduce the loss of these key investigators. Although the global pandemic highlighted the power of biomedical science to define, treat, and protect against threats to human health, significant investment in the biomedical workforce is required to maintain and promote well-being.",Circulation,2021-Dec,"McNally EM, Elkind MSV, Benjamin IJ, Chung MK, Dillon GH, Hernandez AF, Ibeh C, Lloyd-Jones DM, McCullough LD, Wold LE, Wright DR, Wu JC",12,1789,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
33314988,Hybrid Organizations in Health Systems: The Corporatization of Malaysia's National Heart Institute.,"Health system reforms across high- and middle-income countries often involve changes to public hospital governance. Corporatization is one such reform, in which public sector hospitals are granted greater functional independence while remaining publicly owned. In theory, this can improve public hospital efficiency, while retaining a public service ethos. However, the extent to which efficiency gains are realized and public purpose is maintained depends on policy choices about governance and payment systems. We present a case study of Malaysia's National Heart Institute (IJN), which was created in 1992 by corporatization of one department in a large public hospital. The aim of the paper is to examine whether IJN has achieved the goals for which it was created, and if so, whether it provides a potential model for further reforms in Malaysia and other similar health systems. Using a combination of document analysis and key informant interviews, we examine key governance, health financing and payment, and equity issues. For governance, we highlight the choice to have IJN owned by and answerable to a Ministry of Finance (MOF) holding company and MOF-appointed board, rather than the Ministry of Health (MOH). On financing and payment, we analyze the implications of IJN's combined role as fee-for-service provider to MOH as well as provider of care to private patients. For equity, we analyze the targeting of IJN care across publicly-referred and private patients. These issues demonstrate unresolved tensions between IJN's objectives and public service goals. As an institutional innovation that has endured for 28 years and grown dramatically in size and revenue, IJN's trajectory offers critical insights on the relevance of the hybrid public-private models for hospitals in Malaysia as well as in other middle-income countries. While IJN appears to have achieved its goal of establishing itself as a commercially viable, publicly owned center of clinical excellence in Malaysia, the value for money and equity of the services it provides to the Ministry of Health remain unclear. IJN is accountable to a small Ministry of Finance holding company, which means that detailed information required to evaluate these critical questions is not published. The case of IJN highlights that corporatization cannot achieve its stated goals of efficiency, innovation, and equity in isolation; rather it must be supported by broader reforms, including of health financing, payment, governance, and transparency, in order to ensure that autonomous hospitals improve quality and provide efficient care in an equitable way.",Health systems and reform,2020-Dec,"Virk A, Croke K, Mohd Yusoff M, Mokhtaruddin K, Abdullah Z, Nadziha Mohd Hanafiah A, Soleha Ramli E, Filzatun Borhan N, Almodovar Diaz Y, Aun YW, Atun R",11,2625,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
37934981,Radiation exposure in interventional cardiology: extremities doses.,"X-rays are widely used in interventional cardiology (IC). Medical staff is exposed to ionising radiations with difficulties to accurately estimate the absorbed dose, on the other hand, it is well known that eye lens and extremities are the most exposed. In most IC units, radiological monitoring is performed by measuring the personal dose equivalent with a dosemeter worn under the operator's apron. The ambient dose equivalent is, usually, also measured. Furthermore, doses to the lens and extremities are often not measured because of the absence or difficulty of wearing the appropriate dosemeters. The main aim of our study is to estimate the extremities doses, of the interventional cardiologists, from the personal dose equivalent, the patient's received doses or to the ambient dose equivalent. For this purpose, we use a radiological monitoring, of four (04) interventional cardiologists, carried out at Algiers hospital. A Monte Carlo calculation is performed for comparison.

In this review we explore novel statistical approaches and methodological considerations for such trials, with a focus on cardiovascular therapies. We discuss the concept of ""small"" sample sizes and their limitations and cover various analytical frameworks, including frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and emphasize their implications for result interpretation and reproducibility. We examine end points such as ""days alive and free specific to disease state,"" which combines mortality and morbidity measures, the win ratio for hierarchical end points, and ordinal scales that capture detailed patient outcomes. These methods potentially increase statistical power and provide more clinically relevant measures compared with traditional binary outcomes; an extensive use of simulations is used to clarify this point. The use of longitudinal ordinal models is presented as a promising method to capture complex patient trajectories over time, offering insights into treatment effects at various disease stages. We also address the potential of adaptive platform trials for rare conditions, allowing for more efficient use of limited patient populations.

To examine female representation within Australia and New Zealand (NZ) among physician specialties and certain comparator surgical specialties with a focus on cardiology as an outlier of workforce gender equality. Data of practising medical specialists, new consultants and trainees were sought from the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency, the Medical Council of NZ and the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (2015-2017). The stratified data pertaining to interventional cardiologists were obtained through direct contact with individual hospitals (from 2017 to 2018) and derived from state-based cardiac registries. In Australia and NZ, there were fewer female practising adult medicine physician consultants (n = 8956, 32%, P < 0.001), with gender disparities seen across most physician specialties. Cardiology (15%) was the only physician specialty with <20% representation; gastroenterology (23%), neurology (27%) and respiratory medicine (29%) had <30% female representation at the consultant level. The rates of cardiology (15%) and interventional cardiology (5%) were similar to general surgery (15%) and orthopaedics (4%). Although more than half of physician trainees are female, and most physician specialties are approaching or have equal gender ratios at the trainee level, cardiology (23%) and interventional cardiology (9%) remain significantly underrepresented.

36508019,Applying Practice Analysis to Develop a New Test Content Outline for the Pediatric Cardiology Certification Examination.,"The evolving breadth and complexity of the contemporary pediatric cardiology specialty requires regular, systematic analysis of the practice to ensure that training and certification requirements address the demands of real-world clinical experience. We report the process of the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) for conducting such a practice analysis and revising the test content outline (TCO) for the pediatric cardiology subspecialty certification exam. A panel of 15 pediatric cardiologists conducted seven 2-h virtual meetings, during which they identified 37 unique tasks that represent the work a pediatric cardiologist may reasonably expect to perform within the first 5 years after training. These tasks were grouped into nine performance domains, similar to the entrustable professional activities (EPA), previously endorsed by the ABP in collaboration with the pediatric cardiology education community, and which represent the critical activities of the profession. The panel then enumerated the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform each task. These deliberations resulted in two work products: a practice analysis document (PAD) and subspecialty board TCO based on testable knowledge, skills, and abilities. Survey assessments of the panel's work were then distributed to pediatric cardiology fellowship program directors and to practicing pediatric cardiologists for their input, which largely aligned with the panel's recommendations. Survey responses were considered in the final revisions of the PAD and TCO.

32627666,A Systematic Review of Methods Used for Confounding Adjustment in Observational Economic Evaluations in Cardiology Conducted between 2013 and 2017.,"<b>Background.</b> Observational economic evaluations (i.e., economic evaluations in which treatment allocation is not randomized) are prone to confounding bias. Prior reviews published in 2013 have shown that adjusting for confounding is poorly done, if done at all. Although these reviews raised awareness on the issues, it is unclear if their results improved the methodological quality of future work. We therefore aimed to investigate whether and how confounding was accounted for in recently published observational economic evaluations in the field of cardiology. <b>Methods.</b> We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and PsycInfo databases using a set of Medical Subject Headings and keywords covering topics in ""observational economic evaluations in health within humans"" and ""cardiovascular diseases."" Any study published in either English or French between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2017, addressing our search criteria was eligible for inclusion in our review. Our protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018112391). <b>Results.</b> Forty-two (0.6%) out of 7523 unique citations met our inclusion criteria.

34795366,Comparison of two strategies for managing in-hospital cardiac arrest.,"In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is associated with poor outcomes. There are currently no standards for cardiac arrest teams in terms of member composition and task allocation. Here we aimed to compare two different cardiac arrest team concepts to cover IHCA management in terms of survival and neurological outcomes. This prospective study enrolled 412 patients with IHCA from general medical wards. From May 2014 to April 2016, 228 patients were directly transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for ongoing resuscitation. In the ICU, resuscitation was extended to advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) (Load-and-Go [LaG] group). By May 2016, a dedicated cardiac arrest team provided by the ICU provided ACLS in the ward. After return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), the patients (n = 184) were transferred to the ICU (Stay-and-Treat [SaT] group). Overall, baseline characteristics, aetiologies, and characteristics of cardiac arrest were similar between groups. The time to endotracheal intubation was longer in the LaG group than in the SaT group (6 [5, 8] min versus 4 [2, 5] min, p = 0.001). In the LaG group, 96% of the patients were transferred to the ICU regardless of ROSC achievement. In the SaT group, 83% of patients were transferred to the ICU (p = 0.001). Survival to discharge did not differ between the LaG (33%) and the SaT (35%) groups (p = 0.758). Ultimately, 22% of patients in the LaG group versus 21% in the SaT group were discharged with good neurological outcomes (p = 0.857). In conclusion, we demonstrated that the cardiac arrest team concepts for the management of IHCA did not differ in terms of survival and neurological outcomes.

Materials and Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. ESC and ACC/AHA guidelines published until May 2023 were systematically screened for recommendations related to cardiac MRI. The class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE) for cardiac MRI recommendations were compared between the two guidelines and between newer versus older versions of each guideline using χ<sup>2</sup> or Fisher exact tests. Results ESC guidelines included 109 recommendations regarding cardiac MRI, and ACC/AHA guidelines included 90 recommendations. The proportion of COR I and LOE B was higher in ACC/AHA versus ESC guidelines (60% [54 of 90] vs 46.8% [51 of 109]; <i>P</i> = .06 and 53% [48 of 90] vs 35.8% [39 of 109], respectively; <i>P</i> = .01). The increase in the number of cardiac MRI recommendations over time was significantly higher in ESC guidelines (from 63 to 109 for ESC vs from 65 to 90 for ACC/AHA; <i>P</i> = .03). The main areas of consensus were found in heart failure and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, while the main divergences were in valvular heart disease, arrhythmias, and aortic disease. Conclusion ESC guidelines included more recommendations related to cardiac MRI use, whereas the ACC/AHA recommendations had higher COR and LOE. The number of cardiac MRI recommendations increased significantly over time in both guidelines, indicating the increasing role of cardiac MRI evaluation and management of cardiovascular disease. <b>Keywords:</b> Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance, Guideline, European Society of Cardiology, ESC, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, ACC/AHA <i>Supplemental material is available for this article.</i> © RSNA, 2024.",Radiology.

34253795,Influence of heart rate correction formulas on QTc interval stability.,"Monitoring of QTc interval is mandated in different clinical conditions. Nevertheless, intra-subject variability of QTc intervals reduces the clinical utility of QTc monitoring strategies. Since this variability is partly related to QT heart rate correction, 10 different heart rate corrections (Bazett, Fridericia, Dmitrienko, Framingham, Schlamowitz, Hodges, Ashman, Rautaharju, Sarma, and Rabkin) were applied to 452,440 ECG measurements made in 539 healthy volunteers (259 females, mean age 33.3 ± 8.4 years). For each correction formula, the short term (5-min time-points) and long-term (day-time hours) variability of rate corrected QT values (QTc) was investigated together with the comparisons of the QTc values with individually corrected QTcI values obtained by subject-specific modelling of the QT/RR relationship and hysteresis. The results showed that (a) both in terms of short-term and long-term QTc variability, Bazett correction led to QTc values that were more variable than the results of other corrections (p < 0.00001 for all), (b) the QTc variability by Fridericia and Framingham corrections were not systematically different from each other but were lower than the results of other corrections (p-value between 0.033 and < 0.00001), and (c) on average, Bazett QTc values departed from QTcI intervals more than the QTc values of other corrections. The study concludes that (a) previous suggestions that Bazett correction should no longer be used in clinical practice are fully justified, (b) replacing Bazett correction with Fridericia and/or Framingham corrections would improve clinical QTc monitoring, (c) heart rate stability is needed for valid QTc assessment, and (d) development of further QTc corrections for day-to-day use is not warranted.",Scientific reports,2021-Jul,"Andršová I, Hnatkova K, Šišáková M, Toman O, Smetana P, Huster KM, Barthel P, Novotný T, Schmidt G, Malik M",10,1771,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

As social media influence continues to expand, it becomes increasingly important for cardiovascular researchers to employ social media strategies to increase the impact of their research work, for the ultimate goal of improved outcomes for patients living with or at risk for cardiovascular diseases. Altmetrics are novel metrics that track the attention that scholarly outputs are receiving in non-traditional sources such as in the news, blogs, and social media posts. These alternative metrics record research dissemination beyond traditional journal citation indices, while also predicting and even promoting future citations.

35750554,Feasibility and effectiveness of cardiac auscultation training with a cardiology patient simulator for first-year medical students.,"The effectiveness of cardiac auscultation training with a cardiology patient simulator for medical students is still unclear. Starting such training earlier may help students improve their proficiency. We investigated whether cardiac auscultation training using a simulator for first-year students is feasible and effective. A total of 43 first-year medical students (5-12 in each year, 2015-2019) participated in three 1.5-hour extra-curricular classes comprising mini-lectures, facilitated training, two different auscultation tests (the second test closer to clinical setting than the first), and a questionnaire. The test results were compared with those of 556 fourth-year medical students who participated in a compulsory 3-hour cardiac auscultation class in 2016-2019. The accuracy rate of all heart sounds and murmurs was higher in the first-year students than in the fourth-year students in both the first (85.8 vs. 79.4 %, p = 0.001) and second (71.3 vs. 61.2 %, p = 0.02) tests. That of second/third/fourth sounds was also higher in the first-year students than in the fourth-year students in both the first (86.0 vs. 79.7 %, p = 0.01) and second (70.9 vs. 53.9 %, p = 0.002) tests. The accuracy rate of murmurs was higher in the first-year students than in the fourth-year students in the first test (85.5 vs. 78.9 %, p = 0.04), but not in the second test (72.1 vs. 75.7 %, p = 0.58). All the first-year students and 65 % of them agreed that they had received sufficient knowledge and built sufficient skills, respectively. All the first-year students and 93 % of them agreed that they were satisfied with the program, and that the program was suitable for first-year students, respectively. Although training time was different between the two groups and it is possible that only motivated first-year students participated in the program, these results suggest that our cardiac auscultation training is feasible and effective for first-year medical students.",Journal of cardiology,2022-Nov,"Kagaya Y, Tabata M, Arata Y, Kameoka J, Ishii S",5,1971,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Due to the inherent complexity and flexibility of ML algorithms, inconsistencies in the model performance and interpretation may occur. Several review articles have been recently published that introduce the fundamental principles and clinical application of ML for cardiologists. This paper builds on these introductory principles and outlines a more comprehensive list of crucial responsibilities that need to be completed when developing ML models. This paper aims to serve as a scientific foundation to aid investigators, data scientists, authors, editors, and reviewers involved in machine learning research with the intent of uniform reporting of ML investigations. An independent multidisciplinary panel of ML experts, clinicians, and statisticians worked together to review the theoretical rationale underlying 7 sets of requirements that may reduce algorithmic errors and biases. Finally, the paper summarizes a list of reporting items as an itemized checklist that highlights steps for ensuring correct application of ML models and the consistent reporting of model specifications and results.

We followed the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) methodology for the development of QIs. Key domains were identified by constructing a conceptual framework for the delivery of TAVI care. A list of candidate QIs was developed by conducting a systematic review of the literature. A modified Delphi method was then used to select the final set of QIs. Finally, we mapped the QIs to the EuroHeart (European Unified Registries on Heart Care Evaluation and Randomized Trials) data standards for TAVI to ascertain the extent to which the EuroHeart TAVI registry captures information to calculate the QIs. We formed an international group of experts in quality improvement and TAVI, including representatives from the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions, the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging, and the Association of Cardiovascular Nursing and Allied Professions.

Regionalization of ECMO might require the implementation of therapy before and during transfer to the high-volume center. The aim of this international survey was to describe the manner in which interhospital ECMO transport care is organized at experienced centers. Fifteen mobile ECMO centers from nine countries participated in this survey. Seven (47%) of them operated under the ""Hub-and-Spoke"" model. Transport team composition varies from three to nine members, with at least one ECMO specialist (i.e., nurse or perfusionist) participating in all centers, although intensivists and surgeons were present in 69% and 50% of the teams, respectively. All centers responded that the final decision to initiate ECMO is multidisciplinary and made bedside at the referring hospital. Most centers (75%) have a quality control system; all teams practice simulation and water drills. Considering the variability in ECMO transport teams among experienced centers, continuous education, training and quality control within each organization itself are necessary to avoid adverse events and maintain a low mortality rate.

When compared to responses received from physicians at low-volume centers (< 300 annual bypass cases), those at high-volume centers reported more involvement from the neurodevelopmental teams (58% vs. 29%; P = 0.012) and a standardized transition to outpatient care (68% vs. 52%; P = 0.038). While a majority of cardiothoracic surgery and anesthesiology respondents reported multidisciplinary involvement, less than half of cardiology and neonatology supported this statement. The most commonly reported obstacles to multidisciplinary engagement were culture (61.6%) and logistics (47.1%). Having a standardized neonatal cardiac curriculum for neonatal fellows was positively associated with the perception that multidisciplinary collaboration was ""always"" in place (53% vs. 40%; P = 0.09).

Data about feasibly and safety of pediatric ECMO transport are scarce. Our aim is to describe our experience with a pediatric ECMO reach-out program and review pertinent literature. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were collected retrospectively from the charts of all patients cannulated onto ECMO at referring centers and transported to our center from 2003 to 2018. Similar data were recorded for patients who were referred for ECMO support from within the hospital. The cohort included 80 patients cannulated at 17 referring centers. The transport team included a senior pediatric cardiac surgeon and an ECMO specialist. All transfers but one were done by special emergency medical service ambulance. No major complications or deaths occurred during transport, and all patients were stable upon arrival to our unit. Mortality was lower in the ECMO reach-out cohort than in-house patients referred for ECMO support. This is the first study from Israel and one of the largest to date describing a dedicated pediatric ECMO transport program. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation transport appears to be feasible and safe when conducted by a small, highly skilled mobile team. Successful reach-out program requires open communication between the referring physician and the accepting center.

Fluoroscopy has traditionally been the primary imaging modality for catheter ablation, providing real-time visualization of catheter navigation. However, its limitations, such as inadequate soft tissue visualization and exposure to ionizing radiation, have prompted the integration of alternative imaging modalities. Over the years, advancements in imaging techniques have played a pivotal role in enhancing the safety, efficacy, and efficiency of catheter ablation procedures. This manuscript aims to explore the utility of imaging, including electroanatomical mapping, cardiac computed tomography, echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and nuclear cardiology exams, in helping electrophysiology procedures. These techniques enable accurate anatomical guidance, identification of critical structures and substrates, and real-time monitoring of complications, ultimately enhancing procedural safety and success rates. Incorporating advanced imaging technologies into routine clinical practice has the potential to further improve clinical outcomes of catheter ablation procedures and pave the way for more personalized and precise ablation therapies in the future.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",2023-Aug,"Berruezo A, Penela D, Jáuregui B, de Asmundis C, Peretto G, Marrouche N, Trayanova N, de Chillou C",8,1303,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

39709014,Is the Time Right for Preventive Cardiology Guidelines on Sedentary Behaviours and Sitting Time?,"In this review sedentary behaviour (SB) is considered beyond its simplistic definition of ""sitting"" and also includes sedentary activities. We explore the definition, physiological characteristics, prevalence, and guidelines of SB, contrasting it with physical activity (PA). The discussion encompasses: (1) the association between SB and mortality, with a specific focus on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes; (2) biological mechanisms that link SB to CV health, additionally differentiating between the effects of acute and chronic sitting; (3) sex and gender differences in SB; and (4) SB as an independent CV risk factor is explored. The review concludes with an examination of the potential beneficial effects of PA on mitigating the detrimental effects of SB and an analysis of evidence that supports the use of break-up strategies in preventive cardiology. This analysis sheds light on the significant deleterious consequences of SB on CV health. It highlights the potential of incorporating strategies to reduce and interrupt prolonged sitting alongside existing guidelines that promote PA.

36123701,Variable exposure to echocardiography core competencies when applying minimum recommended procedural numbers for cardiology fellows in training.,"The American College of Cardiology Core Cardiovascular Training Statement (COCATS) defined echocardiography core competencies and set the minimum recommend number of echocardiograms to perform (150) and interpret (300) for independent practice in echocardiography (level 2 training). Fellows may lack exposure to key pathologies that are relatively infrequent, however, even when achieving an adequate number of studies performed and interpreted. We hypothesized that cardiology fellows would lack exposure to 1 or more cardiac pathologies related to core competencies in COCATS when performing and interpreting the minimum recommend number of studies for level 2 training. We retrospectively reviewed 11,250 reports from consecutive echocardiograms interpreted (7,500) and performed (3,750) by 25 cardiology fellows at a University tertiary referral hospital who graduated between 2015 and 2019. The first 300 echocardiograms interpreted and the first 150 echocardiograms performed by each fellow were included in the analysis. Echocardiography reports were reviewed for cardiac pathologies relating to core competencies defined in COCATS. All 25 fellows lacked exposure to 1 or more cardiac pathologies related to echocardiography core competencies despite meeting COCATS minimum recommended numbers for echocardiograms performed and interpreted. Pathologies for which 1 or more fellows encountered 0 cases despite meeting the minimum recommended numbers for both echocardiograms performed and interpreted included: pericardial constriction (16/25 fellows), aortic dissection (15/25 fellows), pericardial tamponade (4/25 fellows), valvular mass/thrombus (2/25 fellows), prosthetic valve dysfunction (1/25 fellows), and cardiac chamber mass/thrombus (1/25 fellows). Cardiology fellows who completed the minimum recommend number of echocardiograms performed and interpreted for COCATS level 2 training frequently lacked exposure to cardiac pathologies, even in a University tertiary referral hospital setting. These data suggest that fellowship programs should monitor pathology case counts for each fellow in training, in addition to the minimum recommend number of echocardiograms defined by COCATS, to ensure competency for independent practice in echocardiography.",Cardiovascular ultrasound,2022-Sep,"Bierowski MJ, Qureshi U, Ramedani S, Grewal S, Shah R, Park R, Peterson BR",7,2268,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Our aim is to describe and evaluate a visual teaching tool, tomographic plane visualization (ToPlaV) as an adjunct to skills training in pediatric echocardiography image acquisition. This tool incorporates learning theory by applying psychomotor skills that closely emulate the skills used in echocardiography. ToPlaV was used as part of a transthoracic bootcamp for first year cardiology fellows. A qualitative survey was given to trainees to evaluate their perceptions of its usefulness. There was universal agreement among fellow trainees that ToPlaV is a useful training tool. ToPlaV is a simple, low cost, education tool which can complement a simulator and live models. We propose that ToPlaV should be incorporated into early training in echocardiography skills for pediatric cardiology fellows.",Pediatric cardiology,2023-Oct,"Koenig P, Patel S, McGaghie WC",3,870,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
38989848,Assessing GPT-4's Performance in Delivering Medical Advice: Comparative Analysis With Human Experts.,"Accurate medical advice is paramount in ensuring optimal patient care, and misinformation can lead to misguided decisions with potentially detrimental health outcomes. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4 has spurred interest in their potential health care applications, particularly in automated medical consultation. Yet, rigorous investigations comparing their performance to human experts remain sparse. This study aims to compare the medical accuracy of GPT-4 with human experts in providing medical advice using real-world user-generated queries, with a specific focus on cardiology. It also sought to analyze the performance of GPT-4 and human experts in specific question categories, including drug or medication information and preliminary diagnoses. We collected 251 pairs of cardiology-specific questions from general users and answers from human experts via an internet portal. GPT-4 was tasked with generating responses to the same questions. Three independent cardiologists (SL, JHK, and JJC) evaluated the answers provided by both human experts and GPT-4. Using a computer interface, each evaluator compared the pairs and determined which answer was superior, and they quantitatively measured the clarity and complexity of the questions as well as the accuracy and appropriateness of the responses, applying a 3-tiered grading scale (low, medium, and high). Furthermore, a linguistic analysis was conducted to compare the length and vocabulary diversity of the responses using word count and type-token ratio. GPT-4 and human experts displayed comparable efficacy in medical accuracy (""GPT-4 is better"" at 132/251, 52.6% vs ""Human expert is better"" at 119/251, 47.4%). In accuracy level categorization, humans had more high-accuracy responses than GPT-4 (50/237, 21.1% vs 30/238, 12.6%) but also a greater proportion of low-accuracy responses (11/237, 4.6% vs 1/238, 0.4%; P=.001). GPT-4 responses were generally longer and used a less diverse vocabulary than those of human experts, potentially enhancing their comprehensibility for general users (sentence count: mean 10.9, SD 4.2 vs mean 5.9, SD 3.7; P<.001; type-token ratio: mean 0.69, SD 0.07 vs mean 0.79, SD 0.09; P<.001). Nevertheless, human experts outperformed GPT-4 in specific question categories, notably those related to drug or medication information and preliminary diagnoses. These findings highlight the limitations of GPT-4 in providing advice based on clinical experience. GPT-4 has shown promising potential in automated medical consultation, with comparable medical accuracy to human experts. However, challenges remain particularly in the realm of nuanced clinical judgment. Future improvements in LLMs may require the integration of specific clinical reasoning pathways and regulatory oversight for safe use. Further research is needed to understand the full potential of LLMs across various medical specialties and conditions.",JMIR medical education,2024-Jul,"Jo E, Song S, Kim JH, Lim S, Kim JH, Cha JJ, Kim YM, Joo HJ",8,2949,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
32883415,Program Directors Survey on Diversity in Cardiovascular Training Programs.,"Women and minorities are under-represented in cardiovascular disease (CVD) specialties. It remains unknown how characteristics of the CVD learning environment affect diversity and how program directors (PDs) approach these critical issues. The second annual Cardiovascular PD Survey aimed to investigate characteristics of the CVD learning environment that may affect diversity and strategies PDs use to approach these issues. The survey contained 20 questions examining U.S.-based CVD PD perceptions of diversity in CVD and related characteristics of the CVD fellowship learning environment. In total, 58% of PDs completed the survey. Responding programs demonstrated geographic diversity. The majority were university-based or -affiliated. A total of 86% of PDs felt diversity in CVD as a field needs to increase, and 70% agreed that training programs could play a significant role in this. In total, 89% of PDs have attempted to increase diversity in fellowship recruitment. The specific strategies used were associated with PD sex and the presence of under-represented minority trainees in the program. PDs identified lack of qualified candidates and overall culture of cardiology as the 2 most significant barriers to augmenting diversity. A majority of programs have support systems in place for minority fellows or specific gender groups, including procedures to report issues of harassment or an unsafe learning environment. PDs identified shared best practices for recruitment and implicit bias training, among others, as important resources in their efforts to support diversity in CVD training. Diversity is important to CVD PDs. They are striving to increase it in their programs through recruitment and strategies directed toward the fellowship learning environment.

35438211,A deep neural network using audio files for detection of aortic stenosis.,"Although aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease in the western world, many affected patients remain undiagnosed. Auscultation is a readily available screening tool for AS. However, it requires a high level of professional expertise. An AI algorithm can detect AS using audio files with the same accuracy as experienced cardiologists. A deep neural network (DNN) was trained by preprocessed audio files of 100 patients with AS and 100 controls. The DNN's performance was evaluated with a test data set of 40 patients. The primary outcome measures were sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. Results of the DNN were compared with the performance of cardiologists, residents, and medical students. Eighteen percent of patients without AS and 22% of patients with AS showed an additional moderate or severe mitral regurgitation. The DNN showed a sensitivity of 0.90 (0.81-0.99), a specificity of 1, and an F1-score of 0.95 (0.89-1.0) for the detection of AS. In comparison, we calculated an F1-score of 0.94 (0.86-1.0) for cardiologists, 0.88 (0.78-0.98) for residents, and 0.88 (0.78-0.98) for students. The present study shows that deep learning-guided auscultation predicts significant AS with similar accuracy as cardiologists.

A 42-question survey was sent to 80 echocardiography laboratory directors at paediatric cardiology centres with surgical programmes in the United States and Canada. Question domains included transesophageal echocardiography centre characteristics, performance and reporting, equipment use, trainee participation, and quality assurance. Fifty of the 80 centres (62.5%) responded to the survey. Most settings were academic (86.0%) with 42.0% of centres performing > 350 surgical cases/year. The median number of transesophageal echocardiograms performed/cardiologist/year was 50 (26, 73). Pre-operative transesophageal echocardiography was performed in most surgical cases by 91.7% of centres. Transesophageal echocardiography was always performed by most centres following Norwood, Glenn, and Fontan procedures and by < 10% of centres following coarctation repair. Many centres with a written guideline allowed transesophageal echocardiography transducer use at weights below manufacturer recommendations (50.0 and 61.1% for neonatal and paediatric transducers, respectively). Most centres (36/37, 97.3%) with categorical fellowships had rotations which included transesophageal echocardiography participation.

This newly developed hands-on training program is supposed to enable the acquisition of certain skills which are necessary when investigating and treating patients in a catheter laboratory. Based on anonymous CT-scans of pediatric patients' digital 3D heart models with or without cardiac defects were developed and printed three-dimensionally in a flexible material visible under X-ray. Hands-on training courses were offered using models of a healthy heart and the most common congenital heart defects (CHD). An evaluation was performed by quantifying fluoroscopy times (FL-time) and a questionnaire. The acceptance of theoretical and practical contents within the hands-on training was very positive. It was demonstrated that it is possible to master various steps of a diagnostic procedure and an intervention as well as to practice and repeat them independently which significantly reduced FL-time. The participants stated that the hands-on training led to more confidence in interventions on real patients. With the development of a training module using 3D-printed heart models, basic and advanced training in the field of diagnostic cardiac examinations as well as interventional therapies of CHD is possible.

This study employs a prospective cohort design. Internal medicine residents at University at Buffalo participated in monthly ECG didactic sessions over a 7-month period. Residents were invited to complete pre- and post-curriculum questionnaires. Responses were anonymous and participation voluntary. Data collected included basic demographics, career interest, exposure to clinical cardiology, and number of sessions attended. Residents were asked to interpret sixteen unique ECGs, divided evenly among eight common rhythms into both questionnaires. Pre- and post-curriculum cohorts were compared using t-tests and chi-square analyses. Associations between attendance, comfort level in interpretation, and number of correct interpretations were analyzed using Pearson correlations. Multivariate linear regression determined the strongest predictor of the number of correct ECG interpretations. The post-curriculum cohort correctly interpreted a significantly greater percentage of ECGs compared to pre-curriculum cohort (74.5% vs. 60.9%, p < .001). Didactic attendance was significantly associated with comfort level in interpreting ECGs (r = .328, p = .018) and trended towards an increased number of correct interpretations (r = .248, p = .077). Residents who attended three or more sessions demonstrated increased ECG interpretation skills compared to those who attended two or fewer sessions (80.0% vs. 71.1%, p = .048). Number of clinical cardiology rotations attended was significantly associated with correct interpretations (r = .310, p < .001) and was the strongest predictor of accurately interpreting ECGs (β = 0.29, p = .037).

The prevalence of heart failure (HF) in this group exceeds 10%. We assessed changes in clinical characteristics, therapy, and 1-year outcomes over 2 decades in chronic HF outpatients aged ≥ 80 years enrolled in a nationwide cardiology registry. We included 2520 octogenarians with baseline echocardiographic ejection fraction measurements and available 1-year follow-up, who were recruited at 138 HF outpatient clinics (21% of national hospitals with cardiology units), across 3 enrolment periods (1999-2005, 2006-2011, 2012-2018). At recruitment, over the 3 study periods, there was an increase in age, body mass index, ejection fraction, the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, pre-existing hypertension, and atrial fibrillation history. The proportion of patients with preserved ejection fraction rose from 19.4% to 32.7% (P for trend <.0001). Markers of advanced disease became less prevalent. Prescription of beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists increased over time. During the 1-year follow-up, 308 patients died (12.2%) and 360 (14.3%) were admitted for cardiovascular causes; overall, 591 (23.5%) met the combined primary endpoint of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization.

For the study, a set of 88 multiple-choice cardiology exam questions was used. The participating cardiology fellows and selected chatbots were presented with these questions. The evaluation metrics included Top-1 and Top-2 accuracy, assessing the ability of chatbots and fellows to select the correct answer. Among the cardiology fellows, all 36 participants successfully passed the exam with a median accuracy of 98% (IQR 91-99%, range from 78% to 100%). However, the performance of the chatbots varied. Only one chatbot, Jasper quality, achieved the minimum pass rate of 73% correct answers. Most chatbots demonstrated a median Top-1 accuracy of 47% (IQR 44-53%, range from 42% to 73%), while Top-2 accuracy provided a modest improvement, resulting in a median accuracy of 67% (IQR 65-72%, range from 61% to 82%). Even with this advantage, only two chatbots, Jasper quality and ChatGPT plus 4.0, would have passed the exam. Similar results were observed when picture-based questions were excluded from the dataset. Overall, the study suggests that most current language-based chatbots have limitations in accurately solving theoretical medical board exams. In general, currently widely available chatbots fell short of achieving a passing score in a theoretical cardiology board exam. Nevertheless, a few showed promising results.

33992489,The Need for Telemedicine Integration Into Adult Cardiology Training Curricula in Canada.,"COVID-19 brought telemedicine to the forefront of clinical cardiology. We aimed to examine the extent of trainees' involvement in and comfort with telemedicine practices in Canada with the use of a web-based self-administered survey. Eighty-six trainees from 12 training programs completed the survey (65% response rate). Results showed that before COVID-19, 39 trainees (45%) had telemedicine exposure, compared with 67 (78%) after COVID-19 (P < 0.001). However, only 44 trainees (51%) reported being comfortable or very comfortable with the use of telemedicine. Of the 67 trainees who were involved in telemedicine, 4 (6%) had full supervision during virtual visits, 13 (19%) had partial supervision, and 50 (75%) had minimal or no supervision. Importantly, 67 trainees (78%) expressed the need for telemedicine-specific training and 64 (74%) were willing to have their virtual visits recorded for the purpose of evaluation and feedback. Furthermore, 47 (55%) felt strongly or very strongly positive about incorporating telemedicine into their future practice. The main perceived barriers to telemedicine use were concerns about patients' engagement, fear of weakening the patient-physician relationship, and unfamiliarity with telemedicine technology. These barriers, together with training in virtual physical examination skills and medicolegal aspects of telemedicine, are addressed in several established internal medicine telemedicine curricula that could be adapted by cardiology programs. In conclusion, while the degree of telemedicine involvement since COVID-19 was high, the trainees' comfort level with telemedicine practice remains suboptimal likely due to lack of training and inadequate staff supervision. Therefore, a cardiology telemedicine curriculum is needed to ensure that trainees are equipped to embrace telemedicine in cardiovascular clinical care.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2021-Jun,"Almufleh A, Lee C, Tsang MY, Gin K, Tsang TSM, Nair P",6,1873,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
39622018,Instituto y no hospital. La distintiva organización que Ignacio Chávez concibió para combatir integralmente a las enfermedades del corazón en México. En el octogésimo aniversario del Instituto Nacional de Cardiología.,"In 1936, Ignacio Chávez submitted a proposal to the Mexican government for the creation of a cardiology institute. He had studied in Paris, Berlin, and other European cities in 1926. Upon his return to Mexico, he founded the Cardiology Service at the General Hospital in Mexico City, the first of its kind in the country. The National Institute of Cardiology of Mexico was inaugurated on April 18, 1944, becoming one of the first cardiology institutes in the world. Chávez explained the purpose of this new institute: ""We were born with the purpose of studying, researching, and controlling heart diseases."" According to him, the institute should be a place where cardiovascular diseases could be addressed comprehensively, combining clinical practice with research and teaching to provide effective knowledge for patient care and scientific advancement. ""A health center is for the patient, of course; but something more than that is necessary: a great school for doctors, a great laboratory for researchers, and a social instrument of human help,"" he said. This vision was summarized in the words: love and science at the service of the heart. Chávez successfully institutionalized cardiology in Mexico. From its inception, the institute became an internationally recognized center, attracting students from various countries. Alfredo de Micheli noted that under Chávez's influence and example, new institutions emerged in the national medical field and expanded onto the international stage. The institute founded by Chávez became a model for similar institutions on other continents and a driving force in the international cardiology movement. Chávez's legacy was a work of love, intelligence, and culture, dedicated to the heart and the care of humanity.",Archivos de cardiologia de Mexico,2024-Dec,Izaguirre-Ávila R,1,1760,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

A survey was sent via email to all (N = 63) pediatric cardiology training program directors in the United States to evaluate the perceived exercise training needs of pediatric cardiology fellows. The survey consisted of multiple-choice responses as well as a few open-ended responses. A 60% response rate was achieved. 74% of programs did not have a pre-existing exercise core program. This type of training was felt to be important or very important in 84%. A wide variability of time allotted for exercise training exists amongst programs from < 1 week to > 4 weeks, with 2 weeks being most common. There was no consensus on a target number of total exercise tests nor types of tests in which fellows should participate. Preferred methods in training consisted of lectures and online media. Less preferred methods of teaching methods included dedicated reading of a handbook, a dedicated rotation, or live webinars. There was general support to develop exercise training competencies as well as the associated online learning materials with a focus on competency rather than target numbers.

37526495,"Changes of heart: Debating the role of cardiology and cardiac surgery in India, 1948-1968.","In 1950, the leaders of independent India celebrated the contributions that surgeons could make to modernising India. Surgeons, however, faced a difficult choice. Some wanted to invest in generalist surgeons to make basic surgical care available to all Indians. Others wanted to invest in specialists to ensure that India participated in cutting-edge surgical research and care. These debates shaped the emergence of cardiac surgery at two centres: the Christian Medical College in Vellore and the King Edward Memorial Hospital in Bombay. CMC invested in thoracic surgery in the 1940s to offer new treatments for tuberculosis. This gave surgeons the opportunity to explore new techniques of cardiac surgery. Debate quickly emerged about whether investments in cardiology and cardiac surgery made sense. In the end, the specialities were supported in order to attract paying patients. A parallel controversy took place at KEM, where the dean debated the Bombay Municipal Corporation about the role of surgical research at a public hospital. The Rockefeller Foundation influenced both sites, offering financial support if they adopted an American model of full-time faculty clinician-researchers.

Shortages in workforce have led to focus on how to increase clinical capacity. However, a simplistic focus on training clinicians will not fill the gaps in research, policy and implementation, which also need to be addressed at the same time. There are multiple efforts to develop early career capacity across diverse areas at national and international level to address these gaps.

38366821,Device innovation in cardiovascular medicine: a report from the European Society of Cardiology Cardiovascular Round Table.,"Research performed in Europe has driven cardiovascular device innovation. This includes, but is not limited to, percutaneous coronary intervention, cardiac imaging, transcatheter heart valve implantation, and device therapy of cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. An important part of future medical progress involves the evolution of medical technology and the ongoing development of artificial intelligence and machine learning. There is a need to foster an environment conducive to medical technology development and validation so that Europe can continue to play a major role in device innovation while providing high standards of safety. This paper summarizes viewpoints on the topic of device innovation in cardiovascular medicine at the European Society of Cardiology Cardiovascular Round Table, a strategic forum for high-level dialogue to discuss issues related to the future of cardiovascular health in Europe. Devices are developed and improved through an iterative process throughout their lifecycle. Early feasibility studies demonstrate proof of concept and help to optimize the design of a device. If successful, this should ideally be followed by randomized clinical trials comparing novel devices vs. accepted standards of care when available and the collection of post-market real-world evidence through registries. Unfortunately, standardized procedures for feasibility studies across various device categories have not yet been implemented in Europe. Cardiovascular imaging can be used to diagnose and characterize patients for interventions to improve procedural results and to monitor devices long term after implantation. Randomized clinical trials often use cardiac imaging-based inclusion criteria, while less frequently trials randomize patients to compare the diagnostic or prognostic value of different modalities. Applications using machine learning are increasingly important, but specific regulatory standards and pathways remain in development in both Europe and the USA. Standards are also needed for smart devices and digital technologies that support device-driven biomonitoring. Changes in device regulation introduced by the European Union aim to improve clinical evidence, transparency, and safety, but they may impact the speed of innovation, access, and availability. Device development programmes including dialogue on unmet needs and advice on study designs must be driven by a community of physicians, trialists, patients, regulators, payers, and industry to ensure that patients have access to innovative care.",European heart journal,2024-Apr,"Windecker S, Gilard M, Achenbach S, Cribier A, Delgado V, Deych N, Drossart I, Eltchaninoff H, Fraser AG, Goncalves A, Hindricks G, Holborow R, Kappetein AP, Kilmartin J, Kurucova J, Lüscher TF, Mehran R, O'Connor DB, Perkins M, Samset E, von Bardeleben RS, Weidinger F",22,2556,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

34217807,Canadian Cardiovascular Society: Clinical Practice Update on Cardiovascular Management of the Pregnant Patient.,"The number of women of childbearing age with cardiovascular disease (CVD) is growing because of increased survival of children with congenital heart disease. More women are also becoming pregnant at an older age, which is associated with increased rates of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and acquired CVD. Over the past decade the field of cardio-obstetrics has significantly advanced with the development of multidisciplinary cardio-obstetric programs (COPs) to address the increasing burden of CVD in pregnancy. With the introduction of formal COPs, pregnancy outcomes in women with heart disease have improved. COPs provide preconception counselling, antenatal and postpartum cardiac surveillance, and labor and delivery planning. Prepregnancy counselling in a COP should be offered to women with suspected CVD who are of childbearing age. In women who present while pregnant, counselling should be performed in a COP as early as possible in pregnancy. The purpose of counselling is to reduce the risk of pregnancy to the mother and fetus whenever possible. This is done through accurate maternal and fetal risk stratification, optimizing cardiac lesions, reviewing safety of medications in pregnancy, and making a detailed plan for the pregnancy, labor, and delivery. This Clinical Practice Update highlights the COP approach to prepregnancy counselling, risk stratification, and management of commonly encountered cardiac conditions through pregnancy. We highlight ""red flags"" that should trigger a more timely assessment in a COP.

31787326,Reprint of : Transcatheter closure of patent foramen ovale to prevent stroke recurrence in patients with otherwise unexplained ischaemic stroke: Expert consensus of the French Neurovascular Society and the French Society of Cardiology.,"Unlike previous randomized clinical trials (RCTs), recent trials and meta-analyses have shown that transcatheter closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) reduces stroke recurrence risk in young and middle-aged adults with an otherwise unexplained PFO-associated ischaemic stroke. To produce an expert consensus on the role of transcatheter PFO closure and antithrombotic drugs for secondary stroke prevention in patients with PFO-associated ischaemic stroke. Five neurologists and five cardiologists with extensive experience in the relevant field were nominated by the French Neurovascular Society and the French Society of Cardiology to make recommendations based on evidence from RCTs and meta-analyses. The experts recommend that any decision concerning treatment of patients with PFO-associated ischaemic stroke should be taken after neurological and cardiological evaluation, bringing together the necessary neurovascular, echocardiography and interventional cardiology expertise. Transcatheter PFO closure is recommended in patients fulfilling all the following criteria: age 16-60 years; recent (≤6 months) ischaemic stroke; PFO associated with atrial septal aneurysm (>10mm) or with a right-to-left shunt>20 microbubbles or with a diameter≥2mm; PFO felt to be the most likely cause of stroke after thorough aetiological evaluation by a stroke specialist. Long-term oral anticoagulation may be considered in the event of contraindication to or patient refusal of PFO closure, in the absence of a high bleeding risk. After PFO closure, dual anti-platelet therapy with aspirin (75mg/day) and clopidogrel (75mg/day) is recommended for 3 months, followed by monotherapy with aspirin or clopidogrel for≥5 years. Although a big step forward that will benefit many patients has been taken with recent trials, many questions remain unanswered. Pending results from further studies, decision-making regarding management of patients with PFO-associated ischaemic stroke should be based on a close coordination between neurologists/stroke specialists and cardiologists.",Revue neurologique,2020-,"Mas JL, Derex L, Guérin P, Guillon B, Habib G, Juliard JM, Marijon E, Massardier E, Meneveau N, Vuillier F",10,2063,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

To investigate the prescription patterns and appropriateness of aspirin in a real-world clinical setting. Cross-sectional study. The Appropriateness of Aspirin Use in Medical Outpatients: A Multicenter, Observational Study (ASSOS) is a cross-sectional and multicenter study that included 5007 consecutive patients aged 18 or over who presented to 30 different cardiology outpatient clinics from 14 cities throughout Turkey. Only patients using aspirin (80-325 mg) were included. The study population was divided into 2 groups regarding the use of aspirin: primary prevention (PP) group and secondary prevention (SP) group. The indication of aspirin use was evaluated following the 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the 2016 United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPTF) guidelines in the PP group. A total of 5007 patients (mean age 62.15 ± 11.05, 39% female) were enrolled. The PP group included 1132 (22.6%) patients, and the SP group included 3875 (77.4%) patients.

39592164,Heart valve clinics: an expanding role for the clinical scientists - validation of a framework for competency and certification.,"Valvular heart disease (VHD) represents a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide, necessitating specialised care through multidisciplinary valve clinics. However, there is a lack of a standardised training and certification framework for clinical scientists and specialist physiologists (CSSPs) working within specialist valve clinics (SVCs). This study aimed to design, implement and validate a competency framework dedicated to training and certifying valve CSSPs to enhance patient outcomes and establish standardised care. A comprehensive competency framework was developed and implemented, consisting of two levels: Enhanced Valve Clinic Training (EVCT) and Advanced Valve Clinic Training (AVCT). The programme was trialled at Guy's Valve Clinic, London, over a 12-month period. Validation was undertaken through trainee and patient feedback, including multiple-choice questions, clinical skills assessments, and patient satisfaction surveys. Nine CSSPs completed the EVCT and four the AVCT. All participants passed their certification examinations with scores ranging from 80% to 95%. The time to complete each programme averaged 6 months. After certification, clinical queries raised by EVCT trainees averaged 1.2 per session but dropped by 75% to 0.3 per session in the AVCT group, indicating greater confidence and independence in managing cases. Physician review of trainee-led cases led to additional tests or treatment changes in 23% of cases and referrals to physician clinics in 11%. Patient feedback was positive: 95% felt confident in the clinical scientists' knowledge, and 100% were satisfied with the clarity of their care plans and follow-up. The implementation of this training and certification framework demonstrated enhanced clinical outcomes and care delivery in SVCs. By advocating for formal recognition and accreditation of valve clinic training, this framework could serve as a model for national and international standardisation in valve care and clinical training.",Open heart,2024-Nov,"Zhou C, Fekadu J, Hayes A, Aure N, Sivalinganathan M, Bowen L, Campbell B, Subbiah S, Page C, Bennett S, Rajani R, Demetrescu C",12,2008,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

We used 168 questions: 141 text-only and 27 image-based, categorized into four sections mirroring the CBNC exam. Each LLM was presented with the same standardized prompt and applied to each section 30 times to account for stochasticity. Performance over six weeks was assessed for all models except GPT-4o. McNemar's test compared correct response proportions. GPT-4, Gemini, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o correctly answered median percentages of 56.8% (95% confidence interval 55.4% - 58.0%), 40.5% (39.9% - 42.9%), 60.7% (59.5% - 61.3%), and 63.1% (62.5%-64.3%) of questions, respectively.

31302789,Feasibility evaluation of non-invasive cardiac function technology during echocardiography-based cardiac stress testing.,"Evaluation of cardiac function during periods of stress is of key importance for the perioperative setting. Non-invasive hemodynamic monitors provide markers of cardiac function. This pilot study sought to evaluate the ability of a non-invasive hemodynamic monitor to detect cardiac stress during formal stress echocardiography testing. The primary goal was to compare the change in hemodynamic values during the pre/during/post phases of stress echocardiography testing in patients who had results negative versus positive for myocardial ischemia. Adult patients scheduled for outpatient cardiac stress testing were screened. Only patients scheduled for stress-echocardiography testing were consented. Patients with history of arrhythmias were excluded. During the testing, patients wore a cuff-based hemodynamic sensor (Nexfin system, Edwards Lifesciences). Data from the hemodynamic sensor were compared to the findings of the stress study. A total of 37 patients were enrolled, with 31 patients included for analysis. Five patients had stress studies positive for coronary ischemia. Comparison of the hemodynamic variables between patients who had a positive stress study versus negative showed a significant reduction in the percentage change in dP/dt and stroke volume from baseline (p < 0.05).

32332807,Three-Dimensional Rotational Angiography during Catheterization of Congenital Heart Disease - A ten Years' experience at a single center.,"This paper aims to assess the usability and advantages of three-dimensional rotational angiography (3DRA) in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) and its application in the cath lab. Up to now, its use in CHD is not widespread or standardized. We analyzed all patients with CHD who underwent a 3DRA at our facility between January 2010 and May 2019. The 3DRAs were evaluated for radiation exposure, contrast dye consumption, diagnostic utility and image quality. We performed 872 3DRAs. 3DRA was used in 67.1% of the cases for interventional procedures and in 32.9% for diagnostic purposes. Two different acquisition programs were applied. The median dose-area product (DAP) for all 872 rotations was 54.1 µGym<sup>2</sup> (21.7-147.5 µGym<sup>2</sup>) and 1.6 ml/kg (0.9-2.07 ml/kg) of contrast dye was used. Diagnostic utility of the generated 3D-model was rated superior to the native 3D angiography in 94% (819/872). 3DRA is an excellent and save diagnostic and interventional tool. However, 3DRA has not become a standard imaging procedure in pediatric cardiology up to now.

Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of a 3-year quality improvement and patient safety (QI/PS) curriculum that gives fellows both didactic knowledge and first-hand experience with improvement science, and meets Clinical Learning Environment Review (CLER) requirements. Knowledge assessment is obtained through pre- and post-surveys. A secondary measure of success is academic products resulting from fellows' QI/PS work, and future participation in QI/PS efforts. Since 2019, 51 pre-tests and 36 post-tests were completed, showing improvement across all competencies. Fellows have produced one published manuscript, two poster presentations, and two oral presentations describing their improvement work. Additionally, mentoring faculty members have gone on to lead other QI work throughout the division. This longitudinal QI/PS curriculum provides both knowledge and experience in QI/PS work. It also creates opportunities for academic publications and presentations, builds faculty expertise, and most importantly, works to improve multiple aspects of patient care.

39510937,Reprint of: Scientific statement from the French neurovascular and cardiac societies for improved detection of atrial fibrillation after ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack.,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the primary cause of ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA). AF is associated with a high risk of recurrence, which can be reduced using optimal prevention strategies, mainly anticoagulant therapy. The availability of effective prophylaxis justifies the need for a significant, coordinated and thorough transdisciplinary effort to screen for AF associated with stroke. A recent French national survey, initiated and supported by the Société française neurovasculaire (SFNV) and the Société française de cardiologie (SFC), revealed many shortcomings, such as the absence or inadequacy of telemetry equipment in more than half of stroke units, insufficient and highly variable access to monitoring tools, delays in performing screening tests, heterogeneous access to advanced or connected ambulatory monitoring techniques, and a lack of dedicated human resources. The present scientific document has been prepared on the initiative of the SFNV and the SFC with the aim of helping to address the current shortcomings and gaps, to promote efficient and cost-effective AF detection, and to improve and, where possible, homogenize the quality of practice in AF screening among stroke units and outpatient post-stroke care networks. The working group, composed of cardiologists and vascular neurologists who are experts in the field and are nominated by their peers, reviewed the literature to propose statements, which were discussed in successive cycles, and maintained, either by consensus or by vote, as appropriate. The text was then submitted to the SFNV and SFC board members for review. This scientific statement document argues for the widespread development of patient pathways to enable the most efficient AF screening after stroke. This assessment should be carried out by a multidisciplinary team, including expert cardiologists and vascular neurologists.",Revue neurologique,2024-Dec,"Gaillard N, Deharo JC, Suissa L, Defaye P, Sibon I, Leclercq C, Alamowitch S, Guidoux C, Cohen A",9,1904,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

A position statement of the Polish Cardiac Society endorsed by Polish Society of Human Genetics and Cardiovascular Patient Communities.,"According to the latest guidelines of European and American medical societies, genetic testing (GT) is essential in cardiovascular diseases for establishing diagnosis, predicting prognosis, enabling initiation of disease-modifying therapy, and preventing sudden cardiac death. The GT result may be relevant for cascade GT in the patient's relatives, for planning his/her profession and physical activity, and for procreative counseling. This position statement has been prepared due to the scarcity of GT in cardiovascular diseases in Poland and the need to expand its availability. We give a concise description of the genetic background of cardiomyopathies, channelopathies, aortopathies, familial hypercholesterolemia, pheochromocytomas, and paragangliomas. The article discusses various aspects of GT in specific populations, such as children or athletes, and also presents prenatal genetic diagnostics. We propose recommendations for GT and counselling, which take into account Polish needs and capabilities. We give an outline of legal regulations, good clinical practice in GT with respect for patient rights, the role of cardiologists and clinical geneticists in GT planning and post-test counseling, and the requirements for laboratories performing genetic tests.

38727825,Assessing the State of Training in Congenital Interventional Cardiology: A Global Survey of Program Directors.,"This study aimed to evaluate the current state of congenital interventional cardiology training worldwide, with a focus on case volumes, competency assessment, and the need for ongoing mentorship during early career stages. A survey was conducted among program directors (PDs) of congenital interventional training programs across the globe. The survey gathered data on training pathways, case volumes, types of procedures performed, trainee competency assessment, and the role of ongoing mentorship. Of the 79 PDs who completed the survey, it was observed that training pathways and case volumes varied significantly, particularly between the United States and other countries. Most PDs reported an annual laboratory case volume of >500 congenital cardiac cases, with most cases being interventional. While trainees demonstrated competency in simple procedures (diagnostic cases, simple ASD closure), complex interventions (such as patent ductus arteriosus closure in premature infants) require ongoing mentorship for graduates. PDs recommended a minimum case volume of 400 total cases for trainees, including 250 interventional cases. In addition to case volumes, assessing trainee competency was deemed important, with clinical reasoning, judgment, skillset, teamwork, and complication management being key areas of evaluation. The study highlights the variability in congenital interventional cardiology training and the need for ongoing mentorship during the early career years. External mentorship programs, facilitated by national and international societies, are proposed to provide critical support for early career interventionalists thus enhancing patient care for congenital heart disease. Ultimately, the findings of this survey may serve as a framework for future training standards and guidelines in this specialized field.",Pediatric cardiology,2025-Apr,"Aggarwal V, Butera G, Boe B, Celebi A, Downing T, Rossi RF, Kenny D, Linsky N, Pan X, Sivakumar K, Whiteside W, Hijazi ZM, Armstrong AK",13,1838,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Differing opinions exist regarding the utility of comprehensive final examinations in veterinary courses. A mixed-methods prospective randomized trial was undertaken with veterinary students (<i>n</i> = 47) in an elective cardiology course. All students received identical content, which was presented through weekly in-class lectures (eight total lessons). They were given access to four different formats of study aids and completed quizzes of content knowledge within 1 week of each lesson. For the cumulative final examination (post-test), students were explicitly instructed to study only for four out of the eight lessons. Students then completed a delayed post-test 3-6 months after completion of the course. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected in the form of in-depth pre- and post-course surveys. Overall, studying a particular lesson for the post-test resulted in higher scores for six out of eight lessons in the post-test (<i>p <</i> .05) but did not result in significantly higher scores for any lesson in the delayed post-test. Time spent studying for individual quizzes, as well as other measures of study habits, decreased significantly throughout the semester. Among study aids, student preference was highest for instructor-provided graphic organizers, and this preference persisted across the semester with a shift away from instructor-provided outlines over time (<i>p</i> = .043). Free-text survey responses showed that students had realistic expectations for the impact of studying for the post-test and appreciated exposure to a variety of study aid formats.

Multicenter survey and results of a comparative study evaluating a new educational approach.,"Learning to interpret electrocardiograms (ECGs) is a crucial objective in medical education. Despite its importance, errors in ECGs interpretation are common, and the optimal teaching methods have not yet been clearly established. To evaluate students' confidence in ECGs analysis and their opinion on current teaching methods, and to assess the effectiveness of a new ECG educational approach. First, we conducted a survey on ECG learning among fourth to sixth-year medical students. Second, a 5-week multicenter comparative study was conducted with fourth-year medical students during their cardiology internship. Two different teaching methods were used, assigned by center. The first group participated in 5-minutes workshops 4 times a week using a ""reversed classroom"" method, supervised by a cardiologist, where students took turns selecting, presenting and discussing ECGs. The control group attended a single 2-hour face-to-face ECG course. All participants completed a 30-minute ECGs analysis test at baseline and after 5 weeks. Out of 401 survey respondents, the confidence levels in ECG interpretation were 3/5 (IQR 2-3) for routine situations and 2/5 (IQR 1-3) for emergency situations. Satisfaction with ECG teaching was low (2/5, IQR 1-3) and 96.3% of respondents favored more extensive ECG training. In the comparative study, 52 students from 3 medical schools were enrolled (control group: n = 27; workshop group: n = 25). Both groups showed significant improvement in exam scores from baseline to 5-week (33/100 ± 12/100 to 44/100 ± 12/100, p < 0.0001 for the control group and 36/100 ± 13/100 to 62/100 ± 12/100, p < 0.0001 for the workshop group). The improvement was significantly greater in the workshop group compared to the control group (+ 26 ± 11 vs. + 11 ± 6, p < 0.001).

What a review of Nobel Prize nominations reveals about scientific trends.,"Since 1901, at least 15 scholars who contributed to cardiovascular research have received a Nobel prize in physiology or medicine. Using the Nobel nomination database (nobelprize.org), which contains 5950 nominations in the accessible period from 1901 to 1953 in physiology or medicine, we listed all international nominees who contributed to cardiovascular research. We subsequently collected nomination letters and jury reports of the prime candidates from the archive of the Nobel Committee in Sweden to identify shortlisted candidates. The five most frequently nominated researchers with cardiovascular connections from 1901 to 1953 were, in descending order, the surgeon René Leriche (1879-1955) (FR) with a total of 79 nominations, the physiologist and 1924 Nobel laureate Willem Einthoven (1860-1927) (NL) (31 nominations), the surgeon Alfred Blalock (1899-1964) (US) (29 nominations), the pharmacologist and 1936 Nobel laureate Otto Loewi (1873-1961) (DE, AT, US) (27 nominations) and the paediatric cardiologist Helen Taussig (1898-1986) (US) (24 nominations). The research of these scholars merely hints at the width of topics brought up by nominators ranging from the physiological and pathological basics to the diagnosis and (surgical) interventions of diseases such as heart malformation or hypertension.

We hypothesized that implementing an explicit 7-week CR curriculum taught in a large-enrollment elective veterinary cardiology course would improve students' awareness of clinical reasoning principles, self-efficacy of CR skills, and application of CR principles in clinical case analyses. A secondary aim was to assess the impact of peer review as a means of providing feedback in a large classroom setting. A mixed method approach was used with veterinary students (<i>N</i> = 78) in a cardiology elective course meeting twice weekly for a half-semester (7 weeks). Course content included a 1-week introduction to CR led by the instructor and 6 weeks of instructor-facilitated, case-based learning. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected, including pre- and post-course surveys, weekly peer reviews for six clinical case assignments, and instructor-graded clinical cases for three case assignments. Students reported improved self-efficacy across all CR skill categories (<i>p</i> < .001) and significant improvement in applied CR skills was demonstrated in both peer- (<i>p</i> < .001) and instructor-graded assignments (<i>p</i> < .001). Peer reviews provided a means for students to reflect on and internalize CR skills, which may play a role in improved self-efficacy. In an elective cardiology course, implementing an explicit CR curriculum resulted in improved student awareness and self-efficacy of CR, as well as improved applied CR skills.",Journal of veterinary medical education,2025-Aug,"Klehm CD, Karabulut-Ilgu A, Tropf MA",3,1555,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
34155081,Implementation of a virtual international cardiology curriculum to address the deficit of cardiovascular education in Haiti: a pilot study.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, conferring a disparate burden on low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Haiti represents a resource-constrained setting, limited by a paucity of resources and trained cardiovascular professionals equipped to address the increasing burden of CVD. Here, we describe the creation of a comprehensive cardiology curriculum delivered through a virtual classroom. The curriculum was created to augment cardiovascular education in LMICs such as Haiti. Over one academic year (May 2019-2020), International Cardiology Curriculum Accessible by Remote Distance Learning-Haiti consisted of biweekly, live-streamed, synchronous didactic lectures, seminars and case presentations broadcasted to 16 internal medicine (IM) residents at Hôpital Universitaire de Mirebalais, one of only four IM training programmes in Haiti. The virtual classroom was created using commercially available videoconferencing and data-sharing platforms. Prelecture and postlecture surveys and an end of the year survey were administered to assess the impact of the curriculum. Participant performance analysis revealed that 80% of the curriculum demonstrated a positive trend in knowledge acquisition postintervention. Based on the end of the year evaluation, 94% of participants reported that the curriculum was educational and relevant to medical practice in Haiti and 100% reported that the curriculum was good to excellent. Additionally, the curriculum was cited as an effective means of maintaining trainee education during the COVID-19 pandemic. This international medical education pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of augmenting cardiology education in LMICs by creating a virtual curriculum made possible by local partnerships, internet access and technology.",BMJ open,2021-Jun,"Haynes NA, Saint-Joy V, Swain J, Ezekwesili A, Vernet FV, Dawson C, Laneau D, Tierney A, Shea JA, Ambrose MS",10,1837,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
32926088,Identifying Recommendations for Stopping or Scaling Back Unnecessary Routine Services in Primary Care.,"Much of health care involves established, routine use of medical services for chronic conditions or prevention. Stopping these services when the evidence changes or if the benefits no longer outweigh the risks is essential. Yet, most guidelines focus on escalating care and provide few explicit recommendations to stop or scale back (ie, deintensify) treatment and testing. To develop a systematic, transparent, and reproducible approach for identifying, specifying, and validating deintensification recommendations associated with routine adult primary care. A focused review of existing guidelines and recommendations was completed to identify and prioritize potential deintensification indications. Then, 2 modified virtual Delphi expert panels examined the synthesized evidence, suggested ways that the candidate recommendations could be improved, and assessed the validity of the recommendations using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Twenty-five physicians from Veterans Affairs and US academic institutions with knowledge in relevant clinical areas (eg, geriatrics, primary care, women's health, cardiology, and endocrinology) served as panel members. Validity of the recommendations, defined as high-quality evidence that deintensification is likely to improve patient outcomes, evidence that intense testing and/or treatment could cause harm in some patients, absence of evidence on the benefit of continued or repeated intense treatment or testing, and evidence that deintensification is consistent with high-quality care. A total of 409 individual recommendations were identified representing 178 unique opportunities to stop or scale back routine services (eg, stopping population-based screening for vitamin D deficiency and decreasing concurrent use of opioids and benzodiazepines). Thirty-seven recommendations were prioritized and forwarded to the expert panels. Panelists reviewed the evidence and suggested modifications, resulting in 44 recommendations being rated. Overall, 37 recommendations (84%) were considered to be valid, as assessed by the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. In this study, a total of 178 unique opportunities to deintensify routine primary care services were identified, and 37 of these were validated as high-priority deintensification recommendations. To date, this is the first study to develop a model for identifying, specifying, and validating deintensification recommendations that can be implemented and tracked in clinical practice.",JAMA internal medicine,2020-Nov,"Kerr EA, Klamerus ML, Markovitz AA, Sussman JB, Bernstein SJ, Caverly TJ, Chou R, Min L, Saini SD, Lohman SE, Skurla SE, Goodrich DE, Froehlich W, Hofer TP",14,2489,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
39377635,Position statement of Polish Cardiac Society experts on cardiomyopathy.,"Cardiomyopathies (CMs) are a very broad group of diseases, including genetically determined and acquired, and their classification is based on phenotypic characteristics. There is always a need to search for the etiology (often also to try to identify the genetic cause), which may determine the appropriate choice of clinical management. The geographical distribution of genetic variants varies as does the prevalence across populations, ethnic groups, regions, and countries. The most reliable data on the distribution of individual genetic variants come from developed countries. The phenotypic classification includes 5 main types of CM, i.e., dilated CM, hypertrophic, restrictive, arrhythmogenic right ventricular CM, and non-dilated left ventricular (LV) CM. Individual CMs are characterized by a variety of causes and different phenotypic pictures, which affect their presentation, diagnosis, and response to treatment. Within each type of CM, there are both familial and sporadic (acquired) forms. The complex presentation of CM, as well as the limited availability of screening and diagnostic tests, causes CMs to be diagnosed late, often at an advanced stage of the disease. Therapeutic management of CM is strictly determined by its type and clinical picture. Diagnostics include the assessment of symptoms, the results of imaging and genetic tests, as well as morphological, functional, and often histological assessment. This allows for personalized and dedicated clinical management. To optimize thediagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with CMs, an individualized, expert, systemic, coordinated, and often multidisciplinary structure of care is necessary. Hence, it is important to create multidisciplinary teams for CM management. We present examples of existing systemic solutions for the care of CM patients in Europe (France and Spain). Not all of these options are available to patients in our country. This article presents issues related to CM and may be the basis for developing a diagnostic and therapeutic model allowing for earlier detection of CM in Polish patients and their effective treatment.",Kardiologia polska,2024-,"Mizia-Stec K, Burchardt P, Mazurkiewicz Ł, Tajstra M, Wybraniec M, Mitkowski P, Bartuś S, Biernacka EK, Gierlotka M, Sterliński M, Wojakowski W, Witkowski A, Gil RJ, Farkowski M, Szymański P, Tycińska A, Kowalski O, Grzybowski J, Leszek P",19,2129,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Survey results identified key competencies deemed to be inadequately addressed during training and those in which a moderate or significant additional amount of training was desired. These competencies were identified within the 4 main domains of the fellowship: heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, mechanical circulatory support, and heart transplantation. This study highlights key medical-knowledge competencies that are inadequately addressed by current fellowship training in advanced heart failure and transplant cardiology.

38818617,The autonomic nervous system and the origins of neurocardiology.,"Following new concepts by Bichat in the early 19th century, of organic and animal life centered around the ganglionic nervous system, over 100 years of anatomic studies and physiologic experimentation eventually resulted in Gaskell's 1916 book entitled ""The Involuntary Nervous System"" and Langley's 1921 book entitled ""The Autonomic Nervous System."" Neurology and cardiology emerged as specialties of medicine in the early 20th century. Although neurology made several prominent discoveries in neurophysiology during the first half of the 20th century, cardiology developed coronary care units and cardiac catheterization in the 1960s. Programmed electrical stimulation of the heart and noninvasive ambulatory monitoring provided new methodologies to study clinical cardiac arrhythmias. Experimentally, direct cardiac nerve stimulation of sympathetic nerve endings, as well as parasympathetic control of the atrioventricular node, provided the background to new detailed autonomic studies of the heart. Neurocardiology, perhaps initially more directed towards our understanding of sudden cardiac death, ultimately embraced an even significantly more complex scheme of local circuit neurons and near-endless loops of interconnecting neurons in the heart. Intrathoracic extracardiac and intracardiac ganglia have been recharacterized, both anatomically and physiologically, laying the groundwork for potential new therapies of cardiac neuromodulation.",Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology,2024-Aug,Lemery R,1,1450,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

34813876,The Role of Machine Learning in Cardiovascular Pathology.,"Machine learning has seen slow but steady uptake in diagnostic pathology over the past decade to assess digital whole-slide images. Machine learning tools have incredible potential to standardise, and likely even improve, histopathologic diagnoses, but they are not yet widely used in clinical practice. We describe the principles of these tools and technologies and some successful preclinical and pretranslational efforts in cardiovascular pathology, as well as a roadmap for moving forward. In nonhuman animal models, one proof-of-principle application is in rodent progressive cardiomyopathy, which is of particular significance to drug toxicity studies. Basic science successes include screening the quality of differentiated stem cells and characterising cardiomyocyte developmental stages, with potential applications for research and toxicology/drug safety screening using derived or native human pluripotent stem cells differentiated into cardiomyocytes. Translational studies of particular note include those with success in diagnosing the various forms of heart allograft rejection. For fully realising the value of these tools in clinical cardiovascular pathology, we identify 3 essential challenges. First is image quality standardisation to ensure that algorithms can be developed and implemented on robust, consistent data. The second is consensus diagnosis; experts don't always agree, and thus ""truth"" may be difficult to establish, but the algorithms themselves may provide a solution. The third is the need for large-enough data sets to facilitate robust algorithm development, necessitating large cross-institutional shared image databases. The power of histopathology-based machine learning technologies is tremendous, and we outline the next steps needed to capitalise on this power.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2022-Feb,"Glass C, Lafata KJ, Jeck W, Horstmeyer R, Cooke C, Everitt J, Glass M, Dov D, Seidman MA",9,1805,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

While awareness of cardiotoxicity due to cancer disease and/or therapies has greatly increased, much of the attention has focused on myocardial systolic disfunction and heart failure. However, coronary and structural heart disease are also a common issue in cancer patients and encompass the full spectrum of cardiotoxicity. While invasive percutaneous or surgical intervention, either is often needed or considered in cancer patients, limited evidence or guidelines are available for dealing with coronary or structural heart disease. The Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions consensus document published in 2016 is the most comprehensive document regarding this particular issue, but relevant evidence has emerged since, which render some of its considerations outdated. In addition to that, the recent 2022 ESC Guidelines on Cardio-Oncology only briefly discuss this topic. As a result, the Portuguese Association of Cardiovascular Intervention and the Cardio-Oncology Study Group of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology have partnered to produce a position paper to address the issue of cardiac intervention in cancer patients, focusing on percutaneous techniques.

Propelled by recent advances in technology-catalyzed by COVID-19-and the requirement to adapt age-old methods of both teaching and health care delivery, many aspects, or 'domains', of learning have changed. These include the environments in which FITs work (outpatient clinics, 'on-call' inpatient service) and procedures in which they need clinical competency. Further advances in virtual reality are also changing the way FITs learn and interact. The proliferation of technology into the cardiology curriculum has led to some describing the need for FITs to develop into 'digital cardiologists', namely those who comfortably use digital tools to aid clinical practice, teaching, and training whilst, at the same time, retain the ability for human analysis and nuanced assessment so important to patient-centred training and clinical care.",Current problems in cardiology,2022-Dec,"Vandermolen S, Ricci F, Chahal CAA, Capelli C, Barakat K, Fedorowski A, Westwood M, Patel RS, Petersen SE, Gallina S, Pugliese F, Khanji MY",12,986,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
31880471,Modeling Clinical Processes to Consent Research Donors of Remnant Biospecimens in an Outpatient Cardiology Clinic.,"<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Informed consent for research biospecimen donations is traditionally obtained through a face-to-face interaction with research staff and by signing an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved printed form. Electronic signatures (eSign) are routinely used in the electronic medical record (EMR) for the consenting of clinical services after patients review printed documentation. Our goal was to develop an electronic self-consenting workflow that mimicked clinical services. Specifically, we tested a research consent process for the biobanking of remnant clinical samples that relies solely on clinical resources in a busy outpatient practice. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> The Biorepositories Core Resource (BCR) unit initiated a new enterprise-wide biobanking infrastructure for consenting patients, termed Biospecimen Use for Research-Related Investigations and Translational Objectives (BURRITO). BURRITO is modeled after an established clinical process called Terms and Conditions of Service (TACOS). The TACOS requires patients to annually review printed documentation and self-consent electronically for clinical services. BURRITO also requires patients to review printed documentation and self-consent with eSign to opt-in for remnant biospecimen banking, but patients must complete this process only once. We captured eSign for consents directly into the EMR without research staff. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Patients reviewed the IRB-approved documents and self-consented during their cardiology clinic visit. At checkout, their participation preferences were electronically documented by clinic staff. During a 6-month period, 123 patients agreed to donate. After a review of process, a second 3-month period identified 202 patients agreeing to donate. BURRITO did not require face-to-face interactions with research staff, used a ""no-paper"" eSign for consent, and created discrete fields in the clinical EMR of the patient's preference. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> BURRITO electronically documents informed consent using an EMR functionality and the least amount of clinical and research resources. Our results show promise for developing institutionally adopted processes, which could leverage existing clinical workflows for universal research consenting and scalability.",Biopreservation and biobanking,2020-Apr,"Soares SE, Anderson NR, Solis LJ, López JE",4,2318,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

We translated these codes into discrete medical content areas using a newly developed ""crosswalk tool."" Residents' clinical exposure was enriched in infectious diseases (ID) and cardiovascular disease content at baseline. During the pandemic's surge, ID became the dominant content area. Exposure to other content was dramatically reduced, with clinical diversity repopulating only toward the end of the study period.

ChatGPT, a natural language processing technology developed by OpenAI, is widely used in various industries, including healthcare. The application of ChatGPT in healthcare is still evolving, with studies exploring its potential in clinical decision-making, patient education, workflow optimization, and scientific literature. ChatGPT could be exploited in the medical field to improve patient education and information, thus increasing compliance. ChatGPT could facilitate information exchange on major cardiovascular diseases, provide clinical decision support, and improve patient communication and education. It could assist the clinician in differential diagnosis, suggest appropriate imaging modalities, and optimize treatment plans based on evidence-based guidelines. However, it is unclear whether it will be possible to use ChatGPT for the management of patients who require rapid decisions. Indeed, many drawbacks are associated with the daily use of these technologies in the medical field, such as insufficient expertise in specialized fields and a lack of comprehension of the context in which it works.

38925728,"Lessons for Cardiovascular Clinical Investigators: The Tumultuous 2,500-Year Journey of Physicians Who Ignited Our Fire.","Whereas medical practice stems from Hippocrates, cardiovascular science originates with Aristotle. The Hippocratic philosophy was championed by Galen (129-216 CE), whose advocacy of a tripartite soul found favor in the early Christian Church. In contrast, Aristotle's works were banned as heresy by ecclesiastical authority, only to survive and prosper in the Islamic Golden Age (775-1258 CE). Galen theorized that the circulation consisted of separate venous and arterial systems. Blood was produced in the liver and traveled centrifugally through veins. When arriving in the right ventricle, venous blood passed through tiny pores in the ventricular septum into the left ventricle, where it became aerated by air passing from the lungs through the pulmonary veins to the left side of the heart. Following arrival at distal sites, arterial blood disappeared, being consumed by the tissues, requiring that the liver needed to continually synthesize new blood. The heart was viewed as a sucking organ, and the peripheral pulse was deemed to result from changes in arterial tone, rather than cardiac systole. Galen's framework remained undisputed and dominated medical thought for 1,300 years, but the reintroduction of Aristotelian principles from the Islamic world into Europe (through the efforts of the Toledo School of Translators) were nurtured by the academic freedom and iconoclastic environment uniquely cultivated at the University of Padua, made possible by Venetian rebellion against papal authority. At Padua, the work of Andreas Vesalius, Realdo Colombo, Hieronymus Fabricius ab Acquapendente, and William Harvey (1543-1628) methodically destroyed Galen's model, leading to the modern concept of a closed-ended circulation. Yet, due to political forces, Harvey was ridiculed, as was James Lind, who performed the first prospective controlled trial, involving citrus fruits for scurvy (1747); it took nearly 50 years for his work to be accepted. Even the work of William Withering (1785), the father of cardiovascular pharmacology, was tarnished by professional jealously and the marketing campaign of a pharmaceutical company. Today's cardiovascular investigators should understand that major advances are routinely derided by the medical establishment for political or personal reasons; and it may take decades or centuries for important work to be accepted.",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2024-Jul,Packer M,1,2371,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

The tests were performed in several specific geometries and in addition to eye lens dosemeters the value of a personal dosemeter located at the reference point was also monitored. The value of Hp(3) and Hp(10) was monitored. It is clear from the results that film dosemeters achieve more correct results in most cases.

The referral decision defined by physician reading biosignal-based ECG or CHART report were compared for 550 patients, where its performance is calculated against the ground truth referral decision. The ground truth was established by cardiologist consensus based on all the available measurements and findings including echocardiography (ECHO). The results confirmed that CHART analysis was far more effective than ECG only analysis: CHART reduced false negative rates 15.8% and false positive (FP) rates by 5%, when compared with SOTA ECG devices. General physicians (GP's) using CHART saw their positive diagnosis rate significantly increased, from ~10% to ~26% (260% increase), and the uncertainty rate significantly decreased, from ~31% to ~1.9% (94% decrease). For cardiology, the study showed that in 98% of the cases, the CHART report was found to be a good indicator as to what kind of heart problems can be expected (the 'start-point') in the ECHO examination. The study revealed that GP use of CHART resulted in more accurate referrals for cardiology, resulting in fewer true negative or FP-healthy or mildly abnormal patients not in need of ECHO confirmation. The indirect benefit is the reduction in wait-times and in unnecessary and costly testing in secondary care.

38995217,European Society of Cardiology quality indicators update for the care and outcomes of adults with heart failure. The Heart Failure Association of the ESC.,"To update the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) quality indicators (QIs) for the evaluation of the care and outcomes of adults with heart failure. The Working Group comprised experts in heart failure including members of the ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines Task Force for heart failure, members of the Heart Failure Association, and a patient representative. We followed the ESC methodology for QI development. The 2023 focused guideline update was reviewed to assess the suitability of the recommendations with strongest association with benefit and harm against the ESC criteria for QIs. All the new proposed QIs were individually graded by each panellist via online questionnaires for both validity and feasibility. The existing heart failure QIs also underwent voting to 'keep', 'remove' or 'modify'. Five domains of care for the management of heart failure were identified: (1) structural QIs, (2) patient assessment, (3) initial treatment, (4) therapy optimization, and (5) patient health-related quality of life. In total, 14 'main' and 3 'secondary' QIs were selected across the five domains. This document provides an update of the previously published ESC QIs for heart failure to ensure that these measures are aligned with contemporary evidence. The QIs may be used to quantify adherence to clinical practice as recommended in guidelines to improve the care and outcomes of patients with heart failure.",European journal of heart failure,2024-Sep,"Abdin A, Wilkinson C, Aktaa S, Böhm M, Polovina M, Rosano G, Lainscak M, Lund LH, McDonagh T, Metra M, Adamo M, Mindham R, Piepoli M, Abdelhamid M, Störk S, Tokmakova MP, Seferović P, Coats AJS, Gale CP",19,1418,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

STEEER-AF is a pragmatic trial designed to objectively and robustly determine whether guidelines are adhered to in routine practice and evaluate a targeted educational programme for healthcare professionals. Seventy centres were randomized in six countries (France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and UK; 2022-23). The STEEER-AF centres recruited 1732 patients with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF), with a mean age of 68.9 years (SD 11.7), CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3.2 (SD 1.8), and 647 (37%) women. Eight hundred and forty-three patients (49%) were in AF at enrolment and 760 (44%) in sinus rhythm. Oral anticoagulant therapy was prescribed in 1543 patients (89%), with the majority receiving direct oral anticoagulants (1378; 89%). Previous cardioversion, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, or ablation was recorded in 836 patients (48.3%). Five hundred fifty-one patients (31.8%) were currently receiving an antiarrhythmic drug, and 446 (25.8%) were scheduled to receive a future cardioversion or ablation. The educational programme engaged 195 healthcare professionals across centres randomized to the intervention group, consisting of bespoke interactive online learning and reinforcement activities, supported by national expert trainers. The STEEER-AF trial was successfully deployed across six European countries to investigate guideline adherence in real-world practice and evaluate if a structured educational programme for healthcare professionals can improve patient-level care.

39003654,A Novel Approach to Mentorship in Pediatric Cardiology: A Group for Women.,"Gender disparities for female physicians in academic medicine are longstanding. Female pediatric cardiologists experience inequities in scholarship opportunities, promotion, leadership positions, and compensation. Mentorship groups have been successfully implemented in other subspecialities with promising results. We created a peer mentorship group for female pediatric cardiologists in the Northeast and completed a needs assessment survey of eligible participants. Our goal was to better understand the current challenges and identify resources to overcome these barriers. Our objectives were to (1) describe the creation of a novel mentorship program for female pediatric cardiologists and trainees in the Northeast United States, and (2) report the results of a formal needs assessment survey of all eligible participants. All female pediatric cardiology fellows and practicing pediatric and adult congenital heart disease specialists from 15 academic centers in New England were invited to join a free group with virtual meetings. A formal needs assessment survey was provided electronically to all eligible members. The vast majority of respondents agreed that the Women in Pediatric Cardiology (WIPC) group is a valuable networking and mentorship experience (90%) and would recommend this group to a colleague (95%). Members have witnessed or experienced inequities in a broad range of settings. Common challenges experienced by respondents include dependent care demands, lack of mentorship, inadequate research support, and inequitable clinical responsibilities. Resources suggested to overcome these barriers include mentorship, sponsorship, transparency in compensation, and physician coaching. Mentorship groups have the potential to address many challenges faced by women in medicine.

37625911,Proposed competencies for the performance of cardiovascular computed tomography in pediatric and adult congenital heart disease.,"Cardiovascular computed tomography (CCT) is rated appropriate by published guidelines for the initial evaluation and follow up of congenital heart disease (CHD) and is an essential modality in cardiac imaging programs for patients of all ages. However, no recommended core competencies exist to guide CCT in CHD imaging training pathways, curricula development, or establishment of a more formal educational platform. To fill this gap, a group of experienced congenital cardiac imagers, intentionally inclusive of adult and pediatric cardiologists and radiologists, was formed to propose core competencies fundamental to the expert-level performance of CCT in pediatric acquired and congenital heart disease and adult CHD. The 2020 SCCT Guideline for Training Cardiology and Radiology Trainees as Independent Practitioners (Level II) and Advanced Practitioners (Level III) in Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (1) for adult imaging were used as a framework to define pediatric and CHD-specific competencies. Established competencies will be immediately relevant for advanced cardiac imaging fellowships in both cardiology and radiology training pathways. Proposed future steps include radiology and cardiology society collaboration to establish provider certification levels, training case-volume recommendations, and continuing medical education (CME) requirements for expert-level performance of CCT in pediatric and adult CHD.",Journal of cardiovascular computed tomography,2023-,"Jepson BM, Rigsby CK, Hlavacek AM, Prakash A, Priya S, Barfuss S, Chelliah A, Binka E, Nicol E, Ghoshhajra B, Han BK",11,1430,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
33172590,Adolf Eugen Fick (1829-1901) - The Man Behind the Cardiac Output Equation.,"Adolf Fick was a German physiologist, born in Kassel in 1829, who studied medicine at the University of Marburg and graduated in 1851. He worked first in Zurich and then in Wurzburg. Most of his studies were based on physics and mathematics, and deep analysis, and only later were proven by experiments. Fick's name in physics is associated to the laws of diffusion of solutions, and in medicine to the principle of cardiac output calculation. In 1855, he proposed Fick's laws on gas diffusion. In 1870, he devised Fick's principle, which allows the measurement of cardiac output and calculations of intracardiac shunts from the arteriovenous oxygen difference. The method was later generalized to the Fick principle, according to which the flow of an indicator taken up or released by an organ corresponds to the difference between the indicator flows in the inflow and outflow tracts. Fick invented several devices most of them aimed to improve precision in his physiologic experiments. In 1868, he invented the plethysmograph, for recording the speed of blood in the human artery. In 1888, the tonometer for measuring from outside the hydrostatic pressure inside the eyeball. After 3 decades as Professor in Wurzburg, he retired.

The CICD-LT registry is investigating short- and long-term outcomes and management in patients in European Society of Cardiology (ESC) member countries, in a longitudinal ESC EURObservational Research Programme aimed at improving CCS management. Between 1 May 2015 and 31 July 2018, 9174 patients with previous ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI or coronary revascularisation, or other CCS, were recruited during a routine ambulatory visit or elective revascularisation procedure. Baseline clinical data were recorded and prescribed medications analysed at initial contact and discharge, and according to patient gender and age (<75 vs. ≥75 years). Poorly controlled cardiovascular risk factors, including current smoking (18.5%), obesity (33.9%), diabetes (25.8%), raised low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (73.3%) and persistent hypertension (24.7%), were common across all cohorts. At ambulatory visit or admission, the guidelines-recommended combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, beta-blocker, aspirin, statin and any antiplatelet agent was prescribed to 57.8% of patients with STEMI/NSTEMI. Differences in prescribing rates, including for combination therapies, were observed based on age and gender and persisted after adjustment for demographic factors. Cardiovascular risk factors were common in contemporary CCS patients and secondary prevention prescribing was suboptimal. Patients aged ≥75 years and, to some extent, female patients were less likely to receive guidelines-recommended drug combinations than younger and male patients.

39267595,Are paediatric cardiology textbooks obsolete in the current digital era?,"With the rise of online references, podcasts, webinars, self-test tools, and social media, it is worthwhile to understand whether textbooks continue to provide value in medical education, and to assess the capacity they serve during fellowship training. A prospective mixed-methods study based on surveys that were disseminated to seven paediatric cardiology fellowship programmes around the world. Participants were asked to read an assigned chapter of <i>Anderson's Pediatric Cardiology 4th Edition</i> textbook, followed by the completion of the survey. Open-ended questions included theming and grouping responses as appropriate. The survey was completed by 36 participants. When asked about the content, organisation, and utility of the chapter, responses were generally positive, at greater than 89%. The chapters, overall, were rated relatively easy to read, scoring at 6.91, with standard deviations plus or minus 1.72, on a scale from 1 to 10, with higher values meaning better results. When asked to rank their preferences in where they obtain educational content, textbooks were ranked the second highest, with in-person teaching ranking first. Several themes were identified including the limitations of the use of textbook use, their value, and ways to enhance learning from their reading. There was also a near-unanimous desire for more time to self-learn and read during fellowship. Textbooks are still highly valued by trainees. Many opportunities exist, nonetheless, to improve how they can be organised to deliver information optimally. Future efforts should look towards making them more accessible, and to include more resources for asynchronous learning.",Cardiology in the young,2024-Aug,"Kim ME, Tretter JT, Anderson RH, Spicer DE, Penny DJ, Kumar RK, McMahon CJ",7,1675,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Patients admitted for a first ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in the ePARIS registry (n=2757) between 2010 and 2018 were classified by age: <55, 55-65 and >65 years old. Using Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, we evaluated whether patients would have been detected and treated with primary prevention statins before their first STEMI based on the 2021 EAS/ESC guidelines versus 2019 and 2016 guidelines. Eligibility for intensive proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9i) in secondary prevention was also assessed. Following 2021 ESC guidelines, 62.5% of individuals aged <55 years old would have been eligible for statins before their first STEMI, similarly to older age categories. In comparison, only 17% and 18% of young individuals would have been eligible for primary prevention statins prior to their first STEMI with 2016 and 2019 guidelines, compared with group 55-65 years (41% and 35%) and >65 years old (19% and 72%), p<0.01. After their first STEMI, 25% of patients <55 years would be eligible for PCSK9i, compared with 23.2% and 15% in patients aged 55-65 years and >65 years. The 2021 ESC guidelines allowed a much better detection of young individuals before their first STEMI than prior ESC guidelines.

We assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fellow education and echocardiography volumes. Our institutional database was used to examine volumes of transthoracic (TTE), stress (SE), and transesophageal echocardiograms (TEE) from 7/1/2018 to 10/10/2020. Study volumes were compared in three intervals: pre-pandemic (7/1/2018- 3/14/2020), pandemic (3/15/2020-6/13/2020), and pandemic recovery (6/14/2020-10/10/2020). We examined weekly number of TTEs performed or interpreted by cardiology fellows during the study period, and compared these to the two previous academic years. Weekly TTE volume declined by 54% during the pandemic, and increased by 99% during pandemic recovery, (p < 0.05). SE and TEE revealed similar trends. A strong correlation between weekly TTE volume and inpatient admissions was observed during the study period (r<sub>s</sub>=0.67, p < 0.05). Weekly fellow TTE scans declined by 78% during the pandemic, with a 380% increase during pandemic recovery (p < 0.05). Weekly fellow TTE interpretations declined by 56% during the pandemic, with a 76% increase during pandemic recovery (p < 0.05). COVID restrictions between 3/15/2020- 6/14/2020 coincided with a marked decline in TTE, SE, and TEE volumes, with an increase similar to near pre-pandemic volumes during the pandemic recovery period. A similar decline with the onset of COVID restrictions, and increase to pre-restriction volumes thereafter was observed with fellow scans and interpretations, but total academic year fellow training volumes remained depressed. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and rise of multiple variants, training programs may need to adjust fellows' clinical responsibilities so as to support achievement of echocardiography training certification.",BMC medical education,2022-Dec,"Varghese MS, Strom JB, Kannam JP, Fostello SE, Riley MF, Manning WJ",6,1980,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Based on international epidemiological data, around 20,000-40,000 patients are expected to be affected in Austria. Due to the wide variety of clinical and morphological manifestations the diagnosis can be difficult and the disease therefore often goes unrecognized. HCM is associated with a substantial reduction in quality of life and can lead to sudden cardiac death, especially in younger patients. Early and correct diagnosis, including genetic testing, is essential for comprehensive counselling of patients and their families and for effective treatment. The latter is especially true as an effective treatment of outflow tract obstruction has recently become available in the form of a first in class cardiac myosin ATPase inhibitor, as a noninvasive alternative to established septal reduction therapies.

38733027,MEMS Technology in Cardiology: Advancements and Applications in Heart Failure Management Focusing on the CardioMEMS Device.,"Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. It is characterized by various structural and/or functional abnormalities of the heart, resulting in elevated intracardiac pressure and/or inadequate cardiac output at rest and/or during exercise. These dysfunctions can originate from a variety of conditions, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, cardiomyopathies, heart valve disorders, arrhythmias, and other lifestyle or systemic factors. Identifying the underlying cause is crucial for detecting reversible or treatable forms of HF. Recent epidemiological studies indicate that there has not been an increase in the incidence of the disease. Instead, patients seem to experience a chronic trajectory marked by frequent hospitalizations and stagnant mortality rates. Managing these patients requires a multidisciplinary approach that focuses on preventing disease progression, controlling symptoms, and preventing acute decompensations. In the outpatient setting, patient self-care plays a vital role in achieving these goals. This involves implementing necessary lifestyle changes and promptly recognizing symptoms/signs such as dyspnea, lower limb edema, or unexpected weight gain over a few days, to alert the healthcare team for evaluation of medication adjustments. Traditional methods of HF monitoring, such as symptom assessment and periodic clinic visits, may not capture subtle changes in hemodynamics. Sensor-based technologies offer a promising solution for remote monitoring of HF patients, enabling early detection of fluid overload and optimization of medical therapy. In this review, we provide an overview of the CardioMEMS device, a novel sensor-based system for pulmonary artery pressure monitoring in HF patients. We discuss the technical aspects, clinical evidence, and future directions of CardioMEMS in HF management.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2024-May,"Ciotola F, Pyxaras S, Rittger H, Buia V",4,1926,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

34954110,Multi-level process mining methodology for exploring disease-specific care processes.,"Public healthcare is a complex domain with many actors and highly variable protocols, which makes traditional process mining tools less effective and calls for specialized methods. The objective of the work was to develop a generally applicable process mining methodology to explore care processes related to diseases. The proposed methodology called Process Mining Methodology for Exploring Disease-specific Care Processes (MEDCP) is based on a systematic, step-wise refinement of the raw event logs by using such a multi-level expert taxonomy of events that encapsulates the professional concepts of the analysis. A treatment process is defined according to domain-specific rules to identify the starting (index) and closing events. Concepts from various levels of the taxonomy support the final process definition for an analysis that can deliver meaningful conclusions for domain experts. The applicability of the methodology was demonstrated on two case studies in the cardiological and oncological care domains, in the public health care system in Hungary over a period of ten years. Thanks to the multi-level taxonomy, these studies successfully identified the most important high-level event sequence patterns and some key anomalies in the national care system, such as the significantly different behavior of low-volume vs. high volume care providers in the oncology study or the geographically connected, homogeneous clusters of providers with similar care spectra in the cardiology study. As the case studies showed, the proposed methodology can improve the efficiency of standard process mining methods, and deliver high level conclusions that are easy to interpret by domain experts. System-level insight into health care processes can serve as a basis for the optimisation and long-term planning of the whole care system.",Journal of biomedical informatics,2022-Jan,"Vathy-Fogarassy Á, Vassányi I, Kósa I",3,1835,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

It is structured into 8 chapters, including (i) principles of cancer biology and therapy; (ii) forms and definitions of cancer therapy-related cardiovascular toxicity (CTR-CVT); (iii) risk stratification, prevention and monitoring protocols for CTR-CVT; (iv) diagnosis and management of CV disease in patients with cancer; (v) long-term survivorship programmes and cardio-oncology rehabilitation; (vi) multidisciplinary team management of special populations; (vii) organization of cardio-oncology services; (viii) research in cardio-oncology. The core curriculum aims at promoting standardization and harmonization of training and evaluation in cardio-oncology, while it further provides the ground for an ESC certification programme designed to recognize the competencies of certified specialists.",European journal of heart failure,2024-Apr,"López-Fernández T, Farmakis D, Ameri P, Asteggiano R, de Azambuja E, Aznar M, Barac A, Bayes-Genis A, Bax JJ, Bergler-Klein J, Boriani G, Celutkiene J, Coats A, Cohen-Solal A, Córdoba R, Cosyns B, Filippatos G, Fox K, Gulati G, Inciardi RM, Lee G, Mamas MA, Novo G, Plummer C, Psyrri A, Rakisheva A, Suter T, Tini G, Tocchetti CG, Toutouzas K, Wilhelm M, Metra M, Lyon AR, Rosano GMC",34,1439,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

This narrative review summarizes evidence suggesting that the recognition of pulmonary circulation is older than the time of Ibn Nafis. The theory of pulmonary circulation originated in ancient Persia (ad 224-637), was overshadowed by Greek theory from the 11th century, and reestablished by Ibn Nafis in the 13th century. The findings of this review may help contextualize the story of the discovery of pulmonary circulation in ancient Persian and Greek theories before Ibn Nafis.",JAMA cardiology,2022-Jan,Zargaran A,1,616,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
30681399,A Survey of Adult and Pediatric Cardiology Fellows on Training Received in Family Planning Counseling.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> This 2016 study aimed to investigate the training in contraception and preconception counseling received by cardiovascular science fellows. <b><i>Method:</i></b> The authors surveyed current adult and pediatric cardiology fellows in the United States. Questions assessed the availability of family planning counseling training within their training program, current practices of contraception and preconception counseling, and use of available tools for risk stratification of patients. Bivariate logistic regressions were utilized to predict demographic variables associated with survey responses, and associations between hours of training or perceived preparedness and clinical use of training. <b><i>Results:</i></b> There were 101 survey responses. Most participating fellows disagreed that their fellowship training had prepared them to counsel patients on contraception (69%) and preconception planning (62%). Sixty-one percent of participants do not routinely discuss contraception options and 55% do not routinely discuss preconception counseling with reproductive-age female patients at routine visits. Having more than 1 hour of training was predictive of more consistent counseling for both contraception and preconception counseling. Approximately 40% of participants routinely refer patients to an OB/Gyn for contraception or preconception counseling. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> This study highlights the need for increased training in contraceptive and preconception counseling within adult and pediatric cardiology fellowship programs.",Journal of women's health (2002),2020-Feb,"Brown AE, Bradbrook KE, Casey FE",3,1576,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
38866449,Geographic Mapping of Gender Disparities in Authorship of Cardiovascular Literature.,"Women in cardiology experience considerable gender disparities in publications, which hinders their career advancements to higher faculty and senior leadership positions. However, the extent of these disparities across different types of cardiovascular literature is not well understood. We investigated gender differences in authorship across various cardiovascular publications over a decade and examined geographic variations in the representation of women authors. All papers published from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019, in 4 major cardiovascular journals (Journal of the American College of Cardiology, European Heart Journal, Journal of the American Medical Association Cardiology, and Nature Reviews Cardiology) were reviewed. Of the 18,535 papers with 111,562 authors, 20.6% of the authors were women, and 47.7% of the papers had no women authors. Over 10 years, the proportion of women authors remained low (20.7% in 2010 to 21.4% in 2019), with the lowest proportion in editorial papers (14.8%) and the highest in research papers (21.8%). More women as first (34.6%) and last (47.6%) authors were affiliated with institutions in the United States compared with other countries. The proportion of women middle-order authors was higher on papers with women as first authors (29.4% vs 20.5%) or last authors (30.6% vs 21.3%), compared with papers with men as first or last authors, respectively. Over the past decade, the proportion of women authors across all article types in major cardiovascular journals remained low.

38427088,Delivering Serious News in Pediatric Cardiology-A Pilot Program.,"Pediatric cardiology fellows receive limited training on delivering serious news. This is a teachable skill through simulation-based communication. While studies have shown the use of communication courses in pediatrics, there have been none in pediatric cardiology. Pediatric cardiologists recognize the importance of good communication and desire further development of these skills. Based on an internal needs assessment, three cases were developed; fetal hypoplastic left heart syndrome, teenager with new hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and young-adult with Fontan failure. A 4-h simulation course using evidence-based methods to teach delivering serious news was designed, consisting of a didactic session, case demonstration and small group case-based encounters with simulated patients. Trainees completed standardized pre/post-course surveys to assess perception of skill and preparedness. Paired survey responses were compared. Six pediatric cardiology fellows participated. Only 33% had received formal training in delivering serious news and 17% in techniques of responding to patient's emotions. The proportion of participants who felt good about their ability to deliver serious news and deal with a family's emotions increased from 0 to 83%. The proportion of participants who felt prepared to provide serious news about a patient's illness increased from 17 to 67%. Given the small number of participants, results were not statistically significant. All participants felt that the course was valuable in improving communication skills. A formal communication course increased perception of skill and preparedness among trainees. We provide an evidence-based framework and clinical cases for delivering serious news in pediatric cardiology, which is generalizable to other training programs.",Pediatric cardiology,2025-Feb,"Das N, Brown A, Harris TH",3,1803,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

To ensure that simulators provide a realistic surrogate to real procedures they must undergo scientific validation. We aimed to evaluate the 3D-printed simulator SimulHeart® for face and content validity to demonstrate its value as a training tool in interventional cardiology (IC). Health professionals were recruited from sixteen Portuguese IC units. All participants received a 30-minute theoretical introduction, 10-minute demonstration of each task and then performed the intervention on a 3D-printed simulator (SimulHeart®). Finally, a post-training questionnaire focusing on the appearance of the simulation, simulation content, and satisfaction/self-efficacy was administered. We included 56 participants: 16 ""experts"" (general and interventional cardiologists), 26 ""novices"" (cardiology residents), and 14 nurses and allied professionals. On a five-point Likert scale, the overall mean score of face validity was 4.38±0.35 and the overall mean score of content validity was 4.69±0.32. There was no statistically significant difference in the scores provided by ""experts"" and ""novices"". Participants reported a high level of satisfaction/self-efficacy with 60.7% considering it strongly improved their skills. The majority (82.1%) ""agreed"" or ""strongly agreed"" that after the simulation they felt confident to perform the procedure on a patient. The 3D-printed simulator (SimulHeart®) showed excellent face and content validity. 3D simulation may play an important role in future IC training programs.

38837338,The impact of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines and whole exome sequencing on genetic testing in hereditary cardiac diseases.,"In the last decade, an incredible improvement has been made in elucidating the genetic bases of cardiomyopathies. Here we report the impact of either the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines or the use of whole exome sequencing (WES) in terms of a number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) and missed diagnoses in a series of 260 patients affected by inherited cardiac disorders. Samples were analyzed using a targeted gene panel of 128 cardiac-related genes and/or WES in a subset of patients, with a three-tier approach. Analyzing (i) only a subset of genes related to the clinical presentation, strictly following the ESC guidelines, 20.77% positive test were assessed. The incremental diagnostic rate for (ii) the whole gene panel, and (iii) the WES was 4.71% and 11.67%, respectively. The diverse analytical approaches increased the number of VUSs and incidental findings. Indeed, the use of WES highlights that there is a small percentage of syndromic conditions that standard analysis would not have detected. Moreover, the use of targeted sequencing coupled with ""narrow"" analytical approach prevents the detection of variants in actionable genes that could allow for preventive treatment. Our data suggest that genetic testing might aid clinicians in the diagnosis of inheritable cardiac disorders.",Clinical genetics,2024-Oct,"Mio C, Zucco J, Fabbro D, Bregant E, Baldan F, Allegri L, D'Elia AV, Collini V, Imazio M, Damante G, Faletra F",11,1327,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

33755872,Applications of cosinor rhythmometry in pharmacology.,"Study design and data analysis are two important aspects relevant to chronopharmacometrics. Blunders can be avoided by recognizing that most physiological variables are circadian periodic. Both ill health and treatment can affect the amplitude, phase, and/or period of circadian (and other) rhythms, in addition to their mean. The involvement of clock genes in molecular pathways related to important physiological systems underlies the bidirectional relationship often seen between circadian rhythm disruption and disease risk. Circadian rhythm characteristics of marker rhythms interpreted in the light of chronobiologic reference values represent important diagnostic tools. A set of cosinor-related programs is presented. They include the least squares fit of multiple-frequency cosine functions to model the time structure of individual records; a cosinor-based spectral analysis to detect periodic signals; the population-mean cosinor to generalize inferences; the chronobiologic serial section to follow the time course of changing rhythm parameters over time; and parameter tests to assess differences among populations. Relative merits of other available cosinor and non-parametric algorithms are reviewed. Parameter tests to compare individual records and a self-starting cumulative sum (CUSUM) make personalized chronotherapy possible, where the treatment of each patient relies on an N-of-1 design. Methods are illustrated in a few examples relevant to endocrinology, cancer and cardiology. New sensing technology yielding large personal data sets is likely to change the healthcare system. Chronobiologic concepts and methods should become an integral part of these evolving systems.",Journal of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,2021-Jun,Cornelissen G,1,1696,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

To provide comprehensive contemporary information on the access and use of cardiac arrhythmia services in Africa. Data on human resources, drug availability, cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED), and ablation procedures were sought from member countries of Pan African Society of Cardiology. Data were received from 23 out of 31 countries. In most countries, healthcare services are primarily supported by household incomes. Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), digoxin, and amiodarone were available in all countries, while the availability of other drugs varied widely. Non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were unequally present in the African markets, while International Normalized Ratio monitoring was challenging. Four countries (18%) did not provide pacemaker implantations while, where available, the implantation and operator rates were 2.79 and 0.772 per million population, respectively. The countries with the highest pacemaker implantation rate/million population in descending order were Tunisia, Mauritius, South Africa, Algeria, and Morocco. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) were performed in 15 (65%) and 12 (52%) countries, respectively. Reconditioned CIED were used in 5 (22%) countries. Electrophysiology was performed in 8 (35%) countries, but complex ablations only in countries from the Maghreb and South Africa. Marked variation in costs of CIED that severely mismatched the gross domestic product per capita was observed in Africa. From the first report, three countries have started performing simple ablations. The access to arrhythmia treatments varied widely in Africa where hundreds of millions of people remain at risk of dying from heart block.

32447058,Identifying Guideline-Practice Gaps to Optimize Evaluation and Management for Patients With Syncope.,"Syncope is a common and complex symptom that requires efficient evaluation to determine the cause. Recent guidelines focus on high-value testing, but a systematic evaluation of their implementation has not been performed. To this end, we used a mixed-methods approach of surveys, chart reviews, and focus groups to understand current practices relating to the diagnosis and management of patients with syncope and to identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation of guideline-supported recommendations. Surveys were distributed to 1500 providers in the specialties of hospital medicine, cardiology, emergency medicine, and family medicine, and 175 responses were received. Knowledge of class I and III guideline recommendations were assessed with the use of clinical vignettes, which were answered correctly 60%-80% of the time. Chart reviews focused on patient history and testing for syncope. Per the guidelines, < 50% of charts met criteria for bare minimum history and physical examination. Based on the documentation, 25% of echocardiograms and 90% of neurologic testing obtained would not have been appropriate per the guidelines. Self-reported and actual practice patterns were similar in rates of testing. Our results indicate that there remains a gap between guideline-directed management and actual practice for syncope. Focus groups revealed barriers across multiple levels of care that need to be addressed to improve care.

39313866,Conflicts of interest in clinical practice: lessons learned from cardiovascular medicine.,"Cardiovascular diseases represent a major burden worldwide, and clinical trials are critical to define treatment improvements. Since various conflicts of interest (COIs) may influence trials at multiple levels, cardiovascular research represents a paradigmatic example to analyze their effects and manage them effectively to re-establish the centrality of evidence-based medicine.Despite the manifest role of industry, COIs may differently affect both sponsored and non-sponsored studies in many ways. COIs influence may start from the research question, data collection and adjudication, up to result reporting, including the spin phenomenon. Outcomes and endpoints (especially composite) choice and definitions also represent potential sources for COIs interference. Since large randomized controlled trials significantly influence international guidelines, thus impacting also clinical practice, their critical assessment for COIs is mandatory. Despite specific protocols aimed to mitigate COI influence, even scientific societies and guideline panels may not be totally free from COIs, negatively affecting their accountability and trustworthiness.Shared rules, awareness of COI mechanisms and transparency with external data access may help promoting evidence-based research and mitigate COIs impact.

32838627,Perceptions on Diversity in Cardiology: A Survey of Cardiology Fellowship Training Program Directors.,"Background The lack of diversity in the cardiovascular physician workforce is thought to be an important driver of racial and sex disparities in cardiac care. Cardiology fellowship program directors play a critical role in shaping the cardiology workforce. Methods and Results To assess program directors' perceptions about diversity and barriers to enhancing diversity, the authors conducted a survey of 513 fellowship program directors or associate directors from 193 unique adult cardiology fellowship training programs. The response rate was 21% of all individuals (110/513) representing 57% of US general adult cardiology training programs (110/193). While 69% of respondents endorsed the belief that diversity is a driver of excellence in health care, only 26% could quote 1 to 2 references to support this statement. Sixty-three percent of respondents agreed that ""our program is diverse already so diversity does not need to be increased."" Only 6% of respondents listed diversity as a top 3 priority when creating the cardiovascular fellowship rank list. Conclusions These findings suggest that while program directors generally believe that diversity enhances quality, they are less familiar with the literature that supports that contention and they may not share a unified definition of ""diversity."" This may result in diversity enhancement having a low priority. The authors propose several strategies to engage fellowship training program directors in efforts to diversify cardiology fellowship training programs.",Journal of the American Heart Association,2020-Sep,"Crowley AL, Damp J, Sulistio MS, Berlacher K, Polk DM, Hong RA, Weissman G, Jackson D, Sivaram CA, Arrighi JA, Kates AM, Duvernoy CS, Lewis SJ, Capers Q",14,1526,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Pediatric preventive cardiology programs have independently developed and proliferated to address cardiovascular risk factors in youth, but there is a general lack of clarity on best practices to optimize and sustain desired outcomes. We conducted surveys of pediatric cardiology division directors and pediatric preventive cardiology clinicians across the United States and Canada to describe the current landscape and perspectives on future directions for the field. We summarize the data and conclude with a call to action for various audiences who seek to improve cardiovascular health in youth, reduce the burden of premature cardiovascular disease, and increase healthy longevity. We call on heart centers, hospitals, payers, and policymakers to invest resources in the important work of pediatric preventive cardiology programs. We urge professional societies to advocate for pediatric preventive cardiology and provide opportunities for training and cross-pollination across programs.

Traditional approaches to understanding and treating metabolic dysfunction-associated disorders have been organ-centered, leading to silo-type disease care. However, given the broad impact that systemic metabolic dysfunction has on the human body, approaches that simultaneously involve multiple medical specialists need to be developed and encouraged to optimize patient outcomes.

Part 2: results of the VERIDIC project.,"Optimizing patient exposure in interventional cardiology is key to avoid skin injuries. To establish predictive models of peak skin dose (PSD) during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention (CTO), and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedures. A total of 534 PCI, 219 CTO, and 209 TAVI were collected from 12 hospitals in eight European countries. Independent associations between PSD and clinical and technical dose determinants were examined for those procedures using multivariate statistical analysis. A priori and a posteriori predictive models were built using stepwise multiple linear regressions. A fourfold cross-validation was performed, and models' performance was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), coefficient of determination (R²), and linear correlation coefficient (r). Multivariate analysis proved technical parameters to overweight clinical complexity indices with PSD mainly affected by fluoroscopy time, tube voltage, tube current, distance to detector, and tube angulation for PCI. For CTO, these were body mass index, tube voltage, and fluoroscopy contribution. For TAVI, these parameters were sex, fluoroscopy time, tube voltage, and cine acquisitions. When benchmarking the predictive models, the correlation coefficients were r = 0.45 for the a priori model and r = 0.89 for the a posteriori model for PCI. These were 0.44 and 0.67, respectively, for the CTO a priori and a posteriori models, and 0.58 and 0.74, respectively, for the TAVI a priori and a posteriori models. A priori predictive models can help operators estimate the PSD before performing the intervention while a posteriori models are more accurate estimates and can be useful in the absence of skin dose mapping solutions.","Acta radiologica (Stockholm, Sweden : 1987)",2023-Jan,"Feghali JA, Delépierre J, Belac OC, Dabin J, Deleu M, De Monte F, Dobric M, Gallagher A, Hadid-Beurrier L, Henry P, Hršak H, Kiernan T, Kumar R, Knežević Ž, Maccia C, Majer M, Malchair F, Noble S, Obrad D, Merce MS, Sideris G, Simantirakis G, Spaulding C, Tarantini G, Van Ngoc Ty C",25,1846,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Despite the array of therapeutic avenues in clinical practice, predominantly pharmaceutical and surgical interventions, they often fall short of fully addressing the clinical exigencies of cardiovascular patients. In recent years, nanocarriers have shown great potential in the treatment and diagnose of cardiovascular diseases. They can enhance drug targeting and bioavailability while reducing side effects. Additionally, by improving imaging and detection technologies, they enhance early diagnosis and disease monitoring capabilities. These advancements in technology offer new solutions for precision medicine in cardiovascular diseases, advancing treatment efficacy and disease management. Crafted from biomaterials, metals, or their amalgamations, these nanocarriers approximate the dimensions of biologically active molecules like proteins and DNA. Cardiovascular nanomedicine, in its infancy, has only recently burgeoned. Yet, with continual refinement in nanocarrier architecture, drug delivery mechanisms, and therapeutic outcomes, the potential of nanomedical technologies in clinical contexts becomes increasingly evident.

34924098,Assessment of physician training and prediction of workforce needs in paediatric cardiac intensive care in the United States.,"To assess the training and the future workforce needs of paediatric cardiac critical care faculty. REDCap surveys were sent May-August 2019 to medical directors and faculty at the 120 US centres participating in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database. Faculty and directors were asked about personal training pathway and planned employment changes. Directors were additionally asked for current faculty numbers, expected job openings, presence of training programmes, and numbers of trainees. Predictive modelling of the workforce was performed using respondents' data. Patient volume was projected from US Census data and compared to projected provider availability. Sixty-six per cent (79/120) of directors and 62% (294/477) of contacted faculty responded. Most respondents had training that incorporated critical care medicine with the majority completing training beyond categorical fellowship. Younger respondents and those in dedicated cardiac ICUs were more significantly likely to have advanced training or dual fellowships in cardiology and critical care medicine. An estimated 49-63 faculty enter the workforce annually from various training pathways. Based on modelling, these faculty will likely fill current and projected open positions over the next 5 years. Paediatric cardiac critical care training has evolved, such that the majority of faculty now have dual fellowship or advanced training. The projected number of incoming faculty will likely fill open positions within the next 5 years.

35940166,Setting up regional diagnostic reference levels for pediatric interventional cardiology in Latin America and the Caribbean countries: preliminary results and identified challenges.,"The goal of the present study was to propose a set of preliminary regional diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for pediatric interventional cardiology (IC) procedures in Latin America and the Caribbean countries, classified by age and weight groups. The study was conducted in the framework of the Optimization of Protection in Pediatric Interventional Radiology in Latin America and the Caribbean program coordinated by the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The first step of the program was focused on pediatric IC. Dose data from diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were collected between December 2020 and December 2021. Regional DRLs were set as the third quartile of patient dose data (kerma area product) collected in 18 hospitals from 10 countries in an initial sample of 968 procedures. DRLs were set for four age bands and five weight ranges. The values obtained for the four age bands (<1 yr, 1 to <5 yr, 5 to <10 yr and 10 to <16 yr) were 2.9, 6.1, 8.8 and 14.4 Gy cm<sup>2</sup>for diagnostic procedures, and 4.0, 5.0, 10.0 and 38.1 Gy cm<sup>2</sup>for therapeutic procedures, respectively. The values obtained for the five weight bands (<5 kg, 5 to <15 kg, 15 to <30 kg, 30 to <50 kg and 50 to <80 kg) were 3.0, 4.5, 8.1, 9.2 and 26.8 Gy cm<sup>2</sup>for diagnostic procedures and 3.7, 4,3, 7.3, 16.1 and 53.4 Gy cm<sup>2</sup>for therapeutic procedures, respectively. While initial data were collected manually as patient dose management systems (DMSs) were not available in most of the hospitals involved in the program, a centralized automatic DMS for the collection and management of patient dose indicators has now been introduced and is envisaged to increase the sample size.

34338183,2021 PACES expert consensus statement on the indications and management of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices in pediatric patients.,"In view of the increasing complexity of both cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) and patients in the current era, practice guidelines, by necessity, have become increasingly specific. This document is an expert consensus statement that has been developed to update and further delineate indications and management of CIEDs in pediatric patients, defined as ≤21 years of age, and is intended to focus primarily on the indications for CIEDs in the setting of specific disease categories. The document also highlights variations between previously published adult and pediatric CIED recommendations and provides rationale for underlying important differences. The document addresses some of the deterrents to CIED access in low- and middle-income countries and strategies to circumvent them. The document sections were divided up and drafted by the writing committee members according to their expertise. The recommendations represent the consensus opinion of the entire writing committee, graded by class of recommendation and level of evidence. Several questions addressed in this document either do not lend themselves to clinical trials or are rare disease entities, and in these instances recommendations are based on consensus expert opinion. Furthermore, specific recommendations, even when supported by substantial data, do not replace the need for clinical judgment and patient-specific decision-making. The recommendations were opened for public comment to Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES) members and underwent external review by the scientific and clinical document committee of the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), the science advisory and coordinating committee of the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and the Association for European Paediatric and Congenital Cardiology (AEPC). The document received endorsement by all the collaborators and the Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS), the Indian Heart Rhythm Society (IHRS), and the Latin American Heart Rhythm Society (LAHRS).

31865443,Fears and Stressors of Trainees Starting Fellowship in Pediatric Cardiology.,"Post-graduate training for physicians involves a high level of stress. High stress during training has the potential to cause burnout, a well-studied phenomenon in medical trainees. Burnout has previously been shown to increase the risk of mental health problems and medical error in trainees. Little research has been done on the impact of stress on new fellows in general and pediatric cardiology fellows in particular; understanding common sources of stress offers the opportunity to design targeted interventions to support trainee wellness. New trainees in Boston Children's Hospital's Pediatric Cardiology Fellowship program were asked to answer to the following question at the beginning of their training: ""What are you afraid of in the coming year?"" A qualitative content analysis was done on their anonymous responses. Responses were coded and analyzed for common themes. The overall analysis found that 83% of fellows reported fear of ""fellowship/career responsibilities."" The second most common theme was ""failure/disappointment"" (78%) followed by ""personal life"" (74%), ""emotional exhaustion"" (61%); least common was ""new hospital environment"" (37%). The most common individual fear was ""increased clinical responsibility"" reported by 65% of the new fellows, while 62% reported fears of ""imposter syndrome,"" and 58% about ""burnout."" We found that fellows commonly report fears about both clinical and personal responsibilities, similar to stressors found in studies on residency. It is important for pediatric cardiology fellowships to develop early and specific interventions designed to assist fellows in managing both their new clinical responsibilities and their other stressors.",Pediatric cardiology,2020-Apr,"Brown DW, Binney G, Gauthier Z, Blume ED",4,1696,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
39287714,The Role of Nursing in the Delivery of Cardio-Oncology.,"Nurses are the ""heart of patient care"" and in the forefront of the health care delivery for cardio-oncology patients. Nurses play a critical central role in maximizing longitudinal health of cancer patients and survivors through the prevention of cardiovascular complications throughout the patient's cancer care journey. Nurses function in a variety of roles such as nurse clinicians, advanced practice nurses (APNs)or nurse practitioners (NPs), patient educators, managers, nurse navigators or nurse researchers. The role of nurses, particularly the advanced practice nurses as key members in delivering cardio-oncology care is evolving. However, despite the rapidly increasing growth of cardio oncology programs globally, a pivotal need remains to develop and provide formalized training programs for nurses, NPs and APNs. At present, no formal academic cardio-oncology nurse training program or certification exists. There is clearly more work to be done on the role of nurses in cardio-oncology care. As cardio-oncology evolves to become a key specialty with dedicated services being established across the globe, the role of the nurse in delivering this service is critical and a concerted collaborative approach between the two distinct specialties of cardiology and oncology needs to ensure the nursing workforce is educationally prepared and confident to treat and manage cardio-oncology patients.",Current treatment options in oncology,2024-Oct,"Fadol A, Nodzon L, Lee G",3,1406,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
34015465,Improving Online ECG Interpretation Through Self-Generation of Diagnoses During Practice: A Randomized Study.,"Although electrocardiography (ECG) is a fundamental skill for most physicians, trainees have poor diagnostic performance when interpreting ECGs. In this study, we examine a strategy to improve learning ECG interpretation: self-generation of diagnoses during online practice. We randomly assigned medical students and residents to one of 2 ECG interpretation training formats: multiple-choice (MCQ) or self-generation (SG) format, where participants free-text type their diagnosis aided by an autocomplete feature. The training phase consisted of 30 ECGs, after which participants completed an immediate post test and delayed post test (3-4 weeks later). Forty-eight participants completed the training module, 45 completed the immediate post test, and 27 completed the delayed post test. Participants assigned to the SG format scored higher on the immediate post test compared with those who practiced with the MCQ format, with a large effect size (78% vs 57%; d = 0.94; P = 0.02). There was a trend favouring SG on the delayed post test, with a moderate effect size (67% vs 56%; d = 0.65; P = 0.09). However, only 60% of participants completed the delayed post test, which hindered the detection of a statistically significant difference. The SG group made the correct primary diagnosis at a faster rate (32 vs 56 seconds; P < 0.001) but had a lower detection of secondary diagnoses (22 vs 42%; P = 0.007). Practicing ECG interpretation using self-generation of diagnoses improved immediate post test performance and fluency.

The technology enables personalized simulations of clinical scenarios, prediction of disease risk, and strategies for clinical trial augmentation. Current applications of cardiovascular digital twins have integrated multi-modal data into mechanistic and statistical models to build physiologically accurate cardiac replicas to enhance disease phenotyping, enrich diagnostic workflows, and optimize procedural planning. Digital twin technology is rapidly evolving in the setting of newly available data modalities and advances in generative artificial intelligence, enabling dynamic and comprehensive simulations unique to an individual. These twins fuse physiologic, environmental, and healthcare data into machine learning and generative models to build real-time patient predictions that can model interactions with the clinical environment to accelerate personalized patient care. This review summarizes digital twins in cardiovascular medicine and their potential future applications by incorporating new personalized data modalities. It examines the technical advances in deep learning and generative artificial intelligence that broaden the scope and predictive power of digital twins. Finally, it highlights the individual and societal challenges as well as ethical considerations that are essential to realizing the future vision of incorporating cardiology digital twins into personalized cardiovascular care.",European heart journal,2024-Dec,"Thangaraj PM, Benson SH, Oikonomou EK, Asselbergs FW, Khera R",5,1591,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
33179179,Online Learning and Echocardiography Boot Camp: Innovative Learning Platforms Promoting Blended Learning and Competency in Pediatric Echocardiography.,"Mastering pediatric echocardiography (PE) requires a substantial knowledge base of echo theory and congenital heart disease (CHD), along with technical proficiency. Online self-directed learning has become increasingly utilized among medical trainees to promote competency within medical subspecialties. We sought to evaluate the impact of online learning combined with lecture-based and hands-on teaching on the acquisition of PE knowledge and confidence in pediatric cardiology and pediatric critical care fellows. We prospectively enrolled 124 learners from 2016 to 2019. These included 40 incoming cardiology and critical care fellows at Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) as well as 84 national and international participants recruited from our online echo education website. All participants completed online learning modules through our website ( www.pedecho.org ), which covers pediatric echo physics, Doppler, technique, normal anatomy, atrial septal defects, and ventricular septal defects. TCH cardiology and critical care fellows subsequently participated in an Echo Boot Camp (BC), a 3-day training program with hands-on workshops and didactic lectures. Knowledge was assessed using an 80-question pre and post-test multiple choice exams. The online learning group demonstrated improvement in exam scores following online learning (PRE 49.1 ± 15.3 vs. POST 67.8 ± 17%; p ≤ 0.01). Echo Boot Camp fellows were noted to have further incremental improvement in test scores following BC (PRE 48% ± 13% vs. POST MODULE 68.6% ± 15% vs. POST BC 75.7% ± 13%; p ≤ 0.01). Self-assessment regarding confidence in context areas showed a substantial gain in self perceived interpretive confidence across all groups as well as procedural confidence in BC participants. Online learning significantly promotes the acquisition of echocardiography knowledge. Additional lecture-based and hands-on teaching in the form of an Echo Boot Camp can further enhance knowledge and interpretative skills.

36974343,Handheld ultrasound in cardiology: Current perspective.,"The advantages of ultrasonography do not need to be discussed. It is suitable for use in diverse clinical settings and environments by operators with different backgrounds. Recent technological advances have led not only to the enhancement of the diagnostic capabilities of stationary ultrasound systems but also to miniaturization, which in turn led to the introduction of smartphone-sized handheld ultrasound devices (HUDs), designed to be used at bedside to improve and extend the scope of physical examination. Although diagnostic capabilities of HUDs are expanding, according to guidelines, they cannot be perceived as a tool suitable for performing full echocardiographic examination. However, their ultraportability made them essential for the bedside assessment, with the particular emphasis on the bedside focus cardiac ultrasound (FoCUS)-goal-oriented, limited echocardiographic screening. Clinically relevant cardiological targets suggested for HUDs include the assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function and size, assessment of other cardiac chambers, identification of gross valvular abnormalities, and detection of the pathological masses within the heart cavities. Handheld ultrasound devices may be also helpful in identifying pleural effusion or subpleural consolidations; furthermore, brief ultrasonographic assessment of ""lung comets"" enables the estimation of the level of congestion. Ultrasound screening for certain vascular abnormalities also appears promising. The limitations of HUDs are rather obvious and caution is needed to distinguish the role of HUD-based bedside-limited scan from comprehensive stationary echocardiography. It appears that the right approach is to treat them as complementary tools proving their capabilities in diverse clinical scenarios.",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,2023-Mar,"Filipiak-Strzecka D, Lipiec P, Kasprzak JD",3,1799,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

30903598,Factors associated with refusal or acceptance of older patients (≥ 65 years) to provide consent to participate in clinical research in cardiology: a qualitative study.,"Clinical research is an essential step in the successful translation of knowledge from basic research into concrete clinical applications, yet many people are reluctant to provide consent when actually approached to actively participate in clinical trials. We investigated the factors that influence older patient's (≥ 65 years) decisions to accept or refuse to participate in a prospective randomized clinical trial in secondary prevention after acute coronary syndrome. Qualitative approach based on individual semi-structured interviews with patients who were approached for consent to participate in a currently ongoing clinical trial was adopted. Patients were interviewed after the consent process (8 accepted; 8 refused the trial). Interviews were analysed using grounded theory methodology. Sixteen patients aged ≥ 65 years participated. The main concept to emerge from these interviews is that the actual trial itself does not appear to be the primary determinant in the decision to participate in clinical research. Rather, patients' decisions to participate (or not) in clinical research appear to be primarily determined by their capacity to deal with the current health event that has disrupted their life, and by their available mental and physical resources. Older patients display varying levels of engagement in their own health, ranging from low engagement with high trust in the medical profession, to high engagement mirrored by distrust of the medical profession. Structural conditions, such as personal benefit from trial participation, or logistic barriers to participation, seem to affect both accepters and refusers in the same manner.",Aging clinical and experimental research,2020-Jan,"Ecarnot F, Meunier-Beillard N, Quenot JP, Meneveau N",4,1660,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Traditional social media has been used extensively by cardiologists for several years and now extends to the entire care team including trainees, advanced practitioners, nurses and technologists. Numerous challenges include concerns about patient privacy and security, lack of peer-review and organization, and chances of propagating misinformation. More recently, newer networking platforms have emerged within cardiology to overcome several of the limitations of traditional social media. Additionally, mobile applications have emerged as an educational tool that provides clinicians with easy access to the latest information including guidelines, consensus documents, risk estimators and treatment algorithms. These point-of-care learning and decision-making tools are especially relevant and impactful in a procedural field like interventional cardiology. While professional societies are major drivers of these emerging platforms, there are also other stakeholders including educational institutions and the medical device industry. In this review article, we examine the role of traditional social media and describe newer networking platforms as well as mobile applications applicable to interventional cardiology with a discussion about their relative advantages and disadvantages.",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,2024-Dec,"Bharadwaj AS, Cader FA, Goldsweig AM, Kini A, Sharma S, Gluckman TJ, O'Leary J, Cohen D, Cigarroa JE, Alasnag M",10,1568,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Despite this, dissemination into widespread routine clinical practice has been slow, largely restricted to large academic centers and urban settings. The reasons of this are multifactorial, but one of the most impactful of these reasons is undeniably reimbursement. Currently, there is marked discrepancy between the costs of performing cardiac CT and the renumeration provided for this. Until this is addressed, cardiac CT will not reach its potential for the benefit of patients. It is for this reason that the SCCT continues to dedicate significant efforts to represent the need of the cardiology and radiology communities in bringing about changes in policy and billing. Significant momentum has been gained in recent years with the engagement of both congress and Medicare in moving towards a system of payment that recognizes the time and expertise required to acquire high quality cardiac CT.

32405641,EAPCI Position Statement on Invasive Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to healthcare worldwide. The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment. The transmission of the disease poses a risk to both patients and healthcare workers. The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions. This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe. Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge. Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described. In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries.

To identify which clinical and technical parameters affect patient exposure and peak skin dose (PSD) and to establish dose reference levels (DRL) per clinical complexity level in IC procedures. Validation and Estimation of Radiation skin Dose in Interventional Cardiology (VERIDIC) project analyzed prospectively collected patient data from eight European countries and 12 hospitals where percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), chronic total occlusion PCI (CTO), and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedures were performed. A total of 62 clinical complexity parameters and 31 technical parameters were collected, univariate regressions were performed to identify those parameters affecting patient exposure and define DRL accordingly. Patient exposure as well as clinical and technical parameters were collected for a total of 534 PCI, 219 CTO, and 209 TAVI. For PCI procedures, body mass index (BMI), number of stents ≥2, and total stent length >28 mm were the most prominent clinical parameters, which increased the PSD value. For CTO, these were total stent length >57 mm, BMI, and previous anterograde or retrograde technique that failed in the same session. For TAVI, these were male sex, BMI, and number of diseased vessels. DRL values for Kerma-area product (<i>P</i><sub>KA</sub>), air kerma at patient entrance reference point (<i>K<sub>a,r</sub></i>), fluoroscopy time (FT), and PSD were stratified, respectively, for 14 clinical parameters in PCI, 10 in CTO, and four in TAVI.

38506540,"Interventional Imaging Systems in Radiology, Cardiology, and Urology: Energy Consumption, Carbon Emissions, and Electricity Costs.","<b>BACKGROUND.</b> The energy demand of interventional imaging systems has historically been estimated using manufacturer-provided specifications rather than directly measured. <b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to investigate the energy consumption of interventional imaging systems and estimate potential savings in the carbon emissions and electricity costs of such systems through hypothetical operational adjustments. <b>METHODS.</b> An interventional radiology suite, neurointerventional suite, radiology fluoroscopy unit, two cardiology laboratories, and two urology fluoroscopy units were equipped with power sensors. Power measurement logs were extracted for a single 4-week period for each radiology and cardiology system (all between June 1, 2022, and November 28, 2022) and for the 2-week period from July 31, 2023, to August 13, 2023, for each urology system. Power statuses, procedure time stamps, and fluoroscopy times were extracted from various sources. System activity was divided into off, idle (no patient in room), active (patient in room for procedure), and net-imaging (active fluoroscopic image acquisition) states. Projected annual energy consumption was calculated. Potential annual savings in carbon emissions and electricity costs through hypothetical operational adjustments were estimated using published values for Switzerland. <b>RESULTS.</b> Across the seven systems, the mean power draw was 0.3-1.1, 0.7-7.4, 0.9-7.6, and 1.9-12.5 kW in the off, idle, active, and net-imaging states, respectively. Across systems, the off state, in comparison with the idle state, showed a decrease in the mean power draw of 0.2-6.9 kW (relative decrease, 22.2-93.2%). The systems had a combined projected annual energy consumption of 115,684 kWh (range, 3646-26,576 kWh per system). The systems' combined projected energy consumption occurring outside the net-imaging state accounted for 93.3% (107,978/115,684 kWh) of projected total energy consumption (range, 89.2-99.4% per system). A hypothetical operational adjustment whereby all systems would be switched from the idle state to the off state overnight and on weekends (versus being operated in idle mode 24 hours a day, 7 days a week) would yield the following potential annual savings: for energy consumption, 144,640 kWh; for carbon emissions, 18.6 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent; and for electricity costs, US$37,896. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Interventional imaging systems are energy intensive, having high consumption outside of image acquisition periods. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT.</b> Strategic operational adjustments (e.g., powering down idle systems) can substantially decrease the carbon emissions and electricity costs of interventional imaging systems.",AJR.

34864692,The impact of neonatologist performed echocardiography in an Italian neonatal unit.,"The main goal of neonatologist performed echocardiography is to timely assess hemodynamic changes in order to properly manage unsteady neonates. Detailed structural heart assessment remains the domain of pediatric cardiologists. Nonetheless, many neonatologists take on an additional role in diagnosis of congenital heart defects, mostly compelled by the lack of in-house pediatric cardiology services. The experience of neonatologist performed echocardiography in an Italian neonatal unit was reported and the risk benefit profile of this practice was discussed. We retrospectively reviewed the echocardiograms undertaken by the neonatologist on infants admitted to the neonatal unit and postnatal ward of the Hospital San Pio in Benevento, over a 2-year period. Details of scans and concordance between neonatologist and cardiologist were analyzed. A total of 160 echocardiographic studies were done by the neonatologist on 136 infants. The ECG was requested in a minority of infants. The most common reason for performing the echocardiogram was admission to the neonatal care unit. Around half of the echocardiograms were normal. The remaining scans resulted in functional and structural abnormalities, transitional changes, and doubtful findings. Cardiac anomalies were significantly more likely found in cases of echocardiograms performed for fetal indications. Only 28 patients were eventually referred to the cardiology services. The inter-rater agreement was satisfactory. The hemodynamic assessment of sick infants, as well as triaging and referral of neonates with structural heart diseases are valuable advantages of the echocardiography run by neonatologists.Collaboration with pediatric cardiologists and robust training and accreditation programs are essential to ensure safety and quality service.",Journal of neonatal-perinatal medicine,2022-,"Casani A, Tozzi N, Cocca F",3,1812,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
32247298,Impact of trainee involvement on patient radiation exposure and contrast volumes during invasive cardiac procedures.,"The impact of cardiology fellows (CFs) and interventional cardiology fellows (ICFs) on patient radiation and contrast exposure during diagnostic coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention is unknown. Between 2011 and 2014, 16,175 cases were retrospectively assessed involving 27 CFs, 22 ICFs and 24 staff as primary operators. During diagnostic coronary angiography, ICFs administered the lowest radiation dose (5,648±5,523 cGy*cm2; 1.30 ± 1.27 mSv)-achieving 22% less radiation than the staff (6,889±4,294 cGy*cm2; 1.58 ± 0.99 mSv) and 36% less than CFs (7,700±6,751 cGy*cm2; 1.77 ± 1.55 mSv) (p<0.01). When adjusted for access site, CFs administered more radiation than either the ICFs or staff. However, differences between ICFs and staff were exclusively observed during transradial procedures (p<0.01). With regards to contrast administration, ICFs administered less contrast (126.3 ± 57.6 mL) than either CFs (130±52.4 mL) or staff (132.7±47.6 mL) (p<0.01)-again, a finding isolated to the transradial cohort. Of the 6,751 percutaneous coronary intervention cases, no significant differences existed between the ICFs or staff cardiologists in patient radiation exposure-but a CF as the primary operator resulted in an 18% increase in radiation exposure. Notably, contrast use was not different amongst the types of operators (p<0.05). In conclusion, having a cardiology fellow as primary operator during invasive cardiac procedures increases patient radiation exposure and minimally increases contrast administration. Strategies to minimize patient radiation exposure while maintaining trainee involvement should be evaluated.",Clinical and investigative medicine.

34228476,Incorporating SGLT2i and GLP-1RA for Cardiovascular and Kidney Disease Risk Reduction: Call for Action to the Cardiology Community.,"Multiple sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) have been shown to impart significant cardiovascular and kidney benefits, but are underused in clinical practice. Both SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA were first studied as glucose-lowering drugs, which may have impeded uptake by cardiologists in the wake of proven cardiovascular efficacy. Their significant effect on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, which are largely independent of glucose-lowering effects, must drive a broader use of these drugs. Cardiologists are 3 times more likely than endocrinologists to see patients with both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, thus they are ideally positioned to share responsibility for SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA treatment with primary care providers. In order to increase adoption, SGLT-2i and GLP-1RA must be reframed as primarily cardiovascular and kidney disease risk-reducing agents with a side effect of glucose-lowering. Coordinated and multifaceted interventions engaging clinicians, patients, payers, professional societies, and health systems must be implemented to incentivize the adoption of these medications as part of routine cardiovascular and kidney care.

Unlike cardiovascular conditions with a narrow referral pathway (e.g., acute coronary syndrome), AF may be first detected by a wide range of specialties (often noncardiology) or a general practitioner. Since timely initiated optimal management is essential for the prevention of AF-related complications, a concise and simple guidance is essential for practitioners managing AF patients, regardless of their specialty. Guideline-adherent management of patients with AF has been shown to translate to improved patient outcomes compared with guideline-nonadherent treatment. To facilitate guideline implementation in routine clinical practice, a good guideline document on AF should introduce only evidence-based new recommendations, while avoiding arbitrary changes, which may be confusing to practitioners.

Despite many technological advancements, CXR interpretation error rates have remained constant for decades. The application of machine learning has the potential to substantially improve clinical workflow efficiency, pathology detection accuracy, error rates and clinical decision making in cardiology. To date, machine learning has been developed to improve image processing, facilitate pathology detection, optimize the clinical workflow, and facilitate risk stratification. This review explores the current and potential future applications of machine learning for chest radiography to facilitate clinical decision making in cardiology.

32404302,EAPCI Position Statement on Invasive Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an unprecedented challenge to healthcare worldwide. The infection can be life threatening and require intensive care treatment. The transmission of the disease poses a risk to both patients and healthcare workers. The number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care may overwhelm health systems and negatively affect standard care for patients presenting with conditions needing emergency interventions. This position statements aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. To that end, we assembled a panel of interventional cardiologists and acute cardiac care specialists appointed by the European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions (EAPCI) and from the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association (ACVC) and included the experience from the first and worst affected areas in Europe. Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge. Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST- and non-ST-segment elevation ACS are described. In addition, we address the need for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, as well as for in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units, with examples coming from multiple European countries. Furthermore, we provide a guidance to reorganization of catheterization laboratories and, importantly, measures for protection of healthcare providers involved with invasive procedures.",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,2020-Jun,"Chieffo A, Stefanini GG, Price S, Barbato E, Tarantini G, Karam N, Moreno R, Buchanan GL, Gilard M, Halvorsen S, Huber K, James S, Neumann FJ, Möllmann H, Roffi M, Tavazzi G, Ferré JM, Windecker S, Dudek D, Baumbach A",20,1727,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
32419096,Pediatric Cardiology Specialist's Opinions Toward the Acceptability of Comfort Care for Congenital Heart Disease.,"In order to evaluate physicians' willingness to seek legal action to mandate surgery when parents refuse surgery for various congenital heart lesions, we surveyed pediatric cardiologists and cardiovascular surgeons at 4 children's hospitals. We asked whether physicians would support parental refusal of surgery for specific heart defects and, if not, whether they would seek legal action to mandate surgery. We then analyzed associations between physicians' willingness to mandate surgery and national operative mortality rates for each lesion. We surveyed 126 cardiologists and 9 cardiac surgeons at four tertiary referral centers. Overall response rate was 77%. Greater than 70% of physicians would seek legal action and mandate surgery for the following lesions: ventricular septal defect, coarctation of the aorta, complete atrioventricular canal, transposition of the great arteries, tetralogy of Fallot, and unobstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous return. Surgery for all of these lesions has reported mortality rates of < 5%. Physicians were less likely to seek legal action when parents refused surgery for Shone complex, any single ventricle lesion, or any congenital heart disease accompanied by Trisomy 13 or Trisomy 18. Among experts in pediatric cardiology, there is widespread agreement about the appropriate response to parental refusal of surgery for most congenital heart lesions, and these lesions tended to be heart defects with lower surgical mortality rates. Lesions for which there was greater consensus among experts were those with the best outcomes. There was less consensus for lesions with higher mortality rates. Such surveys, revealing disagreement among expert professionals, can provide an operational definition of the current professional ""gray zone"" in which parental preferences should determine treatment.",Pediatric cardiology,2020-Aug,"Swanson TM, Patel A, Baxter AJ, Morris SA, Maskatia SA, Lantos JD",6,1848,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
34052015,How the COVID-19 Pandemic Has Affected Cardiology Fellow Training.,"With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, resources have been reallocated and elective cases have been deferred to minimize the spread of the disease, altering the workflow of cardiac catheterization laboratories across the country. This has in turn affected the training experience of cardiology fellows, including diminished procedure numbers and a narrow breadth of cases as they approach the end of their training before joining independent practice. It has also taken a toll on the emotional well-being of fellows as they see their colleagues, loved ones, patients or even themselves struggling with COVID-19, with some succumbing to it. The aim of this opinion piece is to focus attention on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fellows and their training, challenges faced as they transition to practicing in the real world in the near future and share the lessons learned thus far.

35763772,Using co-creation to develop a cardiology online open course: an effective approach for implementing digital learning.,"we developed a massive online open course (MOOC) through co-creation between medical students and academic staff on heart semeiotics and evaluated its teaching efficiency and user satisfaction. ""The Heart, Its Signs and Symptoms"" was a MOOC aimed to teach medical students to collect clinical history and perform physical examination of patients presenting with chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, or syncope. It consisted of 4 interactive cases with preliminary, interim and final evaluation tests. A group of medical students, with the supervision of a multidisciplinary team of University professors residents, health management and informatics researchers developed the MOOC. Users (n = 701) registered to the online platform over 1 month. Students from 34 of the 40 Italian medical faculties participated. 96% of those who started the online course completed at least one of the 4 modules. Among users completing both the preliminary test and the final exam (n = 239, 34% of those registered to the online platform), the percentage of subjects passing the evaluation test raised s from 74% to 95% after the course. Younger age, attendance of Universities in Southern Italy, and a lower number of correct answers during the pre-test predicted a greater increase in the number of correct answers; Almost all participants who provided a feedback (n = 238) felt satisfied by the course. Partnership of medical students and academic staff was a key asset for the success of the initiative.

38769338,Development of a neonatal cardiac curriculum for neonatal-perinatal medicine fellowship training.,"The topic of neonatal cardiovascular care in neonatal-perinatal medicine (NPM) fellowship training has continued to transform due to increased complexity of patients, development of specialized units, continued Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements, and clinical practice variation across centers that care for neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD). We developed a neonatal cardiac curriculum comprised of eight interactive sessions with novel active learning concepts specific to our NPM fellows. A self-assessment survey in comfort in managing infants with CHD and perceived competency in neonatal cardiology topics was performed by all neonatology fellows at baseline and after completion of the curriculum. The American Board of Pediatrics Subspecialty In-training Exam (SITE) scores for fellows were compared to that of the national average. The average comfort score (0-100) of the first-year fellows increased from 33 to 76, and that of the second and third-year fellows increased from 72 to 86, and 75 to 86, respectively. The first-year fellows improved their competency score by 44 points (3 standard deviations), the second-year fellows improved their score by about 26 points (one standard deviation), and there was an overall 9-point increase in the competency score of all fellows (one standard deviation). The average local SITE score was lower than the national average before the initiation of this curriculum, became nearly equal to the national average score at the end of the first year the curriculum was implemented, and has progressively become higher since then.

31592719,Implementing Artificial Intelligence and Digital Health in Resource-Limited Settings? Top 10 Lessons We Learned in Congenital Heart Defects and Cardiology.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the key drivers of digital health. Digital health and AI applications in medicine and biology are emerging worldwide, not only in resource-rich but also resource-limited regions. AI predates to the mid-20th century, but the current wave of AI builds in part on machine learning (ML), big data, and algorithms that can learn from massive amounts of online user data from patients or healthy persons. There are lessons to be learned from AI applications in different medical specialties and across developed and resource-limited contexts. A case in point is congenital heart defects (CHDs) that continue to plague sub-Saharan Africa, which calls for innovative approaches to improve risk prediction and performance of the available diagnostics. Beyond CHDs, AI in cardiology is a promising context as well. The current suite of digital health applications in CHD and cardiology include complementary technologies such as neural networks, ML, natural language processing and deep learning, not to mention embedded digital sensors. Algorithms that build on these advances are beginning to complement traditional medical expertise while inviting us to redefine the concepts and definitions of expertise in molecular diagnostics and precision medicine. We examine and share here the lessons learned in current attempts to implement AI and digital health in CHD for precision risk prediction and diagnosis in resource-limited settings. These top 10 lessons on AI and digital health summarized in this expert review are relevant broadly beyond CHD in cardiology and medical innovations. As with AI itself that calls for systems approaches to data capture, analysis, and interpretation, both developed and developing countries can usefully learn from their respective experiences as digital health continues to evolve worldwide.",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,2020-May,"Thomford NE, Bope CD, Agamah FE, Dzobo K, Owusu Ateko R, Chimusa E, Mazandu GK, Ntumba SB, Dandara C, Wonkam A",10,1858,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
33227940,Simulation and Improvement of Patients' Workflow in Heart Clinics during COVID-19 Pandemic Using Timed Coloured Petri Nets.,"The COVID-19 epidemic has spread across the world within months and creates multiple challenges for healthcare providers. Patients with cardiovascular disease represent a vulnerable population when suffering from COVID-19. Most hospitals have been facing difficulties in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, and there is a need to minimise patient flow time so that staff health is less endangered, and more patients can be treated. This article shows how to use simulation techniques to prepare hospitals for a virus outbreak. The initial simulation of the current processes of the heart clinic first identified the bottlenecks. It confirmed that the current workflow is not optimal for COVID-19 patients; therefore, to reduce waiting time, three optimisation scenarios are proposed. In the best situation, the discrete-event simulation of the second scenario led to a 62.3% reduction in patient waiting time. This is one of the few studies that show how hospitals can use workflow modelling using timed coloured Petri nets to manage healthcare systems in practice. This technique would be valuable in these challenging times as the health of staff, and other patients are at risk from the nosocomial transmission.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020-Nov,"Zeinalnezhad M, Chofreh AG, Goni FA, Klemeš JJ, Sari E",5,1214,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Under the auspice of the Clinical Practice Guideline Quality Indicator Committee of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), the Working Group for cardiac pacing QIs was formed. The Group comprised Task Force members of the 2021 ESC Clinical Practice Guidelines on Cardiac Pacing and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy, members of the European Heart Rhythm Association, international cardiac device experts, and patient representatives. We followed the ESC methodology for QI development, which involved (i) the identification of the key domains of care by constructing a conceptual framework of the management of patients receiving cardiac pacing, (ii) the development of candidate QIs by conducting a systematic review of the literature, (iii) the selection of the final set of QIs using a modified-Delphi method, and (iv) the evaluation of the feasibility of the developed QIs. Four domains of care were identified: (i) structural framework, (ii) patient assessment, (iii) pacing strategy, and (iv) clinical outcomes. In total, seven main and four secondary QIs were selected across these domains and were embedded within the 2021 ESC Guidelines on Cardiac Pacing and Cardiac Resynchronization therapy. By way of a standardized process, 11 QIs for cardiac pacing were developed. These indicators may be used to quantify adherence to guideline-recommended clinical practice and have the potential to improve the care and outcomes of patients receiving cardiac pacemakers.","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",2022-Jan,"Aktaa S, Abdin A, Arbelo E, Burri H, Vernooy K, Blomström-Lundqvist C, Boriani G, Defaye P, Deharo JC, Drossart I, Foldager D, Gold MR, Johansen JB, Leyva F, Linde C, Michowitz Y, Kronborg MB, Slotwiner D, Steen T, Tolosana JM, Tzeis S, Varma N, Glikson M, Nielsen JC, Gale CP",25,1602,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
38658906,Utility of RAND/UCLA appropriateness method in validating multiple-choice questions on ECG.,"This study aimed to investigate the utility of the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method (RAM) in validating expert consensus-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) on electrocardiogram (ECG). According to the RAM user's manual, nine panelists comprising various experts who routinely handle ECGs were asked to reach a consensus in three phases: a preparatory phase (round 0), an online test phase (round 1), and a face-to-face expert panel meeting (round 2). In round 0, the objectives and future timeline of the study were elucidated to the nine expert panelists with a summary of relevant literature. In round 1, 100 ECG questions prepared by two skilled cardiologists were answered, and the success rate was calculated by dividing the number of correct answers by 9. Furthermore, the questions were stratified into ""Appropriate,"" ""Discussion,"" or ""Inappropriate"" according to the median score and interquartile range (IQR) of appropriateness rating by nine panelists. In round 2, the validity of the 100 ECG questions was discussed in an expert panel meeting according to the results of round 1 and finally reassessed as ""Appropriate,"" ""Candidate,"" ""Revision,"" and ""Defer."" In round 1 results, the average success rate of the nine experts was 0.89. Using the median score and IQR, 54 questions were classified as "" Discussion."" In the expert panel meeting in round 2, 23% of the original 100 questions was ultimately deemed inappropriate, although they had been prepared by two skilled cardiologists. Most of the 46 questions categorized as ""Appropriate"" using the median score and IQR in round 1 were considered ""Appropriate"" even after round 2 (44/46, 95.7%).

39159709,Evaluating ChatGPT platform in delivering heart failure educational material: A comparison with the leading national cardiology institutes.,"Patient education plays a crucial role in improving the quality of life for patients with heart failure. As artificial intelligence continues to advance, new chatbots are emerging as valuable tools across various aspects of life. One prominent example is ChatGPT, a widely used chatbot among the public. Our study aims to evaluate the readability of ChatGPT answers for common patients' questions about heart failure. We performed a comparative analysis between ChatGPT responses and existing heart failure educational materials from top US cardiology institutes. Validated readability calculators were employed to assess and compare the reading difficulty and grade level of the materials. Furthermore, blind assessment using The Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) was done by four advanced heart failure attendings to evaluate the readability and actionability of each resource. Our study revealed that responses generated by ChatGPT were longer and more challenging to read compared to other materials. Additionally, these responses were written at a higher educational level (undergraduate and 9-10th grade), similar to those from the Heart Failure Society of America. Despite achieving a competitive PEMAT readability score (75 %), surpassing the American Heart Association score (68 %), ChatGPT's actionability score was the lowest (66.7 %) among all materials included in our study. Despite its current limitations, artificial intelligence chatbots has the potential to revolutionize the field of patient education especially given theirs ongoing improvements.

This study examines whether waiting room-based CV education could complement CV care. A 2:1 randomised clinical trial of patients in waiting rooms of hospital cardiology clinics. Intervention participants received a series of tablet-delivered CV educational videos and were randomised 1:1 to receive another video on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or no extra video. Control received usual care. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants reporting high motivation to improve CV risk-modifying behaviours (physical activity, diet and blood pressure monitoring) post-clinic. clinic satisfaction, CV lifestyle risk factors (RFs) and confidence to perform CPR. Assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. Among 514 screened, 330 were randomised (n=220 intervention, n=110 control) between December 2018 and March 2020, mean age 53.8 (SD 15.2), 55.2% male. Post-clinic, more intervention participants reported high motivation to improve CV risk-modifying behaviours: 29.6% (64/216) versus 18.7% (20/107), relative risk (RR) 1.63 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.55). Intervention participants reported higher clinic satisfaction RR: 2.19 (95% CI 1.45 to 3.33). Participants that received the CPR video (n=110) reported greater confidence to perform CPR, RR 1.61 (95% CI 1.20 to 2.16). Overall, the proportion of participants reporting optimal CV RFs increased between baseline and 30-day follow-up (16.1% vs 24.8%, OR=2.44 (95% CI 1.38 to 4.49)), but there was no significant between-group difference at 30 days.

Wherever no new data have been introduced with respect to the 2013 publication, please refer to the previous version. This document is intended to complement recent European and American guidelines but an important difference should be noted. The European and American guidelines indicate good practice for people engaging in physical activity at various levels, not only at the competitive level. In contrast, the COCIS guidelines refer specifically to competitive athletes in various sports including those with high cardiovascular stress. This explains why Italian guidelines are more restrictive than European and USA ones.

38616006,Palliative Care Education in Cardiovascular Disease Fellowships: A National Survey of Program Directors.,"Palliative care (PC) is an essential component of high-quality care for people with cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, little is known about the current state of PC education in CVD training, including attitudes toward integration of PC into training and implementation of PC by the program's leadership. We developed a nationwide, cross-sectional survey that queried education approaches, perspectives and barriers to PC education in general CVD fellowship training. The survey was distributed to 392 members of the American College of Cardiology Program Director (PD) listserv, representing 290 general CVD fellowships between 1/2023 and 4/2023. We performed descriptive and ꭕ<sup>2</sup> analyses of survey data. Of the program's representatives, 56 completed the survey (response rate = 19.3%). Respondents identified themselves as current PDs (89%), associate PDs (8.9%) or former PDs (1.8%), representing a diverse range of program sizes and types and regions of the country. Respondents reported the use of informal bedside teaching (88%), formal didactics (59%), online or self-paced modules (13%), in-person simulation (11%), and clinical rotations (16%) to teach PC content. Most programs covered PC topics at least annually, although there was variability by topic. We found no associations between program demographics and type or frequency of PC education. Most respondents reported dissatisfaction with the quantity (62%) or quality (59%) of the PC education provided. Barriers to PC education included an overabundance of other content to cover (36%) and perceived lack of fellow (20%) or faculty (18%) interest. Comments demonstrated the importance of PC education in fellowship, the lack of a requirement to provide PC education, difficulty in covering all topics, and suggestions of how PC skills should be taught. In a national survey of CVD educational leadership concerning approaches to PC education in CVD training, respondents highlighted both challenges to implementation of formal PC curricula in cardiology training and opportunities for comprehensive PC education.",Journal of cardiac failure,2024-Dec,"Godfrey S, Steiner JM, Damluji AA, Sampath R, Chuzi S, Warraich H, Krishnaswami A, Bernacki G, Goodlin S, Josephson R, Mulrow J, Doherty C",12,2096,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
33973513,Hybrid Coronary Revascularization: Perspective Current State After 25 Years of Start.,"Hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) represents a minimally invasive revascularization strategy in which the durability of the internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery graft is combined with percutaneous coronary intervention to treat remaining lesions. It first was introduced in the mid-1990s and aspired to bring together the ""best of both worlds"" - the excellent patency rates and survival benefits associated with the durable left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending artery alongside the good patency rates of drug-eluting stents, which outlive saphenous vein grafts to non-left anterior descending vessels. Although in theory this is a very attractive revascularization strategy, several years later, only small randomized controlled trials comparing HCR with coronary artery bypass grafting has recently emerged in the medical literature, raising concerns regarding HCR's role.

32297597,Comparison of Multiple Quantitative Evaluation Indices of Theoretical Knowledge and Clinical Practice Skills and Training of Medical Interns in Cardiovascular Imaging Using Blended Teaching and the Case Resource Network Platform (CRNP).,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to compare multiple quantitative evaluation indices of levels of theoretical knowledge and clinical practice skills in training medical interns in cardiovascular imaging based on the use of the blended teaching (BT) online artificial intelligence (AI) case resource network platform (CRNP), including time and frequency indices and effectiveness of the CRNP. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 110 medical interns who were divided into the routine teaching (RT) group (n=55) and the blended teaching (BT) group (n=55). The two were assessed using the mini-clinical evaluation exercise (mini-CEX) that assessed clinical skills, attitudes, and behaviors and using an objective written questionnaire. The following four indices were compared between the RT and BT groups: the X-ray score (XS), the computed tomography angiography (CTA) score (CS), the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) score (MS), and the average score (AS). Seven assessment indicators included: the imaging description (ID), the qualitative diagnosis (QD), the differential diagnosis (DD), examination preparation (EP), interview skill (IS), position display (PD), and human care (HC). Indicators of CRNP use included: number of times (TN), average duration (AD), single maximum duration (SMD), and total duration (TD). RESULTS AS significantly correlated with AD (rAD=0.761) and TD (rTD=0.754), and showed moderate correlation with TN (rTN=0.595), but weak correlation with SMD (rSMD=0.404).

Yet, quantifying training load remains challenging due to the complexity of its components (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type [FITT]). In this systematic review we evaluate how training load has been quantified in sports cardiology studies and provide recommendations for how this can be improved. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed and EMBASE up to October 2024. Studies involving ""sports cardiology,"" ""training load,"" and ""endurance sport"" were included. Data extraction included study characteristics, training load assessment methods, cardiovascular outcomes, and athlete profiles. A total of 62 studies with 1,060,700 participants were included in our review. The majority of studies (59.7%) focused on exercise-induced cardiac remodelling, with other topics being cardiac arrhythmias (12.9%), cardiac autonomic adaptation (3.2%), exercise dose-response (6.5%), and coronary heart disease (17.7%). Training load was primarily quantified by questionnaires (58.1%), whereas heart rate monitoring, a more objective measure, was used in only 1.6% of the studies. All studies reported exercise type, but only 19.4% measured all FITT components. There is a lack of uniformity in the assessment of key FITT variables to quantify training load within the field of sports cardiology, with many studies relying on subjective or incomplete methods. As cardiology moves into the precision medicine era, researchers and clinicians should seek to obtain objective training load information from their athletes according to the FITT framework, and data from use of objective wearable devices represent the optimal way to do this.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2025-Mar,"Dausin C, Tironi RM, Cornelissen V, Hespel P, Willems R, Haykowsky M, La Gerche A, Claessen G, Foulkes S",9,1766,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
35142829,Hospital Characteristics and Early Enrollment Trends in the American College of Cardiology Voluntary Public Reporting Program.,"Limited data exist regarding the characteristics of hospitals that do and do not participate in voluntary public reporting programs. To describe hospital characteristics and trends associated with early participation in the American College of Cardiology (ACC) voluntary reporting program for cardiac catheterization-percutaneous coronary intervention (CathPCI) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) registries. This cross-sectional study analyzed enrollment trends and characteristics of hospitals that did and did not participate in the ACC voluntary public reporting program. All hospitals reporting procedure data to the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) CathPCI or ICD registries that were eligible for the public reporting program from July 2014 (ie, program launch date) to May 2017 were included. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify hospital characteristics associated with voluntary participation. Enrollment trends were evaluated considering the date US News & World Report (USNWR) announced that it would credit participating hospitals. Data analysis was performed from March 2017 to January 2018. Hospital characteristics and participation in the public reporting program. By May 2017, 561 of 1747 eligible hospitals (32.1%) had opted to participate in the program. Enrollment increased from 240 to 376 hospitals (56.7%) 1 month after the USNWR announcement that program participation would be considered as a component of national hospital rankings. Compared with hospitals that did not enroll, program participants had increased median (IQR) procedural volumes for PCI (481 [280-764] procedures vs 332 [186-569] procedures; P < .001) and ICD (114 [56-220] procedures vs 62 [25-124] procedures; P < .001). Compared with nonparticipating hospitals, an increased mean (SD) proportion of participating hospitals adhered to composite discharge medications after PCI (0.96 [0.03] vs 0.92 [0.07]; P < .001) and ICD (0.88 [0.10] vs 0.81 [0.12]; P < .001). Hospital factors associated with enrollment included participation in 5 or more NCDR registries (odds ratio [OR],1.98; 95% CI, 1.24-3.19; P = .005), membership in a larger hospital system (ie, 3-20 hospitals vs ≤2 hospitals in the system: OR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.65-3.17; P = .001), participation in an NCDR pilot public reporting program of PCI 30-day readmissions (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 2.19-3.91; P < .001), university affiliation (vs government affiliation: OR, 3.85, 95% CI, 1.03-14.29; P = .045; vs private affiliation: OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.35-3.57; P < .001), Midwest location (vs South: OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.06-2.08; P = .02), and increased comprehensive quality ranking (4 vs 1-2 performance stars in CathPCI: OR, 8.08; 95% CI, 5.07-12.87; P < .001; 4 vs 1 performance star in ICD: OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.48-3.44; P < .001) (C statistic = 0.829).

We sought to evaluate the validity of using a subjective scoring system to assess the accuracy of ECG interpretations submitted by pediatric cardiology fellows, trainees, and faculty to the Pediatric ECG Review (pECGreview), a web-based ECG interpretation training program. We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional study of responses submitted to pECGreview. ECG interpretations were assessed independently by four individuals with a range of experience. Accuracy was assessed using a 3-point scale: 100% for generally correct interpretations, 50% for over- or underdiagnosis of minor ECG abnormalities, and 0% for over- or underdiagnosis of major ECG abnormalities. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using expanded Bland-Altman plots, Pearson correlation coefficients, and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC). 1460 ECG interpretations by 192 participants were analyzed. 107 participants interpreted at least five ECGs. The mean accuracy score was 76.6 ± 13.7%. Participants were correct in 66.1 ± 5.1%, had minor over- or underdiagnosis in 21.5 ± 4.6% and major over- or underdiagnosis in 12.3 ± 3.9% of interpretations. Validation of agreement between evaluators demonstrated limits of agreement of 11.3%. Inter-rater agreement exhibited consistent patterns (all correlations ≥ 0.75). Absolute agreement was 0.74 (95% CI 0.69-0.80), and average measures agreement was 0.92 (95% CI 0.89-0.94).

This study aimed to evaluate the use of the data and results from the challenge for detection of AF in longer ECGs, taken from three other PhysioNet datasets. The used data-driven models were based on features extracted from ECG recordings, calculated according to three solutions from the challenge. A Random Forest classifier was trained with the data from the challenge. The performance was evaluated on all non-overlapping 30 s segments in all recordings from three MIT-BIH datasets. Fifty-six models were trained using different feature sets, both before and after applying three feature reduction techniques. Based on rhythm annotations, the AF proportion was 0.00 in the MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm (N = 46083 segments), 0.10 in the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia (N = 2880), and 0.41 in the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation (N = 28104) dataset. For the best performing model, the corresponding detected proportions of AF were 0.00, 0.11 and 0.36 using all features, and 0.01, 0.10 and 0.38 when using the 15 best performing features. The results obtained on the MIT-BIH datasets indicate that the training data and solutions from the 2017 Physionet/Cinc Challenge can be useful tools for developing robust AF detectors also in longer ECG recordings, even when using a low number of carefully selected features. The use of feature selection allows significantly reducing the number of features while preserving the classification performance, which can be important when building low-complexity AF classifiers on ECG devices with constrained computational and energy resources.",Biomedical physics & engineering express,2020-Feb,"Kleyko D, Osipov E, Wiklund U",3,1680,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

38198766,Cardiovascular multimodality imaging in women: a scientific statement of the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging of the European Society of Cardiology.,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) represent an important cause of mortality and morbidity in women. It is now recognized that there are sex differences regarding the prevalence and the clinical significance of the traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors as well as the pathology underlying a range of CVDs. Unfortunately, women have been under-represented in most CVD imaging studies and trials regarding diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics. There is therefore a clear need for further investigation of how CVD affects women along their life span. Multimodality CV imaging plays a key role in the diagnosis of CVD in women as well as in prognosis, decision-making, and monitoring of therapeutics and interventions. However, multimodality imaging in women requires specific consideration given the differences in CVD between the sexes. These differences relate to physiological changes that only women experience (e.g. pregnancy and menopause) as well as variation in the underlying pathophysiology of CVD and also differences in the prevalence of certain conditions such as connective tissue disorders, Takotsubo, and spontaneous coronary artery dissection, which are all more common in women.

This provides challenges for the use of secondary prevention measures in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this Position Statement is to review the implications for effective delivery of secondary prevention strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced limitations for many patients to access standard health services such as visits to health care professionals, medications, imaging and blood tests as well as attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. In addition, the pandemic is having an impact on lifestyle habits and mental health. Taken together, this has the potential to adversely impact the ability of practitioners and patients to adhere to treatment guidelines for the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events. Every effort should be made to deliver safe, ongoing access to health care professionals and the use of evidenced based therapies in individuals with CVD. An increase in use of a range of electronic health platforms has the potential to transform secondary prevention.

An online survey was emailed to all APIC members, between August and November 2021. The questionnaire consisted of 50 questions focusing on knowledge and measures of IR protection in the catheterization laboratory. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. From a response rate of 46.9%, the study obtained a total sample of 159 responses (156 selected for analysis). Most survey respondents (66.0%) were unaware of the radiation exposure category, and only 60.4% reported systematically using a dosimeter. A large majority (90.4%) employed techniques to minimize exposure to radiation. All participants used personal protective equipment, despite eyewear protection only being used frequently by 49.2% of main operators. Ceiling suspended shields and table protectors were often used. Only two-thirds were familiar with the legally established limit on radiation doses for workers or the dose that should trigger patient follow-up. Most of the survey respondents had a non-certified training in IR procedures and only 32.0% had attended their yearly occupational health consultation. Safety methods and protective equipment are largely adopted among interventional cardiologists, who have shown some IR awareness.

35050949,Patient Pathways in Cardiology: Should Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Companies Care?,"A shared goal of patients, providers, and the companies that produce new therapies is to have these therapies used according to guidelines. Health services specialize in patient care and may lack the capabilities to take a product from conception through to everyday use. This results in a mutually beneficial relationship between health services and industry. The market for cardiovascular drugs is significant, which results in competition between companies. While traditional methods of observational analysis may be able to determine to what extent drugs and devices are being prescribed or implanted by health providers, there is less real-world patient level insight as to why patients are taking (or not taking) these treatments and why one agent is chosen over another. Considering patient pathways is a novel approach that can be utilized to understand real-world patient activities. This approach focuses on the patient flow across the healthcare system and barriers at each stage including identification of patients, diagnostic testing, the decisions on treatment, and prescribing can help identify ways of improving the utilization based on guidelines. It overcomes several assumptions related to patient and clinician decision-making and practical considerations such as geography and availability of health services. In this article, we introduce the concept of patient pathways and why considering them maybe of interest to companies. As significant resources are invested to bring a product to market, this approach can help define if there are missed opportunities for their products to be utilized and potential barriers to implementation.",Critical pathways in cardiology,2022-Mar,"Kwok CS, Muntean EA, Foster W, Mallen CD",4,1658,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

38880398,Canadian Cardiovascular Society Clinical Practice Update on Contemporary Management of the Patient With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,"Numerous guidelines on the diagnosis and management of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have been published, by learned societies, over the past decade. Although helpful they are often long and less adapted to nonexperts. This writing panel was challenged to produce a document that grew as much from years of practical experience as it did from the peer-reviewed literature. As such, rather than produce yet another set of guidelines, we aim herein to deliver a concentrate of our own experiential learning and distill for the reader the essence of effective and appropriate HCM care. This Clinical Practice Update on HCM is therefore aimed at general cardiologists and other cardiovascular practitioners rather than for HCM specialists. We set the stage with a description of the condition and its clinical presentation, discuss the central importance of ""obstruction"" and how to look for it, review the role of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, reflect on the appropriate use of genetic testing, review the treatment options for symptomatic HCM-crucially including cardiac myosin inhibitors, and deal concisely with practical issues surrounding risk assessment for sudden cardiac death, and management of the end-stage HCM patient. Uniquely, we have captured the pediatric experience on our panel to discuss appropriate differences in the management of younger patients with HCM. We ask the reader to remember that this document represents expert consensus opinion rather than dogma and to use their best judgement when dealing with the HCM patient in front of them.",The Canadian journal of cardiology,2024-Sep,"Crean AM, Adler A, Arbour L, Chan J, Christian S, Cooper RM, Garceau P, Giraldeau G, Heydari B, Laksman Z, Mital S, Ong K, Overgaard C, Ruel M, Seifer CM, Ward MR, Tadros R",17,1572,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
38813819,Simulation-guided auscultatory training before graduation is associated with better auscultatory skills in residents.,"A growing body of scientific evidence shows that simulation-guided auscultatory training can significantly improve the skills of medical students. Nevertheless, it remains to be elucidated if this training has any long-term impact on auscultatory skills. We sought to ascertain whether there were differences in heart and lung auscultation among residents who received simulation-guided auscultatory training before graduation vs. those who did not. A total of 43 residents were included in the study; 20 of them entered into Cardiology specialty school (C) and 23 of them entered into Internal and Occupational Medicine specialty schools (M) at the University of Trieste. Based on the history of simulation-guided auscultatory training before graduation (yes = Y; no = N), four groups were formed: CY, CN, MY, and MN. Residents were evaluated in terms of their ability to recognize six heart and five lung sounds, which were reproduced in a random order with the Kyoto-Kagaku patient simulator. Associations between history of simulation training, specialty choice and auscultatory skills were evaluated with Kruskal-Wallis test and logistic regression analysis. Auscultatory skills of residents were associated with simulation-guided training before graduation, regardless of the specialty chosen. Simulation-guided training had a higher impact on residents in Medicine. Overall, heart and lung sounds were correctly recognized in 41% of cases. Logistic regression analysis showed that simulation-guided training was associated with recognition of aortic stenosis, S2 wide split, fine crackles, and pleural rubs. Specialty choice was associated with recognition of aortic stenosis as well as aortic and mitral regurgitation. History of simulation-guided auscultatory training was associated with better auscultatory performance in residents, regardless of the medical specialty chosen. Choice of Cardiology was associated with better scores in aortic stenosis as well as aortic and mitral regurgitation. Nevertheless, overall auscultatory proficiency was quite poor, which suggests that simulation-guided training may help but is probably still too short.","Journal of cardiovascular medicine (Hagerstown, Md.)",2024-Aug,"Bernardi S, Fabris B, Giudici F, Grillo A, Di Pierro G, Pellin L, Aleksova A, Larese Filon F, Sinagra G, Merlo M",10,2157,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

38864102,Cost Perception of Cardiological Procedures Among -Medical Students and Doctors in Switzerland.,"Aims: The aim of the present study was to analyze the cost awareness of cardiological tests and procedures among medical students, residents and doctors in Switzerland and discuss trends in cost perception in health expenditures. Methods: Using an online questionnaire, participants (randomly recruited by mailing lists, messaging app or via direct contact) had to estimate the costs of the 13 predefined cardiological procedures services, diagnostic tests and procedures in Swiss Francs (CHF). Short technical descriptions of the procedures and tests were provided. Estimated costs were considered accurate if they were within ±25 % of the reimbursement rate. Participant groups were defined: medical students, residents, hospital-based physicians and cardiologists in private practice (practitioners). Results: A total of 939 participants (172 physicians and 767 medical students) were enrolled. The overall proportion of medical gestures estimated correctly within ±25% of the reimbursement rate ranged from 10 % (students) to 55 % in practitioners. Residents (26 %) and hospital-based physicians (38 %) performed intermediately. In general, the costs were overestimated. Conclusions: The level of cost knowledge of cardiological tests and procedures among medical students, residents and doctors in Switzerland is modest. In general, the costs were overestimated. Increasing experience seems to sharpen the accuracy of cost estimation. Overestimation of costs is potentially problematic: Either in systems of governmental defined global budget or systems with substantial out-of-pocket costs for patients, overestimated costs will result in more restrictive ordering than it would be appropriate and affordable for the individual patient.",Praxis,2024-May,"Müller A, Melliger R, Biaggi P, Oechslin L, Wyss C",5,1742,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
38212100,Cardiogeriatrics: the current state of the art.,"It is estimated that by 2050, 17% of the world's population will be greater than 85 years old, which, combined with cardiovascular disease (CVD) being the leading cause of death and disability, sets an unprecedented burden on our health and care systems. This perfect storm will be accompanied by a rise in the prevalence of CVD due to increased survival of patients with pre-existing CVD and the incidence of CVD that is associated with the process of ageing. In this review, we will focus on the diagnosis and management of common CVD conditions in old age, namely: heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF) and valvular heart disease (VHD). Despite limited evidence, clinical guidelines are increasingly considering the complexity of management of these conditions in the older person, which often coexist, for example, AF and HF or CAD and VHD. Furthermore, they, in turn, need specific consideration in the context of comorbidities, polypharmacy, frailty and impaired cognition found in this age group. Hence, the emerging role of the geriatric cardiologist is therefore vital in performing comprehensive geriatric assessment, attending multidisciplinary team meetings and ultimately considering the patient and the sum of their diseases in their totality. There have been recent advances in CVD management but how we apply these to deliver integrated care to the elderly population is key. This review article aims to bring together emerging studies and guidelines on assessment and management of CVD in the elderly, summarising latest definitions, diagnostics, therapeutics and future challenges.",Heart (British Cardiac Society),2024-Jun,"Gaur A, Carr F, Warriner D",3,1637,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

We aimed to examine the impact of these unprecedented changes on the formal education of paediatric cardiology fellows through a nationwide survey. A REDCap™-based voluntary anonymous survey was sent to all current paediatric cardiology fellows in the United States of America in May, 2020. Of 143 respondents, 121 were categorical fellows, representing over one-fourth of all categorical paediatric cardiology fellows in the United States of America. Nearly all (140/143, 97.9%) respondents utilised online learning during the pandemic, with 134 (93.7%) reporting an increase in use compared to pre-pandemic. The percentage of respondents reporting curriculum supplementation with outside lectures increased from 11.9 to 88.8% during the pandemic. Respondents considered online learning to be ""equally or more effective"" than in-person lectures in convenience (133/142, 93.7%), improving fellow attendance (132/142, 93.0%), improving non-fellow attendance (126/143, 88.1%), and meeting individual learning needs (101/143, 70.6%). The pandemic positively affected the lecture curriculum of 83 respondents (58.0%), with 35 (24.5%) reporting no change and 25 (17.5%) reporting a negative effect. A positive effect was most noted by those whose programmes utilised supplemental outside lectures (62.2 versus 25.0%, p = 0.004) and those whose lecture frequency did not decrease (65.1 versus 5.9%, p < 0.001). Restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic have greatly increased utilisation of online learning platforms by medical training programmes.

32251546,Triage considerations for patients referred for structural heart disease intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic: An ACC/SCAI position statement.,"The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has strained health care resources around the world, causing many institutions to curtail or stop elective procedures. This has resulted in an inability to care for patients with valvular and structural heart disease in a timely fashion, potentially placing these patients at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular complications, including CHF and death. The effective triage of these patients has become challenging in the current environment, as clinicians have had to weigh the risk of bringing susceptible patients into the hospital environment during the COVID-19 pandemic against the risk of delaying a needed procedure. In this document, the authors suggest guidelines for how to triage patients in need of structural heart disease interventions and provide a framework for how to decide when it may be appropriate to proceed with intervention despite the ongoing pandemic. In particular, the authors address the triage of patients in need of transcatheter aortic valve replacement and percutaneous mitral valve repair.

In this position statement, the Heart Failure Association aims to systematize the use of various imaging methods in accordance with the timeline of acute heart failure care proposed in the recent guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. During the first hours of admission the point-of-care focused cardiac and lung ultrasound examination is an invaluable tool for rapid differential diagnosis of acute dyspnoea, which is highly feasible and relatively easy to learn. Several portable and stationary imaging modalities are being increasingly used for the evaluation of cardiac structure and function, haemodynamic and volume status, precipitating myocardial ischaemia or valvular abnormalities, and systemic and pulmonary congestion. This paper emphasizes the central role of the full echocardiographic examination in the identification of heart failure aetiology, severity of cardiac dysfunction, indications for specific heart failure therapy, and risk stratification. Correct evaluation of cardiac filling pressures and accurate prognostication may help to prevent unscheduled short-term readmission. Alternative advanced imaging modalities should be considered to assist patient management in the pre- and post-discharge phase, including cardiac magnetic resonance, computed tomography, nuclear studies, and coronary angiography.

Adopting AUC into clinical workflows may present challenges, and there may be specific implementation strategies that are effective in promoting effective use of AUC. We sought to assess the effect of implementing AUC in clinical practice. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies found through a systematic search of the MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane, or CINAHL databases. Peer-reviewed manuscripts published after 2005 that reported on the implementation of AUC for a cardiovascular test or procedure were included. The main outcome was to determine if AUC implementation was associated with a reduction in inappropriate/rarely appropriate care. Of the 18 included studies, the majority used pre/post-cohort designs; few (n = 3) were randomized trials. Most studies used multiple strategies (n = 12, 66.7%). Education was the most common individual intervention strategy (n = 13, 72.2%), followed by audit and feedback (n = 8, 44.4%) and computerized physician order entry (n = 6, 33.3%). No studies reported on formal use of stakeholder engagement or 'nudges'. In meta-analysis, AUC implementation was associated with a reduction in inappropriate/rarely appropriate care (odds ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.49-0.78). Funnel plot suggests the possibility of publication bias. We found most published efforts to implement AUC observed reductions in inappropriate/rarely appropriate care. Studies rarely explored how or why the implementation strategy was effective. Because interventions were infrequently tested in isolation, it is difficult to make observations about their effectiveness as stand-alone strategies. PROSPERO 2018 CRD42018091602.

We evaluated the overall awareness regarding Ayurveda among patients attending two specialty clinics at a tertiary care institute. Methods We did a cross-sectional study on patients attending the cardiology and neurology clinics at a tertiary care hospital in India. We conducted this paper-based survey using a standardized, validated questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 14.2. Results Three hundred and ninety-seven patients agreed to participate in the study. Their mean (SD) age was 45.65 (15.02) years. Among them 68.5% were men and 56.9% were from urban areas. Participants perceived that Ayurveda comprised herbal drugs (77.6%), metallic/herbo-mineral preparations (44.3%), Panchakarma therapy (22.2%) and personalized medicine (37.8%). Principal sources of information were TV promotional programmes (34.7%) and newspaper advertisements (13.9%). Nearly two-thirds (63%) of participants opined that Ayurveda is effective in chronic disorders. Although only 9.1% of participants reported the use of Ayurvedic medicines, 89.2% believed it would be beneficial if the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi had Ayurveda services. Three-fourths (75.8%) of respondents were interested to participate in research studies integrating Ayurveda with modern medicine. Conclusion Imprecise knowledge and awareness towards Ayurveda appears to prevail in addition to the low practice among the patients surveyed.

This cross-sectional study evaluates the precision of ChatGPT-4 in interpreting multimodal images for paediatric cardiology knowledge assessment, including echocardiograms, angiograms, X-rays, and electrocardiograms. One hundred multiple-choice questions with accompanying images from the textbook <i>Pediatric Cardiology Board Review</i> were randomly selected. The chatbot was prompted to answer these questions with and without the accompanying images. Statistical analysis was done using <i>X</i><sup>2</sup>, Fisher's exact, and McNemar tests. Results showed that ChatGPT-4 answered 41% of questions with images correctly, performing best on those with electrocardiograms (54%) and worst on those with angiograms (29%). Without the images, ChatGPT-4's performance was similar at 37% (difference = 4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -9.4% to 17.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.56). The chatbot performed significantly better when provided the image of an electrocardiogram than without (difference = 18, 95% CI 4.0% to 31.9%, <i>p</i> < 0.04). In cases of incorrect answers, ChatGPT-4 was more inconsistent with an image than without (difference = 21%, 95% CI 3.5% to 36.9%, <i>p</i> < 0.02). In conclusion, ChatGPT-4 performed poorly in answering image-based multiple-choice questions in paediatric cardiology. Its accuracy in answering questions with images was similar to without, indicating limited multimodal image interpretation capabilities. Substantial training is required before clinical integration can be considered. Further research is needed to assess the clinical reasoning skills and progression of ChatGPT in paediatric cardiology for clinical and academic utility.",Cardiology in the young,2024-Nov,"Gritti MN, Prajapati R, Yissar D, Morgan CT",4,1883,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
31887781,Aspirin Therapy for Primary Prevention: The Case for Continuing Prescribing to Patients at High Cardiovascular Risk-A Review.,"Current evidence supports the use of low-dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention. By contrast, the benefit-to-risk ratio of aspirin use in primary prevention is debated: three contemporary randomized control trials have been conflicting, and meta-analyses have concluded for an unclear clinical benefit, based on the consideration that the reduction in thromboembolic events is counterbalanced by increased bleeding. The primary prevention setting is, however, a heterogeneous mix of subjects at highly variable cardiovascular risk. One possible explanation for the uncertainty of data interpretation is the progressive reduction in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in primary prevention that has accompanied global education programs, leading patients to smoke less, exercise more, and increasingly take lipid-lowering therapies. Based on a meta-regression of the benefits and harm of aspirin therapy in primary prevention as a function of the 10-year risk of MACE, we favor a nuanced approach still, however, based on the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, acknowledging differences between patients and emphasizing an individualized assessment of both benefits and harm. After optimal control of cardiovascular risk factors, and when patients are less than 70 years of age, clinicians should assess the risk of MACE and base decision on such stratification, considering the risk of bleeding and patient preferences. Clinicians would then advise the use of aspirin in primary prevention patients at the highest risk of MACE who do not have a prohibitive risk of bleeding, and in the majority of cases after initiation of properly titrated statin therapy.",Thrombosis and haemostasis,2020-Feb,"De Caterina R, Aimo A, Ridker PM",3,1688,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
39440939,Transformational learning and professional identity formation in postgraduate competency-based medical education.,"Residency programmes are in transition to a framework for competency-based medical education (CBME). The intersection of CBME with transformational learning (TL) experiences and professional identity formation (PIF) - particularly within senior learners in transitional states - is unknown but important to understand in order to develop and implement strategies to support trainees' professional development. Through inductive qualitative methods, we conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 22) of current trainees and recent graduates from adult cardiology residency training programmes within Canada to explore the impact of TL experiences on residents' professional growth and identity formation. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis informed by TL theory. CBME did not appear to influence trainees' experiences of disorienting dilemmas and TL. Important clinical encounters and interpersonal relationships - in particular, those between mentor and mentee - shaped trainees' professional development as cardiologists ('enabling factors' for TL and PIF). 'Imposter phenomenon' was widely prevalent in our sample study population even among graduates who had already completed their training. Requisite elements for transformation (disorienting dilemmas, critical reflection, discourse and action) also contributed to PIF. TL experiences influenced PIF in senior learners but infrequently intersected with CBME; these experiences were more commonly prompted by disorienting dilemmas relating to clinical outcomes or interpersonal interactions independent of CBME-specific architecture.",Medical education,2025-Apr,"Chow J, Al-Duaij L, Last N, Sheth U, Rehman M, Azim A, Khalid F, Blissett S, Sibbald M",9,1601,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23
31907086,The patient encounter index: a novel method of measuring clinical workload in a paediatric cardiology service.,"Technological advances have led to better patient outcomes and the expansion of clinical services in paediatric cardiology. This expansion creates an ever-growing workload for clinicians, which has led to workflow and staffing issues that need to be addressed. The objective of this study was the development of a novel tool to measure the clinical workload of a paediatric cardiology service in Cape Town, South Africa: The patient encounter index is a tool designed to quantify clinical workload. It is defined as a ratio of the measured duration of clinical work to the total time available for such work. This index was implemented as part of a prospective cross-sectional study design. Clinical workload data were collected over a 10-day period using time-and-motion sampling. Clinicians were contractually expected to spend 50% of their daily workload on patient care. The median patient encounter index for the Western Cape Paediatric Cardiac Service was 0.81 (range 0.19-1.09), reflecting that 81% of total contractual working time was spent on clinical activities. This study describes the development and implementation of a novel tool for clinical workload quantification and describes its application to a busy paediatric cardiology service in Cape Town, South Africa. This tool prospectively quantifies clinical workload which may directly influence patient outcomes. Implementation of this novel tool in the described setting clearly demonstrated the excessive workload of the clinical service and facilitated effective motivation for improved allocation of resources.",Cardiology in the young,2020-Jan,"Harrison MJ, Barry OM, Hounsell RA, De Decker R",4,1582,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

Here, the current medical and surgical applications of virtual reality are reviewed and the potential for future applications explored. Multiple centers have begun to develop software designed to bring virtual reality technology to bear on congenital heart disease. These efforts have focused on surgical preparation, on education of medical providers, and on preparation of patients and their family members for cardiac interventions. Though relatively little statistical evidence for benefit has been generated to date, those studies currently available suggest that virtual reality may provide a significant benefit in all three of these aspects of medical care. The immersive nature of virtual reality meshes well with the learning styles of adult practitioners and promises to be a powerful tool for both pediatric cardiologists and the patients with whose care they are entrusted.

A high acuity therapies (ATs) score was derived (1 point per positive response) from 44 survey questions and scores were compared to center surgical volume. Of 31 centers that completed the 2017 survey, 26 also completed the 2019 survey. Scores ranged from 11 to 34 in 2017 and 11 to 35 in 2019. AT scores in 2019 were not statistically different from 2017 scores (29/44, IQR 27-32.5 vs. 29.5/44, IQR 27-31, p = 0.9). In 2019, more centers reported initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and Bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) in Acute Care Cardiology Unit (ACCU) (19/26 vs. 4/26, p < 0.001) and permitting continuous CPAP/BiPAP (22/26 vs. 14/26, p = 0.034) compared to 2017.

33277408,Sacred hearts and pumps: cardiology and the conflicted body politic (1500-1900).,"This article examines how conflicting notions of the body politic between the natural and the spiritual have contextualised the evolution of cardiology. After a brief look at the place of the heart in biblical, patristic and medieval notions of the church, the article turns to the Reformation period. While Martin Luther moved theological gravity to the individual's heart and conscience, his contemporary Michael Servetus described the pulmonary cycle in the context of an antitrinitarian theology condemned as theological and political heresy. In the early modern period, nature conceived as creation grounded sovereign political authority, which science could then align with. Whereas William Harvey still adhered to an Aristotelian teleology, René Descartes and subsequent mechanistic contributions to cardiology were flanked by an intense 'cardiolatry'. Both, it is argued, are two sides of the same, almost non-corporeal coin. The emerging Enlightened epistemology allowed for a position distinct from both sovereign and ecclesial powers. The French Revolution was a paradigm shift: the ancien régime falls, and its Sacred Heart devotion is mocked; the new 'Erastian' state-university emerges as the context of cardiology. These developments are reflected in the life of René Laënnec and in cultural interpretations of the heart later in the 19th century. It is shown that the heart as a doubly inscribed, both biological and spiritual organ, played a central role in theological, and therefore political and scientific notions of the body politic. These continue to haunt the present, allowing us to interpret normative appeals to the heart particularly in political contexts.",Medical humanities,2020-Dec,Feiler T,1,1684,cardiology,2025-11-02 18:31:23

The goal of this study was to survey early career cardiothoracic surgeons regarding their training experiences. An email-based survey was sent to cardiothoracic surgeons, who graduated between 2012-2017. Data on training pathway specific variables and overall satisfaction were collected. The primary endpoints were career preparation and satisfaction, scored on a scale from 1-100, 100 being the most positive. Four hundred seventy-seven emails were sent, with a response rate of 95/477 (20%). Seventy-six of the respondents (80%) were male; the mean age was 39. Seventy-seven (81.0%) completed a traditional training pathway, 7 (7.4%) completed a 4+3 pathway, and 11 (11.6%) completed an I-6 pathway. Participants felt prepared for practice with a mean response of 79.8 (range 31-100); mean career satisfaction was 87.6.  When asked which pathway respondents would choose in the current era, 52 (54.7%) would choose a traditional pathway, 17 (17.9%) a 4+3 pathway, and 19 (20.0%) an I-6 program; 7 (7.4%) did not respond. Twenty of 72 (27.8%) traditional pathway trained and 18/18(100%) integrated pathway trained surgeons would choose an integrated pathway.

33133359,Paying for Performance Improvement in Quality and Outcomes of Cardiovascular Care: Challenges and Prospects.,"Over the past two decades, Medicare and other payers have been looking at ways to base payment for cardiovascular care on the quality and outcomes of care delivered. Public reporting of hospital performance on a series of quality measures began in 2004 with basic processes of care such as aspirin use and influenza vaccination, and it expanded in later years to include outcomes such as mortality and readmission rates. Following the passage of the Affordable Care Act in March 2010, Medicare and other payers moved forward with pay-for-performance programs, more commonly referred to as value-based purchasing (VBP) programs. These programs are largely based on an underlying fee-for-service payment infrastructure and give hospitals and clinicians bonuses or penalties based on their performance. Another new payment mechanism, called alternative payment models (APMs), aims to move towards episode-based or global payments to improve quality and efficiency. The two most relevant APMs for cardiovascular care include Accountable Care Organizations and bundled payments. Both VBP programs and APMs have challenges related to program efficacy, accuracy, and equity. In fact, despite over a decade of progress in measuring and incentivizing high-quality care delivery within cardiology, major limitations remain. Many of the programs have had little benefit in terms of clinical outcomes yet have led to marked administrative burden for participants. However, there are several encouraging prospects to aid the successful implementation of value-based high-quality cardiovascular care, such as more sophisticated data science to improve risk adjustment and flexible electronic health records to decrease administrative burden. Furthermore, payment models designed specifically for cardiovascular care could incentivize innovative care delivery models that could improve quality and outcomes for patients.

Validity was evaluated with factor analysis and reliability by analyzing internal consistency using the Cronbach's alpha coefficient. Feasibility was defined by a minimum of 80% of the raters responding the questionnaire. The factor analysis clearly identified five item groupings, similar to the theoretical attributes predefined in the original questionnaire, providing evidence of the validity of the Spanish version. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.92, indicating high internal consistency of the items included. All the evaluators proposed completed the electronic form (152 surveys) demonstrating feasibility to implement.

Here, we consider how it will change daily practice for cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, and healthcare professionals. Clinical evidence for any high-risk device must be reported by the manufacturer in a Summary of Safety and Clinical Performance (SSCP) that will be publicly available in the European Union Database on Medical Devices (Eudamed) maintained by the European Commission; this will facilitate evidence-based choices of which devices to recommend. Hospitals must record all device implantations, and each high-risk device will be trackable by Unique Device Identification (UDI). Important new roles are envisaged for clinicians, scientists, and engineers in EU Expert Panels-in particular to scrutinize clinical data submitted by manufacturers for certain high-risk devices and the evaluations of that data made by notified bodies. They will advise manufacturers on the design of their clinical studies and recommend to regulators when new technical specifications or guidance are needed. Physicians should support post-market surveillance by reporting adverse events and by contributing to comprehensive medical device registries. A second law on In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices will take effect from 2022.

33962641,Variability of risk factors and diabetes complications.,"Several studies suggest that, together with glucose variability, the variability of other risk factors, as blood pressure, plasma lipids, heart rate, body weight, and serum uric acid, might play a role in the development of diabetes complications. Moreover, the variability of each risk factor, when contemporarily present, may have additive effects. However, the question is whether variability is causal or a marker. Evidence shows that the quality of care and the attainment of the target impact on the variability of all risk factors. On the other hand, for some of them causality may be considered. Although specific studies are still lacking, it should be useful checking the variability of a risk factor, together with its magnitude out of the normal range, in clinical practice. This can lead to an improvement of the quality of care, which, in turn, could further hesitate in an improvement of risk factors variability.",Cardiovascular diabetology,2021-May,"Ceriello A, Prattichizzo F",2,928,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The lack of diagnostic methods for early detection results in patients losing the best treatment opportunity. Oral hypoglycemics and exogenous insulin replenishment are currently the most common therapeutic strategies, which only yield temporary glycemic control rather than curing the disease and its complications. Exosomes are nanoparticles containing bioactive molecules reflecting individual physiological status, regulating metabolism, and repairing damaged tissues. They function as biomarkers of diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications. Considering that exosomes are bioactive molecules, can be obtained from body fluid, and have cell-type specificity, in this review, we highlight the multifold effects of exosomes in the pathology and therapy of diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2021-,"Sun Y, Tao Q, Wu X, Zhang L, Liu Q, Wang L",6,948,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

In addition to type 2 diabetes, in which aging is a well-known risk factor, individuals with type 1 and other types of diabetes are also increasing owing to longevity in the general population and improved prognosis of the disease and comorbidities. Insulin-dependent state in type 1 diabetes and other types of diabetes, such as diabetes after pancreatectomy, inevitably requires insulin treatment for survival; however, daily injection of insulin is often hampered in older adults due to impaired cognitive function or limited activities of daily living. In this review, we aimed to discuss the current situation of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in older adults and highlight future prospects.

39556629,Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Evaluation and Treatment.,"Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes resulting from an absolute or relative insulin deficiency. It can occur in patients of all ages and can be the initial presentation of diabetes, especially in young children. Polyuria and polydipsia are the most common symptoms, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, severe fatigue, dyspnea, and preceding febrile illness. Traditionally, DKA has been diagnosed by the triad of hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.3, serum bicarbonate less than 18 mEq/L, anion gap greater than 10 mEq/L), and elevated serum (preferred) or urine ketones. However, hyperglycemia has been de-emphasized in recent guidelines because of the increasing incidence of euglycemic DKA. The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors modestly increases the risk of DKA and euglycemic DKA. Electrolytes, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood cell count with differential, A1C, and electrocardiography should be evaluated for all patients diagnosed with DKA to identify causes and complications of DKA. Amylase, lipase, hepatic transaminase levels, troponin, creatine kinase, blood and urine cultures, and chest radiography are additional tests to consider. Treatment involves fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin, treatment of precipitating causes, and close monitoring to adjust therapy and identify complications. Prevention strategies include identifying diabetes before DKA develops, educating patients to manage high-risk situations, and ensuring uninterrupted access to therapies for diabetes.",American family physician,2024-Nov,"Veauthier B, Levy-Grau B",2,1682,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
30961501,The Growing Epidemic of Diabetes Mellitus.,"During the past decades, the prevalence of diabetes (DM) has increased significantly, mainly as a result of continuous rise in the incidence of type 2 DM. According to World Health Organization statistics, >422 million adults globally were suffering from DM in 2014 and a continuous rise in DM prevalence is expected. The present review considers recent epidemiological data providing worldwide estimates regarding the incidence of DM. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify available data from epidemiological studies evaluating the current burden of DM. Over the past few decades the prevalence of DM has risen significantly in nearly all countries and may be considered as a growing epidemic. Urbanization and income status are major factors which influence current rates in the prevalence studies introducing interesting differences between several population groups. Having recognized the global burden of DM, we now realize the urgent need for effective interventions. In order to monitor the public-health strategies and design effective future interventions we need reliable global estimates regarding the prevalence of DM.",Current vascular pharmacology,2020-,"Lovic D, Piperidou A, Zografou I, Grassos H, Pittaras A, Manolis A",6,1152,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
31057114,Microvascular Complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic, non communicable, multisystem disease that has reached epidemic proportions. Chronic exposure to hyperglycaemia affects the microvasculature, eventually leading to diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy with high impact on the quality of life and overall life expectancy. Sexual dysfunction is an often-overlooked microvascular complication of T2DM, with a complex pathogenesis originating from endothelial dysfunction. The purpose of this review is to present current definitions, epidemiological data and risk factors for diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and sexual dysfunction. We also describe the clinical and laboratory evaluation that is mandatory for the diagnosis of these conditions. A comprehensive review of the literature was performed to identify data from clinical studies for the prevalence, risk factors and diagnostic methods of microvascular complications of T2DM. Diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy affect approximately 25% of patients with T2DM; diabetic neuropathy is encountered in almost 50% of the diabetic population, while the prevalence of erectile dysfunction ranges from 35-90% in diabetic men. The duration of T2DM along with glycemic, blood pressure and lipid control are common risk factors for the development of these complications. Criteria for the diagnosis of these conditions are well established, but exclusion of other causes is mandatory. Early detection of microvascular complications associated with T2DM is important, as early intervention leads to better outcomes.

37839502,β-cell neogenesis: A rising star to rescue diabetes mellitus.,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM), a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose, is caused by various degrees of insulin resistance and dysfunctional insulin secretion, resulting in hyperglycemia. The loss and failure of functional β-cells are key mechanisms resulting in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of β-cell failure, and exploring approaches for β-cell neogenesis to reverse β-cell dysfunction may provide novel strategies for DM therapy. Emerging studies reveal that genetic susceptibility, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, oxidative stress, islet inflammation, and protein modification linked to multiple signaling pathways contribute to DM pathogenesis. Over the past few years, replenishing functional β-cell by β-cell neogenesis to restore the number and function of pancreatic β-cells has remarkably exhibited a promising therapeutic approach for DM therapy. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the underlying mechanisms of β-cell failure in DM, highlight the effective approaches for β-cell neogenesis, as well as discuss the current clinical and preclinical agents research advances of β-cell neogenesis.

Two SGLT2 inhibitors, namely bexagliflozin and velagliflozin, were recently FDA approved for the treatment of uncomplicated feline diabetes mellitus. These oral hypoglycemic agents are a suitable option for many newly diagnosed cats, with rapid improvements in glycemic control and clinical signs. Suitable candidates must have some residual β-cell function, as some endogenous insulin production is required to prevent ketosis.

36916961,Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Therapy as a new Treatment Option for Diabetes Mellitus.,"The worldwide increase in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus has raised the demand for new therapeutic strategies targeting diabetic symptoms and its chronic complications. Among different treatment options for diabetes, adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) therapy attract the most attention. The therapeutic effects of ADMSCs are based primarily on their paracrine release of immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and trophic factors. Animal models of diabetes as well as human clinical trials have shown that ADMSCs can effectively facilitate endogenous β cell regeneration, preserve residual β cell mass, reduce islet graft rejection, regulate the immune system, and ultimately improve insulin sensitivity or ameliorate insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Nevertheless, transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells is associated with certain risks; therefore recently much attention has been devoted to ADMSCs derivatives, such as exosomes or conditioned media, as therapeutic agents for the treatment of diabetes. Compared to ADMSCs, cell-free therapy has even better therapeutic potential. This narrative review summarizes recent outcomes and molecular mechanisms of ADMSCs action in the treatment for both type 1 DM and type 2 DM, as well as shows their feasibility, benefits, and current limitations.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2023-Jul,"Mikłosz A, Chabowski A",2,1322,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Millions of people across the world are affected by diabetes mellitus which has serious implications for their health. Over the past few decades, diabetes has become a major cause of mortality and morbidity across the world due to its rapid prevalence. Treatment for diabetes that focuses on insulin secretion and sensitization can lead to unwanted side effects and/or poor compliance, as well as treatment failure. A promising way to treat diabetes is through gene-editing technologies such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9). However, issues such as efficiency and off-target effects have hindered the use of these technologies. In this review, we summarize what we know today about CRISPR/Cas9 technology's therapeutic potential for treating diabetes.

32894314,The clinical consequences of heterogeneity within and between different diabetes types.,"Advances in molecular methods and the ability to share large population-based datasets are uncovering heterogeneity within diabetes types, and some commonalities between types. Within type 1 diabetes, endotypes have been discovered based on demographic (e.g. age at diagnosis, race/ethnicity), genetic, immunological, histopathological, metabolic and/or clinical course characteristics, with implications for disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis and treatment. In type 2 diabetes, the relative contributions of insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction are heterogeneous and relate to demographics, genetics and clinical characteristics, with substantial interaction from environmental exposures. Investigators have proposed approaches that vary from simple to complex in combining these data to identify type 2 diabetes clusters relevant to prognosis and treatment. Advances in pharmacogenetics and pharmacodynamics are also improving treatment. Monogenic diabetes is a prime example of how understanding heterogeneity within diabetes types can lead to precision medicine, since phenotype and treatment are affected by which gene is mutated. Heterogeneity also blurs the classic distinctions between diabetes types, and has led to the definition of additional categories, such as latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, type 1.5 diabetes and ketosis-prone diabetes. Furthermore, monogenic diabetes shares many features with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which make diagnosis difficult. These challenges to the current classification framework in adult and paediatric diabetes require new approaches. The 'palette model' and the 'threshold hypothesis' can be combined to help explain the heterogeneity within and between diabetes types. Leveraging such approaches for therapeutic benefit will be an important next step for precision medicine in diabetes.

Its pathogenesis is not fully understood, but there are indications that dysbiosis can play a role in the development of diabetes, or that it appears during the course of the disease. Changes in microbiota composition are observed in both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. These modifications are associated with pro-inflammation, increased intestinal permeability, endotoxemia, impaired β-cell function and development of insulin resistance.

38512073,"Diabetes: a review of its pathophysiology, and advanced methods of mitigation.","Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a long-lasting metabolic non-communicable disease often characterized by an increase in the level of glucose in the blood or hyperglycemia. Approximately, 415 million people between the ages of 20 and 79 years had DM in 2015 and this figure will rise by 200 million by 2040. In a study conducted by CARRS, it's been found that in Delhi the prevalence of diabetes is around 27% and for prediabetic cases, it is more than 46%. The disease DM can be both short-term and long-term and is often associated with one or more diseases like cardiovascular disease, liver disorder, or kidney malfunction. Early identification of diabetes may help avoid catastrophic repercussions because untreated DM can result in serious complications. Diabetes' primary symptoms are persistently high blood glucose levels, frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. Therefore, DM is classified into four major categories, namely, Type 1, Type 2, Gestational diabetes, and secondary diabetes. There are various oral and injectable formulations available in the market like insulin, biguanides, sulphonylureas, etc. for the treatment of DM. Recent attention can be given to the various nano approaches undertaken for the treatment, diagnosis, and management of diabetes mellitus. Various nanoparticles like Gold Nanoparticles, carbon nanomaterials, and metallic nanoparticles are some of the approaches mentioned in this review. Besides nanotechnology, artificial intelligence (AI) has also found its application in diabetes care. AI can be used for screening the disease, helping in decision-making, predictive population-level risk stratification, and patient self-management tools. Early detection and diagnosis of diabetes also help the patient avoid expensive treatments later in their life with the help of IoT (internet of medical things) and machine learning models.

The pre-diabetic phase of the disease is called tropical chronic pancreatitis (TCP). Currently FCPD is classified as a secondary form of diabetes called pancreatic diabetes, because essentially the disease is caused by pancreatic damage. There is an overlap of these subjects with idiopathic, non-alcoholic pancreatitis. This review will cover the etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and management of this clinical condition. FCPD could lead to endocrine dysfunction (diabetes and its complications) as well as exocrine dysfunction, and is associated with a higher risk of pancreatic cancer, for which early detection is important.",Journal of diabetes and its complications,2021-Jan,"Kumaran S, Unnikrishnan AG",2,798,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37644750,Types of Nursing Intervention on Improving Quality of Life among Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review.,"Long-term treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is considered a major factor causing disease complications. DM complications mostly impact the patient's quality of life (QoL). Only a few studies have been conducted summarizing the types of nursing interventions for improving the QoL of DM patients. The objective of this study is to explore the types of nursing interventions that can improve the QoL of DM patients. The online databases, including ScienceDirect, Medline, Google Search, and Pro-Quest, were used to search for the relevant articles. Articles that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed, and their level of evidence was determined and synthesized. A total of 30 articles defining the types of nursing intervention on improving the QoL of DM patients were discovered, comprising the five types of nursing interventions, such as health education (15 articles), exercise (8 articles), WhatsApp/short message service (WA/SMS) gateway (3 articles), blood glucose control (3 articles), and black garlic herbal therapy (1 article). Sequentially, the most common types of nursing interventions to improve the QoL of DM patients was health education, followed by exercise, WA/SMS gateway, and glucose control. A personal approach to health education is a significant point in improving the QoL of DM patients in the future. The findings of this study might not be strongly generalized, so further randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies with larger samples are needed.",Current diabetes reviews,2024-,"Alam AS, Samiasih A, Mubin MF, Pranata S, Dhamanik R",5,1492,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

There is an interplay of nongenetic and genetic components in pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications. There are several established genes such as ABCC8, TCF7L2, SLC2A2, and CAPN10 which are known to influence blood insulin and glucose levels. Current management of diabetes types may include lifetime burdensome use of insulin, insulin sensitizers, insulin secretagogues, etc. There has been increasing interest in improving genetic editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9 and using genetically edited stem cells to alter diabetes disease course or possibly cure it. Current research on microRNAs and long noncoding RNAs may provide insights into the pathways involved in development of diabetes and its complications. Consequently, developing further understanding of genetics and its messenger pathways in diabetes would enhance our ability to develop precise and accurate genetic editing tools which can translate into clinically useful therapeutics.",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,2023-,Shah P,1,1047,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38890775,Estimation of the direct health and indirect societal costs of diabetes in the UK using a cost of illness model.,"The direct cost of diabetes to the UK health system was estimated at around £10 billion in 2012. This analysis updates that estimate using more recent and accurate data sources. A pragmatic review of relevant data sources for UK nations was conducted, including population-level data sets and published literature, to generate estimates of costs separately for Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes. A comprehensive cost framework, developed in collaboration with experts, was used to create a population-based cost of illness model. The key driver of the analysis was prevalence of diabetes and its complications. Estimates were made of the excess costs of diagnosis, treatment and diabetes-related complications compared with the general UK population. Estimates of the indirect costs of diabetes focused on productivity losses due to absenteeism and premature mortality. The direct costs of diabetes in 2021/22 for the UK were estimated at £10.7 billion, of which just over 40% related to diagnosis and treatment, with the rest relating to the excess costs of complications. Indirect costs were estimated at £3.3 billion. Diabetes remains a considerable cost burden in the UK, and the majority of those costs are still spent on potentially preventable complications. Although rates of some complications are reducing, prevalence continues to increase and effective approaches to primary and secondary prevention continue to be needed. Improvements in data capture, data quality and reporting, and further research on the human and financial implications of increasing incidence of Type 2 diabetes in younger people are recommended.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2024-Sep,"Hex N, MacDonald R, Pocock J, Uzdzinska B, Taylor M, Atkin M, Wild SH, Beba H, Jones R",9,1636,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

DM is one of the fastest growing challenges to global health in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and places a tremendous burden on affected individuals and their families and countries. Although insulin and antidiabetic drugs have been used to treat DM, a radical cure for the disease is unavailable. The pathogenesis of DM remains unclear. Emerging roles of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in DM have become a subject of global research. CircRNAs have been verified to participate in the onset and progression of DM, implying their potential roles as novel biomarkers and treatment tools. In the present review, we briefly introduce the characteristics of circRNAs.

39084095,Diabetes and male fertility disorders.,"Couple infertility is a common condition, defined as being unable to conceive after 12 months of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. Male Factor Infertility (MFI) is responsible, alone or in combination with female factors, for about half of the overall cases of couple infertility. MFI is gradually increasing in prevalence, with a notable decline in semen parameters over the last decades. The aetiologies behind the finding of decreasing sperm counts are difficult to pinpoint but might be due in part to increasing rates of overweight and obesity in men of childbearing age. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common and chronic metabolic disease, whose prevalence is also gradually increasing, rising up to 10% of the population. The International Diabetes Federation estimates that there are currently more than 500 million people living with DM worldwide, the vast majority of whom suffering from type 2 DM (T2DM). There is growing awareness of the relationship between unhealthy lifestyle, in particular unhealthy diet, and MFI. Starting from all these premises, the aim of this narrative review is to describe the current evidence on the link between DM and MFI, both in terms of DM as a cause of/a risk factor for MFI and of MFI as a possible predictive marker for T2DM. Finally, we will discuss the risk of DM as a consequence of the therapy of MFI or assisted reproductive techniques.",Molecular aspects of medicine,2024-Oct,"Graziani A, Scafa R, Grande G, Ferlin A",4,1393,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39461229,Prevalence and clinical implications of diabetes mellitus in autoimmune nodopathies: A systematic review.,"Autoimmune nodopathies comprise a newly-established subtype of immune-mediated peripheral neuropathies, characterized by circulating autoantibodies that target nodal-paranodal proteins, including contactin-1 (CNTN1), contactin-associated protein-1 (Caspr1), neurofascin-155 (NF155) and neurofascin-isoforms (NF140 and NF186). Emerging evidence suggests that diabetes mellitus (DM) may confer increased risk for autoimmune nodopathies. A systematic search was performed including studies reporting on patients harboring nodal/paranodal antibodies (CNTN1, Caspr1, NF155, NF140 and NF186). We sought to evaluate: (1) the prevalence of DM among patients with autoimmune nodopathies; (2) the phenotype of DM-patients harboring different types of nodal/paranodal antibodies; (3) clinical features that allow distinction of autoimmune nodopathies from diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Five cohort studies, 3 case-reports and one case-series study were identified comprising 114 patients with autoimmune nodopathies. DM prevalence was documented to range between 10.5 % and 60 %. DM-patients harbored mostly paranodal antibodies; CNTN1: 58.3 %, followed by pan-neurofascin: 33.3 %, and Caspr1: 25 % antibodies. No significant differences in clinical phenotype were uncovered between DM-patients and their non-DM counterparts. Overall, DM patients were refractory to intravenous-immunoglobulins (IVIG), but responded well to escalation immunotherapies. Compared to DPN, distinctive features of autoimmune nodopathy comprised: (i) severe ataxia, tremor, and cranial nerve involvement; (ii) neurophysiological findings indicative of nodal-paranodal pathology, including (reversible) conduction failure and conduction velocity slowing, often accompanied by reduced compound muscle and sensory nerve action potentials; and (iii) marked protein-elevation or albuminocytological dissociation in cerebrospinal fluid analysis. DM patients fall under the typical clinical phenotype of autoimmune nodopathy, displaying predominantly paranodal antibodies.

37449742,Chronic Venous Disease and Its Intersections With Diabetes Mellitus.,"Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a vascular disorder in which blood return is severely compromised and CVD is usually characterized by venous hypertension. Along with obesity and diabetes mellitus, CVD is one of the most common civilization diseases. In general, the estimated prevalence of CVD ranges from 60-80 %. Early diagnosis and adequate treatment are important for preventing progression to more severe stages of the disease like venous leg ulcers. Clinical manifestations of CVD in initial stages of the disease are often asymptomatic. However, as CVD progresses, symptoms begin to develop. Treatment of CVD could be divided into conservative and surgical. Conservative therapy consists of compression, pharmacological treatment and lifestyle change. In cases where conservative therapy is ineffective, surgical or endovascular treatment may be required. The intersections between diabetes mellitus (DM) and CVD are not to be underestimated. CVD and DM have often the same risk factors. Symptoms of CVD can be modified by late complications of DM, but the incidence of different CVD degrees seems to be the same as in diabetics as in non-diabetics population. We are particularly concerned in diabetics about worse compliance with treatment due to their often-poorer adherence to treatment of DM and lifestyle changes. Moreover, there exist a higher risk of CVD and peripheral arterial disease in diabetics patients. Patients with CVD should always be inspected for the presence of DM, considering its presence can have a bearing on CVD symptoms, diagnostic procedures, and therapeutic strategies.",Physiological research,2023-Jul,"Jarošíková R, Roztočil K, Husáková J, Dubský M, Bém R, Wosková V, Fejfarová V",7,1605,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33175668,The interrelationship between diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial disease.,"<b></b>This systematic review examined the interrelationship between concomitant diabetes mellitus (DM) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The objective was to determine differences in the prevalence as well as in the outcomes in diabetic vs. non-diabetic PAD patients. The current review followed a study protocol that was published online in German in 2017. The search included societal practice guidelines, consensus statements, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and observational studies published from 2007 to 2020 reporting symptomatic PAD and concomitant DM in patients undergoing invasive open-surgical and endovascular revascularizations. German and English literature has been considered. Eligibility criteria were verified by three independent reviewers. Disagreement was resolved by discussion involving a fourth reviewer. 580 articles were identified. After exclusion of non-eligible studies, 61 papers from 30 countries remained, respectively 850,072 patients. The included studies showed that PAD prevalence differed between diabetic vs. non-diabetic populations (20-50% vs. 10-26%), and further by age, gender, ethnicity, duration of existing diabetes, and geographic region. The included studies revealed worse outcomes regarding perioperative complications, amputation rate, and mortality rate in diabetic patients when compared to non-diabetic patients. In both groups, the amputation rates decreased during the research period. This review emphasizes an interrelationship between PAD and DM. To improve the outcomes, early detection of PAD in diabetic patients, and vice versa, should be recommended.

38732253,Pathophysiology and Advances in the Therapy of Cardiomyopathy in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is known as the first non-communicable global epidemic. It is estimated that 537 million people have DM, but the condition has been properly diagnosed in less than half of these patients. Despite numerous preventive measures, the number of DM cases is steadily increasing. The state of chronic hyperglycaemia in the body leads to numerous complications, including diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). A number of pathophysiological mechanisms are behind the development and progression of cardiomyopathy, including increased oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, increased synthesis of advanced glycation products and overexpression of the biosynthetic pathway of certain compounds, such as hexosamine. There is extensive research on the treatment of DCM, and there are a number of therapies that can stop the development of this complication. Among the compounds used to treat DCM are antiglycaemic drugs, hypoglycaemic drugs and drugs used to treat myocardial failure. An important element in combating DCM that should be kept in mind is a healthy lifestyle-a well-balanced diet and physical activity. There is also a group of compounds-including coenzyme Q10, antioxidants and modulators of signalling pathways and inflammatory processes, among others-that are being researched continuously, and their introduction into routine therapies is likely to result in greater control and more effective treatment of DM in the future.

This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the emerging roles of MVs in the pathogenesis of diabetes and associated complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, cardiomyopathy, and neuropathy. MVs, through their cargo of proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and miRNAs, regulate critical processes like inflammation, oxidative stress, immune responses, and tissue remodeling, all of which contribute to the progression of diabetes and its complications. We examine the molecular mechanisms underlying MVs' involvement in these pathological processes and discuss their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic tools, particularly for drug delivery. Despite promising evidence, challenges remain in isolating and characterizing MVs, understanding their molecular mechanisms, and validating them for clinical use. Advanced techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomics are required to gain deeper insights.

On the one hand, diabetes mellitus is considered one of the most important risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19. Several factors that are often present in diabetes mellitus are likely to contribute to this risk, such as older age, a proinflammatory and hypercoagulable state, hyperglycemia and underlying comorbidities (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and obesity). On the other hand, a severe COVID-19 infection, and its treatment with steroids, can have a specific negative impact on diabetes itself, leading to worsening of hyperglycemia through increased insulin resistance and reduced β-cell secretory function. Worsening hyperglycemia can, in turn, adversely affect the course of COVID-19.

To this end, several monogenetic mutations in the beta cells have been linked with neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), however, the list of suspect genes is expansive, necessitating an update. This study, therefore, provides an update on NDM candidate genes and pathophysiology. Reputable online academic databases were searched for relevant information, which led to the identification of 43 genes whose mutations are linked to the condition. Of the linked genes, mutations in the KCNJ11, ABCC8, and INS genes as well as the genes on 6q24 chromosomal region are the most frequently implicated. Mutations in these genes can cause pancreatic agenesis and developmental errors, resulting in NDM in the first six to twelve months of birth. The clinical presentations of NDM include frequent urination, rapid breathing, and dehydration, among others.

39316333,"Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diabetes mellitus.","Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment, offering hope for patients with various malignancies. However, along with their remarkable anticancer effects, ICIs can also trigger immune-related adverse events (irAEs). One such noteworthy complication is the development of Diabetes Mellitus (DM), which particularly resembles Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). The aim of this review is to provide insights into the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic issues, and treatment considerations of ICI-induced DM (ICI-DM), emphasizing the importance of early recognition and management to mitigate adverse outcomes. Although still rare, the incidence has increased with the widespread use of ICIs, especially PD-1/PD-L1 blockers (from 0.2% to 1.9%). Factors affecting the development of ICI-DM, such as specific ICIs, patient demographics, and genetic predispositions, are discussed. The complex interplay between immune dysregulation and pancreatic β-cell destruction contributes to diagnostic challenges, with presentations varying from asymptomatic hyperglycemia to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Management strategies prioritize meticulous glycemic and electrolyte regulation along with tailored intravenous insulin therapy in cases of DKA. DM remission is rare, therefore treatment with both long-acting insulin at bedtime and short-acting insulin before meals is needed in longterm. Total daily insulin requirements can be estimated at 0.3-0.4 units/kg/day for most patients as a starting dose.",Endocrine,2025-Mar,"Kani ER, Karaviti E, Karaviti D, Gerontiti E, Paschou IA, Saltiki K, Stefanaki K, Psaltopoulou T, Paschou SA",9,1524,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33789298,Post-Transplantation Diabetes Mellitus in Pediatric Patients.,"More than 80% of pediatric solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients now survive into young adulthood and many encounter transplant-related complications. Post-transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM), sometimes also referred to as post-transplant diabetes or new onset diabetes after transplant, occurs in 3-20% of pediatric SOT recipients depending upon the organ transplanted, age at transplantation, immunosuppressive regimen, family history, and time elapsed since transplant. To diagnose PTDM, hyperglycemia must persist beyond the initial hospitalization for transplantation when a patient is on stable doses of immunosuppressive medications. Though standard diagnostic criteria used by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) to diagnose diabetes are employed, clinicians need to be aware of the limitations of using these criteria in this unique patient population. Management of PTDM parallels strategies used for type 2 diabetes (T2D), while also carefully considering comorbidities and potential interactions with immunosuppressive medications in these patients. In caring for patients with PTDM, it is important to be familiar with these interactions and comorbidities in order to coordinate care with the transplant team and optimize outcomes for these patients.",Hormone research in paediatrics,2020-,"Grundman JB, Wolfsdorf JI, Marks BE",3,1274,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34462631,Diabetes Mellitus Prediction and Severity Level Estimation Using OWDANN Algorithm.,"Today, diabetes is one of the most prevalent, chronic, and deadly diseases in the world owing to some complications. If accurate early diagnosis is feasible, the risk factor and incidence of diabetes may be greatly decreased. Diabetes prediction is stable and reliable, since there are only minimal labelling evidence and outliers found in the datasets of diabetes. Numerous works coped with diabetes disease prediction and provided the solution. But the existing methods proffered low accuracy detection and consumed more training time. So, this paper proposed an OWDANN algorithm for diabetes mellitus disease prediction and severity level estimation. The proposed system mainly consists of two phases, namely, disease prediction and severity level estimation phase. In the disease prediction phase, the preprocessing is performed for the Pima dataset. Then, the features are extracted from the preprocessed data, and finally, the classification step is performed by using OWDANN. In the severity level estimation phase, the diabetes positive dataset is preprocessed first. Then, the features are extracted, and lastly, the severity level is predicted using GDHC. The extensive experimental results showed that the proposed system outperforms with 98.97% accuracy, 94.98% sensitivity, 95.62% specificity, 97.02% precision, 93.84% recall, 9404% <i>f</i>-measure, 0.094% FDR, and 0.023% FPR compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",Computational intelligence and neuroscience,2021-,"R A, R N",2,1434,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35775305,Feline Comorbidities: Clinical perspective on diabetes mellitus and pancreatitis.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common feline endocrine disorders. It has been shown by several studies that DM in cats frequently coexists with pancreatitis. It has not been definitively established what the exact pathogenetic association between DM and pancreatitis is in the cat. However, the association between these two conditions is most likely bidirectional, with DM predisposing cats to pancreatitis and vice versa. Diagnosis of pancreatitis in cats with DM is crucial because concurrent pancreatitis commonly leads to difficulties in the management of DM. When pancreatitis is associated with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), therapeutic management is even more challenging. This review focuses on the concurrent presence of DM or DKA and pancreatitis in cats, mainly focusing on their clinical management. Information provided in this review is based on feline-specific clinical research when available. In addition, comparative and human research, as well as clinical experience, has been used to enrich knowledge in areas where feline-specific research is not yet available.",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,2022-Jul,"Xenoulis PG, Fracassi F",2,1093,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39041707,The connections of sialic acids and diabetes mellitus: therapeutic or diagnostic value?,"Modulation of sialic acids is one of the important pathological consequences of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus with or without the micro- and macrovascular complications. However, the mechanistic, therapeutic and/or diagnostic implications of these observations are uncoordinated and possibly conflicting. This review critically analyses the scientific investigations connecting sialic acids with diabetes mellitus. Generally, variations in the levels and patterns of sialylation, fucosylation and galactosylation were predominant across various tissues and body systems of diabetic patients, but the immune system seemed to be most affected. These might be explored as a basis for differential diagnosis of various diabetic complications. Sialic acids are predominantly elevated in nearly all forms of diabetic conditions, particularly nephropathy and retinopathy, which suggests some diagnostic value but the mechanistic details were not unequivocal from the available data. The plausible mechanistic explanations for the elevated sialic acids are increased desialylation by sialidases, stimulation of hexosamine pathway and synthesis of acute phase proteins as well as oxidative stress. Additionally, sialic acids are also profoundly associated with glucose transport and insulin resistance in human-based studies while animal-based studies revealed that the increased desialylation of insulin receptors by sialidases, especially NEU1, might be the causal link. Interestingly, inhibition of the diabetes-associated NEU1 desialylation was beneficial in diabetes management and might be considered as a therapeutic target. It is hoped that the article will provide an informed basis for future research activities on the exploitation of sialic acids and glycobiology for therapeutic and/or diagnostic purposes against diabetes mellitus.",Glycobiology,2024-Jul,"Ibrahim MA, Isah MB, Inim MD, Abdullahi AD, Adamu A",5,1847,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Early post-transplant hyperglycemia (EPTH) and post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) are common following heart transplantation and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This review summarizes the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of EPTH and PTDM in cardiac transplant patients, incorporating findings from non-cardiac solid organ transplant studies where relevant due to limited heart-specific research. EPTH following heart transplantation is common yet understudied and is associated with the later development of PTDM. PTDM is associated with adverse outcomes including infection, renal dysfunction, microvascular disease, and an increased risk of re-transplantation and mortality. Risk factors for EPTH include the post-operative immunosuppression regimen, recipient and donor age, body mass index, infections, and chronic inflammation. Early insulin treatment is recommended for EPTH, whereas PTDM management is varied and includes lifestyle modification, anti-glycemic agents, and insulin. Given the emerging evidence on the transplant benefits associated with effective glucose control, and the cardioprotective potential of newer anti-glycemic agents, further focus on the management of EPTH and PTDM within heart transplant recipients is imperative.",Expert review of endocrinology & metabolism,2024-Mar,"Kuang W, Raven LM, Muir CA",3,1374,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

33082551,The trials and tribulations of determining HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets for diabetes mellitus.,"Glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) is considered the gold standard for predicting glycaemia-associated risks for the microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus over 5-10 years. The value of HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the care of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is unassailable, yet HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets remain contentious. Guidelines from diabetes care organizations recommend conflicting HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets - generally between 6.5% and 8%. However, all such organizations advocate for individualization of HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets, leaving both health-care providers and their patients confused about what HbA<sub>1c</sub> target is appropriate in an individual patient. In this Review, we outline the landmark T1DM and T2DM trials that informed the current guidelines, we discuss the evidence that drives individualized HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets, we examine the limitations of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and we consider alternatives for monitoring glycaemic control. Ultimately, in synthesizing this literature, we argue for an HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of <7% for most individuals, but emphasize the importance of helping patients determine their own personal goals and determinants of quality of life that are independent of a particular glycaemic target. We also recognize that as newer technologies and anti-hyperglycaemic therapies emerge, glycaemic targets will continue to evolve.",Nature reviews.

The burden of diabetes on older adults is significant due to the disease itself, its complications, and its treatments. This is compounded by geriatric syndromes such as frailty and cognitive dysfunction. Consequently, health and diabetes-related quality of life (QoL) are diminished.<b>Areas covered</b>: This article reviews the value of assessing QoL in providing patient-centered care and the associations between QoL measures and health outcomes. The determinants of QoL particular to diabetes and the older population are reviewed, including psychosocial, physical, and cognitive burdens of diabetes and aging and the impact of hypoglycemia on QoL. Strategies are described to alleviate these burdens and improve QoL, and barriers to multidisciplinary patient-centered care are discussed. QoL measurement instruments are reviewed.<b>Expert opinion</b>: The goals of treating diabetes and its complications should be considered carefully along with each patient's capacity to withstand the burdens of treatment. This capacity is reduced by socioeconomic, psychological, cognitive, and physical factors reduces this capacity.

Since it appears to have a similar pathophysiology as other microvascular complications of diabetes it can be considered to be the fourth chronic microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus. There is a three-fold increase in risk of periodontal disease among patients with diabetes mellitus. Periodontitis in diabetes is associated with increased myocardial infarctions, strokes and renal related complications, poor glycaemic control and an increase in the risk of dying of cardiorenal causes. However, treatment of periodontal disease has been demonstrated to improve glucose control and reduce inflammatory markers. Improvements in periodontal health among patients with diabetes mellitus can be achieved with better oral health education, oral examination in diabetic clinics during regular visits and annual dental examinations by qualified dentists. Dental treatments for periodontal infections include mechanical disruption of the pathogenic biofilm using scaling and planing, use of systemic antibiotics to treat refractory pathogens and specialized dental surgery in advanced disease.",JPMA.

The management of diabetes has been transformed with the recent development of newer anti-hyperglycemic agents that have demonstrated superior efficacy. However, the utility of these drugs extends beyond glycemic control to benefits for managing obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. Numerous cardiovascular and kidney outcomes trials of these drugs have played an instrumental role in shaping current guidelines for the management of diabetes and CVD. Older adults with diabetes are diverse in terms of their comorbidities, diabetic complications, and cognitive and functional status. Therefore, there is an unmet need for personalized management of diabetes and CVD in this population. In this review, we provide an overview of the epidemiological burden and management of diabetes and CVD in older adults.

32562358,Challenges in the diagnosis of diabetes type in pediatrics.,"The incidence of diabetes, both type 1 and type 2, is increasing. Health outcomes in pediatric diabetes are currently poor, with trends indicating that they are worsening. Minority racial/ethnic groups are disproportionately affected by suboptimal glucose control and have a higher risk of acute and chronic complications of diabetes. Correct clinical management starts with timely and accurate classification of diabetes, but in children this is becoming increasingly challenging due to high prevalence of obesity and shifting demographic composition. The growing obesity epidemic complicates classification by obesity's effects on diabetes. Since the prevalence and clinical characteristics of diabetes vary among racial/ethnic groups, migration between countries leads to changes in the distribution of diabetes types in a certain geographical area, challenging the clinician's ability to classify diabetes. These challenges must be addressed to correctly classify diabetes and establish an appropriate treatment strategy early in the course of disease for all. This may be the first step in improving diabetes outcomes across racial/ethnic groups. This review will discuss the pitfalls in the current diabetes classification scheme that is leading to increasing overlap between diabetes types and heterogeneity within each type.

Blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin A1c serve as traditional indicators of glucose monitoring. But now glycated albumin, fructosamine, and 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) have been gaining more attention. 1,5-AG is a chemically stable monosaccharide that exists in the human body. Its serum concentration remains stable when blood glucose levels are normal. However, it decreases when blood glucose exceeds the renal glucose threshold. Studies have shown that 1.5-AG reflects blood glucose changes in 1 to 2 weeks; therefore, decreased levels of serum 1,5-AG can serve as a clinical indicator of short-term blood glucose disturbances. Recent studies have shown that 1,5-AG can be used not only for the screening and managing of diabetes but also for predicting diabetes-related adverse events and islet β cell function in prediabetic patients. In addition, saliva 1,5-AG demonstrates potential value in the screening and diagnosis of diabetes.

However, the magnitude of the association between diabetes deterioration and pancreatic cancer has received little attention. We conducted a matched cohort study, nested within a population-based cohort of Australian women with diabetes. Women with unstable diabetes, defined as a change in medication after a 2-year period of stable medication use, were matched by birth year to those with stable diabetes, in a 1:4 ratio. We used flexible parametric survival models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We included 134,954 and 539,789 women in the unstable and stable diabetes cohorts, respectively (mean age 68 years). In total, 1,315 pancreatic cancers were diagnosed. Deterioration of stable diabetes was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer (HR 2.55; 95% CI 2.29-2.85). The risk was particularly high within the first year after diabetes deteriorated. HRs at 3 months, 6 months and 1 year were: 5.76 (95% CI 4.72-7.04); 4.56 (95% CI 3.81-5.46); and 3.33 (95% CI 2.86-3.89), respectively. The risk was no longer significantly different after 7 years. Deterioration in glycaemic control in people with previously stable diabetes may be an indicator of pancreatic cancer, suggesting investigations of the pancreas may be appropriate. The weaker longer-term (3-7 years) association between diabetes deterioration and pancreatic cancer may indicate that poor glycaemic control can be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer.",Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

Attempts at inhibiting protein function, using different techniques, are also discussed including direct and indirect interference with production as well as inhibition of protein function. Developing PAI-1 inhibitors represents an alternative approach to managing hypofibrinolysis by targeting the pathological abnormality rather than current practice that relies on profound inhibition of the cellular and/or acellular arms of coagulation, and which can be associated with increased bleeding events. The review offers up-to-date knowledge on the mechanisms of action of PAI-1 together with the role of altering protein function to improve hypofirbinolysis.

Biomedical research using diabetes-based model organisms and cellular cultures reports evidence of different activin A levels between diabetic and control groups. Activin A is highly conserved across species and universally expressed among disparate tissues. A systematic review of published literatures on human populations reveals association of plasma activin A levels with diabetic patients in some (7) but not in others (5) of the studies. With summarized data from publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWASs), a two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) analysis is conducted on the causality between the exposure and the outcome. Wald ratio estimates from single instruments are predominantly non-significant. In contrast to positive controls between diabetes and plasma cholesterol levels, inverse-variance-weighted (IVW), Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode MR methods all lead to no observed causal link between diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and plasma activin A levels. Unavailability of strong instruments prevents the reversal MR analysis of activin A on diabetes. In summary, further research is needed to confirm or deny the potential association between diabetes and plasma activin A, and to elucidate the temporal incidence of these traits in human populations.

Women with IADPSG-diagnosed GDM were 6.43 times (RR=6.43, 95% CI:3.45-11.96) more likely to develop T2DM in the future compared with controls. For GDM women, the cumulative incidence of T2DM was 12.1% (95% CI: 6.9%-17.3%), while the pooled cumulative incidence of T2DM was estimated to be 8% (95% CI: 5-11%) in studies with 1 to 5 years of follow-up and increased to 19% (95% CI: 3-34%) for studies with more than 5 years of follow-up. Women with IADPSG-diagnosed GDM had 3.69 times (RR=3.69, 95% CI:2.70-5.06) higher risk of developing pre-diabetes (including impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance) than controls. Meta-regression analysis showed that the study effect size was not significantly associated with study design, race, length of follow-up, and maternal age (P>0.05). Overall, the studies had a relatively low risk of bias. Women with IADPSG-diagnosed GDM have higher risk of developing T2DM and pre-diabetes. The risk of T2DM in GDM women are higher with longer follow-up duration. Our results highlight the importance of promoting postpartum screening and keeping health lifestyle as well as pharmacological interventions to delay/prevent the onset of T2DM/pre-diabetes in GDM women. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero, identifier (CRD42022314776).",Frontiers in endocrinology,2022-,"Juan J, Sun Y, Wei Y, Wang S, Song G, Yan J, Zhou P, Yang H",8,2366,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
31074371,A Comprehensive Review on Preclinical Diabetic Models.,"Preclinical experimental models historically play a critical role in the exploration and characterization of disease pathophysiology. Further, these in-vivo and in-vitro preclinical experiments help in target identification, evaluation of novel therapeutic agents and validation of treatments. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a multifaceted metabolic disorder of multidimensional aetiologies with the cardinal feature of chronic hyperglycemia. To avoid or minimize late complications of diabetes and related costs, primary prevention and early treatment are therefore necessary. Due to its chronic manifestations, new treatment strategies need to be developed, because of the limited effectiveness of the current therapies. The study included electronic databases such as Pubmed, Web of Science and Scopus. The datasets were searched for entries of studies up to June, 2018. A large number of in-vivo and in-vitro models have been presented for evaluating the mechanism of anti-hyperglycaemic effect of drugs in hormone-, chemically-, pathogen-induced animal models of diabetes mellitus. The advantages and limitations of each model have also been addressed in this review. This review encompasses the wide pathophysiological and molecular mechanisms associated with diabetes, particularly focusing on the challenges associated with the evaluation and predictive validation of these models as ideal animal models for preclinical assessments and discovering new drugs and therapeutic agents for translational application in humans. This review may further contribute to discover a novel drug to treat diabetes more efficaciously with minimum or no side effects. Furthermore, it also highlights ongoing research and considers the future perspectives in the field of diabetes.",Current diabetes reviews,2020-,"Shakya A, Chaudary SK, Garabadu D, Bhat HR, Kakoti BB, Ghosh SK",6,1767,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34019900,Overview of key molecular and pharmacological targets for diabetes and associated diseases.,"Diabetes epidemiological quantities are demonstrating one of the most important communities' health worries. The essential diabetic difficulties are including cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, inflammation, and retinopathy. Despite developments in glucose decreasing treatments and drugs, these diabetic complications are still ineffectively reversed or prohibited. Several signaling and molecular pathways are vital targets in the new therapies of diabetes. This review assesses the newest researches about the key molecules and signaling pathways as targets of molecular pharmacology in diabetes and diseases related to it for better treatment based on molecular sciences. The disease is not cured by current pharmacological strategies for type 2 diabetes. While several drug combinations are accessible that can efficiently modulate glycemia and mitigate long-term complications, these agents do not reverse pathogenesis, and in practice, they are not established to modify the patient's specific molecular profiling. Therapeutic companies have benefited from human genetics. Genome exploration, which is agnostic to the information that exists, has revealed tens of loci that impact glycemic modulation.

In addition to these physical health complications, people with diabetes are more likely to experience psychological issues such as guilt, distress and depression compared with the general population. These issues can negatively affect an individual's ability to effectively monitor and self-manage their condition; however, they are often an overlooked aspect of diabetes care.

37039964,Pre-transplant HbA1c and risk of diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation: a single center retrospective analysis.,"Post-transplant diabetes mellitus occurs in 10-40% of kidney transplant recipients and is associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Early identification of patients with a higher risk of developing diabetes could allow to take timely measures. However, no validated model exists to predict the risk of post-transplant diabetes mellitus. This retrospective study includes 267 adult patients who underwent kidney transplantation at the Antwerp University Hospital between January 2014 and August 2021. Post-transplant diabetes mellitus was diagnosed based on the American Diabetes Association definition at 3 months post-transplant. First, a logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors for post-transplant diabetes mellitus. Second, criteria to identify patients with a high risk (> 35%) of developing post-transplant diabetes mellitus at 3 months were established. At 3 months post-transplantation, 54 (20.2%) patients developed post-transplant diabetes mellitus. Univariable analysis showed that age, body mass index and HbA1c on the day of transplantation were associated with post-transplant diabetes mellitus. However, in a multivariable model with the same parameters, only HbA1c remained statistically significant. An absolute increase in HbA1c of 0.1% increases the odds for developing post-transplant diabetes mellitus by 28% (95% confidence interval 1.15-1.42). An HbA1c level ≥ 5.3% at transplantation, regardless of age or body mass index, is sufficient to identify patients with a post-transplant diabetes mellitus risk of ≥ 35% with a positive predictive value of 39% and a negative predictive value of 88%. The HbA1c value at transplantation was the strongest predictor for post-transplant diabetes mellitus at 3 months post-transplant. Furthermore, at least in our population, a pre-transplant HbA1c of ≥ 5.3% can be used as an easy tool to identify patients at high risk of early post-transplant diabetes mellitus.",Journal of nephrology,2023-Sep,"Laghrib Y, Massart A, de Fijter JW, Abramowicz D, De Block C, Hellemans R",6,1974,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32413571,Therapeutic approaches to diabetic cardiomyopathy: Targeting the antioxidant pathway.,"The global epidemic of cardiovascular disease continues unabated and remains the leading cause of death both in the US and worldwide. We hereby summarize the available therapies for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in diabetics. Clearly, the current approaches to diabetic heart disease often target the manifestations and certain mediators but not the specific pathways leading to myocardial injury, remodeling and dysfunction. Better understanding of the molecular events determining the evolution of diabetic cardiomyopathy will provide insight into the development of specific and targeted therapies. Recent studies largely increased our understanding of the role of enhanced inflammatory response, ROS production, as well as the contribution of Cyp-P450-epoxygenase-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET), Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), Heme Oxygenase (HO)-1 and 20-HETE in pathophysiology and therapy of cardiovascular disease. PGC-1α increases production of the HO-1 which has a major role in protecting the heart against oxidative stress, microcirculation and mitochondrial dysfunction. This review describes the potential drugs and their downstream targets, PGC-1α and HO-1, as major loci for developing therapeutic approaches beside diet and lifestyle modification for the treatment and prevention of heart disease associated with obesity and diabetes.",Prostaglandins & other lipid mediators,2020-Oct,"Arad M, Waldman M, Abraham NG, Hochhauser E",4,1408,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

34369715,Role of Heavy Metals in Diabetes: Mechanisms and Treatment Strategies.,"Toxic metals affecting metabolic pathways have a broad range in the ecosystem from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Because of constant contamination from waste and untreated chemical effluents, their emissions have risen significantly over the last few decades, quickly gaining attention due to their crucial role in the development of several metabolic disorders, notably diabetes mellitus. Cadmium and arsenic not only spread widely in our atmosphere but are also linked to a wide range of health hazards. These are primarily accumulated in the liver, kidney, and pancreas once they reach the human body, where they have deleterious effects on the metabolism of glucose and its association with other metabolic pathways, particularly glycolysis, glycogenesis, and gluconeogenesis, by altering and impairing the specific activity of major enzymes. Impairment of hepatic glucose homeostasis plays a crucial role in diabetes mellitus pathogenesis. Impaired liver and kidney functions, as well as decreased pancreatic and muscle function, also contribute significantly to elevated levels of blood glucose. Heavy metals have the potential to cause changes in the conformation in these enzymes. They also impair hormonal balance by destroying the pancreas and adrenal glands. Such metals often facilitate the development of reactive oxygen species and inhibit antioxidant defense mechanisms, with multiple organs subsequently damaged. This review briefly discusses the involvement of heavy metals in metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, the enzymes involved in this pathway, and glucose homeostasis.",Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression,2021-,"Javaid A, Akbar I, Javed H, Khan U, Iftikhar H, Zahra D, Rashid F, Ashfaq UA",8,1613,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35619303,Telemedicine for Diabetes Mellitus Management in Older Adults: A Systematic Review.,"Diabetes mellitus affects almost 20% of the world's population between 65 and 99 years old. The care for this disease urges a complex, multidisciplinary, and stepwise approach. Telemedicine has been evaluated, and clinical trials as well as systematic reviews have been performed, and most have shown the benefits of its use in DM management. However, as the prevalence of diabetes mellitus increases, as well as the population ages, considerations regarding access and compliance of older patients to such technologies arise. The study aimed to determine the efficacy of telemedicine medical consultations in comparison to standard face-to-face consultations. A systematic literature search to identify trials investigating the effect of telemedicine medical consultations in clinical-laboratory aspects of DM management was conducted. The search was carried out in electronic databases: Medline, EMBASE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the CENTRAL Cochrane. Two authors independently assessed the included studies using the proper bias assessment tool for each study design. In agreement with the eligibility criteria, three studies were included. In terms of the main outcome, HbA1c, only one out of three articles showed a significant difference between the groups, favoring patients in the telemedicine group. With respect to blood pressure, Sood A reported that the usual care group exhibited a greater improvement in systolic blood pressure with statistical differences. All other results displayed no significant statistical difference between the groups. Also, no statistical difference was found in most of the lipid profile results. Our review shows that teleconsultations do not provide a clear benefit to elderly people with diabetes, but they may be non-inferior.",Current diabetes reviews,2023-,"Tristão LS, Tavares G, Tustumi F, Bernardo WM, Duarte ML, Peccin MS, Dos Santos LR",7,1777,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Population-based cohorts of 528 children (7-18 years of age) with prevalent T2D, 1519 matched control children without diabetes and 778 children with T1D were identified from a clinical registry and linked to health care records to assess hospitalizations and reasons for hospitalizations using ICD-9CM and ICD-10CA codes. Children with T2D are more likely than their matched controls and children with T1D to be admitted to hospital in the year prior to diagnosis {RR 2.83 (1.77, 4.53) p < 0.0001 and 8.05 (4.05, 16.00) p < 0.0001, respectively}, in the first year post diagnosis {RR 3.19 (2.08, 4.89) p < 0.0001 and 3.04 (1.86, 4.98) p < 0.0001, respectively} and in the 5 year post diagnosis period {RR 1.99 (1.56, 2.53) p < 0.0001 and 1.91 (1.48, 2.46) p < 0.0001, respectively}. Mental illness was the most common cause for hospital admission in both children with T2D and their matched controls. This differs from children with T1D where endocrine causes constitute the most common reason for hospital admission. This analysis provides novel data on hospitalization rates and diagnoses in the increasing population of children with T2D.

Retrospective analysis of the clinical and genetic profile of 12 NDM patients. Eight patients presented with NDM before the age of 6 mo. Three other patients, including 2 siblings presented in later part of infancy. An additional patient was diagnosed at age 5 y with the same etiology as her infant sibling. Four patients had transient diabetes [TNDM:1 each with a mutation in KCNJ11 and INS gene, 2 with ABCC8 mutation], 7 had permanent diabetes [PNDM: 2 siblings with complete glucokinase deficiency, 2 siblings with thiamine responsive megaloblastic anemia (TRMA), 1 with Immune dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome and 2 with Wolcott Rallison syndrome, (WRS)]. Four patients had 5 novel mutations. Genetic etiology could not be established in 1 patient with features of insulin resistance. Poorly controlled blood glucose in the TRMA patient led to hyperglycemia-induced hemichorea-hemiballismus, a rare manifestation in children. The authors describe 5 novel mutations, in the EIF2AK3, ABCC8, and GCK genes, a homozygous mutation at the ABCC8 locus presenting as TNDM, an obscure phenotype of the GCK gene mutation, and hyperglycemia-induced hemichorea-hemiballismus in a patient with TRMA.

34040951,Health System Capacity and Access Barriers to Diagnosis and Treatment of CVD and Diabetes in Nepal.,"Universal access to essential medicines and routine diagnostics is required to combat the growing burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. Evaluating health systems and various access dimensions availability, affordability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality is crucial yet rarely performed, especially in low- and middle-income countries. To evaluate health system capacity and barriers in accessing diagnostics and essential medicines for CVD and diabetes in Nepal. We conducted a WHO/HAI nationally-representative survey in 45 health-facilities (public-sector: 11; private-sector: 34) in Nepal to collect availability and price data for 21 essential medicines for treating CVD and diabetes, during MayJuly 2017. Data for 13 routine diagnostics was obtained in 12 health facilities. Medicines were considered unaffordable if the lowest paid worker spends >1 days wage to purchase a monthly supply. To evaluate accessibility, we conducted facility exit interviews among 636 CVD patients. Accessibility (e.g., private-public health facility mix, travel to hospital/pharmacy) and acceptability (i.e. Nepals adoption of WHO Essential Medicine List, and patient medication adherence) were summarized using descriptive statistics, and we conducted a systematic review of relevant literature. We did not evaluate medicine quality. We found that mean availability of generic medicines is low (<50%) in both public and private sectors, and less than one-third medicines met WHOs availability target (80%). Mean (SD) availability of diagnostics was 73.1% (26.8%). Essential medicines appear locally unaffordable. On average, the lowest-paid worker would spend 1.03 (public-sector) and 1.26 (private-sector) days wages to purchase a monthly supply. For a person undergoing CVD secondary preventive-interventions in the private sector, the associated expenditure would be 7.511.2% of monthly household income. Exit-interviews suggest that a long/expensive commute to health-facilities and poor medicine affordability constrain access. This study highlights critical gaps in Nepals health system capacity to offer basic health services to CVD and diabetes patients, owing to low availability, poor affordability and accessibility of essential medicines and diagnostics. Research and policy initiatives are needed to ensure uninterrupted supply of affordable essential medicines and diagnostics.",Global heart,2021-May,"Sharma A, Kaplan WA, Satheesh G, Poudyal IP, Gyawali P, Neupane D, Bhandari PM, Malla M, Sapkota S, Mishra SR",10,2402,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Indeed, diabetic glomerulopathy is the predominant renal lesion in type 1 diabetes, although also tubular, interstitial and arteriolar lesions are present in the advanced stages of renal disease. In contrast, in type 2 diabetes renal lesions are heterogeneous, and a substantial number of type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic kidney disease have mild or absent glomerulopathy with tubulointerstitial and/or arteriolar abnormalities. In addition, a high prevalence of non-diabetic renal diseases, isolated or superimposed on classic diabetic nephropathy lesions have been reported in patients with type 2 diabetes, often reflecting the bias of selecting patients for unusual clinical presentations for renal biopsy. This review focuses on renal structural changes in type 2 diabetes, emphasizing the contribution of research kidney biopsy studies to the understanding of the pathogenesis of DKD and of the structural lesions responsible for the different clinical phenotypes. Also, kidney biopsies could provide relevant information in terms of renal prognosis, and help to understand the different responses to different therapies, especially SGLT2 inhibitors, thus allowing personalized medicine.",Journal of nephrology,2020-Oct,"Di Vincenzo A, Bettini S, Russo L, Mazzocut S, Mauer M, Fioretto P",6,1330,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This national study aimed to assess the prevalence and clinical aspects of diabetes mellitus in Lebanon with special focus on type 1 (T1DM). A national multistage, random household sample survey was conducted, using face-to-face interviews with 1 questionnaire per household. A total of 4500 households were selected from all areas based on a pre-existing sampling frame of the Lebanese population. The prevalence of previously diagnosed diabetes mellitus in the surveyed population of 17 832 persons (mean age ~36 years) was 7.95%. The prevalence of T1DM in particular was estimated at 0.1%, or almost 1% of all detected cases of diabetes mellitus. Most persons with diabetes mellitus reported obtaining their usual care from endocrinologists rather than primary healthcare physicians. Delayed performance of haemoglobin A1c test was reported in 25% of 1418 patients. Hypoglycaemic episodes recently occurred in 30% of patients; of whom, at least one third required medical attention, including hospital admission. Diagnosed complications were reported in 22% of cases, with retinopathy being the most common. Prevalence of T1DM in this population was lower than international estimates. Diabetes mellitus management appears to be deficient, based on delays in standard control testing, hypoglycaemic episodes and diabetes mellitus-related complications.

39106207,Monogenic Diabetes: A Comprehensive Overview and Therapeutic Management of Subtypes of Mody.,"Monogenic diabetes often occurs as a result of single-gene mutations. The illness is minimally affected by environmental and behavioral factors, and it constitutes around one to five percent of all cases of diabetes. Newborn diabetes mellitus (NDM) and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) are the predominant causes of monogenic diabetes, accounting for a larger proportion of cases, while syndromic diabetes represents a smaller percentage. MODY, a group of inherited non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus disorders, is quite common. However, it remains frequently misdiagnosed despite increasing public awareness. The condition is characterized by insulin resistance, the development of diabetes at a young age (before 25 years), mild high blood sugar levels, inheritance in an autosomal dominant pattern, and the preservation of natural insulin production. Currently, there are 14 distinct subtypes of MODY that have been identified. Each subtype possesses distinct characteristics in terms of their frequency, clinical symptoms, severity of diabetes, related complications, and response to medicinal interventions. Due to the clinical similarities, lack of awareness, and high expense of genetic testing, distinguishing between type I (T1D) and type II diabetes mellitus (T2D) can be challenging, resulting in misdiagnosis of this type of diabetes. As a consequence, a significant number of individuals are being deprived of adequate medical attention. Accurate diagnosis enables the utilization of novel therapeutic strategies and enhances the management of therapy in comparison to type II and type I diabetes. This article offers a concise overview of the clinical subtypes and characteristics of monogenic diabetes. Furthermore, this article discusses the various subtypes of MODY, as well as the process of diagnosing, managing, and treating the condition.

No significant association was found in those with T2DM. Similar findings were found for each component of microvascular diseases. There was a causal inverse association between lung function and risks of microvascular diseases in participants with T1DM, but not in those with T2DM.","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2024-Oct,"Zhou C, Ye Z, Zhang Y, He P, Liu M, Zhang Y, Yang S, Gan X, Nie J, Qin X",10,1775,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32650008,Pleiotropic effects of anti-diabetic drugs: A comprehensive review.,"Diabetes mellitus characterized by hyperglycaemia presents an array of comorbidities such as cardiovascular and renal failure, dyslipidemia, and cognitive impairments. Populations above the age of 60 are in an urgent need of effective therapies to deal with the complications associated with diabetes mellitus. Widely used anti-diabetic drugs have good safety profiles and multiple reports indicate their pleiotropic effects in diabetic patients or models. This review has been written with the objective of identifying the widely-marketed anti-diabetic drugs which can be efficiently repurposed for the treatment of other diseases or disorders. It is an updated, comprehensive review, describing the protective role of various classes of anti-diabetic drugs in mitigating the macro and micro vascular complications of diabetes mellitus, and differentiating these drugs on the basis of their mode of action. Notably, metformin, the anti-diabetic drug most commonly explored for cancer therapy, has also exhibited some antimicrobial effects. Unlike class specific effects, few instances of drug specific effects in managing cardiovascular complications have also been reported. A major drawback is that the pleiotropic effects of anti-diabetic drugs have been mostly investigated only in diabetic patients. Thus, for effective repurposing, more clinical trials devoted to analyse the effects of anti-diabetic drugs in patients irrespective of their diabetic condition, are required.",European journal of pharmacology,2020-Oct,"Nath M, Bhattacharjee K, Choudhury Y",3,1481,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38833191,Diabetes and Infectious Diseases with a Focus on Melioidosis.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) leads to impaired innate and adaptive immune responses. This renders individuals with DM highly susceptible to microbial infections such as COVID-19, tuberculosis and melioidosis. Melioidosis is a tropical disease caused by the bacterial pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei, where diabetes is consistently reported as the most significant risk factor associated with the disease. Type-2 diabetes is observed in 39% of melioidosis patients where the risk of infection is 13-fold higher than non-diabetic individuals. B. pseudomallei is found in the environment and is an opportunistic pathogen in humans, often exhibiting severe clinical manifestations in immunocompromised patients. The pathophysiology of diabetes significantly affects the host immune responses that play a critical role in fighting the infection, such as leukocyte and neutrophil impairment, macrophage and monocyte inhibition and natural killer cell dysfunction. These defects result in delayed recruitment as well as activation of immune cells to target the invading B. pseudomallei. This provides an advantage for the pathogen to survive and adapt within the immunocompromised diabetic patients. Nevertheless, knowledge gaps on diabetes-infectious disease comorbidity, in particular, melioidosis-diabetes comorbidity, need to be filled to fully understand the dysfunctional host immune responses and adaptation of the pathogen under diabetic conditions to guide therapeutic options.",Current microbiology,2024-Jun,"Uthaya Kumar A, Ahmad Zan M, Ng CL, Chieng S, Nathan S",5,1476,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34261386,Experts' opinion on the detection and management of prediabetes in Lebanon.,"Given that the complications of type 2 diabetes can start at an early stage, early detection and appropriate management of prediabetes are essential. We aimed to develop an expert opinion on prediabetes in Lebanon to pave the way for national guidelines tailored for the Lebanese population in the near future. A panel of seven diabetes experts conducted a thorough literature review and discussed their opinions and experiences before coming up with a set of preliminary recommendations for the detection and management of prediabetes in Lebanon. Lebanese physicians employ multiple tests for the diagnosis of prediabetes and no national cut-off values exist. The panel agreed that prediabetes screening should be focused on patients exceeding 45 years of age with otherwise no risk factors and on adults with risk factors. The panel reached that fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c should be used for prediabetes diagnosis in Lebanon. FPG values of 100-125 mg/dL or HbA1c values of 5.7%-6.4% were agreed upon as indicative of prediabetes. For the management of prediabetes, a three-step approach constituting lifestyle modifications, pharmacological treatment and bariatric surgery is recommended. There should be more focus on research on prediabetes in Lebanon. This preliminary report will be further discussed with the Lebanese Society of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Lipids in 2021 in order to come up with the first Lebanese national guidelines for the detection and management of prediabetes in Lebanon.",Science progress,2021-,"Andari E, Atallah P, Azar S, Echtay A, Jambart S, Saab C, Howlett HC, Al-Naqshbandi M",8,1514,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33232247,Deep Learning for Diabetes: A Systematic Review.,"Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects an estimated 463 million people worldwide. Aiming to improve the treatment of people with diabetes, digital health has been widely adopted in recent years and generated a huge amount of data that could be used for further management of this chronic disease. Taking advantage of this, approaches that use artificial intelligence and specifically deep learning, an emerging type of machine learning, have been widely adopted with promising results. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the applications of deep learning within the field of diabetes. We conducted a systematic literature search and identified three main areas that use this approach: diagnosis of diabetes, glucose management, and diagnosis of diabetes-related complications. The search resulted in the selection of 40 original research articles, of which we have summarized the key information about the employed learning models, development process, main outcomes, and baseline methods for performance evaluation. Among the analyzed literature, it is to be noted that various deep learning techniques and frameworks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many diabetes-related tasks by outperforming conventional machine learning approaches. Meanwhile, we identify some limitations in the current literature, such as a lack of data availability and model interpretability. The rapid developments in deep learning and the increase in available data offer the possibility to meet these challenges in the near future and allow the widespread deployment of this technology in clinical settings.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2021-Jul,"Zhu T, Li K, Herrero P, Georgiou P",4,1632,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32341338,Use and abuse of dietary supplements in persons with diabetes.,"The dietary supplement industry has estimated sales of over $30 billion in the US and over $100 billion globally. Many consumers believe that dietary supplements are safer and possibly more effective than drugs to treat diabetes. The sheer volume of the literature in this space makes compiling them into one review challenging, so much so that primarily narrative reviews currently exist. By applying the interactive database supplied by the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health, we identified the top 100 ingredients that appeared most often in dietary supplement products. One-hundred different keyword searches using the ingredient name and the word diabetes were performed using a program developed to automatically scrape PubMed. Each search was retained in a separate Excel spreadsheet, which was then reviewed for inclusion or exclusion. The studies that met the inclusion criteria were evaluated for effect of reducing and controlling diabetes. The PubMed scrape resulted in 6217 studies. For each keyword search only the most recent 100 were retained, which refined the total to 1823 studies. Of these 425 met the screening criteria. The ingredients, fiber, selenium and zinc had the most studies associated with improvement in diabetes. Several popular supplement ingredients (phosphorus, pantothenic acid, calcium, magnesium, glutamine, isoleucine, tyrosine, choline, and creatine monohydrate) did not result in any studies meeting our screening criteria. Our study demonstrates how to automate reviews to filter and collapse literature in content areas that have an enormous volume of studies.

32903709,The Challenges in the Development of Diabetes Prevention and Care Models in Low-Income Settings.,"In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the burden of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes is rapidly rising, overpassing the existing burden of communicable diseases. Patients with diabetes living in low-income communities face unique challenges related to lack of awareness, difficulty in accessing health care systems and medications, and consequently failure in achieving optimal diabetes management and preventing complications. Effective diabetes prevention and care models could help reduce the rising burden by standardizing guidelines for prevention and management, improving access to care, engaging community and peers, improving the training of professionals and patients and using the newest technology in the management of the disease. In this article, we review the latest research and evidence on effective models of diabetes prevention and diabetes care delivery in low- income settings. We also provide existing evidence relating to the effectiveness of these models in low-resource contexts, with the aim to highlight characteristics and strengths that make their implementation successful and long-lasting.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2020-,"Karachaliou F, Simatos G, Simatou A",3,1137,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38642828,Virus-induced diabetes mellitus: revisiting infection etiology in light of SARS-CoV-2.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is comprised of two predominant subtypes: type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), accounting for approximately 5 % of cases worldwide and resulting from autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β-cells, and type 2 (T2DM), accounting for approximately 95 % of cases globally and characterized by the inability of pancreatic β-cells to meet the demand for insulin due to a relative β-cell deficit in the setting of peripheral insulin resistance. Both types of DM involve derangement of glucose metabolism and are metabolic diseases generally considered to be initiated by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Viruses have been reported to play a role as infectious etiological factors in the initiation of both types of DM in predisposed individuals. Among the reported viral infections causing DM in humans, the most studied include coxsackie B virus, cytomegalovirus and hepatitis C virus. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the diabetogenic potential of SARS-CoV-2, rekindling interest in the field of virus-induced diabetes (VID).

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis is aimed at determining the pooled national percentage of diabetic self-care practice and its determinants among adult diabetic patients in Ethiopian. Different electronic databases including PubMed/Medline and search engines such as Google scholar were used to retrieve published studies. The Joanna Briggs Institute quality appraisal checklists were used to appraise the quality of studies. Data were extracted using excel spreadsheets and analyses were done by STATA 14. Heterogeneity among studies was diagnosed using the I<sup>2</sup> test. The DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was employed for substantial heterogeneity (I2 > 50%). The pooled estimate of diabetic self-care and odds ratio was reported based on the 95% CI. A total of 3861 studies were identified, of which only 19 studies have reached the final qualitative synthesis and quantitative analysis. Well over half of the Ethiopian diabetic patients have good self-care 54.04% (47.07-61.01, I<sup>2</sup> = 97.3, P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis by region showed that the highest pooled estimate was observed in Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples 81.96% (71.85-92.04), I<sup>2</sup> = 89.1, p < 0.002), whereas the lowest was from the Harari region 44.53% (32.16-56.89%) I<sup>2</sup> = 94%, p < 0.001). Being knowledgeable about diabetes Mellitus 2.69 (1.62, 4.46; I2 = 99%, p < 0.001), having good social support 2.25 (1.49-3.39; I<sup>2</sup> = 99%, p = 0.00), owning private glucometer 3.04(1.64, 5.65; I<sup>2</sup> = 97.4, P < 0.001), and being urban residents 3.26 (2.24, 4.74; I<sup>2</sup> = 96.3%, P < 0.001) promote diabetic victims to apply self-care practice. Despite the life-threatening complications of diabetes Mellitus, the percentage of patients applying self-care has remained low in Ethiopia, depicting the high proportion of diabetic patients are prone to develop long and short-term sequelae of diabetes Mellitus. Therefore, improving the client's awareness about the disease and counseling clients about the significance of social support are believed to be possible strategies to improve self-care practice and policymakers are strongly recommended to combat complications to attain sustainable development goal 3.4 Aims to reduce premature death.

It affects more than 463 million people worldwide and is expected to reach 700 million by 2045. In the Southeast Asian region, the prevalence of DM has tripled to 115 million due to rapid urbanization, unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyles, and genetic factors. In Nepal, a developing country, DM affects 8.5% of adults, with an alarming increase in recent years. Lack of diabetes education and limited populational adoption of behavioural changes further hamper care. In the present study, we performed a scoping review to determine the status of awareness, attitudes, and knowledge about diabetes in the Nepalese population with a focus on the educational initiatives that have been implemented. We also conducted a two-week international case study discussion among medical students to brainstorm viable intervention strategies. Our findings indicate that limited data is available on the level of education or initiatives to improve knowledge and practice among healthcare professionals and community members. Targeted studies of people with diabetes also present heterogeneous results due to differences in the sample population, geographic location, education, age, and gender. Accordingly, we propose five interrelated education-based strategies that leverage existing networks to expand community outreach and engagement, improve system resilience, and improve health outcomes. Effective education for healthcare professionals, community, and patients with diabetes is vital in improving diabetes outcomes in Nepal and South Asia.

Patients with diabetes exhibit an increased risk to develop heart failure and the presence of both comorbidities has a major impact on the prognosis of these patients. Thus, it is of utmost importance to detect heart failure in patients with diabetes and to screen all patients with heart failure for the presence of diabetes. Moreover, the diagnosis of heart failure in diabetes often requires an adjustment of medical therapy.

It currently finds itself in a state of taxonomic dereliction and requires a long overdue refurbishment. Correct conceptualisation is a key precondition for knowledge development in this disorder. This article lays out the epistemological foundation for diabetes of the exocrine pancreas (DEP) and presents a synthesis of the current interdisciplinary discourse on diagnosing and classifying DEP. A diagnosis of DEP in people with no medical records of pre-existing diabetes is generally based on the most up-to-date biochemical criteria endorsed by the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes. The presence of exocrine pancreatic dysfunction is not considered a mandatory diagnostic criterion for DEP but is rather a significant risk factor for developing DEP. DEP principally comprises post-pancreatitis diabetes mellitus, pancreatic cancer-related diabetes, and cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, which are mutually exclusive with autoimmune diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Other exclusions and stipulations apply. The DEP criteria will be instrumental in aiding optimal design and conduct of clinical studies, uniform collection of health utilisation data, meaningful comparison of scientific findings across countries, and clear communication among stakeholders (healthcare providers, patients, medical regulatory authorities, pharmaceutical industry).",European journal of endocrinology,2021-Apr,"Petrov MS, Basina M",2,1531,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
31490762,Dietary Phytonutrients in the Prevention of Diabetes-related Complications.,"The increasing prevalence of reported cases of diabetes has evidently become a major global public health concern. Although diabetes management is possible by the administration of synthetic anti-diabetic agents, there are profound side-effects associated with their long-term usage. Hence there is a demand for safer alternatives which could be possibly formulated using specific yet common phytonutrients. The main objective of this review is to describe the cellular mechanisms of phytonutrients as an alternative to commercially available synthetic anti-diabetic agents in the management of diabetes and related complications. Furthermore, the clinical evidence that supports this view is also highlighted. An in-depth review of published literature was carried out to identify the most promising phytonutrients in the management of diabetes and related complications. A number of phytonutrients are reported to be potential anti-diabetic agents. Few examples include biguanides, resveratrol, lycopene, thymoquinone and quercetin. However, suitable formulations using these phytonutrients and their clinical trials are still underway. Most of the reported findings focus on one aspect of several biochemical processes e.g. enhancement of glucose utilization, antioxidation, induction of insulin production, antiglycation, etc. An in-depth study of phytonutrients with respect to functional, immunological as well as biochemical factors suggesting their efficacy, as well as safety in the management of diabetes, is rarely reported. Our study thus highlights the abundance of clinical evidence of the efficiency of phytonutrients, and at the same time, the scarcity of clinically approved and marketed phytonutrients, as drugs, for the management of diabetes and related complications.",Current diabetes reviews,2020-,"Jha P, Kumari S, Jobby R, Desai N, Ali A",5,1788,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

When diabetes is not well controlled, it can cause complications and affect health-related quality of life. Determining the burden of diabetes in elderly patients can provide a good health-related quality of life. The study was conducted to examine the relationship between diabetes burden and health-related quality of life in elderly patients with diabetes. This is a descriptive and correlational study of 207 patients who applied to the diabetes outpatient clinics of a private and a public hospital in Istanbul. Respondents were completed with ""Personal Information Form for Elderly People"", ""Elderly Diabetes Burden Scale"" and the ""Quality of Life in the Elderly Scale"". Data were analyzed by SPSS. The tests used are Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal Wallis and Spearman Correlation tests. The mean total score from the Elderly Diabetes Burden Scale was 47.13 ± 11.95 (18-88), and the mean score from the Quality of Life in the Elderly Scale was 19.36 ± 7.00.

37157933,Use of hospital care among Dutch diabetes patients.,"To provide insight into healthcare resource utilization and hospital expenditure of patients treated for diabetes in Dutch hospitals. We conducted an observational cohort study of 193 840 patients aged ≥18 years and treated for diabetes mellitus in 65 Dutch hospitals in 2019 to 2020, using real-world reimbursement data. Consultations, hospitalizations, technology use, total hospital and diabetes care costs (encompassing all care for diabetes itself) were assessed during 1-year follow-up. In addition, expenditure was compared with that in the general Dutch population. Total hospital costs for all patients with diabetes were €1 352 690 257 (1.35 billion) per year, and 15.9% (€214 963 703) was associated with treatment of diabetes. Mean yearly costs per patient were €6978, with diabetes care costs of €1109. Mean hospital costs of patients exceeded that of the Dutch population three- to sixfold. Total hospital costs increased with age, whereas diabetes expenditure decreased with age (18-40 years, €1575; >70 years, €932). Of all patients with diabetes, 51.3% (n = 99 457) received care related to cardiovascular complications. Micro- and macrovascular complications, or a combination, increased hospital costs (1.4-5.3 times higher). The hospital resource use of Dutch diabetes patients is high, with a large burden of cardiovascular complications. Resource use is rooted mainly in hospital care of diabetes-related complications, not in the treatment of diabetes. Early treatment and prevention of complications remain imperative to taper future healthcare expenditure on patients with diabetes.","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2023-Aug,"de Vries SAG, Bak JCG, Stangenberger VA, Wouters MWJM, Nieuwdorp M, Sas TCJ, Verheugt CL",7,1607,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
31797455,Behaviour change in diabetes: behavioural science advancements to support the use of theory.,"Behaviour is central to the management of diabetes, both for people living with diabetes and for healthcare professionals delivering evidence-based care. This review outlines the evolution of behavioural science and the application of theoretical models in diabetes care over the past 25 years. There has been a particular advancement in the development of tools and techniques to support researchers, healthcare professionals and policymakers in taking a theory-based approach, and to enhance the development, reporting and replication of successful interventions. Systematic guidance, theoretical frameworks and lists of behavioural techniques provide the tools to specify target behaviours, identify why ideal behaviours are not implemented, systematically develop theory-based interventions, describe intervention content using shared terminology, and evaluate their effects. Several examples from a range of diabetes-related behaviours (clinic attendance, self-monitoring of blood glucose, retinal screening, setting collaborative goals in diabetes) and populations (people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, healthcare professionals) illustrate the potential for these approaches to be widely translated into diabetes care. The behavioural science approaches outlined in this review give healthcare professionals, researchers and policymakers the tools to deliver care and design interventions with an evidence-based understanding of behaviour. The challenge for the next 25 years is to refine the tools to increase their use and advocate for the role of theoretical models and behavioural science in the commissioning, funding and delivery of diabetes care.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2020-Mar,"McSharry J, Byrne M, Casey B, Dinneen SF, Fredrix M, Hynes L, Lake AJ, Morrissey E",8,1662,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

In this review, some frequent mistakes in diabetes management are analyzed, focusing on factors such as medication management, blood glucose level monitoring, inadequate addressing of complications and comorbidities, lifestyle choices, patient education, and overall health counselling.",Primary care diabetes,2024-Dec,"Makrilakis K, Papachristoforou E",2,686,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38815594,Advancing diabetes surveillance ecosystems: a case study of India.,"Professional society and expert guidelines recommend the achievement of glycaemic, blood pressure, and cholesterol targets to prevent the microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes. The WHO Diabetes Compact recommends that countries meet and monitor these targets for diabetes management. Surveillance-ie, continuous, systematic measurement, analysis, and interpretation of data-is a crucial component of public health. In this Personal View, we use the case of India as an illustration of the challenges and future directions needed for a diabetes surveillance system that documents national progress and persistent gaps. To address the growing burdens of diabetes and cardiometabolic diseases, the Government of India has launched programmes such as the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases. Different surveys have provided estimates of the diabetes care continuum of awareness, treatment, and control at the national, state, and, very recently, district level. We reviewed the literature to analyse how these surveys have varied in both their data collection methods and the reported estimates of the diabetes care continuum. We propose an integrated surveillance and monitoring framework to augment decentralised decision making, leveraging the complementary strengths of different surveys and electronic health record databases, such as data obtained by the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases, and building on methodological advances in model-based small-area estimation and data fusion. Such a framework could aid state and district administrators in monitoring the progress of diabetes screening and management initiatives, and benchmarking against national and global standards in all countries.",The lancet.

We examined the presence of microvascular and macrovascular disease in individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes by glycemic status within 3 years before diagnosis. We identified 159 736 individuals with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink database in England between 2004 and 2017. We used logistic regression models to compare presence of microvascular (retinopathy and nephropathy) and macrovascular (acute coronary syndrome, cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial disease) disease at the time of type 2 diabetes diagnosis by prior glycemic status. Half of the study population (49.9%) had at least one vascular disease, over one-third (37.4%) had microvascular disease, and almost a quarter (23.5%) had a diagnosed macrovascular disease at the time of type 2 diabetes diagnosis.Compared with individuals with glycemic values within the normal range, those detected with pre-diabetes before the diagnosis had 76% and 14% increased odds of retinopathy and nephropathy (retinopathy: adjusted OR (AOR) 1.76, 95% CI 1.69 to 1.85; nephropathy: AOR 1.14, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.19), and 7% higher odds of the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.12) in fully adjusted models at time of diabetes diagnosis. Microvascular and macrovascular diseases are detected in 37%-24% of people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Pre-diabetes before diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is associated with increased odds of microvascular disease and acute coronary syndrome. Detection of pre-diabetes might represent an opportunity for reducing the burden of microvascular and macrovascular disease through heightened attention to screening for vascular complications.",BMJ open diabetes research & care,2020-Apr,"Palladino R, Tabak AG, Khunti K, Valabhji J, Majeed A, Millett C, Vamos EP",7,1888,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Prediabetes also predisposes to the development of macrovascular and to a lesser extent of microvascular complications of diabetes. In a large community-based epidemiological study, the Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB), data reported an overall prevalence of prediabetes of 10.3%, derived from 15 Indian states. This shows that the diabetes epidemic is far from over as many of them may soon convert to diabetes. Prediabetes, however, should not be considered a path to diabetes rather it should be a window of opportunity for the prevention of diabetes.

From 1998 to 2004, 159,755 adults from Mexico City were recruited to a prospective study, and from 2015 to 2019, 10,144 survivors were resurveyed. Diabetes was defined as self-reported diagnosis, glucose-lowering medication use, or HbA<sub>1c</sub> ≥6.5%. Controlled diabetes was defined as HbA<sub>1c</sub> <7%. Prevalence estimates were uniformly standardized for age, sex, and residential district. Cox models explored the relevance of controlled and inadequately controlled diabetes to cause-specific mortality. During 1998-2004 and 2015-2019, 99,623 and 8,986 participants were aged 45-84 years. Diabetes prevalence had increased from 26% in 1998-2004 to 35% by 2015-2019. Of those with diabetes, the proportion previously diagnosed had increased from 76% to 89%, and glucose-lowering medication use among them had increased from 80% to 94%. Median HbA<sub>1c</sub> among those with diabetes had decreased from 8.2% to 7.3%, and the proportion of participants with controlled diabetes had increased from 16% to 37%. Use of blood pressure-lowering medication among those with previously diagnosed diabetes had increased from 35% to 51%, and their use of lipid-lowering therapy had increased from 1% to 14%. The excess mortality risk associated with diabetes accounted for 34% of deaths at ages 35-74 years, of which 5% were attributable to controlled and 29% to inadequately controlled diabetes.

Among the 25 total and type 2 diabetes studies that reported the distribution of hospitalisations in broad categories, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) were the leading cause of admission in 19/25 (76%) of studies. Among the 19 studies that reported CVD admissions by subcategories, ischaemic or coronary heart disease was the leading subtype of CVD in 58% of studies. The other common causes of admissions were infections, renal disorders, endocrine, nutritional, metabolic and immunity disorders.

Enrollees attended a median of 18 sessions. Median retention was 38 weeks. Retention was associated with older age, greater initial weight loss, and physical activity. At both 1- and 2-years, body mass index, triglycerides, and HbA1c were significantly improved among enrollees. After adjusting for age group, sex, and race, the odds of developing diabetes based on HbA1c ≥6.5 % was 40 % lower at 1-year and 20 % lower at 2-years, and the odds of self-reported diabetes was 57 % lower at 1-year and 46 % lower at 2-years in enrollees compared to non-enrollees. Enrollees who disenrolled before completing the core curriculum had higher odds and enrollees who completed the NDPP had lower odds of developing diabetes that non-enrollees.

To properly control diabetes, the transtheoretical model (TTM) may be useful. This scoping review is aimed at identifying TTM interventions for diabetes. The study followed Arksey and O'Malley's six steps in conducting the scoping review. Four main databases (PubMed, Central, JSTOR, and ScienceDirect), Google Scholar, Google, and a reference list of identified articles were searched for literature. The study included peer-reviewed articles published online from 2000 to 2023 and published in the English language. At the end of the search, 3,514 entries were found in the four main databases, and 23 records were identified through Google, Google Scholar searches, and reference lists. After a thorough screening, 22 records were used for this review. The study found that the primary interventions based on the TTM for managing diabetes and prediabetes were educational materials to promote physical activity among diabetes and prediabetes individuals, health education, exercise, motivational interviews, self-tracking, and dietary changes. Further interventions on diabetes and prediabetes management could adopt the identified transtheoretical interventions to improve the health of their patients.",Journal of diabetes research,2024-,"Miezah D, Amoadu M, Opoku PN, Junior EM, Zutah J, Obeng P, Sarfo JO",7,1445,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33186216,Novel management of diabetes in kidney transplantation.,"Posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a prevalent complication in kidney transplant recipients, and has been associated with worse short-term and long-term outcomes. While hyperglycemia is frequently seen in the early posttransplant period because of surgical stress, infection, and use of high-dose steroids, the diagnosis of PTDM should be established after patients are clinically stable and on stable maintenance immunosuppression. In the early posttransplant period, hyperglycemia is typically treated with insulin, and pilot data have suggested potential benefit of lower vs. higher glycemic targets in this setting. Growing data indicate lifestyle modifications, including dietary interventions, physical activity, and mitigation of obesity, are associated with improved posttransplant outcomes. While there are limited data to support a first-line antidiabetic medication for PTDM, more established pharmacotherapies such as sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and dipetidyl peptidase IV inhibitors are commonly used. Given recent trials showing the benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists upon kidney outcomes in nontransplant patients, further study of these agents specifically in kidney transplant recipients are urgently needed. Increasing evidence supports a multidisciplinary approach, including lifestyle modification, obesity treatment, judicious immunosuppression selection, and careful utilization of novel antidiabetic therapies in PTDM patients.",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,2021-Jan,"Ong SC, Rhee CM",2,1524,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37226183,Exploring new insights in coronary lesion assessment and treatment in patients with diabetes mellitus: the impact of optical coherence tomography.,"In this review, we summarise new insights into diagnostic approaches and treatment strategies for coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Despite the improvements in therapy, the clinical management of DM patients remains challenging as they develop more extensive CAD at a younger age and consistently have worse clinical outcomes than non-DM patients. Current diagnostic modalities as well as revascularisation treatments mainly focus on ischemic lesions. However, the impact of plaque morphology and composition are emerging as strong predictors of adverse cardiac events even in the absence of identified ischemia. In particular, the presence of vulnerable plaques such as thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) lesions has been identified as a very strong predictor of future adverse events. This emphasises the need for an approach combining both functional and morphological methods in the assessment of lesions. In particular, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has proven to be a valuable asset by truly identifying TCFAs. New treatment strategies should consist of individualised and advanced medical regimens and may evolve towards plaque sealing through percutaneous treatment.",Cardiovascular diabetology,2023-May,"Hommels TM, Hermanides RS, Fabris E, Kedhi E",4,1211,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We aimed to investigate changes in these outcomes of diabetes as depressive symptoms aggravate. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 14 328 participants in the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants were classified into depressive symptom groups of none, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depending on their Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted in three models adjusted for expanding confounders to evaluate the associations between severity of depressive symptoms and prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of DM. As depressive symptom severity worsened, both prevalence and awareness of DM increased regardless of models (p value for trend <0.01 in all models for prevalence and awareness; adjusted OR (aOR) 2.14, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.56 for prevalence in the severe group, model 1; aOR 2.43, 95% CI 1.27 to 4.64 for awareness in the moderately severe group, model 1). Notwithstanding higher awareness of diabetes in the moderately severe and severe groups (84.5% and 86.2%, respectively, vs 71.3% in the none group), these groups were treated less (aOR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.55 in the severe group, model 3) or inadequately controlled (aOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.98 in the moderately severe group, model 3).

32458291,Review of the veteran affairs diabetes trial: Lessons learned.,"Despite robust evidence linking long-term hyperglycemia with cardiovascular complications, several large randomized trials found only modest benefits from intensive compared to standard glucose control. Of these trials, the Veteran Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT), offers a unique long-term perspective in that there were analyses of outcomes at the end of the intervention trial, 5-years post-trial, and after 10-years post-trial. From the VADT and other large trials, we draw several valuable lessons that are relevant to the care of patients with type 2 diabetes. Intensive glucose control reduces development of nephropathy and retinopathy but not neuropathy, though evaluations of neuropathy are less consistent and conclusions regarding outcomes less reliable. While the VADT did not demonstrate reduction in cardiovascular outcomes at completion of the glucose lowering intervention, it did demonstrate a 17% reduction 5-years post-trial, which waned by 10-years post-trial observation. Of interest, the 5-year post trial period included 3 additional years of HbA1c separation between treatment groups which suggests that longer-term glucose control may be needed before benefits are seen. Other factors including hypoglycemia and increased glucose variation are also associated with cardiovascular events and are more prevalent during intensive glucose control, potentially lessening the benefit of lowering average glucose levels. Finally, intensive glucose control requires substantial effort from both the patient and clinician perspective. All of these factors must be kept in mind when considering the benefits of aggressive glucose control for each patient.",Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,2020-Dec,"Tran K, Reaven P",2,1669,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The most alarming is possibly the escalation propensity of diabetes, in recent years, where a nearly ten-fold increase has been witnessed over the past thirty years in Saudi Arabia. However, the number of research arbitrations on the prevalence and incidence of DM is woefully inadequate, as compared to developed countries. Apart from this, most of the existing research data carried out in Saudi Arabia is cross-sectional, with small sample sizes, which most often involve only certain parts of the country.

33403912,"Feline comorbidities: Recognition, diagnosis and management of the cushingoid diabetic.","Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common feline endocrinopathy, and is often driven by underlying insulin resistance with associated pancreatic beta (β)-cell dysfunction. Although spontaneous hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) with hypercortisolemia (hypercortisolism) is relatively uncommon in cats, it is a well-established cause of insulin resistance and is routinely associated with DM in this species. Many of the clinical signs associated with feline HAC are subtle and may be attributed to concurrent DM or the aging process. Failure to recognize HAC in the diabetic cat can impact patient wellbeing and predispose the patient to progressive compromise. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to establish a diagnosis of HAC, as test results may be influenced by poor diabetic regulation, and protocols are different to those used in canine patients. Treatment options depend on the underlying cause, and often require careful, ongoing assessment and modulation of both adrenal function and insulin requirements. However, various approaches have been shown to either improve glycemic control in cats with sustained insulin dependence, or facilitate diabetic remission. This review summarizes the current literature on feline HAC, with a particular focus on cats with concurrent DM. The clinical findings that suggest HAC are discussed, along with an outline of diagnostic options and their limitations.

We included 796 ever- and 277 never-DSME participants of the population-based survey ""Disease knowledge and information needs - Diabetes mellitus (2017)"" from Germany. Data on perceived level of diabetes knowledge (12 items), information needs (11 items), information sources (13 items) and disease distress (2 indices) were collected. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association of DSME-participation with these outcomes. DSME-participants showed a higher level of diabetes knowledge compared to never-DSME participants, particularly in aspects concerning diabetes in general (odds ratio 2.53; 95% confidence intervals 1.48-4.33), treatment (2.41; 1.36-4.26), acute complications (1.91; 1.07-3.41) and diabetes in everyday life (1.83; 1.04-3.22). DSME-participants showed higher information needs regarding late complications (1.51; 1.04-2.18) and acute complications (1.71; 1.71-2.48) than DSME never participants. DSME-participants more frequently consulted diabetologists (5.54; 3.56-8.60) and diabetes care specialists (5.62; 3.61-8.75) as information sources.

We evaluated the association of early rhythm control (ERC), lifestyle modification (LSM), and a combination of ERC and LSM with cardiovascular or diabetes-related complication risk in patients with AF-DM (type 2). From the National Health Information Database, 47,940 patients diagnosed with AF-DM in 2009-2016 were included. We defined ERC as rhythm control therapy within two years of AF diagnosis and LSM as adherence to ≥ 2 of the healthy behaviors among non-current smoking, non-drinking, and regular exercise. We compared the primary (ischemic stroke) and secondary (macro- and microvascular complications, glycemic emergency, and all-cause death) outcomes in four groups: non-ERC and non-LSM (group 1), LSM only (group 2), ERC only (group 3), and both ERC and LSM (group 4). Of total, 10,617 (22%), 26,730 (55.8%), 2,903 (6.1%), and 7,690 (16.0%) were classified into groups 1 to 4, in sequence. The mean duration from AF diagnosis to ERC was 25.6 ± 75.5 days. During 4.0 (interquartile range: 2.5-6.2) years' follow-up, groups 2 and 3 were associated with 23% and 33% lower risks of stroke than group 1, respectively. Group 4 was associated with the lowest risk of stroke: hazard ratio (HR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.67, p < 0.001. Regarding secondary outcomes, the lowest risks were also observed in group 4; macro- and microvascular complications, glycemic emergency, and all-cause death had HRs (95% CIs) of 0.63 (0.56-0.70), 0.88 (0.82-0.94), 0.72 (0.62-0.84), and 0.80 (0.73-0.87), respectively, all p < 0.001.

Conflicting findings from previous studies have resulted in inconsistencies in guidelines regarding DR management in pregnancy. Global estimates of DR prevalence and progression in pregnancy are therefore required to provide clearer information about the overall true burden of DR in this population. To estimate the prevalence of DR and its progression rate in pregnant women with preexisting T1D or T2D diagnosed before pregnancy. For this systematic review and meta-analysis, conducted from November 27, 2018, to June 29, 2021, a systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE/Ovid, Embase/Ovid, and Scopus databases to identify English-language articles that were published from inception through October 2020. Observational studies that reported on DR and its changes in pregnant women with preexisting T1D and T2D. Two independent reviewers extracted relevant data from each included study. Data were pooled using a random-effects model with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. This study followed the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) reporting guidelines. Prevalence of any DR, proliferative DR (PDR), and DR progression rates. A total of 18 observational studies involving 1464 pregnant women with T1D and 262 pregnant women with T2D were included in the analysis. The pooled prevalence of any DR and PDR in early pregnancy was 52.3 (95% CI, 41.9-62.6) and 6.1 (95% CI, 3.1-9.8) per 100 pregnancies, respectively. The pooled progression rate per 100 pregnancies for new DR development was 15.0 (95% CI, 9.9-20.8), worsened nonproliferative DR was 31.0 (95% CI, 23.2-39.2), progression from nonproliferative DR to PDR was 6.3 (95% CI, 3.3-10.0), and worsened PDR was 37.0 (95% CI, 21.2-54.0). DR progression rates per 100 pregnancies were similar between the T1D and T2D groups, except for the development of new DR (T1D groups: 15.8; 95% CI, 10.5-21.9; T2D groups: 9.0; 95% CI, 4.9-14.8). A global trend toward a lower DR progression rate was observed after the 1989 St Vincent Declaration. Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that women with T1D and T2D had a similar risk of DR progression during pregnancy. Despite improvements in the management of diabetes and diabetes during pregnancy, DR prevalence and progression in pregnant women with diabetes remains higher than the nonpregnant population with diabetes, highlighting the need to improve DR management in pregnancy.",JAMA ophthalmology,2022-May,"Widyaputri F, Rogers SL, Kandasamy R, Shub A, Symons RCA, Lim LL",6,2596,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This secondary data analysis study used data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. The participants comprised 186 patients who did not have diabetes at baseline, but developed hyperglycemia at the first follow-up. The average and median periods until DM diagnosis and treatment were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Of the 186 participants, 57.0% were men and 35.5% were 40-49 years old. The average time to DM diagnosis and treatment was 10.87 years and 11.34 years, respectively. The risk factors for the duration of DM were current smoking, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood sugar (FBS), and postprandial 2-hour glucose (PP2). The risk factors for the duration of diabetes treatment were current smoking, hypertension, BMI, FBS, and PP2. The development of one or more comorbidities or diabetes complications was identified at the time of DM diagnosis (36.5%) and DM treatment (41.4%). As diabetes complications occur at the time of DM, and early treatment can impact the development of diabetes complications or mortality, it is necessary to establish a referral program so that participants presenting with high blood sugar levels in the screening program can be diagnosed and treated in a timely manner.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022-Sep,"Jeong IS, Kang CM",2,1452,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

39408828,Monogenic Defects of Beta Cell Function: From Clinical Suspicion to Genetic Diagnosis and Management of Rare Types of Diabetes.,"Monogenic defects of beta cell function refer to a group of rare disorders that are characterized by early-onset diabetes mellitus due to a single gene mutation affecting insulin secretion. It accounts for up to 5% of all pediatric diabetes cases and includes transient or permanent neonatal diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), and various syndromes associated with diabetes. Causative mutations have been identified in genes regulating the development or function of the pancreatic beta cells responsible for normal insulin production and/or release. To date, more than 40 monogenic diabetes subtypes have been described, with those caused by mutations in <i>HNF1A</i> and <i>GCK</i> genes being the most prevalent. Despite being caused by a single gene mutation, each type of monogenic diabetes, especially MODY, can appear with various clinical phenotypes, even among members of the same family. This clinical heterogeneity, its rarity, and the fact that it shares some features with more common types of diabetes, can make the clinical diagnosis of monogenic diabetes rather challenging. Indeed, several cases of MODY or syndromic diabetes are accurately diagnosed in adulthood, after having been mislabeled as type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The recent widespread use of more reliable sequencing techniques has improved monogenic diabetes diagnosis, which is important to guide appropriate treatment and genetic counselling. The current review aims to summarize the latest knowledge on the clinical presentation, genetic confirmation, and therapeutic approach of the various forms of monogenic defects of beta cell function, using three imaginary clinical scenarios and highlighting clinical and laboratory features that can guide the clinician in reaching the correct diagnosis.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024-Sep,"Serbis A, Kantza E, Siomou E, Galli-Tsinopoulou A, Kanaka-Gantenbein C, Tigas S",6,1798,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This study aimed to investigate the interrelationships between the age of onset, frailty, anti-diabetic medications and clinical outcomes in people with diabetes mellitus (DM). A total of 123,172 people aged 40 years and older who were newly diagnosed with DM were identified and categorised into four frailty subgroups (robust, mild, moderate and severe) based on the multimorbidity frailty index (mFI). Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine associations between frailty and clinical outcomes at different ages of DM onsets (40-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ years). Outcomes of interest included generic outcomes (mortality and unplanned hospitalisation) and DM-related outcomes (cardiovascular disease-related mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), diabetes-related hospitalisation and hypoglycaemia). The proportion of frailty increased with age at diagnosis amongst people with incident DM and the mFI scores increased significantly during the 10-year follow-up. Amongst people with diabetes, those with mild, moderate and severe frailty were associated with greater risks of all-cause mortality (mild: adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.69 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60-1.80], P < 0.01; moderate: aHR 2.46 [2.29-2.65], P < 0.01; severe frailty: aHR 3.40 [3.16-3.65], P < 0.01) compared with the robust group. Similar results were found in unplanned hospitalisations, cardiovascular disease-related mortality, MACEs and hypoglycaemia.

People experience negative affect after diagnoses, which can impede self-regulation of health behaviours. Self-compassion, extending care to oneself in difficult times, can mitigate negative affect and promote self-regulation. This scoping review explored the relationship between self-compassion and adaptive affect, self-regulation and engagement in health-promoting/management behaviours among people with prediabetes or diabetes. We conducted a scoping literature search from 6 databases for studies and conference abstracts. Randomized controlled trials and cross-sectional, longitudinal, observational and qualitative designs focused on self-compassion were included. Eligible studies included adults with diabetes (prediabetes, type 1, type 2 and gestational), measured self-compassion using a validated Self-Compassion Scale (quantitative) or included the 3 components (qualitative) and investigated: negative affect, health promoting/management behaviours and/or self-regulation. After deduplication, 5,338 quantitative and 953 qualitative abstracts, and 18 conference proceedings were screened leaving 35 articles. Full-text screening retained 11 eligible studies (6 cross-sectional studies, 2 randomized controlled trials, 2 longitudinal studies and 1 qualitative study). Higher self-compassion was associated with decreased negative affect in 9 studies and was positively associated with well-being in 1 cross-sectional study. Self-compassion led to decreased negative affect and improved blood glucose in 2 interventions. Five studies found positive associations between self-compassion and health-promoting/management behaviours. One qualitative study found self-compassion to benefit affective reactions, health-promoting behaviours and self-regulation. This review shows that self-compassion is linked to adaptive behavioural and affective responding among people with prediabetes and diabetes, and the need for more research on self-compassion and self-regulation in these populations.",Canadian journal of diabetes,2020-Aug,"Morgan TL, Semenchuk BN, Ceccarelli L, Kullman SM, Neilson CJ, Kehler DS, Duhamel TA, Strachan SM",8,2103,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33860488,Metformin for Preventing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Women with a Previous Diagnosis of Gestational Diabetes: A Narrative Review.,"Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) when compared with women who have not had GDM. To delay or prevent T2DM, guidelines recommend regular screening in the primary care setting and lifestyle interventions that are largely focused on dietary and physical activity modifications. As the postpartum period can be challenging for women, uptake and engagement in screening and lifestyle interventions have been poor. Poor uptake and engagement places women with a history of GDM at heightened risk for future morbidity and development of T2DM. Metformin has been a longstanding and safe treatment for the control of blood glucose in people with T2DM. Research has supported the efficacy of metformin, used as an adjunct to a lifestyle intervention or as a stand-alone treatment, in preventing T2DM in people at high risk of T2DM.

However, the result of these studies lacks consistency. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis estimates the pooled level of HRQoL and their associated factors among diabetic patients in sub-Saharan countries. Electronic databases predominantly PubMed were searched. Databases, such as Google and Google scholar, were searched for gray literature. A funnel plot and Egger's regression test were used to see publication bias. Heterogeneity of the studies was checked by Forest plot and I-squared statistic. Both inverse-variance fixed-effect and DerSimonian and Laird random-effects methods were applied to estimate the pooled level of HRQoL (for both WHO-QoL-BREF and SF-36) and the effect size of associated factors. From a total 776 retrieved studies, 16 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled mean score of physical health, psychological, social relation and environmental health domain of WHO-QoL-BREF were 43.12, 47.40, 46.60 and 45.59 respectively. Age had a significant association (pooled β = - 0.47), (pooled β = - 0.24), (pooled β = - 0.32) and (pooled β = - 0.03) with physical health, psychological health, social relation and environmental health domains respectively. Being rural residence (pooled β = - 0.32) was inversely associated with environmental health domain of WHO-QoL-BREF. Increased fasting blood sugar had a significant association (pooled β = - 0.08, 95% CI - 0.11, - 0.05), (pooled β = - 0.07) and (pooled β = - 0.004) with physical health, psychological health and environmental health domains respectively. Having Co-morbidity (pooled β = - 6.25) and diabetes related complication (pooled β = - 5.65) were contrarily related to physical health domain of WHO-QoL-BREF. The pooled mean of physical and environmental domains of HRQOL scores was the least compared to the psychological and social domains. Being Old age and rural residence, increased fasting blood sugar, having co-morbidity and diabetic related complications were contrarily related to level of HRQoL. Therefore, we recommend that early detection and treatment of diabetes related complication and comorbidity and control of fasting blood sugar.

32566680,Measuring the Quality of Life in Diabetic Patients: A Scoping Review.,"Diabetes mellitus is a widely diffused chronic condition which impacts on several aspects of patients' lives. In the current clinical practice, the implementation in the clinical routine of monitoring systems of patients' outcomes has led to an increased generation and use of several measures for the assessment of patients' quality of life (QOL). Nevertheless, this construct appears to be particularly complex, and its operationalization is variable across different measures. The purpose of this paper is to offer an updated review of the diabetes-specific QOL measures present in scientific literature with a specific focus on the broad domains assessed. A scoping review was carried out with the purpose of identifying the existing measures in literature and describing their implicit representation of QOL in diabetes care. Five different databases (Scopus; Web of Science Core Collection; Medline; PsycInfo; and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched with a string including validation studies of adult-only, diabetes-specific QOL measures. Each measure was then qualified according to its structure, a qualitative assessment of the broad domains of QOL it comprises, and finally an overview of the psychometric properties of its first validation. 30 scales were identified and assessed. Theme analysis shows that QOL is operationalized with multidimensional surveys comprising of both mental, physical, and social health components. Some scales also consider the impact of societal attitudes, public policies, and context on QOL. Several self-report measures of QOL specifically developed for diabetic patients exist in scientific literature. The present scoping review reports scales structure, broad domains of QOL, and development purpose. This may help in understanding the concept of QOL in diabetic patients and may also serve the purpose of guiding the reader in the choice of the most appropriate instrument or in the development of a new one.",Journal of diabetes research,2020-,"Palamenghi L, Carlucci MM, Graffigna G",3,1983,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Poor glycemic control, longer duration, and poor medication adherence increased the risk of DM complications. Comprehensive evidence on the pooled prevalence of microvascular complications in DM patients in Ethiopia is not available. Furthermore, individual study findings for the prevalence of microvascular complications in DM patients, and associated factors were not consistent. This systemic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the pooled prevalence of microvascular complications in DM patients, and its associated risk factors in Ethiopia. Systematic search on Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct electronic database, Google Scholar search engine, and library registration was used to identify relevant studies following reviews and meta-analysis guidelines. Microsoft Excel spreadsheets were used to extract data, and Extracted data was analyzed using STATA software version 17.0. A Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the role of each study in the final result and the presence of publication bias was assessed by Egger's test. Heterogeneity across studies was checked by Cochran's Q statistic and I2 statistics and significant heterogeneity was assessed using subgroup analysis. The pooled prevalence of microvascular complications in DM patients was 32.89 % (95 % CI: 28.17-37.60). In addition, the pooled prevalence of retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy in DM patients was 17.16 % (95 % CI: 12-22 %), 10.49 % (95 % CI: 8-13 %) and 11.52 % (95 % CI: 9-15 %) respectively.

38870560,Incretin therapy in feline diabetes mellitus - A review of the current state of research.,"Incretin hormones potentiate the glucose-induced insulin secretion following enteral nutrient intake. The best characterised incretin hormones are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) which are produced in and secreted from the gut in response to nutrient ingestion. The property of incretins to enhance endogenous insulin secretion only at elevated blood glucose levels makes them interesting therapeutics for type 2 diabetes mellitus with a better safety profile than exogenous insulin. While incretin therapeutics (especially GLP-1 agonists, and more recently also GLP-1 / GIP dual agonists and other drugs that influence the incretin metabolism (e.g., dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors)) are already widely used treatment options for human type 2 diabetes, these drugs are not yet approved for the therapy of feline diabetes mellitus. This review provides an introduction to incretins and feline diabetes mellitus in general and summarises the current study situation on incretins as therapeutics for feline diabetes mellitus to assess their possible future potential in feline medicine. Studies to date on the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) in healthy cats largely confirm their insulinotropic effect known from other species. In diabetic cats, GLP-1RAs appear to significantly reduce glycaemic variability (GV, an indicator for the quality of glycaemic control), which is important for the management of the disease and prevention of long-term complications. However, for widespread use in feline diabetes mellitus, further studies are required that include larger numbers of diabetic cats, and that consider and test a possible need for dose adjustments to overweight and diabetic cats. Also evaluation of the outcome of GLP-1RA monotherapy will be neceessary.",Domestic animal endocrinology,2024-Oct,"Haller N, Lutz TA",2,1835,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The impact of DM on public health in developing countries has triggered alarm due to the exaggerated costs of the treatment and monitoring of patients with this disease. Considerable efforts have been made to try to prevent the onset and reduce the complications of DM. However, because insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells progressively deteriorate, many people must receive insulin through subcutaneous injection. Additionally, current therapies do not have consistent results regarding the prevention of chronic complications. Leveraging the approval of real-time continuous glucose monitors and sophisticated algorithms that partially automate insulin infusion pumps has improved glycemic control, decreasing the burden of diabetes management. However, these advances are facing physiologic barriers. New findings in molecular and cellular biology have produced an extraordinary advancement in tissue development for the treatment of DM. Obtaining pancreatic β-cells from somatic cells is a great resource that currently exists for patients with DM. Although this therapeutic option has great prospects for patients, some challenges remain for this therapeutic plan to be used clinically. The purpose of this review is to describe the new techniques in cell biology and regenerative medicine as possible treatments for DM. In particular, this review highlights the origin of induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) and how they have begun to emerge as a regenerative treatment that may mitigate the pathology of this disease.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020-Nov,"Arroyave F, Montaño D, Lizcano F",3,1640,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The interest in measuring QoL in relation to clinical treatment and interventions has led to an increase in the development and use of QoL measures. The vast number of available instruments can be a barrier for establishing evidence and can be overwhelming for clinicians and researchers who are interested in measuring QoL of children with diabetes. As a first step for reaching consensus, we aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the application of QoL instruments used in children (2-18 years old) with diabetes.

Addressing the heterogeneity of T2D is a major task of diabetes research to lower the high rate of treatment failure as well as to reduce the risk of long-term complications. A pathophysiology-based clustering system seems the most promising to help in the stratification of diabetes in terms of complication risk and response to treatment. This urges for clinical studies looking at novel biomarkers related to the different metabolic pathways of T2D and able to inform about the therapeutic cluster of each patient.

32539915,Recent clinical advances of glucokinase activators in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2.,"Glucokinase (GK) is an isozyme of hexokinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose. GK is present in many organs of the human body, including the liver and pancreas. GK plays an important role in promoting the synthesis of hepatic glycogen and balancing postprandial blood glucose. Mutations in the GK gene can result in the inclusion of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY2) and permanent neonatal Diabetes mellitus (PNDM). Glucokinase activators (GKAs) are a class of type 2 diabetes drugs designed for this target. In various animal models of type 2 diabetes, GKAs have been shown to have the ability to decrease blood glucose, and some GKAs also have the ability to stimulate β cell proliferation. However, due to the induction of hypoglycemia and increased liver burden, many candidates stopped in phase II clinical trials. Recently, dorzagliatin has reached the primary endpoint of phase III clinical trial, which can repair the core function of GK as a blood glucose sensor, and can delay or even reverse islet β -cell damage and functional decline. This provides a promising prospect for the study of GKAs as candidates for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

39078140,SGLT2 inhibitors for the treatment of diabetes: a patent review (2019-23).,"The sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are FDA-approved class of drugs for diabetes management. They improve glycemic control by inducing glucosuria. Notwithstanding with potent anti-hyperglycemic activity, SGLT2 inhibitors are emerging as drugs with multifaceted therapeutic potential, evidenced for cardioprotective, renoprotective, antihypertensive, and neuroprotective activities. Continuous attempts are being accomplished through structural modification, development of new formulation, or combination with other drugs, to enhance the bioactivity spectrum of SGLT2 inhibitors for better management of diabetes and related complications. This review comprises a summary of patent applications, acquired using the Espacenet Patent Search database, concerning SGLT2 inhibitors from 2019 to 2023, with focus on improving therapeutic potentials in management of diabetes and metabolic complications. SGLT2 inhibitors have provided an exciting treatment option for diabetes. Originally developed as anti-hyperglycemic agents, SGLT2 inhibitors exert pleiotropic metabolic responses and have emerged as promising antidiabetic agents with cardio-protective and reno-protective activities. Given their distinct therapeutic profile, SGLT2 inhibitors have revolutionized the management of diabetes and associated complications. Emerging evidences on their therapeutic potential against cancer, male reproductive dysfunctions, and neurodegenerative diseases indicate that further research in this field may unfold novel prospective on their plausible use in the management of other chronic conditions.",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,2024-Sep,"Baghel R, Chhikara N, Kumar P, Tamrakar AK",4,1610,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36757165,Adverse Effects of Tacrolimus and Its Associated Risk Factors in Renal Transplant Recipients.,"Tacrolimus, an important constituent of the immunosuppressant regimen for renal transplant recipients, can result in posttransplant diabetes mellitus. The adverse effect profile of tacrolimus is yet to be completely understood. The relationship between the blood level of tacrolimus and development of posttransplant diabetes mellitus has not been clearly elucidated in Indian populations. We conducted this study to investigate the frequency of posttransplant diabetes mellitus and other adverse effects of tacrolimus, to enumerate the risk factors associated with posttransplant diabetes mellitus development, and to correlate the blood levels of tacrolimus with its occurrence. This prospective observational study included 77 renal transplant patients receiving tacrolimus. The blood sugar levels (fasting and postprandial) were monitored, and patients were asked regularly about the adverse effects of tacrolimus experienced by them for 6 months posttransplant. Trough levels of tacrolimus in blood were correlated with occurrence of posttransplant diabetes mellitus. Posttransplant diabetes mellitus developed in 62.3% (48/77) of renal transplant recipients on a tacrolimus-based regimen. Other adverse effects observed included tremors, diarrhea, alopecia, cyto- megalovirus infection, headache, biopsy-proven calci- neurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and BK virus infection. Higher tacrolimus trough level at month 1 posttransplant was significantly associated with the development of posttransplant diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio = 1.379; 95% CI, 1.02-1.86). The best cutoff of tacrolimus trough level at month 1 posttransplant to reduce the risk of posttransplant diabetes mellitus was 8.1 ng/mL. There was a 5 times increased risk of developing posttransplant diabetes mellitus when tacrolimus trough level at month 1 posttransplant was >8.1 ng/mL (adjusted odds ratio = 5.4; 95% CI, 1.4-19.9). Posttransplant diabetes mellitus is a common adverse effect of tacrolimus among renal transplant recipients. A trough level >8.1 ng/mL at month 1 posttransplant was an important predictor for posttransplant diabetes mellitus.",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,2023-Jan,"Meera M, Manikandan S, Parameswaran S",3,2160,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This is a qualitative study where participants were invited to respond by direct interview to a standard questionnaire that is validated by the World Health Organization (WHO), ""Tool for Assessment of Diabetic Retinopathy and DM Management Systems"". The questionnaire casts out of the WHO Health Systems Framework concept, assessing the presence of programs, guidelines, health technology and workforce, health promotion, and financing of DM and DR care in Jordan. Forty-two participants were included. DM is considered as priority in Jordan, but no programs are implemented. National guidelines are present for DM but not for DR. Networking should be improved between different disciplines caring for DM and DR. Human resources for DM and DR care were found insufficient and inadequately distributed. Health technology is only present in major cities and central hospitals. There is no nationwide data on disease burden nor a screening program for DR. More collaborated efforts should be spent on health education and raising awareness among people living with diabetes about the risk of DR. Advanced DM and DR care is not accessible to most people. Programmatic efforts from the government and NGOs must formulate a national action plan to reduce the human and financial impact of the disease in Jordan.",Middle East African journal of ophthalmology,2023-,"Allatayfeh M, Al Shdaifat A, Mariotti SP",3,1624,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33475814,Association of diabetes type and chronic diabetes complications with early exit from the labour force: register-based study of people with diabetes in Finland.,"Diabetes and diabetes complications are a cause of substantial morbidity, resulting in early exits from the labour force and lost productivity. The aim of this study was to examine differences in early exits between people with type 1 and 2 diabetes and to assess the role of chronic diabetes complications on early exit. We also estimated the economic burden of lost productivity due to early exits. People of working age (age 17-64) with diabetes in 1998-2011 in Finland were detected using national registers (N<sub>type 1</sub> = 45,756, N<sub>type 2</sub> = 299,931). For the open cohort, data on pensions and deaths, healthcare usage, medications and basic demographics were collected from the registers. The outcome of the study was early exit from the labour force defined as pension other than old age pension beginning before age 65, or death before age 65. We analysed the early exit outcome and its risk factors using the Kaplan-Meier method and extended Cox regression models. We fitted linear regression models to investigate the risk factors of lost working years and productivity costs among people with early exit. The difference in median age at early exit from the labour force between type 1 (54.0) and type 2 (58.3) diabetes groups was 4.3 years. The risk of early exit among people with type 1 diabetes increased faster after age 40 compared with people with type 2 diabetes. Each of the diabetes complications was associated with an increase in the hazard of early exit regardless of diabetes type compared with people without the complication, with eye-related complications as an exception. Diabetes complications partly but not completely explained the difference between diabetes types. The mean lost working years was 6.0 years greater in the type 1 diabetes group than in the type 2 diabetes group among people with early exit. Mean productivity costs of people with type 1 diabetes and early exit were found to be 1.4-fold greater compared with people with type 2 diabetes. The total productivity costs of incidences of early exits in the type 2 diabetes group were notably higher compared with the type 1 group during the time period (€14,400 million, €2800 million). We found a marked difference in the patterns of risk of early exit between people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The difference was largest close to statutory retirement age. On average, exits in the type 1 diabetes group occurred at an earlier age and resulted in higher mean lost working years and mean productivity costs. The potential of prevention, timely diagnosis and management of diabetes is substantial in terms of avoiding reductions in individual well-being and productivity.",Diabetologia,2021-Apr,"Kurkela O, Forma L, Ilanne-Parikka P, Nevalainen J, Rissanen P",5,2688,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We sought to describe the clinical care of individuals with prediabetes, determine patient factors associated with this care, and evaluate risk for diabetes development. Retrospective cohort study using linked claims and electronic health record data. We created a cohort of adults with prediabetes based on laboratory measures. We excluded patients with a prior history of diabetes, pregnancy in prior 6 months, or recent steroid use. We measured ordering and completion of clinical services targeting prediabetes management and diabetes incidence within 12 months following cohort entry. We tested the strength of the association between individuals' characteristics and outcomes of interest using bivariate and multiple logistic regression. Our cohort included 3888 patients with a laboratory diagnosis of prediabetes (incident or prevalent prediabetes). Within 12 months, 63.4% had repeat glycemic testing, yet only 10.4% had coded diagnoses of prediabetes, 1.0% were referred for nutrition services, and 5.4% were prescribed metformin. Most patients completed labs and nutrition visits when referred and filled metformin when prescribed. Individuals with a higher glycemic level or BMI were more likely to receive prediabetes clinical care. Six percent of individuals developed diabetes within 12 months of cohort entry and had higher glycemic levels and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. In the adjusted model, Black individuals had 1.4 times higher odds of developing diabetes than White individuals. Rates of prediabetes clinical care activities are low and have not improved.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to determine the relationship between metformin use and ND risk based on data from population-based cohort studies. Articles were systematically searched in PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs were obtained using a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses and meta-regression were performed to identify the sources of heterogeneity and strengthen the results. Twelve population-based cohort studies involving 194,792 participants (94,462 metformin users and 100,330 metformin non-users) were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The pooled RR of NDs reached 0.77 (95% CI 0.67-0.88) when comparing metformin users with non-users. The effects were more prominent in long-term metformin users (≥4 years) (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13-0.44) and studies from Asian countries (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.64-0.74). The effect estimates were stable when stratified by subtypes of NDs, study designs, and control definitions (p for interaction >0.05). Meta-regression did not identify the coefficients as the sources of heterogeneity (all p > 0.05). This systematic review and meta-analysis found that metformin use, especially long-term use, was associated with lower ND risk.

An online survey developed using a rapid Delphi method. The survey was translated into 17 different languages and disseminated electronically in 27 countries via national diabetes nurse networks. Survey responses from 1829 diabetes nurses were included in the analysis. The responses indicated that 28% (n = 504) and 48% (n = 873) of diabetes nurses felt the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted 'a lot' on the physical and psychological risks of people with diabetes, respectively. The following clinical problems were identified as having increased 'a lot': anxiety 82% (n = 1486); diabetes distress 65% (n = 1189); depression 49% (n = 893); acute hyperglycaemia 39% (n = 710) and foot complications 18% (n = 323). Forty-seven percent (n = 771) of respondents identified that the level of care provided to people with diabetes had declined either extremely or quite severely.

Overall, diabetic patients with HDHP were less likely to adhere to treatment and prescription refills, utilize fewer healthcare services and medications, and more likely to have acute emergency visits than their counterparts enrolled in low-deductible plans. However, the results on overall healthcare costs and the final health outcome were unclear. It appears that HDHPs negatively impact low-income diabetic patients by leading them to forgo preventive and primary care services and experience excessive preventable emergency department visits.

The Risk Assessment and Management Program (RAMP) in Hong Kong has been providing long-term face-to-face follow-up to DM patients in the government out-patient clinics since 2009. However, under the current outbreak of COVID-19, these face-to-face consultations were ceased over and over again to lower the risk of disease transmission. With the advancement in technology, the recent emergence of telecare has provided an alternative to replace the conventional consultations in the clinics.

SGLT2 inhibitors have been studied in patients with T1DM in phase 3 clinical trials such as the inTandem, DEPICT, and EASE trials, which demonstrated consistent reductions in HbA1c. Secondary analyses of these trials have also reported potential kidney protective effects that are independent of improved glycemic control. However, trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have found an increased risk of DKA with SGLT2 inhibitors, a serious concern in patients with T1DM. SGLT2 inhibitors provide cardiovascular benefits and kidney protection in patients with T2DM and are a promising therapeutic option for patients with T1DM due to overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms. However, SGLT2 inhibitors increase the risk of DKA, and there is currently a lack of research investigating the beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T1DM. Preventative measure for DKA would have to be implemented and the risks would need to be carefully balanced with the benefits offered by SGLT2 inhibitors.

Since the rate of complications was very low in T1DG, excluding this group, a new model similarly revealed that retinopathy and female gender were associated with SMD, however, the association with e-GFR was disappeared. The prevalence of sudomotor dysfunction is high when established peripheral polyneuropathy was present in diabetes. Even though, sudomotor dysfunction can also occur before clinical polyneuropathy in both types of diabetes (T1DG: 18.8%, T2DG 44.3%), prediabetes (59.1%), and nondiabetic healthy subjects (15%). The variables associated with sudomotor dysfunction were retinopathy and female sex. Normalization of ESC for BMI would be a beneficial approach. However, before this method is included in the routine screening programs for diabetic polyneuropathy, large-scale and prospective studies are required to reach a consensus on the pathological threshold values.",Primary care diabetes,2023-Oct,"Calikoglu BF, Celik S, Idiz C, Bagdemir E, Issever H, Calvet JH, Satman I",7,3020,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Diabetes-related microvascular complications and periodontitis are also closely related to systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that periodontitis and oral hygiene markers might increase the risk of microvascular complications in diabetes mellitus. We enrolled 11,353 diabetes participants without prior microvascular complications who received complete oral health checkups in the National Health Insurance Service-National Health Screening Cohort in 2003-2004. The primary outcome was the first development of diabetes-related microvascular complications, including nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. The age of all participants was 55.27 ± 9.46 years, and 7833 (68.99%) participants were male. Periodontitis was noted in 8.37%. During the 7.03 ± 4.30 year of the mean follow-up period, 7227 patients experienced diabetes-related microvascular complications (2645 with nephropathy, 2513 with neuropathy, 2069 with retinopathy). Multivariable Cox regression analyses revealed that periodontitis was an independent risk factor for diabetes-related microvascular complications (adjusted hazard ratio (HR):1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI):1.04-1.23; p = 0.004). In the secondary analysis for individual microvascular complications, periodontitis was an independent risk factor for retinopathy (adjusted HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.04-1.40; p = 0.013).

34299172,Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young-New Approaches for Disease Modelling.,"Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically heterogeneous group of monogenic endocrine disorders that is characterised by autosomal dominant inheritance and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction. These patients are commonly misdiagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, as the clinical symptoms largely overlap. Even though several biomarkers have been tested none of which could be used as single clinical discriminator. The correct diagnosis for individuals with MODY is of utmost importance, as the applied treatment depends on the gene mutation or is subtype-specific. Moreover, in patients with HNF1A-MODY, additional clinical monitoring can be included due to the high incidence of vascular complications observed in these patients. Finally, stratification of MODY patients will enable better and newer treatment options for MODY patients, once the disease pathology for each patient group is better understood. In the current review the clinical characteristics and the known disease-related abnormalities of the most common MODY subtypes are discussed, together with the up-to-date applied diagnostic criteria and treatment options. Additionally, the usage of pluripotent stem cells together with CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing for disease modelling with the possibility to reveal new pathophysiological mechanisms in MODY is discussed.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021-Jul,"Skoczek D, Dulak J, Kachamakova-Trojanowska N",3,1346,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Knowledge, attitude, and practice of the pre-diabetic stage are of great importance and can decrease complications. The present study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practice of the pre-diabetic older people. This cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2022 to August 2022 on 219 pre-diabetic older people referring to Sina Hospital in Tabriz, one of the most populated cities in the northwest of Iran. Data were collected using questionnaires of Knowledge, Attitude, Practice-Prediabetes Assessment Questionnaire (KAP-PAQ). The data were analyzed by SPSS 21. The mean scores of knowledge (in the range of 0-17), attitude (in the range of -10, + 10), and practice (in the range of 0-26) were 1.72 ± 1.0, 2.24 ± 1.92, and 5.76 ± 2.61, respectively. The older people's knowledge and practice levels in the pre-diabetes stage were low and about 50% of them had negative views. According to the Spearman correlation test, there was a positive significant relationship between the older people's knowledge and practice (p < 0.001, r = 0.234). The older people in the pre-diabetes stage had low knowledge and attitude and a negative viewpoint towards correcting lifestyle on diet, exercising and physical activity, weight control, diagnostic and screening methods. Increased knowledge about pre-diabetes and strengthened positive attitude towards correcting lifestyle through counseling as well as empowering the pre-diabetic older people can increase the efficiency of pre-diabetes prevention and control programs and prevent its progression to the diabetes stage.",BMC geriatrics,2024-Mar,"Pakpour V, Molayi F, Nemati H",3,1695,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

In addition, alterations in post-translational modifications (PTMs) and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) also contribute to the development of diabetes pathogenesis. Recent advances in omics technologies have broadened the perspective for systematic investigation of proteome alterations in understanding the pathogenesis of diabetes. Further, PPIs are central to cellular signaling in all living organisms and deranged PPIs lead to diabetic complications. In this context, affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) along with diverse bioinformatic approaches has proven to be competent in mapping large-scale PPI networks around the critical players in the glucose homeostasis. In this review, we revisit the application of proteomic approaches in investigating proteome alterations and probing PPI networks for a better understanding of the underlying intricacies of the major signaling pathways in altered glucose homeostasis.",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

31833083,Sweet dreams or bitter nightmare: a narrative review of 25 years of research on the role of sleep in diabetes and the contributions of behavioural science.,"The aim of this review was to provide an overview of developments, clinical implications and gaps in knowledge regarding the relationship between diabetes and sleep over the past 25 years, with special focus on contributions from the behavioural sciences. Multiple prospective observational and experimental studies have shown a link between suboptimal sleep and impaired glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity and the development of type 2 diabetes. While prevalence rates of suboptimal sleep vary widely according to definition, assessment and sample, suboptimal subjective sleep quality appears to be a common reality for one-third of people with type 1 diabetes and over half of people with type 2 diabetes. Both physiological and psychosocial factors may impair sleep in these groups. In turn, suboptimal sleep can negatively affect glycaemic outcomes directly or indirectly via suboptimal daytime functioning (energy, mood, cognition) and self-care behaviours. Technological devices supporting diabetes self-care may have both negative and positive effects. Diabetes and its treatment also affect the sleep of significant others. Research on the merits of interventions aimed at improving sleep for people with diabetes is in its infancy. Diabetes and sleep appear to be reciprocally related. Discussion of sleep deserves a central place in regular diabetes care. Multi-day, multi-method studies may shed more light on the complex relationship between sleep and diabetes at an individual level. Intervention studies are warranted to examine the potential of sleep interventions in improving outcomes for people with diabetes.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2020-Mar,"Nefs GM, Bazelmans E, Donga E, Tack CJ, de Galan BE",5,1641,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38872966,The unmet drug-related needs of patients with diabetes in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Diabetes is a major health concern globally and in Ethiopia. Ensuring optimal diabetes management through minimizing drug therapy problems is important for improving patient outcomes. However, data on the prevalence and factors associated with unmet drug-related needs in patients with diabetes in Ethiopia is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence of unmet drug-related needs among patients with diabetes mellitus in Ethiopia. A thorough exploration of databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Hinari, and Embase and Google Scholar, was conducted to identify pertinent studies. Inclusion criteria involved observational studies that reported the prevalence of unmet drug-related needs in Ethiopian patients with diabetes. The quality of the studies was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists. A random-effects meta-analysis was employed to amalgamate data on study characteristics and prevalence estimates, followed by subsequent subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Graphical and statistical assessments were employed to evaluate publication bias. Analysis of twelve studies involving 4,017 patients revealed a pooled prevalence of unmet drug-related needs at 74% (95% CI 63-83%). On average, each patient had 1.45 unmet drug-related needs. The most prevalent type of unmet need was ineffective drug therapy, 35% (95% CI 20-50). Type 2 diabetes, retrospective study designs, and studies from the Harari Region were associated with a higher prevalence. Frequently reported factors associated with the unmet drug-related needs includes multiple comorbidities, older age, and polypharmacy. Notably, the results indicated significant heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup> = 99.0%; p value < 0.001), and Egger's regression test revealed publication bias with p<0.001. The prevalence of unmet drug-related needs among diabetes patients with diabetes in Ethiopia is high with the most prevalent issue being ineffective drug therapy. Targeted interventions are needed; especially patients on multiple medications, advanced age, with comorbidities, and prolonged illness duration to improve diabetes management and outcomes. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero, identifier CRD42024501096.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,"Gobezie MY, Tesfaye NA, Solomon T, Demessie MB, Wendie TF, Belayneh YM, Baye AM, Hassen M",8,2253,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34121168,"Is diabetic retinopathy affected by diabetes type? A retrospective study using electronic medical record data from patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes.","To determine whether the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and its related factors are affected by diabetes type (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults [LADA], type 1 diabetes mellitus [T1DM], type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM]). LADA patients were matched for age (± 2 years) and sex to T1DM (1:1) and T2DM (1:2) patients. Retrieved variables included demographic characteristics, diabetes history, laboratory test findings, and history of DR screening, etc. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to identify influencing factors of DR. A decision tree was used to explore interactions between diabetes type and other influencing factors of DR. We included 110 LADA, 101 T1DM, and 220 T2DM patients. DR prevalence was 26.4% in LADA patients, lower than that in T1DM (50.5%) and T2DM (47.7%) patients (P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that diabetes duration (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.1-1.26, P < 0.001) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) (OR = 42.39, 95% CI: 10.88-165.11, P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for DR, and regular DR screening (OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.16-0.69, P = 0.003) was an independent protective factor. Decision tree analysis showed that in patients without DN with a diabetes duration of at least 10.5 years, T1DM and LADA patients had a higher incidence of DR than T2DM patients (72.7% vs. 55.1%). The prevalence of DR in diabetes patients was affected by diabetes duration, DN occurrence, and regular DR screening. Diabetes type indirectly affects DR occurrence through its interaction with diabetes duration and DN.

34649983,Identifying priority and bright spot areas for improving diabetes care: a geospatial approach.,"The objective of this study was to describe a novel geospatial methodology for identifying poor-performing (priority) and well-performing (bright spot) communities with respect to diabetes management at the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level. This research was the first phase of a mixed-methods approach known as the focused rapid assessment process (fRAP). Using data from the Lehigh Valley Health Network in eastern Pennsylvania, geographical information systems mapping and spatial analyses were performed to identify diabetes prevalence and A1c control spatial clusters and outliers. We used a spatial empirical Bayes approach to adjust diabetes-related measures, mapped outliers and used the Local Moran's I to identify spatial clusters and outliers. Patients with diabetes were identified from the Lehigh Valley Practice and Community-Based Research Network (LVPBRN), which comprised primary care practices that included a hospital-owned practice, a regional practice association, independent small groups, clinics, solo practitioners and federally qualified health centres. Using this novel approach, we identified five priority ZCTAs and three bright spot ZCTAs in LVPBRN. Three of the priority ZCTAs were located in the urban core of Lehigh Valley and have large Hispanic populations. The other two bright spot ZCTAs have fewer patients and were located in rural areas. As the first phase of fRAP, this method of identifying high-performing and low-performing areas offers potential to mitigate health disparities related to diabetes through targeted exploration of local factors contributing to diabetes management. This novel approach to identification of populations with diabetes performing well or poor at the local community level may allow practitioners to target focused qualitative assessments where the most can be learnt to improve diabetic management of the community.",Family medicine and community health,2021-Oct,"Topmiller M, Mallow PJ, Shaak K, Kieber-Emmons AM",4,1893,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Direct sequencing of all exons of INS genes was carried out in 189 children with PNDM. Clinical and biochemical data were collected and correlated. The pathogenicity of mutations was determined based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Association of Medical Pathology guidelines. Two novel mutations (His34Pro, Leu35Met) in a compound heterozygous state and seven known mutations (Gly32Ser, Phe48Cys, Arg89Cys, Cys96Tyr, Ser98Ile, Try108Asp and Cys109Phe) in the INS gene were identified in 8 patients out of the total of 189 PNDM children studied. Four mutations were involved in defects with disulphide bond formation and hence were in crucial regions of the gene. All the mutations were de novo in origin. This is the first comprehensive study from India to investigate the insulin gene mutations in PNDM and to show that INS gene mutations also contribute to the causation of PNDM.",Journal of diabetes and its complications,2021-Dec,"Gopi S, Gowri P, Panda JK, Sathyanarayana SO, Gupta S, Chandru S, Chandni R, Raghupathy P, Dayal D, Mohan V, Radha V",11,1246,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
31797443,Assessing the impact of diabetes on quality of life: what have the past 25 years taught us?,"Over the past 25 years, there has been significant acknowledgement of the importance of assessing the impact of diabetes on quality of life. Yet, despite the development of several diabetes-specific quality of life measures, the challenges we faced in 1995 remain. There is little consensus on the definition of quality of life because of the complexity and subjectivity of the concept. General quality of life comprises several domains of life, and these are highly individualized. Assessing the impact of diabetes on these life domains adds to the complexity. While comprehensive diabetes-specific quality-of-life measures typically increase respondent burden, brief questionnaires may not capture all relevant/important domains. Today, the lack of resolution of these challenges may explain why the impact of diabetes on quality of life is not systematically assessed in research or clinical care. Few researchers report detailed rationales for assessment, there is often a mismatch between the concept of interest and the measure selected, and data are misinterpreted as assessing the impact of diabetes on quality of life when, in reality, related but distinct constructs have been assessed, such as diabetes distress, treatment satisfaction or health status. While significant efforts are being made to increase routine monitoring of psychological well-being and understand the lived experience, no guidelines currently recommend routine clinical assessment of diabetes-specific quality of life, and there is no consensus on which questionnaire(s) to use. The gaps identified in this review need urgent attention, starting with recognition that assessment of diabetes-specific quality of life is as important as biomedical markers, if we are to improve the lives of people with diabetes.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2020-Mar,"Speight J, Holmes-Truscott E, Hendrieckx C, Skovlund S, Cooke D",5,1793,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33438572,Association between Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy and Serum Bile Acid Level in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the diabetic microvascular complications, which is also one of the important causes of blindness in adults. To investigate the association between proliferative retinopathy and serum bile acid level in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Three hundred and thirty-six patients with T2DM were included, of which, 229 had a history of more than 10 years without diabetic retinopathy (no diabetic retinopathy, NDR) and 107 had proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The baseline characteristics of the two groups were compared. According to the level of bile acid, the patients were divided into low, medium and high bile acid groups. The ratio of proliferative retinopathy in each group was compared. The presence of retinopathy was taken as the dependent variable, and the significant variables were analyzed by logistic regression. The level of total bilirubin and bile acid in the NDR group was significantly higher than that in the PDR group, while the levels of triglyceride, cholesterol and LDL-C were significantly lower than that in the PDR group (P<0.05). With the increase of bile acid level, the proportion of proliferative retinopathy decreased. Logistic regression analysis showed that bilirubin and bile acid were protective factors of diabetic retinopathy, while SBP, LDL-C and UAER were risk factors of diabetic retinopathy. Bile acid might be a protective factor for diabetic retinopathy in T2DM, which might be a potential therapeutic role in retinal disorders.","Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2021-,"Su Z, Liu W, Yang J",3,1526,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This study aimed to evaluate the performance of Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF)-Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS) to screen for undiagnosed type 2 diabetes in a large representative population in India. Data were acquired from the Indian Council of Medical Research-INdia DIABetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study, a large national survey that included both urban and rural populations from 30 states/union territories in India. Stratified multistage design was followed to obtain a sample of 113,043 individuals (94.2% response rate). MDRF-IDRS used four simple parameters, viz. age, waist circumference, family history of diabetes and physical activity to detect undiagnosed diabetes.

32674731,Current Approaches in Diabetes Treatment and Other Strategies to Reach Normoglycemia.,"Cells are mainly dependent on glucose as their energy source. Multicellular organisms need to adequately control individual glucose uptake by the cells, and the insulin-glucagon endocrine system serves as the key glucose regulation mechanism. Insulin allows for effective glucose entry into the cells when blood glucose levels are high, and glucagon acts as its opponent, balancing low blood glucose levels. A lack of insulin will prevent glucose entry to the cells, resulting in glucose accumulation in the bloodstream. Diabetes is a disease which is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. All diabetes types are characterized by an inefficient insulin signaling mechanism. This could be the result of insufficient insulin secretion, as in the case of type I diabetes and progressive incidents of type II diabetes or due to insufficient response to insulin (known as insulin resistance). We emphasize here, that Diabetes is actually a disease of starved tissues, unable to absorb glucose (and other nutrients), and not a disease of high glucose levels. Indeed, diabetic patients, prior to insulin discovery, suffered from glucose malabsorption. In this mini-review, we will define diabetes, discuss the current status of diabetes treatments, review the current knowledge of the different hormones that participate in glucose homeostasis and the employment of different modulators of these hormones. As this issue deals with peptide therapeutics, special attention will be given to synthetic peptide analogs, peptide agonists as well as antagonists.",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,2020-,"Sirhan W, Piran R",2,1558,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Recipient T2D PRS was associated with pre-transplant T2D and the development of PTDM. T2D PRS in liver donors, but not in kidney donors, was an independent risk factor for PTDM development. The inclusion of a combined liver donor and recipient T2D PRS significantly improved PTDM prediction compared with a model that included only clinical characteristics: the area under the curve (AUC) was 67.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 64.1-71.1%) for the combined T2D PRS versus 62.3% (95% CI 58.8-65.8%) for the clinical characteristics model (P = 0.0001).

Incident diabetes was defined based on 1) fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2) glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), or 3) any diagnostic criterion (FPG, HbA<sub>1</sub>c or medical diagnosis). Sleep and sedentary levels were assessed by questionnaire. Sleep was categorized into short (<7 h/day), adequate (7-9 h/day) and long (>9 h/day). Data from 3355 participants (57.6% women, mean age years 56.6 ± 10.3) was analyzed. There were 136, 110 and 142 incident cases of diabetes defined by FPG, HbA<sub>1</sub>c or any criterion, respectively. Participants who developed diabetes had a higher sedentariness but no differences were found regarding sleep duration. Similar results were obtained after adjusting for age, gender, education, smoking and body mass index: hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for sedentariness 1.61 (1.11-2.35), 1.40 (0.93-2.12) and 1.39 (1.04-1.87) for diabetes defined by FPG, HbA<sub>1</sub>c or any diagnostic criterion, respectively. Being sedentary, but not being a long or a short sleeper, increases the risk of developing diabetes.",Primary care diabetes,2023-Oct,"Liu K, Marques-Vidal P",2,1298,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36629168,Increasing diabetes testing adherence with incentives in rural Northwestern Ontario.,"The health outcomes of rural Canadians have been described as poor and can in some part be related to diabetes mellitus. Despite the high mortality and morbidity rates associated with the disease, compliance with management remains low. Research has shown that a small financial incentive used to modify patient behaviour, can improve outcomes in cardiac disease and exercise adherence. This study aims to evaluate if a small financial incentive awarded to rural Northwestern Ontario patients with diabetes who complete an haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test, would result in greater compliance in test completion. Patients were recruited through two Northern rural clinics. Participants were divided into two groups: Group A received a financial incentive, whereas Group B received a letter of reminder. HbA1c tests were recorded every 6 months for 2 years and compliance was analysed using a t-test and Chi-square. One hundred and forty-six participants were recruited with 30 lost to follow-up. Overall, the incentive group completed a statistically significantly higher number of HbA1c tests compared to those in the control group. In addition, it was noted that there was an increase in test adherence for participants that received reminder letters, although not an initially expected outcome of the study. The results suggest that either a financial incentive or a reminder directed towards rural Canadians could have a benefit in promoting health behaviours to subsequent medical management of diabetes mellitus.",Canadian journal of rural medicine : the official journal of the Society of Rural Physicians of Canada = Journal canadien de la medecine rurale : le journal officiel de la Societe de medecine rurale du Canada,2023-,"Mashru J, Gagnon G, Kaus C, Gagnon Y, Moir A",5,1513,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39393003,Bringing the assessment and treatment of diabetes distress into the real world of clinical care: Time for a shift in perspective.,"Diabetes distress (DD) refers to the emotional and behavioural challenges associated with managing this demanding chronic disease over time. DD is alarmingly common and it has a significant impact on self-management behaviours and clinical outcomes. Thus, there is growing recognition that DD is a pressing problem that deserves careful attention in clinical care. Translating the application of validated DD assessment and intervention protocols from the research to the clinical setting, however, presents challenges that require a reconsideration of some common assumptions about what DD is, how prevalent it is, how it presents itself clinically, how it might best be assessed and by whom. We employed data from six large-scale studies using five common DD measures. Using these data, we review and challenge several common assumptions about DD. These data suggest that, because of its relative ubiquity, DD should not be viewed as a 'co-morbidity' or 'complication' of diabetes and it should not be seen as a mental health/illness 'condition'. Furthermore, we argue that DD assessment should: (1) be accepted as a standard part of comprehensive diabetes care, (2) occur regularly using broad rather than brief screening measures and (3) be addressed directly by diabetes clinicians, rather than exclusively by behavioural specialists. The results form the basis of a series of suggestions to enhance the translation, adoption and implementation of DD knowledge derived from the research setting directly into the real world of clinical care.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2024-Dec,"Fisher L, Guzman S, Polonsky W, Hessler D",4,1546,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The study was done using a retrospective study design. Fasting blood samples from consented patients with no previous diagnosis of diabetes and within the specified age range were collected from King Edward Hospital in Durban. The pre-diabetes diagnosis was confirmed in participants with fasting glucose concentrations between 5.6 and 6.9 mmol/L and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels between 5.7 % and 6.4 % using the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and World Health Organisation (WHO) diagnosis criteria. The study participants' characterisation was stratified according to the diagnosis criterion, age, gender and ethnicity. An alarming 68 % average pre-diabetes prevalence across ADA and WHO criteria in the Durban, eThekwini district sample population. The highest prevalence was recorded using the IFG criterion (83%) and the lowest when using the HbA1c criterion (54 %). Between the White, Black and Indian ethnic groups, the Indian group were more predisposed to pre-diabetes onset, with a prevalence of 62.7 %. If pre-diabetes management is unattended, an unprecedented increase in metabolic disorders such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and all-cause mortality incidence can be expected.

32128655,"Type 2 diabetes - unmet need, unresolved pathogenesis, mTORC1-centric paradigm.","The current paradigm of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is gluco-centric, being exclusively categorized by glycemic characteristics. The gluco-centric paradigm views hyperglycemia as the primary target, being driven by resistance to insulin combined with progressive beta cells failure, and considers glycemic control its ultimate treatment goal. Most importantly, the gluco-centric paradigm considers the non-glycemic diseases associated with T2D, e.g., obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, macrovascular disease, microvascular disease and fatty liver as 'risk factors' and/or 'outcomes' and/or 'comorbidities', rather than primary inherent disease aspects of T2D. That is in spite of their high prevalence (60-90%) and major role in profiling T2D morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the gluco-centric paradigm fails to realize that the non-glycemic diseases of T2D are driven by insulin and, except for glycemic control, response to insulin in T2D is essentially the rule rather than the exception. Failure of the gluco-centric paradigm to offer an exhaustive unifying view of the glycemic and non-glycemic diseases of T2D may have contributed to T2D being still an unmet need. An mTORC1-centric paradigm maintains that hyperactive mTORC1 drives the glycemic and non-glycemic disease aspects of T2D. Hyperactive mTORC1 is proposed to act as double-edged agent, namely, to interfere with glycemic control by disrupting the insulin receptor-Akt transduction pathway, while concomitantly driving the non-glycemic diseases of T2D. The mTORC1-centric paradigm may offer a novel perspective for T2D in terms of pathogenesis, clinical focus and treatment strategy.",Reviews in endocrine & metabolic disorders,2020-Dec,Bar-Tana J,1,1648,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Its pathophysiology is multifactorial and poorly understood and no specific therapeutic guideline has yet been established. Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a challenging diagnosis, made after excluding other potential entities, treated with different pharmacotherapeutic agents targeting various pathophysiological pathways that need yet to be unraveled. It has great clinical importance as diabetes is a disease with pandemic proportions.

A follow-up study on two independent cohorts having oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 1991/1992 and 2011-2016: Cohort 1 consisted of 406 women including 54 with GDM and 352 with a non-GDM OGTT-test and cohort 2 had 433 women diagnosed with GDM. The first cohort had nearly 25 years of follow-up and gave information on magnitude, conversion rate and type of diabetes manifestation. The second cohort was started recently to evaluate whether newer diagnostic criteria and baseline information on the old cohort are still valid for prediction of diabetes risk. The risk of manifest diabetes in cohort 1 at the end of follow-up was six times higher in women with previous GDM compared with non-GDM (RR = 6; 95% CI 4-11). We observed a 70% diabetes rate 25 years after pregnancy. Only family history of diabetes in cohort 2 was associated with conversion to manifest diabetes (p = 0.002), also after adjustment for age, BMI, non-Danish origin and smoking during pregnancy (p < 0.001) CONCLUSION: The incidence of diabetes after GDM is higher than that previously reported in Scandinavian populations and the rate of manifest diabetes rises steeply 15 years after pregnancy and after 40 years of age. The women of cohort 2 with recent GDM are at risk of DM at a higher rate.

Using a longitudinal electronic healthcare record-linkage analysis, all patients admitted to hospital in Scotland with a first episode of AP between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2012 and followed for a minimum of 5 years after their index AP admission were identified. All new-onset morbidity with specific focus on type 3c DM were analysed and, using time-split multiple regression. A total of 2047 patients were included. AP requiring critical care was followed by 2 years of heightened risk (HR 5.24) of developing type 3c DM, increased risk of new-onset cardiac disease (HR 1.61), and renal disease (HR 2.96). The additional risk conferred by critical care AP had a negative interaction with time, whereas additional risk associated with male sex and a non-gallstone aetiology was long lasting. Based on these findings, a personalized approach to include type 3c DM screening for a minimum of 2 years for individuals who required critical care when hospitalized with AP is recommended.",BJS open,2022-Nov,"Walker A, O'Kelly J, Graham C, Nowell S, Kidd D, Mole DJ",6,1258,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

37861021,From Gut to Glucose: A Comprehensive Review on Functional Foods and Dietary Interventions for Diabetes Management.,"In the realm of diabetes research, considerable attention has been directed toward elucidating the intricate interplay between the gastrointestinal tract and glucose regulation. The gastrointestinal tract, once exclusively considered for its role in digestion and nutrient assimilation, is presently acknowledged as a multifaceted ecosystem with regulatory supremacy over metabolic homeostasis and glucose metabolism. Recent studies indicate that alterations in the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota could potentially influence the regulation of glucose levels and glucose homeostasis in the body. Dysbiosis, characterized by perturbations in the equilibrium of gut microbial constituents, has been irrevocably linked to an augmented risk of diabetes mellitus (DM). Moreover, research has revealed the potential influence of the gut microbiota on important factors, like inflammation and insulin sensitivity, which are key contributors to the onset and progression of diabetes. The key protagonists implicated in the regulation of glucose encompass the gut bacteria, gut barrier integrity, and the gut-brain axis. A viable approach to enhance glycemic control while concurrently mitigating the burden of comorbidities associated with diabetes resides in the strategic manipulation of the gut environment through adapted dietary practices. This review aimed to provide a deep understanding of the complex relationship between gut health, glucose metabolism, and diabetes treatment. This study has presented an exhaustive overview of dietary therapies and functional foods that have undergone extensive research to explore their potential advantages in the management of diabetes. It looks into the role of gut health in glucose regulation, discusses the impact of different dietary elements on the course of diabetes, and evaluates how well functional foods can help with glycemic control. Furthermore, it investigates the mechanistic aspects of these therapies, including their influence on insulin sensitivity, β-cell activity, and inflammation. It deliberates on the limitations and potential prospects associated with integrating functional foods into personalized approaches to diabetes care.",Current diabetes reviews,2024-,"Patel N, Dinesh S, Sharma S",3,2214,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

To address inequity of access to diabetes-related services in remote areas of WQ, a visiting credentialled diabetes educator program (VCDEP) was developed. Using a fly-in, fly-out model of service delivery and supporting telehealth services, upskilling of rural primary healthcare professionals occurred and credentialled diabetes educator (CDE) accessibility increased in WQ. This study objectively measured the impact of the VCDEP. Practice report data from five representative VCDEP practices and five non-VCDEP practices were analysed using Pearson Chi-squared tests to ascertain associations in reporting of blood pressure (BP), HbA1c, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), total cholesterol, microalbumin, body mass index (BMI) and foot and eye examinations, as well as improvements in BP, HbA1c, eGFR, total cholesterol, microalbumin and BMI measures at two set date points. In practices involved in the VCDEP, aggregated data indicated significant increases in reporting of HbA1c (P ≤ 0.001), eGFR (P ≤ 0.001), total cholesterol (P = 0.022) and foot assessments (P = 0.015). In contrast, aggregated data from practices not involved in the VCDEP identified significant decreases in the reporting of BP and eye examinations between October 2019 and March 2021 (P = 0.034 and P = 0.007 respectively). Decreases in reporting of HbA1c, eGFR, microalbumin, BMI and foot examinations were also found, although these did not reach statistical significance.

A total of 321,525 HFwDM under triple GDMT (female:49%, median age:68[61-75] years) were included. The highest rate of prescribed combination therapy was metformin and sulfonylureas (n = 55,266). In Cox regression analysis, insülin monotherapy had the highest risk for all-cause mortality (HR:2.25, 95CI%:2.06 - 2.45), whereas combination therapy including metformin, SGLT2i, and sulfonylureas provided the most beneficial effect on survival (HR:0.29, 95CI%:0.22-0.39) when compared to patients not receiving diabetes medication. Among patients taking diabetes medications, the inclusion of SGLT2i demonstrated a survival benefit (p < 0.05), despite concurrent use of volume-retaining medications such as insulin and thiazolidinediones. Conversely, combinations of diabetes medications without SGLT2i did not demonstrate any survival benefit compared to patients not taking diabetes medication (p > 0.05).

Secondary aims are to describe the extent of haemoglobin A1c testing for evaluation of new diabetes, adequate glucose monitoring, treatment of significant hyperglycaemia and documented follow-up plans. Patients presenting to ED at the Alfred (tertiary hospital in Melbourne) have undergone screening random plasma glucose (RPG) with their first plasma biochemistry since 2015. Of the 16 268 adults screened from July to December 2015, a retrospective, cross-sectional study was undertaken evaluating those with hyperglycaemia (RPG >7.8 mmol/L) but without previously recognised diabetes as determined from coding data. After patient records were reviewed to correct for coding errors, a nested cohort of 200 such patients were further evaluated. Glucose monitoring was deemed adequate if undertaken for ≥48 h. Significant hyperglycaemia (RPG >11 mmol/L) was considered appropriately treated if insulin/hypoglycaemic agents were prescribed. Documented follow-up plans were acceptable if found in the discharge summary. Among all patients screened, 1178 had hyperglycaemia without coded diabetes. After adjusting for coding errors, the prevalence was 5.2%. Within the nested cohort, only 7.5% had a follow-up haemoglobin A1c ordered, 9.5% underwent adequate glucose monitoring, 6.5% had appropriate treatment of significant hyperglycaemia and 2% had documentation of a follow-up plan.

It is estimated that 34.2 million Americans have a diabetes diagnosis, and the prevalence of this condition has continually increased over the last two decades. This study includes patients at a large, suburban primary care practice in southwest Ohio who were considered to have uncontrolled diabetes based on their last Hemoglobin A1c of greater than 9%. Compliance with recommended annual screenings among this population was 15%. <b>Objectives:</b> The aim of this project was to improve glycemic control and increase the number of patients who received the recommended annual screenings through the implementation of nurse practitioner-driven, diabetes-focused ""Right Care"" visits.C <b>Methods:</b> This quality improvement pilot study consisted of interventions implemented over the four plan-do-study-act cycles. Each cycle included a test of change that was identified based on data from previous cycles to ensure continuous improvement throughout project implementation. Four interventions were evaluated including the utilization of a diabetes registry, implementation of a ""Right Care"" checklist during ""Right Care"" visits, use of a patient engagement tool with a focus on individualizing diabetes medication regimens, and implementation of a team-engagement plan. <b>Results:</b> Average Hemoglobin A1c reduction was 2.4% post-""Right Care"" visit. Compliance with the annual screening bundle increased to 44% over 8 weeks. Utilization of the patient/provider relationship increased visit compliance by 18%, and the team engagement plan decreased work-related stress by 12%. <b>Conclusions:</b> The implementation of ""Right Care"" visits led to improved glycemic control and increased compliance with the recommended annual screenings among patients with an A1c greater than 9%. The patient engagement tool identified key factors related to diabetes medication adherence and team engagement decreased work-related stress and improved annual fundoscopic exam screening compliance. <b>Implications for Nursing:</b> Nurse practitioner-led ""Right Care"" visits utilize the knowledge and skills of advanced practice registered nurses to improve glycemic control in patients with uncontrolled diabetes.",Journal of doctoral nursing practice,2023-Jul,"Neu T, Eppley C, Gianelis K",3,2381,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37560999,Utility of Polygenic Scores for Differentiating Diabetes Diagnosis Among Patients With Atypical Phenotypes of Diabetes.,"Misclassification of diabetes type occurs in people with atypical presentations of type 1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although current clinical guidelines suggest clinical variables and treatment response as ways to help differentiate diabetes type, they remain insufficient for people with atypical presentations. This work aimed to assess the clinical utility of 2 polygenic scores (PGSs) in differentiating between T1D and T2D. Patients diagnosed with diabetes in the UK Biobank were studied (N = 41 787), including 464 (1%) and 15 923 (38%) who met the criteria for classic T1D and T2D, respectively, and 25 400 (61%) atypical diabetes. The validity of 2 published PGSs for T1D (PGST1D) and T2D (PGST2D) in differentiating classic T1D or T2D was assessed using C statistic. The utility of genetic probability for T1D based on PGSs (GenProb-T1D) was evaluated in atypical diabetes patients. The joint performance of PGST1D and PGST2D for differentiating classic T1D or T2D was outstanding (C statistic = 0.91), significantly higher than that of PGST1D alone (0.88) and PGST2D alone (0.70), both P less than .001. Using an optimal cutoff of GenProb-T1D, 23% of patients with atypical diabetes had a higher probability of T1D and its validity was independently supported by clinical presentations that are characteristic of T1D. PGST1D and PGST2D can be used to discriminate classic T1D and T2D and have potential clinical utility for differentiating these 2 types of diseases among patients with atypical diabetes.",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2023-Dec,"Billings LK, Shi Z, Wei J, Rifkin AS, Zheng SL, Helfand BT, Ilbawi N, Dunnenberger HM, Hulick PJ, Qamar A, Xu J",11,1529,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35603258,Prevention of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes: importance of a screening program for the early detection of risk conditions in a target population.,"Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are two of the main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In their genesis, an important role is played by some behavioural risk factors that may induce the onset of further risk factors represented by hypertension, prediabetes, overweight and obesity. This study aimed to show the importance of the screening methodology for early detection of these risk conditions in order to reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes complications. We carried out a screening programme involving a cohort of people aged 45-60 in which risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes were evaluated. The subjects were then classified into four groups according to the risk conditions. A high percentage (27.0%) of the sample had some alteration in the detected anthropometric and/or clinical-laboratory parameters but were unaware of this condition and, consequently, not under therapeutic treatment. The screening programme allowed the early detection of hypertension and prediabetes or full-blown diabetes conditions in subjects who were unaware they had a pathological condition, and consequently to proceed with adequate investigations and start healthy lifestyles/pharmacological therapies. Overall, the results highlight the need to anticipate these screening campaigns, especially in men, to increase the effectiveness of the prevention programmes.",Journal of preventive medicine and hygiene,2021-Dec,"Facciolà A, Visalli G, D'Andrea G, Varvarà M, Santoro G, Cuffari R, DI Pietro A",7,1407,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis on 500 patients who attended the Endocrinology department at a quaternary health care center in Kerala between November 2017 and April 2018. Patients above the age of 30 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) were included. They underwent a detailed medical history, dilated fundus examination for DR, assessment and grading of DPN, and blood investigations. Among these, 49 randomly selected patients without DR had peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) assessed by optical coherence tomogram. RNFL and GCIPL changes in different grades of neuropathy were evaluated. Out of 500 patients, 303 (60.6%) were males and 197 (39.4%) were females. Prevalence of DR was 48% and DPN 71.8%. Risk factors for the development of DR included duration of DM >15 years, HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) greater than 6.5%, serum creatinine more than 1.5 mg/dl, and the presence of DPN. There was a statistically significant association between DR and DPN. There was significant thinning of GCIPL in patients with moderate to severe neuropathy without DR. There is a significant association between DR and DPN and their severities. There are early changes in inner retinal layers of diabetic patients without microvascular changes of DR. These neurodegenerative changes parallel DPN in the course of DM.

39019572,New Perspectives and Prospects of microRNA Delivery in Diabetic Wound Healing.,"The remarkable potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) as a class of biotherapeutic agents in the treatment of diverse pathological conditions has garnered significant interest in recent years. To heal both acute and chronic wounds, miRNAs work by post-transcriptionally controlling various proteins and the pathways that are linked to them. Diabetes mellitus predisposes to several macro- and microvascular defects of end organs such as atherosclerosis, peripheral artery disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and impaired wound healing. Here, miRNAs emerge as a beacon of hope, with the capacity to heal diabetic wounds by precisely modulating the expression of genes involved in the healing process. Despite the therapeutic promise, the journey to realizing the full potential of miRNAs is fraught with challenges. Their intrinsic instability and the inefficient delivery into target cells pose significant barriers to their clinical application. Consequently, a major focus of current research is the discovery of novel miRNAs and the development of innovative delivery systems that can effectively transport these nucleic acids into the cells where they are needed most. This review delves into the intricate roles that miRNAs play at various stages of diabetic wound healing, providing a comprehensive overview of the latest research findings. The review also addresses the obstacles and opportunities that come with translating miRNA-based strategies into clinical practice, offering a critical assessment of the field's advancements and the hurdles that remain to be overcome.

36127565,A simulation model estimates lifetime health and economic outcomes of screening prediabetes using the 1-h plasma glucose.,"The current method to diagnose impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is based on the 2-h plasma glucose (2-hPG) value during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Robust evidence demonstrates that the 1-h post-load plasma glucose (1-hPG) ≥ 8.6 mmol/L in those with normal glucose tolerance is highly predictive of type 2 diabetes (T2D), micro and macrovascular complications and mortality. The aim of this study was to conduct a health economic analysis to estimate long-term cost-effectiveness of using the 1-hPG compared to the 2-hPG for screening and assessing the risk of diabetes over 35 years. The main outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A Monte Carlo-based Markov simulation model was developed to forecast long-term effects of two screening strategies with regards to clinical and cost-effectiveness outcomes. The base case model included 20,000 simulated patients over 35-years follow-up. Transition probabilities on disease progression, mortality, effects on preventive treatments and complications were retrieved from landmark diabetes studies. Direct medical costs were sourced from published literature and inflated to 2019 Euros. In the lifetime analysis, the 1-hPG was projected to increase the number of years free from disease (2 years per patient); to delay the onset of T2D (1 year per patient); to reduce the incidence of T2D complications (0·6 RR-Relative Risk per patient) and to increase the QALY gained (0·58 per patient). Even if the 1-hPG diagnostic method resulted in higher initial costs associated with preventive treatment, long-term diabetes-related costs as well as complications costs were reduced leading to a lifetime saving of - 31225719.82€. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was - 8214.7€ per each QALY gained for the overall population. Screening prediabetes with the 1-hPG is feasible and cost-effective resulting in reduced costs per QALY. Notwithstanding, the higher initial costs of testing with the 1-hPG compared to the 2-hPG due to incremental preventive intervention, long-term diabetes and complications costs were reduced projecting an overall cost saving of - 8214.7€ per each QALY gained.",Acta diabetologica,2023-Jan,"Andellini M, Manco M, Esposito MT, Tozzi AE, Bergman M, Ritrovato M",6,2174,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33441264,Integrated quality assessment for diabetes care in Portuguese primary health care using prevention quality indicators.,"This study evaluates the prevention quality indicators (PQI) for Diabetes Mellitus (DM) in Portugal using contemporary data and explores their variability according to Primary Health Care (PHC) quality indicators. We conducted a retrospective observational analysis of secondary data comprising Portuguese PHC indicators by health centres group (ACES) and the National Hospital Morbidity Database. We calculated and analysed age-sex-adjusted rates for each PQI. Worse-performing ACES were identified using the 2017 median PQI values as an assessment cut-off. A multivariate logistic analysis was carried to find variables associated with the likelihood of being a worse-performing ACES for the biennium. The median values of the indicator PQI93 - Prevention Quality Diabetes Composite were 79 and 65.2 hospitalizations per 100 000 pop, in 2016 and 2017 respectively. Diabetes long term complications (PQI 03) accounted for most of the hospitalizations. The quality indicator in PHC with greater influence on PQI93 was the proportion of DM patients with <65 years with test results for HbA1c < = 6.5%. This study shows that some PHC quality indicators are closely related to DM care, and so their monitoring is of high importance.

36418058,Barriers and enablers to diabetic retinopathy screening: a cross-sectional survey of young adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in the UK.,"Diabetic retinopathy screening (DRS) attendance in young adults (YAs) is consistently below recommended levels. The aim of this study was to identify barriers and enablers of DRS attendance among YAs in the UK living with type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). YAs (18-34 years) were invited to complete an anonymous online survey in June 2021 assessing agreement with 30 belief statements informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) of behavior change describing potential barriers/enablers to DRS. In total, 102 responses were received. Most had T1D (65.7%) and were regular attenders for DRS (76.5%). The most salient TDF domains for DRS attendance were '<i>Goals</i>', with 93% agreeing that DRS was a high priority, and '<i>Knowledge</i>', with 98% being aware that screening can detect eye problems early.Overall, 67.4% indicated that they would like greater appointment flexibility <i>(Environmental context/resources</i>) and 31.3% reported difficulties getting time off work/study to attend appointments <i>(Environmental context/resources</i>). This was more commonly reported by occasional non-attenders versus regular attenders (59.1% vs 23.4%, p=0.002). Most YAs were worried about diabetic retinopathy (74.3%), anxious when receiving screening results (63%) (<i>Emotion</i>) and would like more support after getting their results (66%) (<i>Social influences</i>). Responses for T1D and T2D were broadly similar, although those with T2D were more likely have developed strategies to help them to remember their appointments (63.6% vs 37.9%, p=0.019) (<i>Behavioral regulation</i>). Attendance for DRS in YAs is influenced by complex interacting behavioral factors.

34854892,Ocular Sequelae in a Population-Based Cohort of Youth Diagnosed With Diabetes During a 50-Year Period.,"Despite the increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) diagnosed in childhood, little is known about the natural history of ocular sequelae in youth-onset T2D compared with type 1 diabetes (T1D). To assess the risk of developing diabetes-associated ocular complications among youth diagnosed with diabetes. This retrospective, population-based medical record review included all residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota (95.7% White in 1990), diagnosed with diabetes at younger than 22 years (hereinafter referred to as children) from January 1, 1970, through December 31, 2019. Risk of developing ocular complications over time. Among 1362 individuals with a diagnostic code of diabetes, medical record reviews confirmed a diagnosis of T1D or T2D in 606 children, of whom 525 (86.6%) underwent at least 1 eye examination (mean [SD] age at diabetes diagnosis, 12.1 [5.4] years; 264 [50.3%] male). Diabetes-associated ocular complications occurred in 147 of the 461 children (31.2%) with T1D and in 17 of the 64 children (26.6%) with T2D. The hazard ratio illustrating the risk between T2D and T1D rates was 1.88 (95% CI, 1.13-3.12; P = .02) for developing any diabetic retinopathy (nonproliferative or greater), 2.33 (95% CI, 0.99-5.50; P = .048) for proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 1.49 (95% CI, 0.46-4.89; P = .50) for diabetic macular edema, 2.43 (95% CI, 0.54-11.07; P = .24) for a visually significant cataract, and 4.06 (95% CI, 1.34-12.33; P = .007) for requiring pars plana vitrectomy by 15 years after the diagnosis of diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and the need for pars plana vitrectomy occurred within a shorter diabetes duration for children with T2D compared with T1D in this population-based cohort. Children with T2D had almost twice the risk of developing retinopathy compared with those with T1D. These findings suggest that to prevent serious ocular complications, children with T2D may require ophthalmoscopic evaluations at least as frequently as or more frequently than children with T1D.",JAMA ophthalmology,2022-Jan,"Bai P, Barkmeier AJ, Hodge DO, Mohney BG",4,2053,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35098857,Mother-Infant Dyad program in primary care: evidence-based postpartum care following gestational diabetes.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a common complication of pregnancy, is associated with a 10-fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to the general population. Evidence-based guidelines recommend that patients with GDM receive postpartum care for T2DM risk reduction including an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 4-12 weeks after delivery, yet half of patients with GDM did not return for their postpartum visits by 12 weeks postpartum. Additionally, only 10% utilize primary care within 12 months of delivery and one-third of GDM patients receive timely postpartum OGTT. To determine if the Mother-Infant Dyad postpartum primary care program provides a framework to link well-child visits with postpartum primary care visits to increase postpartum clinical interactions promoting longitudinal care, such as postpartum visit attendance and T2DM screening. All patients with a diagnosis of GDM that received care at a postpartum mother-infant dyad program at a Midwestern academic medical center internal medicine and pediatrics primary care clinic were enrolled. Clinic level data was obtained by baseline and 6-month post-enrollment surveys and chart review. A comparison population was identified from Medicaid claims data using propensity score matching to enable a comparison of program participants' outcomes to a population comprised of similar individuals diagnosed with GDM that received care at sites not participating in the Dyad program. Our primary outcome was completion of T2DM screening in the 4-12 week postpartum period. The secondary outcomes were postpartum visit attendance with a prenatal provider, and prediabetes diagnoses. A total of 75 mother-infant dyads were seen by the clinic. Of the enrolled women, 43% were Non-Hispanic White and 30% were Non-Hispanic Black; mean age was 30.75 years. The matched comparison group (<i>n</i> = 62) had a mean age of 30.75 years, were 43% Non-Hispanic White and 30% Non-Hispanic Black. Women who participated in the program were more likely to receive T2DM screenings than women who did not participate (87 vs. 79%, <i>p</i><.001) and complete postpartum visits (95 vs. 58%, respectively; <i>p</i><.001). Additionally, a higher rate of new prediabetes diagnoses was observed (12 vs. 6%, <i>p</i> < .001). The Mother-Infant Dyad postpartum primary care program improved T2DM screenings and postpartum visit attendance. In addition, a greater proportion of Dyad program participants experienced new prediabetes diagnoses that those in the comparison group. Our findings suggest that the dyad care model, in which women with GDM engage in postpartum primary care concurrent with well-child visits, can improve longitudinal postpartum care after a GDM diagnosis.","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2022-Dec,"Bose Brill S, May S, Lorenz AM, Spence D, Prater L, Shellhaas C, Otsubo M, Mao S, Flanigan M, Thung S, Leonard M, Jiang F, Oza-Frank R",13,2750,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35752540,Direct and indirect costs of heart failure in relation to diabetes status - A nationwide study.,"Heart failure (HF) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are burdensome chronic diseases with high lifetime risks and numerous studies indicate associations between HF and DM. The objective of this study was to investigate the direct and indirect costs of HF patients with and without DM. Patients with a first-time diagnosis of HF from 1998 to 2016 were identified through nationwide Danish registries and stratified according to DM status into HF with or without DM. The economic healthcare cost analysis was based on both direct costs, including hospitalization, procedures, medication and indirect costs including social welfare and lost productivity. The economic burden was investigated prior to, at, and following diagnosis of HF. Patients with concomitant HF and DM were younger (median age 74 vs. 77), had more comorbidities and fewer were female as compared to patients with HF but without DM. The socioeconomic burden of concomitant HF and DM compared to HF alone was substantially higher; 45% in direct costs (€16,237 vs. €11,184), 35% in home care costs (€3123 vs. €2320), 8% in social transfer income (€17,257 vs. €15,994) and they had 27% lower income (€10,136 vs. €13,845). The economic burden peaked at year of diagnosis, but the difference became increasingly pronounced in the years following the HF diagnosis.

One such disorder involves biallelic mutations in the gene encoding endoplasmic reticulum resident co-chaperone DNAJC3 (P58<sup>IPK</sup> ) that leads to diabetes in the second decade of life, in addition to multiple endocrine dysfunction and nervous system involvement. The aim of this study was to define the natural history of this new form of diabetes, especially the course of abnormalities related to glucose metabolism. Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing was used to detect DNAJC3 defect in two patients. Detailed analysis of their clinical history as well as biochemical, neurological and radiological studies were carried out to deduce natural history of neurological and endocrine phenotype. DNAJC3 defect led to beta-cell dysfunction causing hyperinsulinemichypoglycemia around 2 years of age in both patients, which evolved into diabetes with insulin deficiency in the second decade of life, probably due to beta cell loss. Endocrine phenotype involved severe early-onset growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency, and hypothyroidism of central origin. Neurological phenotype involved early onset sensorineural deafness discovered around 5 to 6 years, and neurodegeneration of central and peripheral nervous system in the first two decades of life.

38220557,Reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the problem areas in diabetes (PAID) survey: Results from diabetes MILES - Turkey.,"To 1) assess the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID), PAID-5 and PAID-1 survey among Turkish adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, 2) estimate the level of elevated diabetes-specific distress (DD), and 3) determine the demographic and clinical correlates of DD-symptom severity. From 2017-2019, 252 adults with type 1(n = 80) (T1DM) or type 2 diabetes (n = 172) (T2DM) self-reported demographic factors, DD(PAID) and related psychological and clinical questionnaires. We examined PAID internal consistency, structural and convergent validity. Associations of measures with DD were explored with hierarchical linear regression analysis. PCA yielded a 3-factor solution for PAID-20 and a 2-factor solution for PAID-5. Cronbach's α for PAID/PAID-5 subscales ranged from 0.63-0.90. All PAID versions correlated most strongly to BIPQ and HFS. The prevalence of elevated distress (PAID-20 ≥33) was 40% in T1DM and 15% in T2DM. DD severity was significantly positively associated (p < 0.01) with more negative diabetes perceptions (BIPQ) and type 1 diabetes. The Turkish translation of the PAID and its short forms appeared to have satisfactory psychometric properties.

We focused on a cohort of diabetic patients with HHCN belonging to Resource Utilization Bands 4 and 5 according to the Adjusted Clinical Group (ACG) system. Their comorbidities were assessed using the clinical diagnoses that the ACG system assigns to single patients by combining different information flows. Regression models were applied to analyze the associations between comorbidities and health care service use or costs, adjusting for age and sex. Our analyses showed that all health care service usage measures (e.g. access to emergency care; number of outpatient visits) and the total annual costs and pharmacy costs are associated significantly with comorbidity class. Instead, no differences in hospitalization rates by comorbidity class were revealed. The association between a larger number of comorbidities and higher total health care service usage and costs was seen mainly for primary care services. This underscores the need to strengthen primary care for today's aging and multimorbid population.",Primary care diabetes,2021-Apr,"Buja A, Caberlotto R, Pinato C, Mafrici SF, Bolzonella U, Grotto G, Baldovin T, Rigon S, Toffanin R, Baldo V",10,1213,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

37915229,The Fusion Clinic: Integrating the care of people with severe mental illness and diabetes.,"People with coexisting severe mental illness (SMI) and type 2 diabetes have a shorter life expectancy and poorer diabetes outcomes than those without SMI. This is partly explained by the separate treatment of diabetes and SMI, which occurs in parallel silos in many healthcare systems. The Steno Diabetes Center Sjaelland and Region Zealand established the Fusion Clinic to offer combined psychiatric and diabetes care delivered by both diabetes and mental healthcare professionals. This study describes how the clinic was established and the initial diabetes outcomes. The Fusion Clinic was co-designed by people with diabetes and SMI and healthcare professionals to improve the care of adults with diabetes and SMI. The clinic approach utilised the F-ACT model. The 63 people referred to the Fusion Clinic between 01.02.2020 and 01.01.2022 who attended the clinic for more than 6 months were included in this study. Diabetes outcomes were recorded in the electronic medical records (Sundhedsplatformen EPIC). There was a high prevalence of diabetes complications at baseline. Furthermore, 70% had one or more additional concomitant diseases, as well as SMI and diabetes. Assessment of diabetes complications and measurements of HbA<sub>1c</sub> and lipid profile improved after referral to the clinic. HbA<sub>1c</sub> declined during the first 6 months of attendance at the clinic.

A modelling study by the small area estimation method, based on a nationwide cross-sectional survey, Iran STEPwise approach to surveillance (STEPS) 2016, was performed. The modelling estimated the prevalence, awareness of diagnosis, treatment coverage, and effective control of diabetes in all 429 districts of Iran based on data from available districts. The modelling results were provided in different geographical and socio-economic scales to make the comparison possible across the country. In 2016, the prevalence of diabetes ranged from 3.2 to 19.8% for women and 2.4 to 19.1% for men. The awareness of diagnosis ranged from 51.9 to 95.7% for women and 35.7 to 100% for men. The rate of treatment coverage ranged from 37.2 to 85.6% for women and 24.4 to 80.5% for men. The rate of effective control ranged from 12.1 to 63.6% for women and 12 to 73% for men. The highest treatment coverage rates belonged to Ardebil for women and Shahr-e-kord for men. The highest effective control rates belonged to Sanandaj for women and Nehbandan for men. Across Iran districts, there were considerable differences between the highest and lowest rates of prevalence, diagnosis awareness, treatment coverage, and effective control of diabetes. The concentration indices of diabetes prevalence, awareness of diagnosis, and treatment coverage were positive and significant for both sexes.

36146952,Temporal trends in patients with peripheral artery disease influenced by diabetes mellitus in Germany.,"In patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Because huge efforts are made to improve medical care of patients with DM including chronic disease programs, the aim of the present study was to investigate temporal trends regarding the clinical burden of DM on PAD patients within a 15-year observational period. We analyzed all patients hospitalized because of PAD between 2005 and 2019 in Germany stratified regarding DM. Overall, 2 654 871 hospitalizations of PAD patients (865 823 with DM) were included. Hospitalizations based on PAD inclined from 142 778 in 2005 to 190 135 in 2019 (β 3956 per year; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3034-4878, p < .001) with simultaneous increase of hospitalizations of PAD patients with DM (2005: 41609 (29.1%) versus 2019: 65 302 (34.3%); β 2019 per year [95% CI 1593-2446], p < .001).

35077560,Cardiovascular disease preventive medication dispensing for almost every New Zealander 65 years and over: a preventive treatment paradox?,"To describe the dispensing of cardiovascular disease (CVD) preventive medications among older New Zealanders with and without prior CVD or diabetes. New Zealanders aged ≥65 years in 2013 were identified using anonymised linkage of national administrative health databases. Dispensing of blood pressure lowering (BPL), lipid lowering (LL) or antithrombotic (AT) medications, was documented, stratified by age and by history of CVD, diabetes, or neither. Of the 593,549 people identified, 32% had prior CVD, 14% had diabetes (of whom half also had prior CVD) and 61% had neither diagnosis. For those with prior CVD, between 79-87% were dispensed BPL and 73-79% were dispensed AT medications, across all age groups. In contrast, LL dispensing was lower than either BPL or AT in every age group, falling from 75% at age 65-69 years to 43% at 85+ years. For people with diabetes, BPL and LL dispensing was similar to those with prior CVD, but AT dispensing was approximately 20% lower. Among people without prior CVD or diabetes, both BPL and AT dispensing increased with age (from 39% and 17% at age 65-69 years to 56% and 35% at 85+ years respectively), whereas LL dispensing was 26-31% across the 65-84 year age groups, falling to 17% at 85+ years.

39470889,"A novel (-)-(2S)-7,4'-dihydroxyflavanone compound for treating age-related diabetes mellitus through immunoinformatics-guided activation of CISD3.","The iron-sulfur domain (CISD) proteins of CDGSH are classified into three classes: CISD1, CISD2, and CISD3. During premature ageing, mutations that affect these proteins, namely their binding sites, could result in reduced protein production and an inability to preserve cellular integrity. Consequently, this leads to the development of conditions such as diabetes. Notably, CISD3 plays a crucial role in the management of age-related disorders such as Wolfram syndrome, which is often referred to as DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness). Computational analyses have predicted that CISD3 regulates the redox state, safeguards the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, and maintains intracellular calcium levels. CISD3, a member of a recently discovered gene family associated with the CDGSH iron protein apoptotic compensatory response, fulfils a crucial function in mitigating the effects of accelerated ageing. The compound ""(-)-(2S)-7,4'-Dihydroxyflavanone"" has been discovered by computational drug design as a possible activator of CISD3. It shows potential therapeutic benefits in ameliorating metabolic dysfunction and enhancing glucose regulation. The ligand binds to the binding pocket of the CISD3 protein, increasing the stability of the protein and enhancing its functionality. The current research investigates the binding processes of the molecule in various structures and its anticipated effects on these tissues, therefore providing valuable insights into the mitigation of age-related diabetes and metabolic dysfunction. The projected tripling of the worldwide population of individuals aged 50 and above by 2050 necessitates the urgent development of immunoinformatics-based approaches, including pharmaceutical therapies that target CISD3, to prevent age-related pathologies. The stimulation of CISD3, namely by compounds such as ""(-)-(2S)-7,4'-Dihydroxyflavanone"", has the potential to counteract telomere shortening and improve metabolic pathways.",Biogerontology,2024-Oct,"Munir AR, Baig SI, Razzaq MA, Rauf F, Ali Y, Azam SMA",6,2012,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted using a standard predesigned and pretested structured questionnaire through online mode in the month of April 2021 to assess the criteria used for referral of diabetic patients for DR screening, barriers to DR screening, and the management plan among physicians after the patient has been diagnosed with DR. In total, 100 physicians participated in the study. Physicians responded that criteria used for referral for DR screening according to duration was <5 years (n = 0), 5-10 years (n = 60), >10 years (n = 10), and irrespective of the duration (n = 30). According to severity, well-controlled DM without (n = 30) and with other system involvement (n = 50) and uncontrolled DM without (20) and with other system involvement (n = 50) and irrespective of the severity of disease (n = 30) was reported. Physicians (n = 40) responded that patients who were diagnosed with DR belonged to the Type 1 DM category rather than Type 2 DM (P < 0.05). With regard to the barriers and challenges faced in ensuring DR screening, the following themes emerged: no ocular symptoms, lack of compliance, time constraint for the patient, and lack of motivation. We found that the preferred practice pattern of physicians regarding referral for DR screening was dependent on the duration of the disease (mostly 5-10 years of the disease) and severity (when other systems were involved).

Stringent criteria for literature inclusion and exclusion were defined. Searches were conducted across four English databases to gather randomized controlled trials investigating exercise interventions for cognitive function in people living with diabetes. Outcome indicators from 1193 subjects across 12 articles were analyzed using RevMan 5.4 software. Exercise intervention demonstrated the ability to mitigate cognitive decline in people living with diabetes, with a combined effect size (standardized mean difference) of 0.91, 95% CI: 0.28, 1.54, P < 0.00001. The intervention effect showed significant modulation by intervention content (I2 = 95%), intervention duration (I2 = 95%), intervention frequency (I2 = 95%), and intervention cycle (I2 = 96%). Among these factors, multi-component exercise, sessions >40 minutes, exercise frequency >4 times per week, and sustained exercise for >6 months were paramount, all with P < 0.05.

33199194,Diabetes care innovation in the Mexican Institute for Social Insurance: Scaling up the preventive chronic disease care model to address critical coverage constraints.,"With diabetes prevalence in Mexico at 11.3% of adults, the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) is piloting the Chronic Disease Preventive Model (CDPM). CDPM includes intensive patient education, care by multidisciplinary teams and risk management in primary care. The objective of this article is to determine CDPM coverage bottlenecks and to explore facilitators and barriers to implementation. The National Health and Nutrition Survey 2018 was processed to identify key diabetes prevalence, coverage, quality and outcome indicators. Key IMSS informant interviews and document content analyses were undertaken following the Tanahashi coverage decay model and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). IMSS screens 49% of adult beneficiaries for diabetes but only 26% with presumptive diagnosis proceed to confirmation. Out of 4.1 million adults with diabetes, IMSS diagnoses 94% and treats 85%. Medications are received by 90% of patients but only 63% of those requiring insulin receive it. The overall quality of care indicator attains 37% of potential. Coverage of diabetes education, monitoring with HbA1c and interdisciplinary care are 20%, 15% and 3%, respectively. Among IMSS beneficiaries treated by the institute 38.1% have HbA1c levels below 7% and 26.1% have levels above 9%. CDPM facilitators are the perceived threat of uncontrolled diabetes, compatibility of innovation values and willingness for institutional learning. Barriers are centralized decision making, functional differentiation across managers and practitioners and lack of incentives, resource shortages and the lack of measures to ensure fidelity. CDPM scale-up has to address organizational and process barriers while ensuring the necessary resources for sustainability.",Primary care diabetes,2021-Apr,"González Block MÁ, Díaz Portillo SP, Morales HR, Rodríguez Saldaña J, Gutiérrez Calderón E",5,1779,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34739523,Alleviating the burden of diabetes with Health Equity Funds: Economic evaluation of the health and financial risk protection benefits in Cambodia.,"In Cambodia, diabetes caused nearly 3% of the country's mortality in 2016 and became the fourth highest cause of disability in 2017. Providing sufficient financial risk protection from health care expenditures may be part of the solution towards effectively tackling the diabetes burden and motivating individuals to appropriately seek care to effectively manage their condition. In this study, we aim to estimate the distributional health and financial impacts of strategies providing financial coverage for diabetes services through the Health Equity Funds (HEF) in Cambodia. The trajectory of diabetes was represented using a Markov model to estimate the societal costs, health impacts, and individual out-of-pocket expenditures associated with six strategies of HEF coverage over a time horizon of 45 years. Input parameters for the model were compiled from published literature and publicly available household survey data. Strategies covered different combinations of types of diabetes care costs (i.e., diagnostic services, medications, and management of diabetes-related complications). Health impacts were computed as the number of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted and financial risk protection was analyzed in terms of cases of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) averted. Model simulations demonstrated that coverage for medications would be cost-effective, accruing health benefits ($27 per DALY averted) and increases in financial risk protection ($2 per case of CHE averted) for the poorest in Cambodia. Women experienced particular gains in health and financial risk protection. Increasing the number of individuals eligible for financial coverage also improved the value of such investments. For HEF coverage, the government would pay between an estimated $28 and $58 per diabetic patient depending on the extent of coverage and services covered. Efforts to increase the availability of services and capacity of primary care facilities to support diabetes care could have far-reaching impacts on the burden of diabetes and contribute to long-term health system strengthening.",PloS one,2021-,"Feldhaus I, Nagpal S, Verguet S",3,2107,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35939485,Is mental health co-morbidity an influencing factor in the health service utilisation of women with diabetes mellitus?,"Diabetes Mellitus, affecting nearly half a billion people worldwide, is a substantial global public health issue. Although diabetes predominantly affects men, women with diabetes have specific risks and self-management characteristics. Women have a higher risk of either presenting with or developing depression or anxiety, as well as being high users of complementary medicine which can create clinical governance issues. In spite of these known gender differences, limited research has explored gender-specific diabetes care, especially health service use patterns. As increasing attention has turned to supporting people with diabetes to successfully self-manage their diabetes, it is important that we understand how women with diabetes are using health services, and if their specific risk profile is influencing their health care choices. Our study sought to examine the relationship between mental health status and the patterns of conventional and complementary medicine health service use by women diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Our results showed that women with diabetes and any mental health co-morbidity were more likely to visit their general practitioner more frequently or use herbal medicine than those without a mental health co-morbidity. Women with depression and anxiety were also less likely to consult a physiotherapist and those with anxiety less likely to consult a podiatrist over time when compared to the other mental health groups.",PloS one,2022-,"Oorschot T, Adams J, Sibbritt D",3,1463,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39521723,Investigating health professionals' perspectives and experiences of food security-related conversations in diabetes care.,"Household food insecurity (FI) is a serious public health concern and disproportionately affects people living with chronic health conditions, undermining diabetes self-management. Little is known about healthcare professionals' (HCPs) experiences of supporting people affected by diabetes and FI, and no national guidelines incorporate consideration of FI within UK diabetes care. A qualitative study of NHS HCPs' consideration of FI within diabetes care, and the extent to which it informs their clinical practice, was undertaken. Fifteen HCPs providing self-management support to people with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes in a Scottish Health Board took part in semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using a thematic framework approach informed by the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour (COM-B) model of behaviour change. Although the potential impact of FI on diabetes self-management was recognised, this important consideration was not currently core to their clinical practice. Enablers and barriers identified included: personal feelings about raising the issue, lack of knowledge of available resources, the patient-practitioner relationship, and the wider socioeconomic environment. Practical suggestions to support HCPs included: specific training on communication, access to patient support information, use of a screening tool to assess FI, and building NHS-third sector links. Our findings provide insight into cognitive factors, emotional processes and environmental systems impacting on HCPs' practice supporting individuals with diabetes and FI.

Questionnaires were administered to 321 certified diabetes educator nurses from 1277 institutions. The practice of periodontal care was assessed, with factors contributing to periodontal care through items developed based on the capability, opportunity, and motivation-behavior model. Fisher's exact tests and logistic regression were performed. >70% of certified diabetes educator nurses did not provide periodontal care for diabetes patients. The respondents who assessed people's oral conditions were more likely to engage in individual or group education and consult for oral management professionals than those who did not. Significant factors for such assessment were low psychological capability and reflective motivation, irregular and weak intention to engage in oral management, and working at an institution without an outpatient department specializing in diabetes. The education for certified diabetes educator nurses who do not work at an institution with an outpatient department specialized in diabetes care should be prioritized. Particularly, education to improve knowledge, skills, and confidence in oral assessments and to make periodontal management regular is needed.",Primary care diabetes,2021-Oct,"Shibayama T, Kudoh R, Hidaka K",3,1388,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We compared the frequency and results of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing in adults with early-onset and usual-onset diabetes and assessed factors related to guideline concordance. Population-level databases from Alberta, Canada (∼4.5 million) were used to identify adults with incident diabetes. The cohort was stratified by age at diagnosis (< 40 vs. ≥ 40 years) and then followed for 365 days for HbA1c testing. Adjusted multivariable analyses were used to identify clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with guideline concordance. Among 23,643 adults with incident diabetes (mean age 54.1 ± 15.4 years; 42.1 % female), 18.9 % had early-onset diabetes. Early-onset diabetes was associated with lower frequency of testing (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 0.80; 95 % CI 0.70-0.90) and above target glycaemic levels compared to usual-onset diabetes (aOR, 1.45; 95 % CI 1.29-1.64). Factors associated with guideline concordant frequency of HbA1c testing were rural residence and insulin use. In our universal care setting with premium-free health care, early-onset diabetes was associated with lower rates of HbA1c testing and sub-optimal glycaemic control compared to those with usual-onset diabetes.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,2024-Jul,"Sriskandarajah A, Metcalfe A, Nerenberg KA, Butalia S",4,1369,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39696157,"Identify unmet needs in diabetes care in Shandong, China: a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study using cascade of care framework.","The continuum management of diabetes remains under-evaluated in China. This study aimed to estimate the proportions of diabetes adults at each stage of the cascade of care framework in Shandong, China. We conducted a secondary analysis using the 2018 China Adult Chronic Disease and Nutrition Surveillance (CACDNS) data in Shandong. This nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted between September and November 2018, investigating the major chronic diseases among Chinese adults through interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory tests. We employed the cascade model to examine the proportion of diabetes adults, including both type 1 and type 2, from diabetes screening, diagnosis, pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical treatments, to single and comprehensive management targets, and quantified the attrition between each stage. Diabetes screening was defined as participants reported to have ever received a blood glucose test. Diabetes diagnosis was defined as: 1) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥ 126 mg/dL, or 2) 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (2 h-OGTT) ≥ 200 mg/dL, or 3) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5%, or 4) self-reported diabetes. Diabetes management targets included: 1) single glycemic target of personalized HbA1c level, 2) comprehensive ABC targets of personalized HbA1c level, blood pressure (BP) < 140/80 mm Hg, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) level < 2.6 mmol/L, 3) lifestyle target of not currently smoking. The estimated proportion was calculated through self-reported diabetes status and FPG, 2h-OGTT and HbA1c. The number of diabetes cases in Shandong was extrapolated using the 2018 provincial census data for adults aged 18 years and above (N = 80.6 million). The cascade of diabetes care was further examined by age, sex, and Basic Public Health Service (BPHS) enrollment. This secondary analysis included 8,462 individuals (47.8% males, median age: 49.0), among whom 12.4% had diabetes (self-reported: 4.2%, newly diagnosed: 8.2%) and 41.1% had prediabetes. In 2018, an estimated 9.2 million adults in Shandong had diabetes, with 6.4 million (69.6%) receiving diabetes screening but 6.2 million (67.7%) remaining unaware of their conditions. Among self-reported diabetes adults, 2.7 million (86.4%) and 2.8 million (89.6%) received pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical treatment, respectively. Of those with treatments, 1.2 million (58.2%) met personalized glycemic target. A rapid decline, however, was observed in BP (31.1%) and LDL-c (39.3%) control among diabetes patients with multimorbidity (≥ 2 diseases). Ultimately, 0.1 million self-reported diabetes adults (3.8%) achieved the ABC targets. BPHS Enrollment slightly improved comprehensive management with ABC targets. A significant unmet need exists for diabetes adults from screening to management, particularly the comprehensive management of glycemia, BP and LDL-c levels among those with multimorbidity. Tailored strategies and appropriate allocation of healthcare resource is needed to addressing gaps in care continuum and reduce long-term disease burden.",BMC endocrine disorders,2024-Dec,"Wang Y, Ren J, Chai X, Wang Y, Lu Z, Dong J, Guo X, Yin X, Zhang J, Tang J, Ma J, Shao R",12,3073,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Their simultaneous development remains disputable. The aim of the present study was to examine the correlation between CAN and the presence/severity of DSPN in DM. Subjects with type 1 (group A: n=51; mean age 40.4 years) and type 2 DM (group B: n=153; mean age 64.6 years) were studied. Evaluation of DSPN was based on neuropathy disability score. Assessment of CAN was based on the battery of 4 standardized cardiovascular autonomic function tests. In group A, patients with moderate/severe DSPN exhibited a 12-fold higher likelihood of CAN in univariate analysis (p=0.035). However, significance was lost after adjustment for gender, age, DM duration, and haemoglobin A1c. In group A, likelihood for CAN did not correlate with the presence of mild DSPN in univariate and multivariate analysis. In group B, likelihood of CAN was similar in patients with mild and in those with moderate/severe DSPN compared with patients without DSPN in univariate and multivariate analysis. In between group comparison CAN was similarly distributed in the 2 groups (p for interaction=0.367), in patients with no, mild and moderate/severe DSPN.

34689778,Are racial/ethnic minorities recently diagnosed with diabetes less likely than white individuals to receive guideline-directed diabetes preventive care?,"Diabetes mellitus has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. As the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise, the burden of disease is divided unevenly among different populations. Racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes care are pervasive, including the provision of care for prevention of complications. Prevention efforts should be focused on the time that immediately follows a diagnosis of diabetes. The aim of this study was to assess racial/ethnic differences in the receipt of guideline-directed diabetes care for complication prevention by individuals recently diagnosed with diabetes. We used repeated cross-sections of individuals recently diagnosed with diabetes (within the past 5 years) from the National Health Interview Survey from 2011 to 2017. Multivariate regression was used to estimate the associations between race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic) and guideline-directed process measures for prevention of diabetes complications (visits to an eye and foot specialist, and blood pressure and cholesterol checks by a health professional - each in the prior year). We assessed effect modification of these associations by socioeconomic status (SES). In a sample of 7,341 participants, Hispanics had lower rates of having any insurance coverage (75.9 %) than Non-Hispanic Whites (93.2 %) and Blacks (88.1 %; p<0.001). After adjustment for demographics, total comorbidities, SES, and health insurance status, Hispanics were less likely to have an eye exam in the prior year (OR 0.80; (95 % CI 0.65-0.99); p=0.04) and a blood pressure check (OR 0.42; (95 % CI 0.28-0.65); p<0.001) compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. There was no significant effect modification of race/ethnicity by SES. Hispanics recently diagnosed with diabetes were less likely to receive some indicators of guideline-directed care for the prevention of complications. Lack of insurance and SES may partially explain those differences. Future work should consider policy change and providers' behaviors linked to racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes care.",BMC health services research,2021-Oct,"Marcondes FO, Cheng D, Alegria M, Haas JS",4,2080,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34952840,Maximum body mass index before onset of type 2 diabetes is independently associated with advanced diabetic complications.,"The maximum body mass index (BMI) before onset of type 2 diabetes (MBBO) might be used to estimate a patient's insulin secretion capacity. There have been few factors that can predict future diabetic complications at the time of diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. This study aimed to clarify the clinical usefulness of MBBO for predicting the development of advanced diabetic microvascular complications. This was a cross-sectional observational study. Of 1304 consecutively admitted patients with type 2 diabetes, we enrolled 435 patients for whom we could confirm their MBBO. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to examine whether MBBO or BMI on admission was associated with advanced diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy. To evaluate the predictive performance of these indexes, we performed cross-validation in various models with MBBO or BMI and evaluated the areas under the curve (AUCs) yielded by these analyses. Univariate analyses suggested that MBBO was associated with advanced retinopathy and nephropathy, while BMI on admission was associated only with advanced nephropathy. In multivariate analyses, MBBO was significantly associated with advanced complications, while BMI on admission was not. For advanced diabetic retinopathy, the AUCs were 0.70-0.72, and for advanced nephropathy, the AUCs were 0.81-0.83. When comparing the AUCs among models, the models with MBBO sustained high predictive performance for diabetic complications. MBBO was independently associated with advanced diabetic complications, while BMI on admission was not. Diabetic microvascular complications in patients with high MBBO could progress more rapidly.

Deprived populations are particularly affected by diabetes and are less likely to have access to these programmes. DSM implementation in primary care, particularly in a multi-professional primary care practice (MPCP), is a valuable strategy to promote care access for these populations. In Rennes (Western France), a DSM programme was designed by a MPCP in a socio-economically deprived area. The study objective was to compare diabetes control in people who followed or not this DSM programme. The historical cohort of patients who participated in the DSM programme at the MPCP between 2017 and 2019 (n = 69) was compared with patients who did not participate in the programme, matched on sex, age, diabetes type and place of the general practitioner's practice (n = 138). The primary outcome was glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) change between 12 months before and 12 months after the DSM programme. Secondary outcomes included modifications in diabetes treatment, body mass index, blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, presence of microalbuminuria, and diabetes retinopathy screening participation. HbA1c was significantly improved in the exposed group after the programme (p < 0.01). The analysis did not find any significant between-group difference in socio-demographic data, medical history, comorbidities, and treatment adaptation.

A retrospective cohort study of 5463 patients with diabetes in 5 patient centered medical home practices in southeast Minnesota was conducted. HOUSES is a validated, standardized housing-based SES measure constructed from publicly available county assessor's office data. Diabetic control was assessed by the D5 (HgbA1c < 8, BP < 140/90, statin use, nonsmoking status, and antiplatelet therapy). In the lowest HOUSES quartile, more patients had an uncontrolled D5 (56.4%) than any of the other quartiles (49.2%, 49.8%, 49.6% respectively, p < 0.001). A multivariate analysis shows the adjusted odds of D5 control for patients in the 2nd, 3rd or 4th HOUSES quartiles as opposed to the 1st quartile are 1.28, 1.21, and 1.20, respectively. Lower SES as represented by the first quartile of HOUSES index, is associated with lower odds of D5 control and thus worse diabetic outcomes.

To assess the effectiveness of layperson-delivered empathetic engagement over the telephone in helping improve glycemic management for patients with diabetes. This parallel-arm randomized clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment was conducted from February 12, 2022, to April 15, 2023, with final measurements on November 18, 2023, among 260 patients with uncontrolled diabetes from a federally qualified health center in Austin, Texas, engaging telephonically from home. Patients assigned to the intervention group received empathy-oriented telephone calls by community-hired laypeople for 6 months, while those assigned to the control group received usual care. Patients were stratified by baseline score (≥5 vs <5) on the depressive symptom scale of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The primary outcome was hemoglobin A1c level at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months, assessed for interaction between time and trial arm. Secondary outcomes were self-perceptions of managing diabetes, diabetes-related behaviors and distress, and mental health symptoms (measured via surveys). Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis.

The within-person change in hemoglobin A1c level was -0.7% (95% CI, -1.0% to -0.4%) for the intervention group and 0.02% (95% CI, -0.4% to 0.4%) for the control group. For the subgroup with a PHQ-9 score of 5 or more at baseline (38.1% [99 of 260]), the within-person change in hemoglobin A1c was -1.1% (95% CI, -1.8% to -0.5%) for the intervention group and 0.1% (95% CI, -0.7% to 0.8%; P = .004) for the control group. For the subgroup with a PHQ-9 score less than 5, the within-person change in hemoglobin A1c was -0.4% (95% CI, -0.8% to -0.1%) for the intervention group and -0.02% (95% CI, -0.5% to 0.5%; P = .21) for the control group. At 6 months, 91.7% of the participants (99 of 108) responded that the program was very or extremely beneficial. In this randomized clinical trial of telephone-based layperson-delivered empathetic engagement, patients with diabetes and low income achieved clinically meaningful improvements in glycemic control.

34874534,To Tweet or Not to Tweet: A Longitudinal Analysis of Social Media Use by Global Diabetes Researchers.,"Engaging influential stakeholders in meaningful exchange is essential for pharmaceutical companies aiming to improve care. At a time where opportunities for face-to-face engagement are limited, the ability to interact, learn and generate actionable insights through digital channels such as Twitter, is of considerable value. The aim of this study was to evaluate digital engagement among global diabetes mellitus researchers. We identified every global tweet (20,614,515) and scientific publication (44,135) regarding diabetes mellitus from 1 August 2018 to 1 August 2020. Through author matching we combined datasets, resulting in a list of digitally active scientific authors. Generalised linear modelling identified factors predicting their digital engagement. Globally, 2686 diabetes researchers used Twitter to discuss the management of diabetes mellitus, posting 110,346 diabetes-related tweets. As Twitter followers increased, so did tweet frequency (p < 0.001), retweets (p < 0.001) and replies (p < 0.001) to their content. Publication count (overall/per month) and proportion of first/last authorships were unrelated to tweet frequency and the likelihood of being retweeted or replied to (p > 0.05). Those with the most  academic co-authors were significantly less likely to tweet than those with smaller networks (< 50; p = 0.001). Finally, those publishing most frequently on specific themes, including insulin (p = 0.041) and paediatrics (p < 0.001), were significantly more likely to tweet about these themes. Academic expertise and seniority cannot be assumed as proxies for digital influence. Those aiming to promote science and obtain digital insights regarding condition management should consider looking beyond well-known 'key opinion leaders' to perhaps lesser known 'digital opinion leaders' with smaller academic networks, who are likely to specialise in the delivery of highly specific content to captive audiences.",Pharmaceutical medicine,2021-Nov,"Leigh S, Noble ME, Pearson FE, Iremonger J, Williams DT",5,1940,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33262478,Risk factors for having diabetic retinopathy at first screening in persons with type 1 diabetes diagnosed under 18 years of age.,"To determine the risk factors for having diabetic retinopathy (DR) in children and young people (CYP) with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) at first screening. Records from the Diabetes Eye Screening Wales (DESW) service for people in Wales, UK, with T1DM diagnosed under age 18 years were combined with other electronic health record (EHR) data in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Data close to the screening date were collected, and risk factors derived from multivariate, multinomial logistic regression modelling. Data from 4172 persons, with median (lower quartile, upper quartile) age 16.3 (13.0, 22.3) years and duration of diabetes 6.6 (2.3, 12.3) years were analysed. 62.6% (n = 2613) had no DR, 26.7% (n = 1112) background DR, and 10.7% (n = 447) had referable DR (RDR). No RDR was observed under 19 years of age. Factors associated with an increased risk of DR were diabetes duration, elevated HbA<sub>1c</sub>, and diastolic blood pressure. People diagnosed with T1DM at 12 years or older had an additional risk for each year they had diabetes compared to those diagnosed before age 12 controlling for the diabetes duration (odds ratios 1.23 and 1.34, respectively). This study found that 37.4% of the study cohort had DR at first screening, the risk being greater the longer the duration of diabetes or higher the HbA<sub>1c</sub> and diastolic blood pressure. In addition, people diagnosed at 12 years of age or over were more likely to have DR with each additional year with diabetes.","Eye (London, England)",2021-Oct,"Rafferty J, Owens DR, Luzio SD, Watts P, Akbari A, Thomas RL",6,1515,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Data regarding the prognostic significance of HbA1c levels in contemporary intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU) patients is limited. All patients admitted to the ICCU at a tertiary care medical center between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, with documented admission HbA1c levels were included in the study. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their HbA1c levels: < 5.7 g% [no diabetes mellitus (DM)], 5.7-6.4 g% (pre-DM), ≥ 6.5 g% (DM). A total of 1412 patients were included. Of them, 974 (69%) were male with a mean age of 67(± 15.7) years old. HbA1c level < 5.7 g% was found in 550 (39%) patients, 5.7-6.4 g% in 458 (32.4%) patients and ≥ 6.5 g% in 404 (28.6%) patients. Among patients who did not know they had DM, 81 (9.3%) patients had high HbA1c levels (≥ 6.5 g%) on admission. The crude mortality rate at follow-up (up to 1.5 years) was almost twice as high among patients with pre-DM and DM than in patients with no DM (10.6% vs. 5.4%, respectively, p = 0.01). Interestingly, although not statistically significant, the trend was that pre-DM patients had the strongest association with mortality rate [HR 1.83, (95% CI 0.936-3.588); p = 0.077].

38768121,"Exploring the path to optimal diabetes care by unravelling the contextual factors affecting access, utilisation, and quality of primary health care in West Africa: A scoping review protocol.","The prevalence of diabetes in West Africa is increasing, posing a major public health threat. An estimated 24 million Africans have diabetes, with rates in West Africa around 2-6% and projected to rise 129% by 2045 according to the WHO. Over 90% of cases are Type 2 diabetes (IDF, World Bank). As diabetes is ambulatory care sensitive, good primary care is crucial to reduce complications and mortality. However, research on factors influencing diabetes primary care access, utilisation and quality in West Africa remains limited despite growing disease burden. While research has emphasised diabetes prevalence and risk factors in West Africa, there remains limited evidence on contextual influences on primary care. This scoping review aims to address these evidence gaps. Using the established methodology by Arksey and O'Malley, this scoping review will undergo six stages. The review will adopt the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to ensure methodological rigour. We will search four electronic databases and search through grey literature sources to thoroughly explore the topic. The identified articles will undergo thorough screening. We will collect data using a standardised data extraction form that covers study characteristics, population demographics, and study methods. The study will identify key themes and sub-themes related to primary healthcare access, utilisation, and quality. We will then analyse and summarise the data using a narrative synthesis approach. The findings and conclusive report will be finished and sent to a peer-reviewed publication within six months.

32057724,Perceptions of health care professionals towards clinical practice guidelines: The case of Diabetes Mellitus in Saudi Arabia.,"Clinical practice guidelines are developed by healthcare policy makers and disseminated to practitioners in order to minimize practice variations and to improve the quality of care. Problems arise when there is a sole reliance on passive dissemination strategies such as mailing or publishing the guidelines, as these approaches do not usually lead to the adoption. This study aims to explore the perspectives of the health care professionals toward the Saudi National Diabetes Guidelines in terms of awareness, adherence and their preferred dissemination and implementation strategies of the guideline. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among physicians and nurses working in twenty primary health care centers in the city of Riyadh between February and March 2019. Nearly half of the total 179 respondents reported that they were unaware of the guidelines (49.1%), and 92% of the remaining 91 participants who were aware of the guideline reported that they had first heard about it through their official mail. The mean scores ranked according to the most preferred methods for disseminating and implementing the diabetes guidelines were as follows: via reminder systems 4.35±0.74, financial incentives 4.33±0.65, and audit and feedback 4.27±0.58. On the other hand, the least favorable strategies were traditional education 3.79±0.96 and the distribution of the guideline by mail 3.13±0.95. The level of awareness of the diabetes guidelines among the primary health care professionals was suboptimal. This was more likely due to the Ministry of Health's reliance on passive implementation strategies. In order to have the guidelines translated into clinical practice, active and targeted implementation strategies such as reminder systems, audit and feedback must be considered by the Saudi health policy makers.",Primary care diabetes,2020-Dec,"Alharbi NS, Alanazi MA",2,1820,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Between 2015 and 2019, University of Michigan employees, retirees, and dependents with prediabetes were offered the National DPP at no out-of-pocket cost. Individuals with prediabetes were identified and mailed letters encouraging them to enroll. We surveyed those who enrolled and a random sample of those who did not using the HBM as a framework to examine factors associated with enrollment. Analyses were performed using multivariable logistic regression models. Of 64,131 employees, retirees, and dependents, 8131 were identified with prediabetes and 776 (9.5%) enrolled in the National DPP. Of those surveyed, 532 of 776 National DPP enrollees and 945 of 2673 non-enrollees responded to the survey (adjusted response rates 74% and 43%, respectively). Among survey respondents, factors associated with National DPP enrollment included older age, female sex, higher BMI, prediabetes awareness, greater perceived benefits of health-protective action, and one or more cues to action. Optimizing National DPP enrollment among adults with prediabetes will require identifying individuals with prediabetes, increasing personal awareness of the diagnosis, increasing perceived benefits of enrollment, and providing strong cues to action.",Journal of diabetes and its complications,2022-Jul,"Joiner KL, McEwen LN, Hurst TE, Adams MP, Herman WH",5,1397,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

38184599,Determinants of disparities of diabetes-related hospitalization rates in Florida: a retrospective ecological study using a multiscale geographically weighted regression approach.,"Early diagnosis, control of blood glucose levels and cardiovascular risk factors, and regular screening are essential to prevent or delay complications of diabetes. However, most adults with diabetes do not meet recommended targets, and some populations have disproportionately high rates of potentially preventable diabetes-related hospitalizations. Understanding the factors that contribute to geographic disparities can guide resource allocation and help ensure that future interventions are designed to meet the specific needs of these communities. Therefore, the objectives of this study were (1) to identify determinants of diabetes-related hospitalization rates at the ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA) level in Florida, and (2) assess if the strengths of these relationships vary by geographic location and at different spatial scales. Diabetes-related hospitalization (DRH) rates were computed at the ZCTA level using data from 2016 to 2019. A global ordinary least squares regression model was fit to identify socioeconomic, demographic, healthcare-related, and built environment characteristics associated with log-transformed DRH rates. A multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model was then fit to investigate and describe spatial heterogeneity of regression coefficients. Populations of ZCTAs with high rates of diabetes-related hospitalizations tended to have higher proportions of older adults (p < 0.0001) and non-Hispanic Black residents (p = 0.003). In addition, DRH rates were associated with higher levels of unemployment (p = 0.001), uninsurance (p < 0.0001), and lack of access to a vehicle (p = 0.002). Population density and median household income had significant (p < 0.0001) negative associations with DRH rates. Non-stationary variables exhibited spatial heterogeneity at local (percent non-Hispanic Black, educational attainment), regional (age composition, unemployment, health insurance coverage), and statewide scales (population density, income, vehicle access). The findings of this study underscore the importance of socioeconomic resources and rurality in shaping population health. Understanding the spatial context of the observed relationships provides valuable insights to guide needs-based, locally-focused health planning to reduce disparities in the burden of potentially avoidable hospitalizations.",International journal of health geographics,2024-Jan,"Lord J, Odoi A",2,2356,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32516505,Use of a simplified clinical audit tool to evaluate hypertension and diabetes management in primary care clinics in Jamaica.,"This study evaluates a simple clinical audit tool for assessing quality of care and blood pressure control among persons with hypertension in primary care clinics. A systematic random sampling of persons with diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN) attending five health centers in Kingston, Jamaica, was conducted. A modified Ministry of Health paper-based audit tool captured quality of care and outcome indicators (blood pressure and glycemic control). Additional chart audits were conducted by a physician and nurse to assess reliability. One hundred and forty-nine charts were audited between January and September 2017. One hundred and thirty-eight persons (92.6%) had hypertension (27 men and 111 women); 77 persons (51.7%) had DM (14 men and 63 women). The median age was 64 years old. Approximately two-thirds of persons with HTN and DM had electrolytes, lipid profile, and ECG done within the last year. One-fifth of persons with hypertension (18.5% men and 19.8% women, P = 1.000) had adequate blood pressure control with greater control among persons with HTN only compared to persons with both DM and HTN. Poor glycemic control was recorded for 69% of persons with DM (57% men and 71% women, P = .297). Moderate to substantial inter-rater agreement was observed for quality of care indicators. Our findings confirmed that hypertension and glycemic control are inadequate among persons attending primary care clinics in Jamaica's capital city. Simplified clinical audits can provide important quality of care and outcome indicators without losing the meaningfulness of the data collected.","Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)",2020-Jul,"Duncan JP, Tulloch-Reid MK, Reid-Jones H, Figueroa JP",4,1606,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38980510,Community-engaged Systems for Population Health Improvement: A Novel Approach to Improve Diabetes Outcomes in Rural Communities.,"Approaches to prevent and manage diabetes at a community population level are hindered because current strategies are not aligned with the structure and function of a community system. We describe a community-driven process based on local data and rapid prototyping as an alternative approach to create diabetes prevention and care management solutions appropriate for each community. We report on the process and provide baseline data for a 3-year case study initiative to improve diabetes outcomes in two rural Nebraska communities. We developed an iterative design process based on the assumption that decentralized decision-making using local data feedback and monitoring will lead to the innovation of local sustainable solutions. Coalitions act as community innovation hubs and meet monthly to work through a facilitated design process. Six core diabetes measures will be tracked over the course of the project using the electronic health record from community clinics as a proxy for the entire community. Baseline data indicate two-thirds of the population in both communities are at risk for prediabetes based on age and body mass index. However, only a fraction (35% and 12%) of those at risk have been screened. This information led both coalitions to focus on improving screening rates in their communities. In order to move a complex system towards an optimal state (e.g., improved diabetes outcomes), stakeholders must have access to continuous feedback of accurate, pertinent information in order to make informed decisions. Conventional approaches of implementing evidence-based interventions do not facilitate this process.",Journal of community health,2024-Oct,"Pullyblank K, Rosen M, Wichman C, Rogers AE, Baron M, Dzewaltowski DA",6,1639,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The aims of our study were to assess diabetic foot ulcer risk factors according to International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) classification, stratify patients into risk categories and identify factors associated with higher-risk grade. Cross-sectional setting over a period of 07 months, patients were randomly selected from the diabetic outpatients attending our unit of diabetology. Questionnaire and clinical examination were made by the same physician. Patients free of active foot ulcer were included. Among 230 patients evaluated, 10 had an active foot ulcer and were excluded. Five patients (2.27%) had a history of foot ulcer and 3(1.36%) had a lower-limb amputation. Sensory neuropathy, as measured by the 5.07(10 g) Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing, was present in 23.63% of patients, whereas 36.82% had a peripheral arterial disease based on clinical findings, and 43.63% had foot deformities. According to the IWGDF classification, Group 0: 72.72%, Group 1: 5.9%, Group 2: 17.73% and Group 3: 3.63%. After univariate analysis, patients in higher-risk groups were significantly more often female, had higher age and BMI, longer diabetes duration, elevated waist circumference, low school level, retinopathy and hyperkeratosis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified 3 significant independent factors associated with high-risk groups: retinopathy (OR = 2.529, CI95 [1.131-5.655], p = 0.024), hyperkeratosis (OR = 2.658, CI95 [1.222-5.783], p = 0.014) and school level (OR = 0.489, CI95 [0.253-9.44], p = 0.033).

Key government organizations have developed clinical quality indicators (CQIs) to ensure patients receive adequate care. The CQIs for comprehensive diabetes care are complex and often indicate a gap-in-care among vulnerable populations. To evaluate if the availability of point-of-care (POC) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing in a mobile clinic increases CQIs adherence in vulnerable populations. This evidence-based clinical practice change project (EBCPCP) focused on improving diabetic CQIs in vulnerable populations by implementing POC HbA1c testing on a federally qualified health centers (FQHC) mobile clinic. The results, 125 individuals having received HbA1c results, indicate having POC HgbA1c testing available on the mobile unit increased HbA1c testing. No patients had an HbA1c lab completed prior to the availability of POC testing. The availability of POC testing on a mobile clinic increases access to HbA1c for vulnerable populations which improves practice outcomes and increased CQI adherence.

We aimed to develop a machine-learning model for predicting people's failure to attend a follow-up visit. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults with newly screened diabetes at a national screening program using a large Japanese insurance claims database (JMDC, Tokyo, Japan). We defined failure to attend a follow-up visit for diabetes care as no physician consultation during the 6 months after the screening. The candidate predictors were patient demographics, comorbidities, and medication history. In the training set (randomly selected 80% of the sample), we developed two models (previously reported logistic regression model and Lasso regression model). In the test set (remaining 20%), prediction performance was examined. We identified 10,645 patients, including 5,450 patients who failed to attend follow-up visits for diabetes care. The Lasso regression model using four predictors had a better discrimination ability than the previously reported logistic regression model using 13 predictors (C-statistic: 0.71 [95% CI 0.69-0.73] vs. 0.67 [0.65-0.69]; P < 0.001). The four selected predictors in the Lasso regression model were lower frequency of physician visits in the previous year, lower HbA1c levels, and negative history of antidyslipidemic or antihypertensive treatment.

34209306,Acellular Dermal Matrix Used in Diabetic Foot Ulcers: Clinical Outcomes Supported by Biochemical and Histological Analyses.,"Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a diabetes complication which greatly impacts the patient's quality of life, often leading to amputation of the affected limb unless there is a timely and adequate management of the patient. DFUs have a high economic impact for the national health system. Data have indeed shown that DFUs are a major cause of hospitalization for patients with diabetes. Based on that, DFUs represent a very important challenge for the national health system. Especially in developed countries diabetic patients are increasing at a very high rate and as expected, also the incidence of DFUs is increasing due to longevity of diabetic patients in the western population. Herein, the surgical approach focused on the targeted use of the acellular dermal matrix has been integrated with biochemical and morphological/histological analyses to obtain evidence-based information on the mechanisms underlying tissue regeneration. In this research report, the clinical results indicated decreased postoperative wound infection levels and a short healing time, with a sound regeneration of tissues. Here we demonstrate that the key biomarkers of wound healing process are activated at gene expression level and also synthesis of collagen I, collagen III and elastin is prompted and modulated within the 28-day period of observation. These analyses were run on five patients treated with Integra<sup>®</sup> sheet and five treated with the injectable matrix Integra<sup>®</sup> Flowable, for cavitary lesions. In fact, clinical evaluation of improved healing was, for the first time, supported by biochemical and histological analyses. For these reasons, the present work opens a new scenario in DFUs treatment and follow-up, laying the foundation for a tailored protocol towards complete healing in severe pathological conditions.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021-Jun,"Campitiello F, Mancone M, Cammarota M, D'Agostino A, Ricci G, Stellavato A, Della Corte A, Pirozzi AVA, Scialla G, Schiraldi C, Canonico S",11,1833,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The study explores disparities in the availability of services and predicts the readiness of primary healthcare facilities to manage diabetes in Tanzania. The study analyzed data from the 2014-2015 Tanzania Service Provision Assessment Survey. A total of 1142 primary healthcare facilities were included in this analysis. The Negative binomial regression models were fitted to predict each of selected independent variable that is associated with the readiness of primary healthcare to manage diabetes. The overall availability of services was significantly different across the type of facility and managing authority. In an adjusted model, the following were the predictors for a significant increase in readiness to manage diabetes: health center [β = 0.470], private facilities [β = 0.252], the performance of management meetings [β = 0.446], having source of fund other than government [β = 0.193,], and presence of medical doctors [β = 0.677].

To determine the difference in 30-day hospital readmission rates for patients who receive IDPE compared to those who do not. This retrospective cohort was completed at UTMC. Patients admitted between October 1, 2012, and September 30, 2013, were included if they were ≥18 years and had one of the following: (1) diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, (2) blood glucose >200 mg/dL (>11.11 mmol/L) on admission, or (3) hemoglobin A<sub>1C</sub> of >6.5% (>48 mmol/mol). Patients who received IDPE from a pharmacist or student pharmacist (intervention group) were compared to patients who did not receive IDPE (control group). The 30-day readmission rate was 13.2% for the intervention group (n = 364) and 21.5% for the control group (n = 149) (<i>P</i> = .023). Average time to 30-day readmission was 13.1 (±8.3) days for the IDPE group and 11.9 (±7.9) days for the control group. There was no significant difference in diabetes-related readmission between the intervention and control groups (25.5% vs 21.9%). An IDPE program delivered primarily by pharmacists and student pharmacists significantly reduced 30-day readmission rates among patients with diabetes.",Journal of pharmacy practice,2020-Dec,"Murphy JA, Schroeder MN, Ridner AT, Gregory ME, Whitner JB, Hackett SG",6,1307,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

32839128,Readiness for utilizing digital intervention: Patterns of internet use among older adults with diabetes.,"The Internet is an important source of health and self-care information for older adults with diabetes. This study examined whether older adults with diabetes can be classified into different profiles based on Internet use. A latent class analysis based on 10 Internet activities was conducted using a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 65 and older (N = 1919). A multinomial logistic regression was performed to explore the potential differences related to socio-demographic characteristics and health-related factors among the classes. Three distinct classes were identified based on Internet use: non-users (n = 1299, 67.6%), communicating users (n = 327, 17.4%), and smart users (n = 293, 15.3%). Smart users were more likely to be highly educated, wealthy, and socially active, and to have good physical and cognitive functioning abilities in comparison, to the other classes. The communicating users were defined by a low incidence of depression. Older adults with diabetes are a diverse group in terms of their Internet activities. Distinguishing among the various types of older adults with diabetes can help healthcare providers tailor their approach to encourage such adults to engage in digital self-care.",Primary care diabetes,2020-Dec,"Park S, Kim B",2,1234,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Class imbalance happens where an instance in the class of interest is relatively low, when compared to the rest of the data. This study aims to apply oversampling strategies in an attempt to balance the classes and improve classification performance. We evaluated four different classifiers from k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and decision trees (DT) with 73 oversampling strategies. In this work, we used imbalanced learning oversampling techniques to improve classification in datasets that are distinctively sparser and clustered. This work reports the best oversampling and classifier combinations and concludes that the usage of oversampling methods always outperforms no oversampling strategies hence improving the classification results.",PloS one,2020-,"Teh K, Armitage P, Tesfaye S, Selvarajah D, Wilkinson ID",5,896,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

34237470,Use of Endocrine Consultation for Hemoglobin A1C ≥9.0% as a Standardized Practice in an Emergency Department Observation Unit.,"Severely uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with poor long-term outcomes and may remain unrecognized. A high frequency of uncontrolled DM has been identified in the acute-care setting, including the emergency department observation unit (EDOU). We assess the use of standardized endocrine consultation in the EDOU for hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels ≥9%. Standard practice in our EDOU includes universal HbA1C screening and endocrine consultation for HbA1C levels ≥9.0%. As part of a quality improvement program, EDOU patients with HbA1C levels ≥9.0% had an endocrinology consult. One-month follow-up phone calls assessed the effects of consultation after discharge. HbA1C tests were administered to 3688 (95.7%) of 3853 EDOU patients, of which 7.0% (n = 258) were found to have an HbA1C level ≥9% (mean ± SD, 11.7 ± 1.8%; range, 9%-16.6%). Endocrine consults were completed for 73.6% (190/258) patients with severely uncontrolled DM. Among the 190 patients, 92.1% (n = 175) had discharge DM medication adjustments. For known patients with DM (n = 142), injectable diabetes medication prescriptions increased from 47.2% (67/142) on EDOU arrival to 78.2% (111/142) upon discharge. Newly diagnosed DM injectable prescriptions increased from 0% (0/48) on arrival to 72.9% (35/48) upon discharge. A total of 72.6% (n = 138) were contacted at a 1-month follow-up and 94.9% (n = 131) reported taking DM medications, compared with 68.2% (n = 94) before consult.

Among the numerous techniques dedicated to tackle this problem, data preprocessing solutions are known to be efficient and easy to implement. In this paper, we propose a selective data preprocessing approach that embeds knowledge of the outlier instances into artificially generated subset to achieve an even distribution. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) was used to balance the training data by introducing artificial minority instances. However, this was not before the outliers were identified and oversampled (irrespective of class). The aim is to balance the training dataset while controlling the effect of outliers.

33468499,Variability in preventive care practices among US adults with diabetes mellitus.,"Patients with diabetes are advised to follow standard medical care including daily blood glucose and foot checks, eye examinations with pupil dilation, and cholesterol checks to prevent diabetes-related complications. It is unclear how these practices currently vary across different US population subgroups. The objective of this study was to assess variation in overall and individual diabetes care practices and identify specific factors associated with differences in these practices in a representative sample of US diabetic adults. Cross-sectional data were from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Survey logistic regression was used to account for the complex sampling design. Among 30 780 eligible participants, 8957 (equivalent to 28% of the target population) followed all four diabetes care practices. Insulin-dependent participants had higher adjusted odds (adjusted OR=2.95; 95% CI 2.62 to 3.31) of following all four diabetic care practices compared with those who did not. Cost-related variables (having healthcare coverage and/or a personal doctor) were positively associated with diabetes care practices, with the strongest association observed for adherence to more costly practices (annual eye examination and cholesterol check) versus less costly ones (daily blood glucose check, daily foot check). Our findings suggest the need for diabetes care practice-specific and population subgroup-specific public health interventions to encourage early adherence to diabetic care practices and reduce complications.",BMJ open diabetes research & care,2021-Jan,"Baccaglini L, Kusi Appiah A, Ray M, Yu F",4,1545,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39577876,Clinical utility of novel diabetes subgroups in predicting vascular complications and mortality: up to 25 years of follow-up of the HUNT Study.,"Cluster analysis has previously revealed five reproducible subgroups of diabetes, differing in risks of diabetic complications. We aimed to examine the clusters' predictive ability for vascular complications as compared with established risk factors in a general adult diabetes population. Participants from the second (HUNT2, 1995-1997) and third (HUNT3, 2006-2008) surveys of the Norwegian population-based Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT Study) with adult-onset diabetes were included (n=1899). To identify diabetes subgroups, we used the same variables (age at diagnosis, body mass index, HbA1c, homeostasis model assessment estimates of beta cell function and insulin resistance, and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies) and the same data-driven clustering technique as in previous studies. We used Cox proportional hazards models to investigate associations between clusters and risks of vascular complications and mortality. We estimated the C-index and R<sup>2</sup> to compare predictive abilities of the clusters to those of established risk factors as continuous variables. All models included adjustment for age, sex, diabetes duration and time of inclusion. We reproduced five subgroups with similar key characteristics as identified in previous studies. During median follow-up of 9-13 years (differing between outcomes), the clusters were associated with different risks of vascular complications and all-cause mortality. However, in prediction models, individual established risk factors were at least as good predictors as cluster assignment for all outcomes. For example, for retinopathy, the C-index for the model including clusters (0.65 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.68)) was similar to that of HbA1c (0.65 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.68)) or fasting C-peptide (0.66 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.68)) alone. For chronic kidney disease, the C-index for clusters (0.74 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.76)) was similar to that of triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein ratio (0.74 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.76)) or fasting C-peptide (0.74 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.76)), and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate yielded a C-index of 0.76 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.78).

39531755,Prognostic value of pulse wave velocity for cardiovascular disease risk stratification in diabetic patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Arterial stiffness, a significant cardiovascular risk marker, is particularly important in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). Pulse wave velocity (PWV), a non-invasive measure of arterial stiffness, has emerged as an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, its precise prognostic value in DM patients for cardiovascular risk stratification remains unclear. To address this, a systematic review was conducted. A thorough search of Ovid and Scopus databases was performed for cohort studies on PWV measurements for cardiovascular risk stratification in DM patients. Nine studies were included, examining the relationship between PWV and cardiovascular events or composite endpoints in DM patients asymptomatic of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The review revealed that optimal PWV cutoffs to predict composite cardiovascular events ranged from 10 to 12.16 m/s (aortic PWV) and 14 to 16.72 m/s (brachial-ankle PWV). In addition, meta-analysis yielded a HR of 1.15 (95 % CI 1.07-1.24, p < 0.001, I<sup>2</sup> = 70 %) for aortic PWV in predicting cardiovascular events. The assessment of arterial stiffness via PWV shows promise as an early diagnostic marker for CVD in DM patients, aiding in improved disease management. This underscores the potential of PWV in enhancing cardiovascular risk assessment and guiding clinical decisions in this high-risk population, without invasive procedures or radiation exposure.",Journal of diabetes and its complications,2024-Dec,"Cheong SS, Samah N, Che Roos NA, Ugusman A, Mohamad MSF, Beh BC, Zainal IA, Aminuddin A",8,1448,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34213655,Redefining distal symmetrical polyneuropathy features in type 1 diabetes: a systematic review.,"Diabetic neuropathy is among the most frequent complications of both type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and commonly manifests as a distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN). Despite evidence that T1DM- and T2DM-related DSPN are separate entities, most of our knowledge on diabetic DSPN derives from studies focused on type 2 diabetes. This systematic review provides an overview of current evidence on DSPN in T1DM, including its epidemiological, pathophysiological and clinical features, along with principal diagnostic tests findings. This review included 182 clinical and preclinical studies. The results indicate that DSPN is a less frequent complication in T1DM compared with T2DM and that distinctive pathophysiological mechanisms underlie T1DM-related DSPN development, with hyperglycemia as a major determinant. T1DM-related DSPN more frequently manifests with non-painful than painful symptoms, with lower neuropathic pain prevalence compared with T2DM-associated DSPN. The overt clinical picture seems characterized by a higher prevalence of large fiber-related clinical signs (e.g., ankle reflexes reduction and vibration hypoesthesia) and to a lesser extent small fiber damage (e.g., thermal or pinprick hypoesthesia). These findings as a whole suggest that large fibers impairment plays a dominant role in the clinical picture of symptomatic T1DM-related DSPN. Nevertheless, small fiber diagnostic testing shows high diagnostic accuracy in detecting early nerve damage and may be an appropriate diagnostic tool for disease monitoring and screening.",Acta diabetologica,2022-Jan,"Galosi E, Hu X, Michael N, Nyengaard JR, Truini A, Karlsson P",6,1567,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

32428521,Heat transfer analysis of blood perfusion in diabetic rats using a genetic algorithm.,"Diabetes is frequently associated with structural and functional impairment of the microcirculation. Blood perfusion is an important indicator of both physiological and pathological conditions of the microcirculation. Given that temperature is closely related to blood perfusion and is more easily measured, blood perfusion can be estimated from variations in skin temperature using an inverse method. The aim of this paper was to develop a thermal analysis method for estimation of blood perfusion and apply it in the assessment of skin blood perfusion in diabetic rats. First, diabetes was induced in the rat models of the experimental group. Skin temperature from the rats left hind paws was measured during a 10-min local heating period followed by a 15-min cooling period. A simple one-dimensional heat transfer model, including an arteriolar vessel node, was used to describe the skin heat transfer process. The blood perfusion of the arteriole was estimated by correlating the calculated skin temperature with known experimental temperatures using a genetic algorithm. The results indicated that the average blood perfusion in the control group was higher during local heating and decreased faster during the cooling period, showing dynamic responses to the thermal stimuli. In contrast, the blood perfusion of diabetic rats was reduced compared with that of the control rats during the heating phase and the rate of decrease in perfusion during the cooling stage was similarly reduced, implying a slower response to thermal stimulation in these rats. It is interesting to note that diabetic rats fed a normal diet showed a similar blood perfusion pattern to that in the control rats, implying that diet may be important in the treatment of diabetes-associated microvascular dysfunction.",Microvascular research,2020-Sep,"Wang Y, Mu L, He Y, Tang Y, Liu C, Lu Y, Xu L",7,1794,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This work is important as it has the potential to delay or prevent the onset of Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM), reduce NZ's health inequities, and the burden that T2DM places on health care services. However, no study has previously examined how this work routinely occurs in NZ. Two case studies of practices serving ethnically and socio-economically diverse populations, followed by cross-case analysis. The NZ health care context including funding mechanisms, reporting targets, and the disease centred focus of care, acted together to dis-incentivise and de-prioritise pre-diabetes care in general practices. The social determinants of health differentially influenced patients' ability to engage with and respond to pre-diabetes care, significantly impacting this work. Differing perspectives about the significance of pre-diabetes and gaps in systematic screening practices were identified. Interventions used were inconsistent and lacked comprehensive ongoing support. Complex multi-layered factors impact on pre-diabetes care, and many of the barriers cannot be addressed at the general practice level.

There is minimal research and a serious lack of screening models for people with a family history of diabetes (FHD), especially one which incorporates gender characteristics. Therefore, the primary objective of our study was to develop a screening model for estimating UDM among people with FHD and enable its validation. We used data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). KNAHNES (2010-2016) was used as a developmental cohort (n = 5939) and was then evaluated in a validation cohort (n = 1047) KNHANES (2017). We developed the screening model for UDM in male (SMM), female (SMF), and male and female combined (SMP) with FHD using backward stepwise logistic regression analysis. The SMM and SMF showed an appropriate performance (area under curve (AUC) = 76.2% and 77.9%) compared with SMP (AUC = 72.9%) in the validation cohort. Consequently, simple screening models were developed and validated, for the estimation of UDM among patients in the FHD group, which is expected to reduce the burden on the national health care system.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020-Nov,"Ryu KS, Kang HYJ, Lee SW, Park HW, You NY, Kim JH, Hwangbo Y, Choi KS, Cha HS",9,1176,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34783760,Care by the Ear: The increasing role of history taking.,"History taking and clinical interviewing is usually the start of medical contact with patients with chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus in primary care. The current novel corona virus-19 epidemic has limited our ability to conduct in-person consultations with patients as before and most of us limit physical contact to the minimum. This has made the process of history taking either by virtual consultations or physically in our offices but by maintaining appropriate physical distance more important than even before. This review summarizes an easy-to-understand hierarchy of questioning to help us in maximizing the information obtained by history taking. We initiate the clinical interview with a warm welcome and first focus on the primary felt need of the patient. Then we interview the patient about his duration and current control of his diabetes. The second part of the interview focuses on current clinical status including reviewing for complications and co-morbidities. The third part focuses on current ongoing management including life style, diet, glucose lowering and other drugs and the use of complementary and alternative medicines. The fourth part of the interview focuses on emotional status including religious and cultural beliefs about diabetes management and presence of diabetes related distress. Special attention should be paid to the financial status of patients who are paying for their treatment out of pocket. The interview should conclude with summarization of current issues with regards to diabetes management and a therapeutic plan individualized for the patient.",JPMA.

33164851,"The diagnosis and management of diabetes in Australia: Does the ""Rule of Halves"" apply?","The Rule of Halves (ROH) is a theoretical framework which states that roughly half of all people with a condition are diagnosed; half of those diagnosed receive care; half of those who receive care achieve their treatment targets; and half of those who reach their targets achieve the desired treatment outcomes. This review examined the applicability of the ROH to diabetes in Australia. Five databases were searched for articles and government reports published between January 2000 and August 2019. Data was extracted for each level of the framework, and pooled sample proportions calculated for the total population and sub-group analysis by ethnicity and type of diabetes. The results showed that 72% of people with diabetes are diagnosed. Approximately 50% are receiving standard care, and 40-60% are meeting treatment targets for HbA1c, blood pressure and lipid levels. Overall, Australia is doing better than the ROH when it comes to achieving treatment outcomes; prevalence of microvascular complications was 20-30% and cardiovascular disease 62%. Indigenous people were less likely to meet treatment targets and more likely to experience adverse complications of diabetes. This review indicates the ROH does generally apply for diabetes care and management in Australia, highlighting the need for further improvement.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,2020-Dec,"Sainsbury E, Shi Y, Flack J, Colagiuri S",4,1327,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

34301190,Primary care providers' perceptions and experiences of family-centered care for older adults: a qualitative study of community-based diabetes management in China.,"Family-centered care, as a contemporary model of health service delivery, involves a mutually beneficial partnership between healthcare providers, patients and their families. Although evidence on the positive effects of family-centered care on older adults and their families is accumulating, less is known about the providers' beliefs, attitudes and practices related to family-centeredness, especially regarding community-based primary healthcare services for the rapidly-ageing Chinese population. This study investigated Chinese primary care providers' perceptions and experiences of family-centered care for older adults, using community-based diabetes management services as an example. Ten focus-group interviews involving 48 community health professionals were conducted. Major themes were identified using thematic analysis. The interviews revealed that the providers acknowledged the importance of the family in older patients' diabetes management, while their current scope of practice with the patients' families was limited and informal. The barriers to implementing family-centered care were attributed to structural and environmental obstacles associated with the patients' families and the community healthcare context and culture. To engage patients' families more effectively, the providers suggested that family-centered values endorsed by their healthcare organizations and reinforced by policies, a trained interdisciplinary team of health professionals and community social workers, and also that the utilization of technology would be beneficial. Our study extends the evidence of family-centered care for older adults in Chinese community-based healthcare settings, contributing to the design of a tailored healthcare delivery model embodying ageing in place.",BMC geriatrics,2021-Jul,"Tu J, Liao J",2,1784,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
31494031,Smoking and Diabetes Control in Adults With Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes: A Nationwide Study From the 2018 National Program for Prevention and Control of Diabetes of Iran.,"Smoking is among the top leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, studies on the association between smoking and diabetes complications and metabolic control have shown conflicting results. In this study, we aimed to assess the association of smoking with micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes and lipid and glycemic indices. We used the National Program for Prevention and Control of Diabetes of Iran database of 99,651 adult patients with diabetes across Iran. Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association between smoking and diabetes complications including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy. This association was adjusted for age, sex, duration of diabetes, glycated hemoglobin (A1C), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, medication, obesity and type of diabetes. Smoking was associated with cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy (odds ratios [ORs] for patients with type 1 diabetes were 1.51, 2.29, 2.70 and 2.40, respectively; for patients with type 2 diabetes, ORs were 1.27, 1.21, 1.51 and 1.70, respectively; all with p values <0.001). Among patients with type 1 diabetes, smoking was significantly (p<0.05) associated with A1C (OR, 2.12), 2-h postglucose level (OR, 1.30), triglycerides (OR, 1.48) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) control (OR, 1.34). Among patients with type 2 diabetes, smoking was significantly associated with A1C (OR, 1.09) and HDL control (OR, 1.21). Smoking was associated with multiple diabetes complications including cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy and worse A1C and HDL control in both patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It was also associated with worse 2-h postglucose level and triglyceride control among patients with type 1 diabetes.

36538088,Diabetes medication following heart transplantation: a focus on novel cardioprotective therapies-a joint review from endocrinologists and cardiologists.,"There is accumulating evidence that novel glucose-lowering agents infer potent cardiovascular and renal benefits. Therefore, it is imperative to reassess the management of post-transplant diabetes mellitus and consider the role of newer agents. With improved transplant-related survival and high prevalence of post-transplant diabetes, management of long-term complications such as diabetes are increasingly important. There are limited guidelines to assist in choice of appropriate agents after solid organ transplantation. Traditional therapies including insulin and sulfonylureas may still have a role; however, other agents should be considered prior. The evidence of novel glucose-lowering agents in post-transplant care is limited, and most studies have focused on kidney transplant recipients. While there are some parallels between renal and cardiac transplant recipients, the potential cardiovascular benefits, particularly on cardiac fibrosis are unique to cardiac transplantation. The treatment of diabetes, with a focus on additional cardiac and renal benefits, needs to be brought to the forefront of post-transplant care with incorporation of recent evidence outside of transplantation.

Recent evidence showed increased cutaneous macrophage infiltration in patients with type 2 diabetes and painful DPN, and this study aimed to understand whether the same applies to type 1 diabetes. The study included 104 participants: 26 healthy controls and 78 participants with type 1 diabetes (participants without DPN [n = 24], participants with painless DPN [n = 29], and participants with painful DPN [n = 25]). Two immune cells, dermal IBA1<sup>+</sup> macrophages and epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs, CD207<sup>+</sup>), were visualized and quantified using immunohistological labeling and stereological counting methods on skin biopsies from the participants. The IBA1<sup>+</sup> macrophage infiltration, LC number density, LC soma cross-sectional area, and LC processes were measured in this study. Significant difference in IBA1<sup>+</sup> macrophage expression was seen between the groups (<i>p</i> = 0.003), with lower expression of IBA1 in participants with DPN. No differences in LC morphologies (LC number density, soma cross-sectional area, and process level) were found between the groups (all <i>p</i> > 0.05). In addition, IBA1<sup>+</sup> macrophages, but not LCs, correlated with intraepidermal nerve fiber density, Michigan neuropathy symptom inventory, (questionnaire and total score), severity of neuropathy as assessed by the Toronto clinical neuropathy score, and vibration detection threshold in the whole study cohort. This study showed expressional differences of cutaneous IBA1<sup>+</sup> macrophages but not LC in participants with type 1 diabetes-induced DPN compared with those in controls.

Though HbA1c criteria are convenient for diagnosis there is a discrepancy between the fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c for diagnosis. Objective To assess the comparability between fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels in the new-onset diabetes mellitus. Method This is a hospital-based descriptive cross-sectional study including 128 newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus conducted at Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital. New onset diabetes patients above 18 years of age who met inclusion criteria were included. The clinical characteristics and biochemical parameters were analyzed. Statistical analysis was done using student's t-test and correlation coefficient. Result There were 128 newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus patients included in the study among which 57.0% were males with a mean age of 49.48±11.40 years. The mean fasting plasma glucose, postprandial sugar (PPBS), and glycated hemoglobin were 205.54±88.93 mg/dL, 331.08±146.61 mg/dL, and 9.59±2.70% respectively. Diabetes was diagnosed using fasting plasma glucose, and glycated hemoglobin criteria in 84.4% and 90.6% of patients. In new-onset diabetic patients, 76.56% of patients had both elevated levels of fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin. Of the diabetic patients who had fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL, 90.7% of patients had HbA1c ≥ 6.5% whereas 1.6% of new-onset diabetes had < 126 mg/dL and glycated hemoglobin < 6.5%. There was a strong correlation between fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin (r=0.723; p<0.01).

33743696,Exploratory study on classification of diabetes mellitus through a combined Random Forest Classifier.,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) has become the third chronic non-communicable disease that hits patients after tumors, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and has become one of the major public health problems in the world. Therefore, it is of great importance to identify individuals at high risk for DM in order to establish prevention strategies for DM. Aiming at the problem of high-dimensional feature space and high feature redundancy of medical data, as well as the problem of data imbalance often faced. This study explored different supervised classifiers, combined with SVM-SMOTE and two feature dimensionality reduction methods (Logistic stepwise regression and LAASO) to classify the diabetes survey sample data with unbalanced categories and complex related factors. Analysis and discussion of the classification results of 4 supervised classifiers based on 4 data processing methods. Five indicators including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score and AUC are selected as the key indicators to evaluate the performance of the classification model. According to the result, Random Forest Classifier combining SVM-SMOTE resampling technology and LASSO feature screening method (Accuracy = 0.890, Precision = 0.869, Recall = 0.919, F1-Score = 0.893, AUC = 0.948) proved the best way to tell those at high risk of DM. Besides, the combined algorithm helps enhance the classification performance for prediction of high-risk people of DM. Also, age, region, heart rate, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and BMI are the top six most critical characteristic variables affecting diabetes. The Random Forest Classifier combining with SVM-SMOTE and LASSO feature reduction method perform best in identifying high-risk people of DM from individuals.

36745515,"Clinical and biochemical determinants of length of stay, readmission and recurrence in patients admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis.","The increasing prevalence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) related admissions poses a significant burden on the healthcare systems globally. However, data regarding the predictors of healthcare resource utilization in DKA is limited and inconsistent. This study aimed to identify key predictors of hospital length of stay (LOS), readmission and recurrent DKA episodes. We undertook a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of all DKA admissions from 2015 to 2021 across four hospitals in Qatar. The primary outcomes were the length of stay (LOS), 90-day readmission and 6-month and 1-year DKA recurrence. We included 922 patients with a median age of 35 years (25-45). 62% were males with type-1 diabetes-mellitus (T1DM) and type-2 DM (T2DM), present in 52% and 48% of patients. The median LOS was 2.6 days (IQR 1.1-4.8), and the median DKA resolution time was 18 h (10.5-29). Male-gender, new-onset DM, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), lower haemoglobin, sodium and potassium, higher urea, longer DKA duration and MICU admission predicted a longer LOS in a multivariate regression analysis. None of the factors were significantly associated with 90-day readmission. Patients with pre-existing T1DM were more likely to have a six-month DKA recurrence than pre-existing T2DM. Patients with a 6-month DKA recurrence, female gender and T1DM had higher odds of 12-month recurrence, whereas a consult with a diabetes educator at the index admission was associated with decreased odds of recurrence. This is the most extensive study from the Middle-East region reporting on LOS, readmissions and the recurrence of DKA. Results from this study with a diverse population may be valuable for physicians and healthcare systems to decrease the diabetes-related healthcare burden in DKA patients.",Annals of medicine,2023-Dec,"Ata F, Khan AA, Khamees I, Iqbal P, Yousaf Z, Mohammed BZM, Aboshdid R, Marzouk SKK, Barjas H, Khalid M, El Madhoun I, Bashir M, Kartha A",13,1790,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

33628833,Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy in Ethiopia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Currently, diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most severe complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). Despite the seriousness of this problem, limited evidence is available on the prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patients with diabetes mellitus in Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, there were no updated studies that estimate the national prevalence of DPN. Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis provided a national prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patients with diabetes mellitus in Ethiopia. This study was submitted for registration with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) in March 2020 and accepted with the registration number CRD42020173831. Different database searching engines were searched online to retrieve related articles, including PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, African Journals Online, World Health Organization (WHO) Afro Library, and Cochrane Review. The reviewers used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline in the reviewing process. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, all published and unpublished articles were analyzed. The reviewers used the random effects model to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among diabetes mellitus patients. The reviewers conducted the statistical analysis using the R version 3.5.3 and RStudio version 1.2.5033 software for Windows. The reviewers evaluated the heterogeneity across the included studies by the inconsistency index (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>). The reviewers examined the publication bias by the funnel plot. The search of the databases produced 245 papers. After checking the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 38 articles with 14029 total patients with diabetes mellitus were found suitable for the review. Except for three (retrospective cohort study), all studies were cross-sectional. The overall pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was 22% (95% CI 18% to 26%).

38773932,MicroRNA-29-mediated cross-talk between metabolic organs in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and its complications: A narrative review.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by hyperglycemia. Microribonucleic acids (microRNAs) are noncoding RNA molecules synthesized in the nucleus, modified, and exported to the extracellular environment to bind to their complementary target sequences. It regulates protein synthesis in the targeted cells by inhibiting translation or triggering the degradation of the target messenger. MicroRNA-29 is one of noncoding RNA that can be secreted by adipose tissue, hepatocytes, islet cells, and brain cells. The expression level of the microRNA-29 family in several metabolic organs is regulated by body weight, blood concentrations of inflammatory mediators, serum glucose levels, and smoking habits. Several experimental studies have demonstrated the effect of microRNA-29 on the expression of target genes involved in glucose metabolism, insulin synthesis and secretion, islet cell survival, and proliferation. These findings shed new light on the role of microRNA-29 in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications, which plays a vital role in developing appropriate therapies. Different molecular pathways have been proposed to explain how microRNA-29 promotes the development of diabetes and its complications. However, to the best of our knowledge, no published review article has summarized the molecular mechanism of microRNA-29-mediated initiation of DM and its complications. Therefore, this narrative review aims to summarize the role of microRNA-29-mediated cross-talk between metabolic organs in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications.",Cell biochemistry and function,2024-Jun,"Yesuf HA, Molla MD, Malik T, Seyoum Wendimagegn Z, Yimer Y",5,1601,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32771242,Toward a model of shared meaningful diagnosis.,"The purpose was to explain the process of diabetes-related diagnosis that prompts patient action (behavior change or treatment adherence). A secondary purpose was to identify barriers/gaps that prevent those outcomes. Using a grounded theory approach, we explored diagnosis from the patient's perspective and through the lens of the electronic health record (EHR). A thematic analysis was conducted on interview and EHR data from 28 patients, using the constant comparative method. The emerging model of shared meaningful diagnosis included four stages: stimulus to screen, medical decision making, medical information transfer, and patient sensemaking. Barriers to a meaningful diagnosis emerged in clinical documentation, clinician communication, and patient sensemaking. This study expands current understanding of ""diagnosis,"" suggesting additional stages between diagnostic labeling and disease management. The additional stages of medical information transfer and patient sensemaking are critical steps to a shared meaningful diagnosis that could enable teamwork among the patient and healthcare team. To sustain meaningful diagnosis for the patient, clinicians should document what language they used to explain the diagnosis to the patient so that subsequent clinicians can use similar language.

32561466,A randomized clinical trial of a collaborative home-based diabetes intervention to reduce emergency department visits and hospitalizations in black individuals with diabetes.,"The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in black individuals (blacks) is twice that of white individuals (whites), and blacks are more likely to have worse glycemic control, less optimal medication regimens, and higher levels of mistrust in the medical system. These three factors account for higher rates of acute medical care use in blacks with DM. To address this disparity, we developed DM I-TEAM (Diabetes Interprofessional Team to Enhance Adherence to Medical Care), a home-based multidisciplinary behavioral intervention that integrates care from a community health worker (CHW), the participant's primary care physician (PCP), a DM nurse educator, and a clinical pharmacist. Treatment is delivered during 9 sessions over 1 year, and includes diabetes education and goal setting, telehealth visits with participants' PCP and a DM nurse educator, and comprehensive medication reviews by a pharmacist. We describe the rationale and methods for a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of DM I-TEAM to reduce emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations. We are enrolling 200 blacks with DM during an ED visit. Participants are randomized to DM I-TEAM or Usual Medical Care (UMC). Follow-up assessments are conducted at 6 and 12 months.

33550441,Realising the long-term promise of insulin therapy: the DCCT/EDIC study.,"The introduction of insulin in the treatment of juvenile-onset, now type 1, diabetes mellitus transformed a rapidly fatal disease into a chronic degenerative one. During the insulin-treatment era, long-term microvascular and cardiovascular complications proved to be the bane of existence for people with type 1 diabetes, leading to blindness, kidney failure, amputations, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and premature mortality. The nascent understanding of the link between non-physiologically regulated glucose levels and these complications led to the development of new treatment tools in the 1970s and 1980s that facilitated the delivery of insulin to achieve glucose levels closer to non-diabetic levels. These therapeutic advances set the stage for definitive testing of the glucose hypothesis. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), supported by the National Institute of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH), definitively established the benefits and risks of intensive therapy that substantially lowered mean blood glucose levels, measured by HbA<sub>1c</sub>, over a mean 6.5 years of therapy. Intensive therapy in the DCCT, resulting in a mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> of ~7% (53 mmol/mol), reduced the development and progression of early microvascular and neurological complications associated with diabetes by 34-76% compared with the conventional-treatment group, which maintained an HbA<sub>1c</sub> of ~9% (75 mmol/mol). Intensive therapy was also associated with weight gain and a threefold increased risk for hypoglycaemia. At the end of the DCCT, a long-term observational follow-up study, the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study, commenced. Despite the convergence of HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels between the two groups during EDIC, owing to the adoption of intensive therapy by the original DCCT conventional-treatment group and the return of all participants to their own healthcare providers for diabetes care, the development and progression of complications continued to be substantially less in the original intensive-treatment group vs the conventional-treatment group; this phenomenon was termed 'metabolic memory'. The DCCT demonstrated a major reduction in early-stage complications with intensive therapy and the metabolic memory phenomenon during EDIC contributed to a substantially lower burden of advanced complications over time. These included a 57% lower risk of CVD events and 33% lower rate of mortality in the original intensive-treatment group compared with the conventional-treatment group. DCCT/EDIC has ushered in the intensive-treatment era, which has been universally adopted and includes the goal of achieving HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels less than 7% (53 mmol/mol) for most patients. Although the challenge of making intensive therapy (with the aim of achieving normoglycaemia) as widely accessible and safe as possible remains, continuing improvements in insulin therapy 100 years after its introduction promise a brighter future for people with type 1 diabetes.",Diabetologia,2021-May,Nathan DM,1,3080,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Participants' diabetes-related knowledge was defined as the primary outcome. Diabetes-related strains, family interaction and other psychosocial factors were determined as secondary outcomes. A generalized estimating equation model showed a persistent increase of diabetes-related knowledge in the intervention group compared to the control group regardless of the type of diabetes. Concerning secondary outcomes, mixed linear models showed an improvement for relatives of people with type 2 diabetes who participated in the DiaLife program. This study provides evidence of DiaLife's efficacy regarding a persistent increase of diabetes-related knowledge and a positive effect on psychosocial outcomes in relatives of people with type 2 but not in type 1 diabetes. Adding (an)other psychosocial module(s) might improve their well-being and psychosocial outcomes. Diabetes centers should consider implementing an education program for relatives, such as DiaLife, in their curriculum. The study was registered at the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00015157; date of registration: 24.08.2018).",Patient education and counseling,2022-Jul,"Bernard M, Lehmann T, Hecht L, Fabisch G, Harder A, Müller N, Luck-Sikorski C",7,1526,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34762354,Using the AUSDRISK score to screen for pre-diabetes and diabetes in GP practices: a case-finding approach.,"To identify the optimal AUSDRISK threshold score to screen for pre-diabetes and diabetes. A total of 406 adult patients not diagnosed with diabetes were screened in General Practices (GP) between May and October 2019. All patients received a point of care (POC) HbA1c test. HbA1c test results were categorised into diabetes (≥6.5% or ≥48 mmol/mol), pre-diabetes (5.7-6.4% or 39-47 mmol/mol), or normal (<5.7% or 39 mmol/mol). Of these patients, 9 (2%) had undiagnosed diabetes and 60 (15%) had pre-diabetes. A Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to predict the presence of pre-diabetes and diabetes; the area under the ROC curve was 0.72 (95%CI 0.65-0.78) indicating modest predictive ability. The optimal threshold cut point for AUSDRISK score was 17 (sensitivity 76%, specificity 61%, + likelihood ratio (LR) 1.96, - likelihood ratio of 0.39) while the accepted cut point of 12 performed less well (sensitivity 94%, specificity 23%, +LR=1.22 -LR+0.26). The AUSDRISK tool has the potential to be used as a screening tool for pre-diabetes/diabetes in GP practices. A cut point of ≥17 would potentially identify 75% of all people at risk and three in 10 sent for further testing would be positive for prediabetes or diabetes. Routine case-finding in high-risk patients will enable GPs to intervene early and prevent further public health burden from the sequelae of diabetes.",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,2022-Apr,"Fleming K, Weaver N, Peel R, Hure A, McEvoy M, Holliday E, Parsons M, Acharya S, Luu J, Wiggers J, Rissel C, Ranasinghe P, Jayawardena R, Samman S, Attia J",15,1399,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37498716,Assessing fear of complications in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes with the Fear of Diabetes Complications Questionnaire.,"Fear of diabetes complications (FDC) is a common source of emotional distress in people with diabetes across types and treatments and may affect health outcomes. To assess FDC, the Fear of Diabetes Complications Questionnaire (FDCQ) was developed. This study evaluates the FDCQ's German version in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). A German version of the FDCQ was developed and administered as part of four different studies sampling people with T1D and T2D. Measurement properties were evaluated across studies using factor analyses, reliability estimates, and associations of the measure within a network of variables. A cutoff criterion for elevated FDC was derived. A short form scale was also developed. High reliability and validity were supported. FDC as measured by the FDCQ was independently associated with higher diabetes distress and depressive symptoms. A cut-off score for elevated FDC was set at ≥30 in the 15-item FDCQ. Elevated FDCQ scores were detected in 36% of participants in secondary diabetes care and up to 46% of those in tertiary care. FDC is prevalent in people with T1D and T2D and associated with diabetes distress and depressive symptoms. The FDCQ is a reliable and valid tool for assessing FDC in research and practice. It may help identify persons in need of tailored education and care and monitor effects following treatment.

38087202,Making prediabetes visible in primary health care: a qualitative study of health care professionals' perspectives.,"People with prediabetes are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and its complications, such as cardiovascular diseases and premature mortality. Primary prevention and health maintenance are therefore imperative. Evidence has shown that prediabetes can be prevented or delayed with behavioural change, mainly in eating habits and physical activity. Interventions that use a person-centered approach can lead to improvements in self-management, quality of life, and health outcomes. Nevertheless, there is a need for further research that engages healthcare professionals and people with prediabetes in constructing and implementing preventive programs. The purpose of this study is to explore and describe how healthcare professionals perceive prediabetes, the current challenges in its detection and treatment, and what is needed to improve quality of care. This qualitative study was conducted in Region Stockholm. A total of 26 primary health care professionals participated in individual interviews: 15 diabetes nurses and/or district nurses, five general practitioners, five dietitians, and one physiotherapist. Interview transcripts were analyzed with qualitative content analysis. The analysis revealed two main themes that emphasize the need to make prediabetes more visible in primary health care. Despite the healthcare professionals' engagement and their motivation to improve prediabetes care, ad hoc practices and the absence of clear screening guidelines and referral pathways made it harder to focus on primary prevention. Supporting professionals in implementing structured care for people with prediabetes might encourage more efficient interprofessional collaboration and contribute to better strategies for promoting behavioural change. Establishing prediabetes care guidelines, supporting health care professionals´ knowledge and skills in prediabetes care, and implementing interprofessional referral pathways are some steps to enhance prediabetes detection and care precedence in primary health care. These steps could lead to more preventive care and ensure patient safety and health care equity.",BMC primary care,2023-Dec,"Harcke K, Graue M, Skinner TC, Olsson CB, Saleh-Stattin N",5,2125,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We found that young people with diabetes, as they develop through to adulthood, are exposed to considerable risks to their physical and mental health. Family-system interventions have had mixed outcomes. Research in this area would benefit from attention to ethnic/cultural diversity, and involving fathers and other family members. In adults with diabetes, social support relates to better diabetes outcomes. While family member involvement in care is likely to affect health and psychosocial outcomes of the person with diabetes, key elements and mediators of effective family interventions need to be identified. The challenges of diabetes management at work are under-researched; distress and intentional hyperglycaemia are common. When depression is comorbid with diabetes, there are increased work-related risks, e.g. unemployment, sickness absence and reduced income. Research to support people with diabetes at work should involve colleagues and employers to raise awareness and create supportive environments. Stigma and discrimination have been found to be more common than previously acknowledged, affecting self-care, well-being and access to health services. Guidance on stigma-reducing choice of language has been published recently. Resilience, defined as successful adaptation to adversity such as stigma and discrimination, requires studies relevant to the specific challenges of diabetes, whether at diagnosis or subsequently. The importance of the social context for living well with diabetes is now fully recognized, but understanding of many of the challenges, whether at home or work, is still limited, with much work needed to develop successful interventions.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2020-Mar,"de Wit M, Trief PM, Huber JW, Willaing I",4,1916,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Our primary goal was to examine diagnosis rates and therapy of individuals with diabetes living in Ormánság, one of the most deprived areas in Hungary and Europe. Our secondary goal was to examine the differences in lifestyle factors and cancer screening participation of patients with diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes compared to healthy participants. Our study is a cross-sectional analysis using data from the ""Ormánság Health Program"". The ""Ormánság Health Program"" was launched to improve the health of individuals in a deprived region of Hungary. Participants in the program were coded as diagnosed diabetes based on diagnosis by a physician as a part of the program, self-reported diabetes status, and self-reported prescription of antidiabetic medication. Undiagnosed diabetes was defined as elevated blood glucose levels without self-reported diabetes and antidiabetic prescription. Diagnosis and therapeutic characteristics were presented descriptively. To examine lifestyle factors and screening participation, patients with diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes were compared to healthy participants using linear regression or multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for sex and age. Our study population consisted of 246 individuals, and 17.9% had either diagnosed (n=33) or undiagnosed (n=11) diabetes. Metformin was prescribed in 75.8% (n=25) of diagnosed cases and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2) in 12.1% (n=4) of diagnosed patients. After adjustment, participants with diagnosed diabetes had more comorbidities (adjusted [aOR]: 3.50, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.34-9.18, p<0.05), consumed vegetables more often (aOR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.07-5.78, p<0.05), but desserts less often (aOR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.15-0.75, p<0.01) than healthy individuals. Patients with undiagnosed diabetes were not different in this regard from healthy participants. No significant differences were observed for cancer screening participation between groups. To increase recognition of diabetes, targeted screening tests should be implemented in deprived regions, even among individuals without any comorbidities.

Exosomes can carry diverse cargo including RNA, DNA, lipids, proteins, and metabolites. Exosomes transfer substances and information between cells by circulating in body fluids and are thus involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes in the human body. Recent studies have closely associated exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) with various human diseases, including diabetes mellitus (DM), which is a complex multifactorial metabolic disorder disease. Exosomal miRNAs are emerging as pivotal regulators in the progression of DM, mainly in terms of pancreatic β-cell injury and insulin resistance. Exosomal miRNAs are closely associated with DM-associated complications, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic nephropathy (DN), and diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), etc. Further investigations of the mechanisms of action of exosomal miRNAs and their role in DM will be valuable for the thorough understanding of the physiopathological process of DM. Here, we have summarized recent findings regarding exosomal miRNAs associated with DM to provide a new strategy for identifying potential diagnostic biomarkers and drug targets for the early diagnosis and treatment, respectively, of DM.",Clinical and translational medicine,2021-Jun,"He X, Kuang G, Wu Y, Ou C",4,1306,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

There is an absence of strong evidence-based dietary guidelines for the prevention and management of post-transplant diabetes mellitus in kidney transplant recipients. The aim of this study was to systematically review all dietary evidence for kidney transplant recipients on clinical outcomes relating to diabetes, patient-reported outcomes and economic outcomes. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in August 2020 using the databases Medline, Embase, CENTRAL and CINAHL. Studies were critically appraised using Cochrane risk of bias tools and GRADE. A total of 12 studies and 1928 participants were included. Four papers focused on diet and exercise, one paper on diet only, two papers on magnesium supplementation, one paper on magnesium and fibre intake, two papers on Mediterranean diet, one paper on marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation and one paper on fruit and vegetable intake. There were no significant effects on outcomes relating to dietary counselling, magnesium supplementation, magnesium and fibre intake or marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation. Low-quality evidence supports the Mediterranean diet in reducing the risk of post-transplant diabetes mellitus and fasting plasma glucose levels. Low-quality evidence suggests vegetable intake being associated with a lower risk of post-transplant diabetes mellitus. This review demonstrates limited evidence for dietary interventions in the prevention and management of diabetes in post-kidney transplantation. The findings suggest that further high-quality research with robust study designs is required.","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2022-Mar,"Li J, Chong A, Carey S",3,1793,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

However, as useful as CGMs are, the experience in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited and has not been summarized. A scoping review of the scientific literature was conducted. Medline, Embase, Global Health and Scopus were used to seek original research conducted in LMICs. The search results were screened by two reviewers independently. We included studies assessing health outcomes following the use of CGMs at the individual level (e.g. glycaemic control or complications) and at the health system level (e.g. barriers, facilitators and cost-effectiveness) in English, Portuguese, Spanish and French. Results were summarized narratively. From 4772 records found in database search, 27 reports were included; most of them from China (n = 7), Colombia (n = 5) and India (n = 4). Thirteen reports studied T1DM, five T2DM, seven both T1DM and T2DM and two GDM. Seven reports presented results of experimental studies (five randomized trials and two quasi-experimental); two on cost-effective analysis and the remaining 18 were observational. Studies showed that CGMs improved surrogate glycaemic outcomes (HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction), hard endpoints (lower hospitalization rates and diabetes complications) and patient-oriented outcomes (quality of life). However, several caveats were identified: mostly observational studies, few participants in trials, short follow-up and focused on surrogate outcomes. The scoping review identified that studies about CGMs in LMICs have several limitations. Stronger study designs, appropriate sample sizes and the inclusion of patient-important outcomes should be considered to inform the evidence about CGMs for the management of people with diabetes in LMICs.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2023-Jun,"Bernabe-Ortiz A, Carrillo-Larco RM, Safary E, Vetter B, Lazo-Porras M",5,1944,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39559363,"A comprehensive review of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related diabetes mellitus: incidence, clinical features, management, and prognosis.","Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related diabetes mellitus (ICI-DM) is a rare complication that medical oncologists seldom encounter in routine practice. The sporadic nature and intrinsic complexity of ICI-DM make it challenging to analyze comprehensively in experimental settings. In this review, we examine phase 3 clinical trials on ICIs and published case reports of ICI-DM, aiming to summarize its incidence, clinical features, management, and prognosis. Phase 3 clinical trials reveal that the incidence of ICI-DM is higher with combination therapies, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-L1, compared to anti-PD-1 monotherapy. ICI-DM typically presents as severe hyperglycemia with a fulminant onset and is often associated with diabetic ketoacidosis, accompanied by unexpectedly low HbA1c and C-peptide levels. ICI-DM shares similarities with classic type 1 diabetes, particularly in terms of autoimmunity and genetic predisposition. This includes a high prevalence of islet autoantibodies and susceptibility to certain HLA haplotypes, often with concurrent endocrine gland dysfunction. This suggests that genetic susceptibility and exposure to ICIs may both be necessary for triggering islet autoimmunity and inducing ICI-DM. Notably, patients with positive islet autoantibodies, such as glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody and islet-associated antigen 2 antibody, tend to experience rapid onset of ICI-DM after ICI exposure. Although patients with ICI-DM generally show a high objective response rate to immunotherapy, a significant proportion also face the need to permanently discontinued treatment. Further research is urgently needed to determine whether permanent discontinuation of immunotherapy is necessary and whether this discontinuation negatively impacts overall survival.",Frontiers in immunology,2024-,"Zhou L, Yang S, Li Y, Xue C, Wan R",5,1798,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

34148917,The Role of Zinc Homeostasis in the Prevention of Diabetes Mellitus and Cardiovascular Diseases.,"Zinc is an essential micronutrient for human health and is involved in various biological functions, such as growth, metabolism, and immune function. In recent years, research on intracellular zinc dynamics has progressed, and it has become clear that zinc transporters strictly control intracellular zinc localization, zinc regulates the functions of various proteins and signal transduction pathways as a second messenger similar to calcium ions, and intracellular zinc dyshomeostasis is associated with impaired insulin synthesis, secretion, sensitivity, lipid metabolism, and vascular function. Numerous animal and human studies have shown that zinc deficiency may be associated with the risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and zinc administration might be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of these diseases. Therefore, an understanding of zinc biology may help the establishment of novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of diabetes and CVDs.

Diabetes mellitus is a common complication of acromegaly, occurring in approximately one-third of patients. The risk of diabetes mellitus in acromegaly is driven by increased exposure to growth hormone, which directly attenuates insulin signalling and stimulates lipolysis, leading to decreased glucose uptake in peripheral tissues. Acromegaly is a unique human model, where insulin resistance occurs independently of obesity and is paradoxically associated with a lean phenotype and reduced body adipose tissue mass. Diabetes mellitus in patients with acromegaly is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Therefore, preventive measures and optimized treatment of diabetes mellitus are essential in these patients. However, specific recommendations for the management of diabetes mellitus secondary to acromegaly are lacking due to limited research on this subject. This Review explores the underlying mechanisms for diabetes mellitus in acromegaly and its effect on morbidity and mortality.

Male patients, older than 50 years, attended their first dental visit to the School of Dentistry for a period of two years, and it was proposed to evaluate undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. Periodontal, biochemical, microbiological examinations, nutritional profile, and physical activity were performed. A total of 106 patients were examined, 6 (5.6%) had diabetes, and 37 (34.9%) had prediabetes without prior diagnosis. The severity of periodontitis was greater in patients with diabetes. Most of the patients were overweight and had increased systolic blood pressure. Patients with prediabetes and periodontitis had a low adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Tannerella forsythia was present in more patients with periodontitis, and the prevalence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is practically absent in groups with periodontitis, except for the group with diabetes. In the population studied, the prevalence of patients without a diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes was very high and underestimated. The increased severity of periodontitis in patients with diabetes and in conjunction with the high level of cortisol seen in patients with periodontitis, especially those with diabetes, emphasize the dysregulation of the immunoinflammatory system.

These inverse associations may be explained by common flaws in observational analyses that can be avoided by explicitly emulating a target trial. We emulated target trials of metformin therapy and cancer risk using population-based linked electronic health records from the UK (2009-2016). We included individuals with diabetes, no history of cancer, no recent prescription for metformin or other glucose-lowering medication, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <64 mmol/mol (<8.0%). Outcomes included total cancer and 4 site-specific cancers (breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate). We estimated risks using pooled logistic regression with adjustment for risk factors via inverse-probability weighting. We emulated a second target trial among individuals regardless of diabetes status. We compared our estimates with those obtained using previously applied analytic approaches. Among individuals with diabetes, the estimated 6-year risk differences (metformin - no metformin) were -0.2% (95% CI = -1.6%, 1.3%) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.0% (95% CI = -2.1%, 2.3%) in the per-protocol analysis. The corresponding estimates for all site-specific cancers were close to zero. Among individuals regardless of diabetes status, these estimates were also close to zero and more precise. By contrast, previous analytic approaches yielded estimates that appeared strongly protective. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that metformin therapy does not meaningfully influence cancer incidence. The findings highlight the importance of explicitly emulating a target trial to reduce bias in the effect estimates derived from observational analyses.","Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",2023-Sep,"Dickerman BA, García-Albéniz X, Logan RW, Denaxas S, Hernán MA",5,1766,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Managing PTDM is complex, as studies suggest that it involves changes in the microbial flora across multiple organs. Recent research highlights the critical role of gut flora metabolism in the development of diabetes among post-renal transplant patients. This paper reviews the alterations in gut flora observed in PTDM patients and explores how gut flora influences PTDM.

Adult patients with DM hospitalized in our tertiary care centre from January 2017 to December 2018 were included in the study. K-means cluster analysis was done in clusters based on glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, body mass index, glycosylated haemoglobin, homeostasis model-assessed beta cell function, insulin resistance index, and age at diagnosis of DM. Chi-square test was used to analyse inter-subgroup differences in DM-related complications and family history of DM. p < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 1152 inpatients with DM were included in the study. Five subgroups were obtained by cluster analysis with highest proportion of population in mild obesity-related DM subgroup (34.55%), followed by mild age-related DM (21.55%), severe insulin deficiency DM (20.51%), severe insulin resistance DM (19.02%), and severe autoimmune DM subgroup (4.36%). The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy, diabetic peripheral vascular disease, diabetic ketosis, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and family history of DM differed significantly among the subgroups (p < 0.05 for all). This cluster-based classification could be applied to hospitalized adult patients with DM in China.

35384822,New-Onset Diabetes as a Complication After Kidney Transplant: Incidence and Outcomes.,"Diabetes after kidney transplant is a common complication. It may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality after kidney transplant. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of diabetes that developed after transplant on outcomes in kidney transplant recipients. This study included renal allograft recipients without diabetes who received transplants from 2008 to 2019 in our Department of Nephrology at Sahloul Hospital (Tunisia). Demographic and clinical data at transplant time and clinical events during the study period were collected. Patient and graft survival rates were analyzed. Patients with and without diabetes after transplant were compared. In the 257 patients (median age of 36 years) included in our study, the overall incidence of diabetes after transplant was 21.8%. Laboratory data (serum cholesterol, serum creatinine at discharge, and 24-hour proteinuria) were similar in those with and without diabetes after transplant. We observed no significant differences in cardiovascular diseases and infectious complication rates between patients with and without diabetes after transplant. There was also no significant difference in graft loss at 5 years between those with and without diabetes after transplant (P = .582). The 5-year patient survival rate in kidney transplant recipients with diabetes after transplant was 87.5%. There was no significant difference in death rate between those with and without diabetes after transplant (P = .566). Diabetes after transplant affected graft and patient survival and increased the incidence of posttransplant cardiovascular disease. The incidence and impact of diabetes after transplant can be minimized through pre- and posttransplant screening to identify patients at higher risk.",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,2022-Mar,"Ouni A, Sahtout W, Hadj Brahim M, Azzabi A, Aicha NB, Mrabet S, Fradi A, Zallema D, Guedri Y, Achour A",10,1772,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

A total of 60 type-2 diabetic patients, assigned to either a diabetes mellitus (DM) with microalbuminuria group (DM/MA+, n=30) or a DM without microalbuminuria group (DM/MA-, n=30), and 30 age-matched control subjects were enrolled in this study. All cases underwent evaluation of blood glucose level, HbA<sub>1c</sub>, lipid fractions, body mass index (BMI), and corneal sensitivity (CS). Corneal nerve fiber length (NFL), nerve fiber density (NFD), nerve branch density (NBD), and tortuosity coefficient (TC) were quantified by IVCCM. None of the patients had peripheral neuropathy or retinopathy. Compared with the healthy subjects, NFL and NFD were reduced in both diabetic groups (P<0.0001), while NBD was significantly reduced in the DM/MA+ group. Between the diabetic groups, NFL, NFD, and NBD were significantly higher in the DM/MA- group (all P's<0.001). CS was significantly lower in DM/MA+ compared with DM/MA- and controls (both P's<0.0001). NFD and NFL were inversely correlated with age, triglyceride level, and BMI. These results indicate that significant damage to small nerves, quantified using IVCCM, can be detected in the absence of retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy or microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients. The severity of corneal nerve involvement may further increase in the presence of nephropathy. This feature may also be valuable for early detection of microvascular complications of DM, allowing for the prevention of progression of life threatening microvascular complications.",Journal francais d'ophtalmologie,2021-Apr,"Celiker H, Erekul G, Turhan SA, Kokar S, Yavuz DG, Gunduz OH, Tavakoli M, Toker E",8,1742,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33539595,Diabetes and atrial fibrillation in hospitalized patients in the United States.,"Data on the burden of atrial fibrillation (AF) associated with diabetes among hospitalized patients are scarce. We assessed the AF-related hospitalizations trends in patients with diabetes, and compared AF outcomes in patients with diabetes to those without diabetes. AF-related health outcomes differ between patient with diabetes and without diabetes. Using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2004-2014, we studied trends in AF hospitalization rate among diabetic patients, and compared in-hospital case fatality rate, length of stay (LOS), cost and utilization of rhythm control therapies, and 30-day readmission rate between patients with and without diabetes. Logistic or Cox regression models were used to assess the differences in AF outcomes by diabetes status. Over the study period, there were 4 325 522 AF-related hospitalizations, of which 1 075 770 (24.9%) had a diagnosis of diabetes. There was a temporal increase in AF hospitalization rate among diabetic patients (10.4 to 14.4 per 1000 hospitalizations among patients with diabetes; +4.4% yearly change, p-trend < .0001). Among AF patients, those with diabetes had a lower in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.65-0.72) and LOS (aOR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.94-0.96), but no difference in costs (aOR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.94-0.96) and a higher 30-day rate of readmissions compared with no diabetes (aHR 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01-1.08), compared to individuals without diabetes. AF and diabetes coexist among hospitalized patients, with rising trends over the last decade.

34872802,Animal models of diabetic microvascular complications: Relevance to clinical features.,"Diabetes has become more common in recent years worldwide, and this growth is projected to continue in the future. The primary concern with diabetes is developing various complications, which significantly contribute to the disease's mortality and morbidity. Over time, the condition progresses from the pre-diabetic to the diabetic stage and then to the development of complications. Years and enormous resources are required to evaluate pharmacological interventions to prevent or delay the progression of disease or complications in humans. Appropriate screening models are required to gain a better understanding of both pathogenesis and potential therapeutic agents. Different species of animals are used to evaluate the pharmacological potentials and study the pathogenesis of the disease. Animal models are essential for research because they represent most of the structural, functional, and biochemical characteristics of human diseases. An ideal screening model should mimic the pathogenesis of the disease with identifiable characteristics. A thorough understanding of animal models is required for the experimental design to select an appropriate model. Each animal model has certain advantages and limitations.

The availability of these ""real-world,"" ""big data"" has fuelled also an intense methodological research into methods to handle them and extract actionable information. In medicine, the evidence generated from ""real-world data"" (RWD), which are not purposely collected to answer biomedical questions, is commonly termed ""real-world evidence"" (RWE). In this review, we focus on RWD and RWE in the area of diabetes research, highlighting their contributions in the last decade; and give some suggestions for future RWE diabetes research, by applying well-established and less-known tools to direct RWE diabetes research towards better personalized approaches to diabetes care. We underline the essential aspects to consider when using RWD and the key features limiting the translational potential of RWD in generating high-quality and applicable RWE. Only if viewed in the context of other study designs and statistical methods, with its pros and cons carefully considered, RWE will exploit its full potential as a complementary or even, in some cases, substitutive source of evidence compared to the expensive evidence obtained from randomized controlled trials.","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2020-Apr,"Zaccardi F, Davies MJ, Khunti K",3,1354,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36457298,Central pancreatectomy prevents postoperative diabetes.,"Central pancreatectomy (CP) can be performed as an alternative surgical approach to distal pancreatectomy (DP) in the treatment of benign or low-grade malignant lesions located in the neck and body of the pancreas, aiming to reduce loss of parenchyma and therefore organ failure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the short- and long-term outcome of CP in comparison to DP. Patients who received CP in a large tertiary care pancreatic surgery center between 2001 and 2020 were identified from a prospectively maintained database and compared via propensity score matching with patients receiving DP during the same time period. Perioperative rate of complications and long-term outcome of pancreatic endocrine and exocrine function were evaluated. One hundred and seven patients undergoing open CP were compared to 107 patients with open DP. No significant difference in rates or severity of most surgical complications could be found including postoperative pancreatic fistula, intraabdominal fluid collection, delayed gastric emptying and wound infection. However, patients receiving CP had a significantly higher risk of grade C postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH) (CP: 10 patients, 9.3% versus DP: 1 patient, 0.9%; p = .0019). Perioperative mortality was comparable. Long-term follow-up of 60 matched pairs revealed significantly less patients with new-onset diabetes after CP (eight patients, 13.3%) compared to DP (22 patients, 36.7%, p = .0056). CP offers an improved endocrine long-term outcome at the expense of a higher risk of PPH without increased perioperative mortality.

This study aimed to investigate balancing ability using a multi-directional reach test (MDRT) in older adults with and without diabetes mellitus. 72 older adults with and without diabetes mellitus were recruited, and divided into two groups, including older adults without diabetes mellitus (n = 36) and older adults with diabetes mellitus (n = 36). All subjects completed all directions of the MDRT. There were no significant differences in MDRT scores in all directions between the two groups (p>0.05). Both groups achieved the highest MDRT scores in the forward direction. In contrast, the two groups had the lowest scores of MDRT in a backward direction. Furthermore, older adults with diabetes mellitus had lower MDRT scores in all directions than older adults without diabetes mellitus.

35877064,The Therapeutic Potential of Mesenchymal Stem Cells in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exist in many tissues and can differentiate into cells of multiple lineages, such as adipocytes, osteoblasts, or chondrocytes. MSC administration has demonstrated therapeutic potential in various degenerative and inflammatory diseases (<i>e.g.</i>, graft-vs.-host disease, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, organ fibrosis, and diabetes mellitus [DM]). The mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effects of MSCs are multifaceted. Generally, implanted MSCs can migrate to sites of injury, where they establish an anti-inflammatory and regenerative microenvironment in damaged tissues. In addition, MSCs can modulate innate and adaptive immune responses through immunosuppressive mechanisms that involve immune cells, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and immunomodulatory factors. DM has a high prevalence worldwide; it also contributes to a high rate of mortality worldwide. MSCs offer a promising therapeutic agent to prevent or repair damage from DM and diabetic complications through properties such as multilineage differentiation, homing, promotion of angiogenesis, and immunomodulation (<i>e.g.</i>, prevention of oxidative stress, fibrosis, and cell death). In this study, we review current findings regarding the immunomodulatory and regenerative mechanisms of MSCs, as well as their therapeutic applications in DM and DM-related complications.",Cellular reprogramming,2022-Dec,"Zhu L, Wang S, Qu J, Hui Z, Kan C, Hou N, Sun X",7,1386,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

31638279,Twenty-five years of diabetes distress research.,"The term 'diabetes distress' first entered the psychosocial research vernacular in 1995, and refers to 'the negative emotional or affective experience resulting from the challenge of living with the demands of diabetes'. At first the proponents of the concept were hesitant in advocating that diabetes distress was a major barrier to individuals' self-care and management of diabetes. Since then, a burgeoning body of evidence, now including several systematic reviews of intervention studies, suggests that diabetes distress, in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, across ages and in all countries and cultures where it has been studied, is common and can be a barrier to optimal emotional well-being, self-care and management of diabetes. As a consequence, monitoring diabetes distress as part of routine clinical care is part of many national guidelines.

The aim of the present study is to verify the COVID-19 pandemic effects on diabetes control and management. The study was designed as a retrospective observational study, performed on two cohorts of patients with diabetes in 2019 and 2020. Data used for the analyses were gathered from administrative and laboratory databases, which do not include any sensible information on COVID-19. The Tuscany Regional Health Agency is data controller for current administrative databases and has been working to produce available information for policy decision-making. In 2020, in comparison with 2019, a relevant reduction of the number of patients measuring HbA1c was observed during the March-April lockdown, and again during the second pandemic wave in Autumn. A similar pattern was observed for specialist visits for diabetes, for which the introduction of televisits only partly compensated for the reduction of traditional office visits. The number of patients receiving drugs for diabetes each week in 2020 was very similar to 2019. The mean HbA1c values and the proportion of HbA1c values > 8% for each week, were higher during the 2020 Spring and Autumn lockdown. COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacts diabetes management, reducing specialist visits and HbA1c determinations during the first and second pandemic wave. Despite a satisfactory continuity in pharmacological treatment, short-term impairment of average glycemic control was detected, particularly in Autumn.","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2022-Nov,"Bellini B, Nreu B, Francesconi P, Mannucci E",4,1582,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

32012347,Renal outcomes with the newer antidiabetes drugs: the era before and after CREDENCE.,"In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration provided guidance for the evaluation of the cardiovascular safety of antidiabetes drugs. The newer antidiabetes drugs, approved after 2008, were therefore evaluated in long-term cardiovascular outcome trials, designed and powered for the assessment of cardiovascular safety. Accordingly, the primary endpoint of these trials was a cardiac composite endpoint. Since 2008, the data from various cardiovascular outcome trials have been reported, including SAVOR-TIMI 53 (saxagliptin), EXAMINE (alogliptin), TECOS (sitagliptin), CARMELINA (linagliptin), CAROLINA (linagliptin), ELIXA (lixisenatide), LEADER (liraglutide), EXSCEL (exenatide once-weekly), SUSTAIN-6 (injectable semaglutide), HARMONY Outcomes (albiglutide), REWIND (dulaglutide), PIONEER-6 (oral semaglutide), EMPA-REG OUTCOME (empagliflozin), the CANVAS Program (canagliflozin) and DECLARE-TIMI 53 (dapagliflozin). Some of these trials subsequently also published data on renal outcomes, although these were secondary or exploratory analyses. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists had beneficial effects on albuminuria, while sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors additionally showed a positive effect on 'hard' renal outcomes. In contrast to the cardiovascular outcome trials, the renal outcome trial of canagliflozin, CREDENCE, assessed a hard renal endpoint as its primary endpoint and showed positive effects on these hard renal outcomes. In this review, we aim to highlight the renal outcome data from the cardiovascular outcome trials and the CREDENCE trial and understand the differences between their results.

38739122,Metabolomics Signature in Prediabetes and Diabetes: Insights From Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analysis.,"This study investigates the metabolic differences between normal, prediabetic and diabetic patients with good and poor glycaemic control (GGC and PGC). In this study, 1102 individuals were included, and 50 metabolites were analysed using tandem mass spectrometry. The diabetes diagnosis and treatment standards of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) were used to classify patients. The nearest neighbour method was used to match controls and cases in each group on the basis of age, sex and BMI. Factor analysis was used to reduce the number of variables and find influential underlying factors. Finally, Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to check the correlation between both glucose and HbAc1 as independent factors with binary classes. Amino acids such as glycine, serine and proline, and acylcarnitines (AcylCs) such as C16 and C18 showed significant differences between the prediabetes and normal groups. Additionally, several metabolites, including C0, C5, C8 and C16, showed significant differences between the diabetes and normal groups. Moreover, the study found that several metabolites significantly differed between the GGC and PGC diabetes groups, such as C2, C6, C10, C16 and C18. The correlation analysis revealed that glucose and HbA1c levels significantly correlated with several metabolites, including glycine, serine and C16, in both the prediabetes and diabetes groups. Additionally, the correlation analysis showed that HbA1c significantly correlated with several metabolites, such as C2, C5 and C18, in the controlled and uncontrolled diabetes groups. These findings could help identify new biomarkers or underlying markers for the early detection and management of diabetes.","Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism",2024-May,"Jabbar Al-Rikabi SA, Etemadi A, Morad MM, Nowrouzi A, Panahi GS, Mondeali M, Toorani-Ghazvini M, Nasli-Esfahani E, Razi F, Bandarian F",10,1710,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

From our electronic medical records, we retrieved clinical and biochemical details of 4555 individuals with childhood and adolescent onset diabetes (diagnosed below the age of 20 years) seen between 1992 and 2017. T1DM was diagnosed if there was history of ketoacidosis or fasting C-peptide <0.3 PMol/mL and stimulated C-peptide <0.6 PMol/mL or if insulin treatment was required from the time of diagnosis. T2DM was diagnosed based on absence of ketosis, or fasting C-peptide ≥0.6 PMol/mL and stimulated >1.0 PMoL/mL, or response to oral hypoglycemic agents for more than 2 years. We calculated the incidence rates of retinopathy (presence of at least one definite microaneurysm by retinal photography), nephropathy (urinary albumin excretion ≥30 μg/mg of creatinine) and neuropathy (vibration perception threshold ≥20 V) per 1000 person-years of follow up. Among the 4555 individuals with childhood and adolescent-onset diabetes, 71.4% had T1DM, 19.5% T2DM and 9.1% other forms of diabetes. Age at first visit and duration of diabetes were significantly higher in T2DM when compared to T1DM. The age adjusted incidence of retinopathy was 52.9/1000 person years (Confidence Intervals [CI]: 42.9-62.8) in T1DM and 49.8/1000 person years (CI 30.8-68.8) in T2DM; nephropathy, 6.2 (CI 3.3-9.0) and 13.8 (CI 5.6-22.0); and neuropathy, 8.8(CI 3.6-14.0) and 24.0 (CI 9.8-38.2) in T1DM and T2DM, respectively.

This study aimed to assess the incidence of PTDM in heart and lung transplant (HLT) patients and to review if the management of these patients is in accordance with the 2014 American Society of Transplantation guidelines. This was a retrospective study in the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Data was collected from the patients who had undergone HLT. All patients who had a heart and/or lung transplant between 2005 and 2017 were identified. The majority of our patients had lung 111 (53.9%), heart 94 (45.6%) and combined heart/lung 1(0.5%) transplants. A total of 174 (84.5%) patients were screened for diabetes pre-transplantation. Two hundred five (99.9%) patients were screened for PTDM post-surgery. The cumulative incidence for PTDM was 19.4% (40/206). All patients with PTDM were on prednisolone, 32 (80%) on tacrolimus and 4 (10%) on cyclosporine. The cumulative incidence of post-transplant diabetes in our cohort was 19.4%. The majority of the patients were screened before and after transplant for glucose abnormality.

37473453,Guidelines and Recommendations for Laboratory Analysis in the Diagnosis and Management of Diabetes Mellitus.,"Numerous laboratory tests are used in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus. The quality of the scientific evidence supporting the use of these assays varies substantially. An expert committee compiled evidence-based recommendations for laboratory analysis in screening, diagnosis, or monitoring of diabetes. The overall quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations were evaluated. The draft consensus recommendations were evaluated by invited reviewers and presented for public comment. Suggestions were incorporated as deemed appropriate by the authors (see Acknowledgments). The guidelines were reviewed by the Evidence Based Laboratory Medicine Committee and the Board of Directors of the American Association of Clinical Chemistry and by the Professional Practice Committee of the American Diabetes Association. Diabetes can be diagnosed by demonstrating increased concentrations of glucose in venous plasma or increased hemoglobin A1c (Hb A1c) in the blood. Glycemic control is monitored by the people with diabetes measuring their own blood glucose with meters and/or with continuous interstitial glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and also by laboratory analysis of Hb A1c. The potential roles of noninvasive glucose monitoring, genetic testing, and measurement of ketones, autoantibodies, urine albumin, insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide are addressed. The guidelines provide specific recommendations based on published data or derived from expert consensus.

32774444,Research of Epidemic Big Data Based on Improved Deep Convolutional Neural Network.,"In recent years, with the acceleration of the aging process and the aggravation of life pressure, the proportion of chronic epidemics has gradually increased. A large amount of medical data will be generated during the hospitalization of diabetics. It will have important practical significance and social value to discover potential medical laws and valuable information among medical data. In view of this, an improved deep convolutional neural network (""CNN+"" for short) algorithm was proposed to predict the changes of diabetes. Firstly, the bagging integrated classification algorithm was used instead of the output layer function of the deep CNN, which can help the improved deep CNN algorithm constructed for the data set of diabetic patients and improve the accuracy of classification. In this way, the ""CNN+"" algorithm can take the advantages of both the deep CNN and the bagging algorithm. On the one hand, it can extract the potential features of the data set by using the powerful feature extraction ability of deep CNN. On the other hand, the bagging integrated classification algorithm can be used for feature classification, so as to improve the classification accuracy and obtain better disease prediction effect to assist doctors in diagnosis and treatment. Experimental results show that compared with the traditional convolutional neural network and other classification algorithm, the ""CNN+"" model can get more reliable prediction results.",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2020-,Wang W,1,1459,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The evidence supports theory-based intervention in promoting self-care behaviors. However, no systematic review was done to monitor these interventions and compare more effective constructs. This study was conducted to investigate the studies using self-care theories and introducing the most effective theories. This is a systematic review study during which some scientific databases including Scopus, Elsevier, Google scholar and PubMed were searched by using some key words like self-care or self-management, diabetes, theory or model. English articles from the start of 2013 up to the end of November 2020 were monitored. 20 articles were selected and studied based on eight theories which they used. These theories were: Social support theory, Health Belief Model, Heath Belief Model and Empowerment Theory, Empowerment Theory, Self-efficacy Theory, precede-proceed model, Self-regulation Theory, behavioral theory and Social Cognitive Theory. Four theories appeared to be more effective for the target behavior of present research: Social Support Theory and the combination of Empowerment Theory and Health Belief Model, Social Cognitive Theory and Self Efficacy Theory. Taken together, the findings of this systematic review suggest that interventions that go beyond individual determinants (such as changing knowledge and attitudes) to determinants of upper cognitive, motor, and social levels (such as the development of skills and competencies) they have led to raised self-care outcomes.",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2020-,"Zare S, Ostovarfar J, Kaveh MH, Vali M",4,1610,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38808694,An analysis of urodynamic parameters in diabetic and nondiabetic women.,"Diabetes is highly prevalent worldwide, with an estimated 536 million living with diabetes in 2021, and that number projected to increase to 783 million by 2045. Diabetic bladder dysfunction is thought to affect up to 60%-90% of individuals with diabetes and can significantly impact quality of life. Despite the prevalence of diabetic bladder dysfunction, the exact pathophysiological mechanism, and resulting clinical presentation, remains debated. Our objective was to compare urodynamic parameters between diabetic and nondiabetic women, assessing the impact of various markers of diabetes severity on bladder function. A retrospective chart review was conducted on female patients aged 18 and above who underwent urodynamic studies at a single tertiary care university hospital system from 2014 to 2020. Patients were categorized based on diabetes status, and diabetes severity including duration of disease, hemoglobin A1c levels, insulin dependence, and markers of end-organ dysfunction. Urodynamic variables, including compliance, bladder voided efficiency, bladder contractility index, postvoid residual, maximum flow rate, capacity, voided volume, and detrusor overactivity, were assessed by two independent reviewers. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the impact of diabetes and diabetic severity on urodynamic parameters. A total of 652 female patients were included in the study, of which, 152 (23.3%) had diabetes, with an average duration of diagnosis of 82.3 months. Diabetic women were older and had higher body mass index compared to nondiabetic women. Diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy were present in 18% and 54.6% of diabetic patients, respectively. Significant differences in urodynamic parameters were observed between diabetic and nondiabetic women, with diabetic women showing higher rates of detrusor overactivity (p = 0.01), particularly associated with increasing BMI (p = 0.03). However, classic markers of diabetes severity including duration, as well as markers of end-organ damage, showed mixed associations with urodynamic changes. Despite the prevalence of diabetic bladder dysfunction and its impact on patient quality of life, the exact mechanisms and clinical presentation remain elusive. Our study highlights the significant differences in urodynamic parameters between diabetic and nondiabetic women, emphasizing the need for further research into the relationship between diabetes and diabetic bladder dysfunction.",Neurourology and urodynamics,2024-Sep,"Burns RT, Arnold PJ, Song L, Moss KL, Powell CR",5,2468,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32970763,Heritability and complex segregation analysis of naturally-occurring diabetes in Australian Terrier Dogs.,"The Australian Terrier breed is the breed at highest risk for naturally-occurring diabetes mellitus in the United States, where it is 32 times more likely to develop diabetes compared to mixed breed dogs. However, the heritability and mode of inheritance of spontaneous diabetes in Australian Terriers has not been reported. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the heritability and mode of inheritance of diabetes in Australian Terriers. A cohort of related Australian Terriers including 383 Australian Terriers without diabetes, 86 Australian Terriers with spontaneous diabetes, and 14 Australian Terriers with an unknown phenotype, was analyzed. A logistic regression model including the effects of sex was formulated to evaluate the heritability of diabetes. The inheritance pattern of spontaneous diabetes in Australian Terriers was investigated by use of complex segregation analysis. Six possible inheritance models were studied, and the Akaike Information Criterion was used to determine the best model for diabetes inheritance in Australian Terriers, among the models deemed biologically feasible. Heritability of diabetes in Australian Terriers was estimated at 0.18 (95% confidence interval 0.0-0.67). There was no significant difference in the effect of males and females on disease outcome. Complex segregation analysis suggested that the mode of diabetes inheritance in Australian Terriers is polygenic, with no evidence for a large effect single gene influencing diabetes. It is concluded that in the population of Australian Terriers bred in the United States, a relatively small degree of genetic variation contributes to spontaneous diabetes. A genetic uniformity for diabetes-susceptible genes within the population of Australian Terriers bred in the Unites States could increase the risk of diabetes in this cohort. These findings hold promise for future genetic studies of canine diabetes focused on this particular breed.",PloS one,2020-,"Mui ML, Famula TR, Henthorn PS, Hess RS",4,1957,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Using the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Registry, we evaluated the validity and accuracy of provider-assigned diabetes type abstracted from medical records against etiologic criteria that included the presence of diabetes autoantibodies (DAA) and insulin sensitivity. Youth who were incident for diabetes in 2002-2006, 2008, or 2012 and had complete data on key analysis variables were included (n = 4001, 85% provider diagnosed type 1). The etiologic definition for type 1 diabetes was ≥1 positive DAA titer(s) or negative DAA titers in the presence of insulin sensitivity and for type 2 diabetes was negative DAA titers in the presence of insulin resistance. Provider diagnosed diabetes type correctly agreed with the etiologic definition of type for 89.9% of cases. Provider diagnosed type 1 diabetes was 96.9% sensitive, 82.8% specific, had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 97.0% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 82.7%. Provider diagnosed type 2 diabetes was 82.8% sensitive, 96.9% specific, had a PPV and NPV of 82.7% and 97.0%, respectively. Provider diagnosis of diabetes type agreed with etiologic criteria for 90% of the cases.

To develop machine learning (ML) models for risk assessment of MASLD occurrence in patients with DM. Feature selection determined the discriminative parameters, utilized to classify DM patients as those with and without MASLD. The performance of the multiple logistic regression model was quantified by sensitivity, specificity, and percentage of correctly classified patients, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Decision curve analysis (DCA) assessed the model's net benefit for alternative treatments. We studied 2000 patients with DM (mean age 58.85 ± 17.37 years; 48% women). Eight parameters: age, body mass index, type of DM, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, platelet count, hyperuricaemia, and treatment with metformin were identified as discriminative. The experiments for 1735 patients show that 744/991 (75.08%) and 586/744 (78.76%) patients with/without MASLD were correctly identified (sensitivity/specificity: 0.75/0.79). The area under ROC (AUC) was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.82-0.86), while DCA showed a higher clinical utility of the model, ranging from 30% to 84% threshold probability. Results for 265 test patients confirm the model's generalizability (sensitivity/specificity: 0.80/0.74; AUC: 0.81 [95% CI, 0.76-0.87]), whereas unsupervised clustering identified high-risk patients.

In a Danish nationwide population-based cohort study, we identified all individuals with adult-onset diabetes in the period 2000-2018 and categorized them as having type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or PPDM. We ascertained diabetes incidence rates, clinical and demographic characteristics, and classifications and prescription patterns of glucose-lowering therapy and compared these parameters across diabetes subgroups. Among 398,456 adults with new-onset diabetes, 5,879 (1.5%) had PPDM, 9,252 (2.3%) type 1 diabetes, and the remaining type 2 diabetes (96.2%).

37345245,Ketosis-prone Diabetes and Hypogonadism: A New Clinical Association to be Aware of ?,"Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) is an emerging entity, sharing features of both type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with KPD usually present with diabetic ketoacidosis without the classic phenotype of autoimmune type 1 diabetes. In most cases, they are Afro-American adults, who require insulin therapy for the management of acute decompensation, then usually encountering insulin-free remission for prolonged periods of time with diet or with non-insulin agents. Meanwhile, hypogonadism is a known condition that could be associated with higher risk of developing both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and could be a risk factor for decompensated diabetes. The association of KPD and hypogonadism is reported for the first time in literature. Here we report two peculiar cases of young African patients, affected by KPD and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, respectively Klinefelter's syndrome and primary ovarian failure. Both patients were treated promptly for the ketoacidosis with intravenous fluids combined with continuous insulin infusion, and then switched to subcutaneous regimen. After the correct clinical evaluation, oral antidiabetic drugs were added. KPD remains an under-recognized and under-diagnosed type of diabetes. As hypogonadism is strongly linked to dysmetabolic disorders, the evaluation of sex hormones should be performed at the onset of diabetes.

There are reports of alternative indices for prediction of DM, besides fasting blood glucose (FBG) level. This study, investigated the ability of combination of biochemical and anthropometric parameters and orodental disease indicators (ODIs) to generate models for DM prediction, using Akaike information criterion (AIC) to substantiate health economics of diabetes screening. Four hundred and thirty-three subjects were enrolled in the study in Ndokwa communities, Delta State, Nigeria, and their glycaemic status was determined, using the CardioChek analyser<sup>®</sup> and previous data from the Prediabetes and Cardiovascular Complications Study were also used. The cost of screening for diabetes (NGN 300 = $0.72) in a not-for-profit organization/hospital was used as basis to calculate the health economics of number of individuals with DM in 1,000 participants. Data on the subjects' anthropometric, biochemical and ODI parameters were used to generate different models, using R statistical software (version 4.0.0). The different models were evaluated for their AIC values. Lowest AIC was considered as best model. Microsoft Excel software (version 2020) was used in preliminary analysis. The cost of identifying <2 new subjects with hyperglycemia, in 1,000 people was ≥NGN 300,000 ($ 716). A total of 4,125 models were generated. AIC modeling indicates FBG test as the best model (AIC = 4), and the least being combination of random blood sugar + waist circumference + hip circumference (AIC ≈ 34). Models containing ODI parameters had AIC values >34, hence considered as not recommendable. The cost of general screening for diabetes in rural communities may appear high and burdensome in terms of health economics. However, the use of prediction models involving AIC is of value in terms of cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness to the healthcare consumers, which favors health economics.",Frontiers in public health,2022-,"Anyasodor AE, Nwose EU, Bwititi PT, Richards RS",4,2014,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

IR estimates of diabetes-related amputations with associated 95% confidence interval (CI) per 100,000 individuals with diabetes were calculated. 23 studies were included, reporting 505,390 diabetes-related lower extremity amputations. IR of minor amputations was 139.97 (95% CI 88.18-222.16) per 100,000 individuals with diabetes, among patients with type 1 diabetes was 148.59 (95% CI 65.00-339.68) and in type 2 diabetes was 75.53 (95% CI 29.94-190.54). IR of major amputations was 94.82 (95% CI 56.62-158.80) per 100,000 individuals with diabetes, among patients with type 1 diabetes was 100.76 (95% CI 53.71-189.01) and among type 2 diabetes was 40.58 (95% CI 11.03-149.28). There were 83.84 annual amputations (95% CI 41.67-168.65) per 100,000 women with diabetes and 178.04 (95% CI 81.16-390.55) per 100,000 men. Globally, annual incidence of diabetes-related amputations from 2010 to 2020 has shown to disproportionately affect men and individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus, although its incidence is not uniform across countries.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,2023-Jan,"Ezzatvar Y, García-Hermoso A",2,1305,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38981733,Trends in the representation of specialties caring for patients with diabetes in the Czech Republic.,"The increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) leads to the differentiation of the registration of diabetics in individual specialties. Objective of this paper was the evaluation of changes in the representation of expertise providing care for patients with DM (pDM) in the Czech Republic, based on data analysis from the National Register of Paid Health Services (NRHZS) 2010-2021. In the entire pDM group, the number of patients treated by a diabetologist (DIA) increased from 491,490 (57.0 %) to 537,430 (50.4 %), with a general practitioner (GP) from 27,719 (3.2 %) to 181,330 (17.0 %) and by internist (INT) from 172,918 (20.0 %) to 161,291 (15.1 %). In 2021, 57.9 % DIA, 17 % GP, 12.2 % INT were treated from the group treated with antidiabetics (813,873). In 2021, 84,345 were treated with insulin alone (87.2 % DIA), 129,127 were treated with a combination of insulin and non-insulin antidiabetics; 115,604 (91.6 %) in DIA, 322 (0.3 %) in GP and 7,983 (6.3 %) in INT. 603,331 treated only with non-insulin antidiabetic drugs, of which 281,929 (46.7 %) DIA, 137,744 (22.8 %) GP and 85,273 (14.1 %) INT. For other specialties, 98,385 (16.3 %) persons. 185,838 patients without reported DIA/GP/INT control, of which 80,144 without therapy.

33221965,One hundred years ago: the dawning of the insulin era.,"The dawn of the insulin era can be placed in 1921, when Banting and Best started their experiments which led, a year later, to the successful treatment of diabetes. They were preceded by the discoveries of the pancreatic cause of diabetes by Minkowski and von Mering in 1889 and of the islets by Paul Langerhans in 1869. The achievement of the first targeted treatment in medical history was a landmark of medical progress. However, it was accompanied by a mixture of human greatness and misery. Genius and recklessness, ambition and deception, camaraderie and rivalry, selflessness and pursuit of glory went along with superficial search of the existing literature, poor planning, faulty interpretation of results, failure to reproduce them, and misquoting of reports from other laboratories. Then as now, such faults surface whenever human nature aims to push forward the boundaries of knowledge and pose a real challenge in today's world, as the scientific method strives to keep healthy in the face of growing anti-scientific feelings.",Acta diabetologica,2021-Jan,Porta M,1,1039,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The potential factors influencing medication adherence and how they contribute to health behaviors have not been synthesized to date. This review synthesized qualitative studies that identified factors influencing medication adherence among adults living with diabetes and comorbidity. Twenty-eight findings were extracted and synthesized into four themes: perceived support, lack of knowledge, medication issues, and the importance of routine. The findings highlight the factors that support medication adherence and areas that can be targeted to support and promote medication adherence. The findings also support the potential role of healthcare providers in supporting people living with diabetes and comorbidity to adhere to and maintain medication regimes. Several factors were identified that are amenable to intervention within the clinical practice setting and have the potential to enhance medication adherence and improve health outcomes for people living with diabetes and comorbidities.

39710551,Positive association of oscillometrically estimated baseline arterial stiffness with incident diabetes and prediabetes: A large population-based cohort study.,"This large population-based study aimed to investigate whether arterial stiffness, assessed oscillometrically, was associated with incident diabetes/prediabetes. The study sample comprised 4240 participants from the Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) Study (mean±SD age = 66 ± 8). Arterial stiffness was assessed from 5 April 2011-6 November 2012 by way of aortic PWV (aPWV) and estimated carotid-femoral PWV (ecfPWV). Incident diabetes/prediabetes was determined by linkage to dispensed prescription and national hospital discharge registers. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the risk of diabetes/prediabetes in relation to chosen arterial stiffness measures both overall and over quartiles. During a mean±SD follow-up of 10.5 ± 0.4 years, 470 participants developed diabetes/prediabetes. Following adjustment for potential confounders, aPWV (hazard ratio (HR) per SD increase, 1.40, 95 % CI, 1.19-1.64) was associated with the incidence of diabetes. The risk of incident diabetes was, compared to the first quartile, higher in the fourth quartile of aPWV (HR, 1.98, 95 %CI, 1.26-3.11)(P<sub>trend</sub>=0.01). Arterial stiffness, as measured by aPWV may be a useful predictor of incident diabetes that can be utilized in clinical practice.",Primary care diabetes,2025-Feb,"Beros AL, Sluyter JD, Hughes AD, Hametner B, Wassertheurer S, Scragg R",6,1256,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33147904,Acute pancreatitis and diabetes mellitus: a review.,"Diabetes following acute pancreatitis (AP) is becoming increasingly recognized. It is unclear what subtype of diabetes mellitus (DM) occurs; however, type 3c diabetes mellitus (T3cDM) is gaining increasing recognition. T3cDM has differing pathophysiology than other subtypes of DM and therefore differing disease course and treatment. Current studies have examined the incidence and prevalence of DM following AP, and meta-analyses have shown around 15% develop DM at 1 year with an increasing proportion developing DM at 5 years. It has been observed that some patients have transient hyperglycemia following AP episode with a subset developing persistent impaired glucose metabolism; however, the exact timeline is not well defined. The data on risk factors for developing DM after AP is limited and mixed; however, it is likely that severity of AP may impact the propensity to develop DM. Screening guidelines have not been established following AP; however, screening 1-year post-event will likely capture a sizable proportion of newly developed DM. The endocrine and exocrine pancreas are closely linked, and studies have found significant overlap in dysfunction of both after AP. Finally, there are some data to suggest that diabetes predisposes patients to structural changes in the pancreas and increased risk of developing AP.",The Korean journal of internal medicine,2021-Jan,"Richardson A, Park WG",2,1335,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Hispanic populations are higher risk for diabetes and associated complications, especially low-income communities. Research suggests free clinics provide suboptimal diabetes management. Our quality improvement project aims to improve diabetes management in the Hispanic free clinic population. Clínica Latina's volunteer medical students and physicians serve predominantly uninsured Spanish-speaking patients. Established diabetes patients that attended clinic during the study were included. Data was collected regarding patients' diabetes care for two months, then analyzed compared to quality metrics. We implemented paper checklists and electronic medical record (EMR) smart phrases for volunteers to utilize in managing diabetes. 32 patients were included in the study. At baseline, 78% had an A1C check in the past 3 months, 81% were on a statin. In the past year, 81% had a lipid panel, 19% had an eye exam, 63% had a diabetic foot exam, 53% had a urine microalbumin-creatinine screening. After interventions, 97% had an A1C check, 93% were on a statin, 91% had a lipid panel, 31% had an eye exam, 75% had a foot exam, 63% had a urine microalbumin-creatinine. Patients with an LDL < 100 increased from 62 to 66%. The mean A1C did not statistically significantly change. Volunteer smart phrase utilization increased from 37 to 59.1%. We implemented a checklist and EMR smart phrase to optimize diabetes management in a student-run Hispanic free clinic, which improved quality metrics.

32268561,Prevalence of Diabetic Retinopathy in Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients in North-East Poland.,"<i>Background and Objectives:</i> The global epidemic of diabetes, especially type 2 (DM2), is related to lifestyle changes, obesity, and the process of population aging. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most serious complication of the eye caused by diabetes. The aim of this research was to assess the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in north-east Poland. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: The eye fundus was assessed on the basis of two-field 50 degrees color fundus photographs that showed the optic nerve and macula in the center after the pupil was dilated with 1% tropicamide. <i>Results</i>: The experimental group included 315 (26%) patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) and 894 (74%) patients with DM2. DM1 patients were diagnosed with DR in 32.58% of cases, with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) in 24.44% of cases, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in 1.59% of cases, diabetic macular edema (DME) in 5.40% of cases, and PDR with DME in 0.95% of cases. DR was found in DM2 patients in 23.04% of cases, NPDR in 17.11% of cases, PDR in 1.01% of cases, DME in 4.81% of cases, and PDR with DME in 0.11% of cases. <i>Conclusions</i>: The presented study is the first Polish study on the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy presenting a large group of patients, and its results could be extrapolated to the whole country. Diabetic retinopathy was found in 25.48% of patients in the whole experimental group. The above results place Poland within the European average, indicating the quality of diabetic care offered in Poland, based on the number of observed complications.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2020-Apr,"Matuszewski W, Baranowska-Jurkun A, Stefanowicz-Rutkowska MM, Modzelewski R, Pieczyński J, Bandurska-Stankiewicz E",6,1651,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38980465,Clinical Outcomes of Rural Patients with Diabetes Treated by ECHO-Trained Providers Versus an Academic Medical Center.,"Despite clinical practice guidelines prioritizing cardiorenal risk reduction, national trends in diabetes outcomes, particularly in rural communities, do not mirror the benefits seen in clinical trials with emerging therapeutics and technologies. Project ECHO supports implementation of guidelines in under-resourced areas through virtual communities of practice, sharing of best practices, and case-based learning. We hypothesized that diabetes outcomes of patients treated by ECHO-trained primary care providers (PCPs) would be similar to those of patients treated by specialists at an academic medical center. Specialists from the University of New Mexico (UNM) launched a weekly diabetes ECHO program to mentor dyads consisting of a PCP and community health worker at ten rural clinics. We compared cardiorenal risk factor changes in patients with diabetes treated by ECHO-trained dyads to patients treated by specialists at the UNM Diabetes Comprehensive Care Center (DCCC). Eligible participants included adults with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes on insulin, or diabetes of either type with A1c > 9%. The primary outcome was change from baseline in A1c in the ECHO and DCCC cohorts. Secondary outcomes included changes in body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, cholesterol, and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR). Compared to the DCCC cohort (n = 151), patients in the ECHO cohort (n = 856) experienced greater A1c reduction (-1.2% vs -0.6%; p = 0.02 for difference in difference). BMI decreased in the Endo ECHO cohort and increased in the DCCC cohort (-0.2 vs. +1.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; p = 0.003 for difference in difference). Diastolic blood pressure declined in the Endo ECHO cohort only. Improvements of similar magnitude were observed in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in both groups. UACR remained stable in both groups. ECHO may be a suitable intervention for improving diabetes outcomes in rural, under-resourced communities with limited access to a specialist.",Journal of general internal medicine,2024-Nov,"Bouchonville MF, Myaskovsky L, Leyva YL, Erhardt EB, Unruh ML, Arora S",6,1988,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38969978,"Evaluating diabetes care in primary healthcare centers in Abuja, Nigeria: a cross-sectional formative assessment.","Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are associated with high and rising burden of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is among the leading causes of NCD-related deaths worldwide and is a foremost public health problem in Nigeria. As part of National policy, Nigeria has committed to implement the World Health Organization (WHO) Package of Essential Non-communicable Disease interventions for primary care. Implementing the intervention requires the availability of essential elements, including guidelines, trained staff, health management information systems (HMIS), equipment, and medications, in primary healthcare centers (PHCs). This study assessed the availability of the DM component of the WHO package, and the readiness of the health workers in these PHCs to implement a DM screening, evaluation, and management program to inform future adoption and implementation. This cross-sectional formative assessment adapted the WHO Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) tool to survey 30 PHCs selected by multistage sampling for readiness to deliver DM diagnosis and care in Abuja, Nigeria, between August and October 2021. The SARA tool was adapted to focus on DM services and the availability and readiness indicator scores were calculated based on the proportion of PHCs with available DM care services, minimum staff requirement, diagnostic tests, equipment, medications, and national guidelines/protocols for DM care within the defined SARA domain. All 30 PHCs reported the availability of at least two full-time staff (median [interquartile range] = 5 [4-9]), which were mostly community health extension workers (median [interquartile range]) = 3 [1-4]. At least one staff member was recently trained in DM care in 11 PHCs (36%). The study also reported high availability of paper-based HMIS (100%), and DM screening services using a glucometer (87%), but low availability of DM job aids (27%), treatment (23%), and national guidelines/protocols (0%). This formative assessment of PHCs' readiness to implement a DM screening, evaluation, and management program in Abuja demonstrated readiness to integrate DM care into PHCs regarding equipment, paper-based HMIS, and nonphysician health workers' availability. However, strategies are needed to promote DM health workforce training, provide DM management guidelines, and supply essential DM medications.",BMC primary care,2024-Jul,"Orji IA, Baldridge AS, Ikechukwu-Orji MU, Banigbe B, Eze NC, Chopra A, Omitiran K, Iyer G, Odoh D, Alex-Okoh M, Reng R, Hirschhorn LR, Huffman MD, Ojji DB",14,2425,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

39218351,Smoking and diabetes.,"Smoking increases insulin resistance via multiple mechanisms but is a poorly understood risk factor for onset of type-2 diabetes. It is also associated with impaired beta-cell function in humans, but again the mechanisms are poorly understood. Mechanistic studies of the impact of smoking on carbohydrate metabolism mainly evaluated nicotine as the causal agent, and more rarely other tobacco constituents, making it impossible to conclude that the risk of diabetes is linked to the effects of nicotine alone. Active smoking also has negative impact on glycemic control in both type-1 and type-2 diabetic patients. It increases the risk of all-cause mortality and worsens the chronic complications of diabetes. Impact on microangiopathic complications in type-2 diabetic patients, however, is more controversial. Data on pharmacological and behavioral strategies for smoking cessation used in the general population are more sparse in diabetic patients, despite opportunities with recent therapeutic trials involving varenicline and GLP-1 analogues. It is essential for diabetic patients to stop smoking, and diabetologists must get involved in smoking cessation as they have done for many years in therapeutic education, which can easily include measures to help patients stop smoking.",Annales d'endocrinologie,2024-Dec,"Rouland A, Thuillier P, Al-Salameh A, Benzerouk F, Bahougne T, Tramunt B, Berlin I, Clair C, Thomas D, Le Faou AL, Vergès B, Durlach V",12,1286,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Unadjusted and adjusted linear regression was performed to determine the association between self-reported physical activity per week (min) and wearable device usage (users and nonusers) among people living with diabetes using survey analysis. 84.97 % (95 % CI [80.39, 88.89]) of participants were nonusers of wearable devices, while 15.03 % (95 % CI [11.11, 19.61]) were users. Across the sample, the average weekly physical activity was 427.39 mins (95 % Cl [356.43, 498.35]). Nonusers had a higher physical activity per week with 433.83 mins (95 % CI [353.59, 514.07]), while users only had 392.59 mins (95 % CI [253.48, 531.69]) of physical activity per week. However, the differences between the two groups were non-statistically significant (p=.61). In both adjusted and unadjusted linear regressions between physical activity per week and wearable device usage, statistically significant associations were not found (unadjusted: β=-41.24, p=.62; adjusted: β=-56.41, p=.59).

35409752,Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes in Poland.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive inherited monogenic disease in Caucasians. As medical technology progresses and the quality of patient care improves, the survival time of patients with CF has increased, which results in more frequent comorbidities such as cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). CFRD is the result of abnormal glucose metabolism characterized primarily by insulin deficiency, exacerbated periodically by insulin resistance. The aim of our study was to analyze the epidemiology of patients with CFRD in Poland on the basis of data collected from six CF treatment centers. Analyses were performed on 1157 CF patients who were treated at one of the six CF care centers. CFRD was diagnosed according to standard criteria. All data including demographics, types of CFTR mutations, CFRD duration, and microorganisms in the sputum were obtained from the patients' medical history. Our study indicates that the prevalence of CFRD in Poland is 12.9%. CFRD was most often diagnosed between the ages of 11 and 20 (60% of patients), while 23% of patients were diagnosed between 21 and 30 years of age. Furthermore, we observed that approximately 3-5% of patients under the age of 10 had CFRD. We found out that the type of mutation did not affect the frequency of CFRD development. Factors that increased the risk of developing CFRD include underweight and chronic <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infection. Due to the extended lifespan of CF patients, the number of CFRD patients is currently increasing.

First, hospitalized COVID-19 patients were divided into three groups; Non-diabetic patients with BS < 140 mg/dl (N = 394), non-diabetic patients with BS ≥ 140 mg/dl (N = 113) and diabetic patients (N = 315). Mortality, ICU admission, and length of hospital stay were compared between groups and odds ratio was adjusted using logistic regression. After adjustment with pre-existing conditions and drugs, it was shown that non-diabetic patients with BS ≥ 140 mg/dl are at increased risk of mortality (aOR 1.89 (0.99-3.57)) and ICU admission (aOR 2.62 (1.49-4.59)) even more than diabetic patients (aOR 1.72 (1.07-2.78) for mortality and aOR 2.28 (1.47-3.54) for ICU admission. Admission time hyperglycemia predicts worse outcome of COVID-19 and BS ≥ 140 mg/dl is associated with a markedly increase in ICU admission and mortality.",Primary care diabetes,2022-Jun,"Nateghi S, Gomari MM, Roudsari YJ, Foroughi A, Mansouri F, Shiva A, Nasrollahizadeh A, Nasiri Z, Faraji N",9,1009,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32387114,News ways of understanding the complex biology of diabetes using PET.,"The understanding of metabolic disease and diabetes on a molecular level has increased significantly due to the recent advances in molecular biology and biotechnology. However, in vitro studies and animal models do not always translate to the human disease, perhaps illustrated by the failure of many drug candidates in the clinical phase. Non-invasive biomedical imaging techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) offer tools for direct visualization and quantification of molecular processes in humans. Developments in this area potentially enable longitudinal in vivo studies of receptors and processes involved in diabetes guiding drug development and diagnosis in the near future. This mini-review focuses on describing the overall perspective of how PET can be used to increase our understanding and improve treatment of diabetes.

34016607,Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults (LADA) Is Likely to Represent a Mixed Population of Autoimmune (Type 1) and Nonautoimmune (Type 2) Diabetes.,"Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is typically defined as a new diabetes diagnosis after 35 years of age, presenting with clinical features of type 2 diabetes, in whom a type 1 diabetes-associated islet autoantibody is detected. Identifying autoimmune diabetes is important since the prognosis and optimal therapy differ. However, the existing LADA definition identifies a group with clinical and genetic features intermediate between typical type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is unclear whether this is due to <i>1</i>) true autoimmune diabetes with a milder phenotype at older onset ages that initially appears similar to type 2 diabetes but later requires insulin, <i>2</i>) a disease syndrome where the pathophysiologies of type 1 and type 2 diabetes are both present in each patient, or <i>3</i>) a heterogeneous group resulting from difficulties in classification. Herein, we suggest that difficulties in classification are a major component resulting from defining LADA using a diagnostic test-islet autoantibody measurement-with imperfect specificity applied in low-prevalence populations. This yields a heterogeneous group of true positives (autoimmune type 1 diabetes) and false positives (nonautoimmune type 2 diabetes). For clinicians, this means that islet autoantibody testing should not be undertaken in patients who do not have clinical features suggestive of autoimmune diabetes: in an adult without clinical features of type 1 diabetes, it is likely that a single positive antibody will represent a false-positive result. This is in contrast to patients with features suggestive of type 1 diabetes, where false-positive results will be rare. For researchers, this means that current definitions of LADA are not appropriate for the study of autoimmune diabetes in later life. Approaches that increase test specificity, or prior likelihood of autoimmune diabetes, are needed to avoid inclusion of participants who have nonautoimmune (type 2) diabetes. Improved classification will allow improved assignment of prognosis and therapy as well as an improved cohort in which to analyze and better understand the detailed pathophysiological components acting at onset and during disease progression in late-onset autoimmune diabetes.",Diabetes care,2021-Jun,"Jones AG, McDonald TJ, Shields BM, Hagopian W, Hattersley AT",5,2251,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33970587,"Diabetes: Screening, Diagnosis, and Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes.","From 2013-2016, 34.5% of US adults had prediabetes. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening all adults ages 40 to 70 years with overweight or obesity for abnormal blood glucose, and screening for gestational diabetes in pregnant women after 24 weeks. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screening all patients older than 45 years for prediabetes and diabetes, and screening earlier for patients with risk factors. Screening in younger patients is based on risk factors. The diagnostic criteria for prediabetes and diabetes require two abnormal test results from the same sample or from two separate samples, in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia or symptomatic hyperglycemia. Physical activity and healthy eating patterns continue to be the cornerstones of diabetes prevention. Although no drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for diabetes prevention, strong evidence supports the use of metformin in adults with prediabetes.

It is associated with several long-term consequences and higher hospitalization rates. To examine the profile of hospital admissions related to diabetes mellitus and the prescription rates of antidiabetic medications in England and Wales. This is an ecological study that was conducted for the period between April 1999 and April 2020 using publicly available hospitalisation data in England and Wales. Hospital admission data for patients of all ages was extracted from Hospital Episode Statistics in England and the Patient Episode Database for Wales. The difference between admission rates in 1999 and 2020, as well as the difference between diabetes mellitus medication prescription rates in 2004 and 2020, were assessed using the Pearson Chi-squared test. A Poisson regression model with robust variance estimation was used to examine the trend in hospital admissions. A total of 1,757,892 diabetes mellitus hospital admissions were recorded in England and Wales during the duration of the study. The hospital admission rate for diabetes mellitus increased by 15.2%. This increase was concomitant with an increase in the antidiabetic medication prescribing rate of 105.9% between 2004 and 2020. Males and those in the age group of 15-59 years had a higher rate of hospital admission. The most common causes of admissions were type 1 diabetes mellitus related complications, which accounted for 47.1% of all admissions. This research gives an in-depth overview of the hospitalization profile in England and Wales during the previous two decades. In England and Wales, people with all types of diabetes and related problems have been hospitalized at a high rate over the past 20 years. Male gender and middle age were significant determinants in influencing admission rates. Diabetes mellitus type 1 complications were the leading cause of hospitalizations.

32461042,Improving compliance with diabetes care using a novel mnemonic: A quality improvement project in an urban primary care clinic.,"The aim of this quality improvement project was to improve compliance with the delivery of multidimensional patient-centered diabetes care using a streamlined mnemonic based on established diabetes guidelines. Using the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) model for improvement, four rapid plan-do-study-act cycles primarily implemented different tests of change over eight weeks using a streamlined mnemonic - the LLaVES (lifestyle, laboratory tests, vaccination, examination, social/psychosocial) bundle for screening and case management of patients with diabetes. Secondary to the LLaVES bundle, tests of change were also conducted for clinic team members and patients. Team member engagement utilized a best-practice toolkit for effective communication. Patient engagement implemented validated models to evaluate knowledge of diabetes and stage of change. Data were analyzed using run charts to evaluate the impact of interventions on outcomes. Overall compliance was measured as the diabetes management compliance rate (DMCR), composed of LLaVES implementation, team engagement, and patient engagement scores. The diabetes management compliance rate increased by 72.2%, from a baseline of 49% to 84.4% in eight weeks. Team engagement increased from 76.6% to 92% while patient engagement increased from 70.4% to 87.4%. Diabetes management is complex and requires team and patient engagement to implement a structured and multidimensional process. Composed of established, high-level evidence interventions, the LLaVES bundle is one approach to systematize complex care while taking into account the specific and unique challenges of a health care organization.",Primary care diabetes,2020-Dec,"Tabingo N, Verzone A",2,1672,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

In parallel, focus has been placed on the development of tools for the application of precision medicine to numerous conditions. This Consensus Report presents the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Precision Medicine in Diabetes Initiative in partnership with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), including its mission, the current state of the field and prospects for the future. Expert opinions are presented on areas of precision diagnostics and precision therapeutics (including prevention and treatment) and key barriers to and opportunities for implementation of precision diabetes medicine, with better care and outcomes around the globe, are highlighted. Cases where precision diagnosis is already feasible and effective (i.e. monogenic forms of diabetes) are presented, while the major hurdles to the global implementation of precision diagnosis of complex forms of diabetes are discussed. The situation is similar for precision therapeutics, in which the appropriate therapy will often change over time owing to the manner in which diabetes evolves within individual patients. This Consensus Report describes a foundation for precision diabetes medicine, while highlighting what remains to be done to realise its potential.

While there is an established market for glucose sensors, the rising number of DM cases has promoted intensive research to provide accurate systems for glucose monitoring. Polyaniline (PAni) is a conductive polymer with a linear conjugated backbone with sequences of single C-C and double C=C bonds. This unique structure produces attractive features for the design of sensing systems such as conductivity, biocompatibility, environmental stability, tunable electrochemical properties, and antibacterial activity. PAni-based glucose sensors (PBGS) were actively developed in past years, using either enzymatic or non-enzymatic principles. In these devices, PAni played roles as a conductive material for electron transfer, biocompatible matrix for enzymatic immobilization, or sensitive layer for detection. In this review, we covered the development of PBGS from 2015 to the present, and it is not even exhaustive; it provides an overview of advances and achievements for enzymatic and non-enzymatic PBGB PBGS for self-monitoring and continuous blood glucose monitoring.

This narrative review examines the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management and identifies areas of future research to address the challenge posed by CAN. We conducted a comprehensive literature search using a range of sources, including the electronic databases PubMed Central, Google Scholar, OVID, and Open Athens, to search for studies on CAN, diabetes mellitus, lifestyle intervention, and cardiovascular risk. We set inclusion criteria to consider review articles or original research published in peer-reviewed journals that examined CAN in diabetes. Epidemiologic data indicate a varied prevalence of CAN in type 1 and 2 diabetes, with prevalences of 17% to 73%) depending on clinical and demographic factors. Indeed, duration of diabetes and hyperglycemia are the strongest risk factors for CAN development in type 1 diabetes. However, in type 2 diabetes, multifactorial risk factors, including obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, are associated with the development of CAN. Insulin resistance, which underpins type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, has a direct role in the pathogenesis of CAN. Lifestyle interventions, including dietary measures and tailored exercise programs, have been beneficial in improving cardiac autonomic function primarily measured through heart rate variability. In addition, weight loss through bariatric surgery also improves heart rate variability and may prevent or reduce CAN progression in people living with obesity and concomitant type 2 diabetes. For optimization in type 2 diabetes, both lifestyle and targeted pharmacologic interventions are required to achieve glycemic/metabolic targets, and weight loss is required to prevent or reverse early CAN or prevent the progression to definite and severe CAN. The focused use of diagnostic testing for CAN, including cardiac autonomic reflex testing in those at high risk of CAN, will enable earlier diagnosis. This testing will allow timely interventions at a reversible stage. Future research should examine targeted early diagnostic testing with subsequent intervention with a combination of lifestyle measures and newer pharmacotherapeutics (eg, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists), which have produced significant cardiovascular benefit in diabetes.",Clinical therapeutics,2022-Oct,"Williams S, Raheim SA, Khan MI, Rubab U, Kanagala P, Zhao SS, Marshall A, Brown E, Alam U",9,2497,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Education delivered during pregnancy aims to reduce this risk by reminding women to maintain dietary and lifestyle modifications after delivery. The primary objective of this study was to describe and analyze the feelings and daily lifestyle changes, including physical activity and dietary changes, among women who experienced gestational diabetes and the roles played by their general practitioners during follow-up. We conducted a qualitative study examining women's attitudes during the 6-12 months postpartum, after receiving a gestational diabetes diagnosis and associated education. All women participated in semi-structured, individual, telephone-based interviews. Out of 47 patients contacted, we interviewed 16 women. All interviewed women modified their behaviors, at least slightly, and described changes that included more balanced diets and the incorporation of mild physical activity. Lack of time, lack of awareness regarding the long-term risk of developing type 2 diabetes, resistance to long-term dietary changes, and cultural habits were identified as the primary barriers to long-term lifestyle modifications, whereas family support was found to be beneficial. The reported interactions between each woman and her physician appeared to be weak. Our study showed that educational attitudes and preventive interventions must be reinforced, especially during the long-term, and not only during the immediate postpartum period.

DKD is found to occur in approximately 40% of patients with type 2 diabetes and 30% of patients with type 1 diabetes. However, research on the effects of antihyperglycemic agents on the renal outcomes of these patients is still in its infancy. The current review explores glycemic management in patients with DKD, focusing on the challenges faced as well as the clinical considerations of antihyperglycemic agents in this population. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using EMBASE, Web of Science, and PubMed databases. This review was completed by the end of March 2023, and the following keywords were used for the search: diabetic nephropathy, diabetic kidney disease, safety, efficacy, and antihyperglycemic therapies. The several concerns about the use of antihyperglycemic agents in treating diabetes in patients with DKD highlight the need for substantial efforts in educating both patients and healthcare practitioners in this regard. In addition, it is suggested that patients receive individualized treatments, considering the potential long-term benefits of each agent; this would entail prospectively modifying doses in line with the stage of DKD to prevent the progression of renal damage. As some classes of agents offer better renoprotective effects for patients with DKD, it would be wise for nephrologists and endocrinologists to collaborate to offer an antihyperglycemic regime for patients with DKD who are at a high risk of further progression. Further study is needed on the beneficial renal effects of specific classes of agents; more knowledge of their mechanisms and renoprotective effects may contribute to the development of novel treatments for patients with DKD.",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,2023-Dec,"Jairoun AA, Ping CC, Ibrahim B",3,1864,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We investigated the prevalence of DM, pre-diabetes, undiagnosed and uncontrolled diabetes and its relationship with some associated socioeconomic factors in the Yazd Greater Area in Iran. Yazd Health Study is a longitudinal study conducted to determine the prevalence of non-communicable disease and related risk factors. In a two-step cluster sampling, 10,000 adults aged 20-69 years (200 clusters) were selected. In the recruitment phase, DM was considered if the patients had been either diagnosed DM by a physician or had fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL. Chi square test was used for categorical variables to evaluate the differences and logistic regression model was applied to determine the predictors of diabetes.. P-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Of the 9965 individuals recruited, the crude self-reported prevalence of DM was 14.1% (95% CI: 13.4-14.7). The prevalence was higher in women than men (15.6 vs.12.4%), significantly. The age-standardized prevalence of DM was 8%. The prevalence was 14.9% in Yazd local people and 8.6% in those residents migrated from other provinces (P < 0.0001). We showed a significant association between DM prevalence and age, education, marital status, unemployment, insurance status, and positive family history (P < 0.0001). The prevalence of DM diagnosed by phycisians was 16.1% in participants (age-standardized prevalence: 8.3%). The subset analysis showed that 4.8% of patients were not aware of their disease. The prevalence of pre-diabetes was 25.8%. Of those with diabetes, 58.3% were not adequately controlled, which is not statistically significant with socio-economic status. The current study showed a high prevalence of DM in Yazd Greater Area which is closely related to some socio-demographic factors. The high prevalence of pre-diabetes is alarming. Effective strategies for DM prevention should be introduced. The majority of people with diabetes are aware, but half of them are not controlled. The ineffective care plan currently in use, should be reviewed. Patients needs to be encouraged to improve their lifestyle.

34922848,Relation between diabetes related distress and glycemic control: The mediating effect of adherence to treatment.,"Diabetes related distress (DRD) is a negative emotional reaction to stresses associated with diabetes mellitus (DM) and its management. This study estimated the burden of DRD and self-reported adherence to treatment (SRAT) among patients with DM and investigated their relationship with glycemic control. A cross sectional study of consented 157 diabetics was conducted using the17-item Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS). It measures distress at four subscales: Emotional Burden (EB), Physician-related (PD), Regimen-related (RD) and Interpersonal Distress (ID). SRAT was assessed using Morisky's scale. Glycemic control was assessed using the most recent HbA1c results. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used for adjustment of confounders and bootstrap Confidence Interval was used to test for the occurrence of mediating effect. Average age was 44.5 ± 16.0 years, 65% were females, 79% had type 2 DM and nearly 55% has had DM for more than 7 years and the average HbA1c was 8.9 ± 2.2%. Clinically significant DRD was reported by 37% of the participants, EB and RD in 40.8%, PD in 46.5%, and ID among 32.5%. Younger patients showed higher level of stress compared to older participants and patients with type 1 DM showed higher level of stress in all DRD domains. Only 46% of patients were defined as having satisfactory SRAT and improvement of SRAT significantly enhanced the glycemic control (r = -0.32, p < 0.01). DRD and low SRAT negatively correlated with HbA1c; increasing the DRD by one point may increase the HbA1c on average by 0.41 (C.I. 0.02-0.80) and will indirectly raise the HbA1c by 0.24 (C.I. 0.04-0.47) through the mediating effect of low SRAT. DRD and low SRAT are commonly reported among DM patients and both are indirectly correlated. The mediating effect of low SRAT highlights the clinical role of DRD and clarifies the process by which distress affect the outcome of DM management.",Primary care diabetes,2022-Apr,"Fayed A, AlRadini F, Alzuhairi RM, Aljuhani AE, Alrashid HR, Alwazae MM, Alghamdi NR",7,1912,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35236158,Diabetes mellitus and the causes of hospitalisation in people with heart failure.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with increased risk of hospitalisation in people with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, little is known about the causes of these events. Prospective cohort study of 711 people with stable HFrEF. Hospitalisations were categorised by cause as: decompensated heart failure; other cardiovascular; infection or other non-cardiovascular. Rates of hospitalisation and burden of hospitalisation (percentage of follow-up time in hospital) were compared in people with and without DM. After a mean follow-up of 4.0 years, 1568 hospitalisations occurred in the entire cohort. DM (present in 32% [<i>n</i>=224]) was associated with a higher rate (mean 1.07 vs 0.78 per 100 patient-years; <i>p</i><0.001) and burden (3.4 vs 2.2% of follow-up time; <i>p</i><0.001) of hospitalisation. Cause-specific analyses revealed increased rate and burden of hospitalisation due to decompensated heart failure, other cardiovascular causes and infection in people with DM, whereas other non-cardiovascular causes were comparable. Infection made the largest contribution to the burden of hospitalisation in people with and without DM. In people with HFrEF, DM is associated with a greater burden of hospitalisation due to decompensated heart failure, other cardiovascular events and infection, with infection making the largest contribution.",Diabetes & vascular disease research,2022-,"Malik A, Garland E, Drozd M, Palin V, Giannoudi M, Straw S, Jex N, Walker AM, Gierula J, Paton M, Witte KK, Kearney MT, Levelt E, Cubbon RM",14,1379,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This study aimed to construct a machine learning model for DPN diagnosis based on microcirculatory parameters, and identify the most predictive parameters for DPN. Our study involved 261 subjects, including 102 diabetics with neuropathy (DMN), 73 diabetics without neuropathy (DM), and 86 healthy controls (HC). DPN was confirmed by nerve conduction velocity and clinical sensory tests. Microvascular function was measured by postocclusion reactive hyperemia (PORH), local thermal hyperemia (LTH), and transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO<inf>2</inf>). Other physiological information was also investigated. Logistic regression (LR) and other machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to develop the model for DPN diagnosis. Kruskal-Wallis Test (non-parametric) were performed for multiple comparisons. Several performance measures, such as accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, were used to access the efficacy of the developed model. All the features were ranked based on the importance score to find features with higher DPN predictions. There was an overall decrease in microcirculatory parameters in response to PORH and LTH, as well as TcPO<inf>2</inf>, in DMN group compared to DM group and HC group. Random forest (RF) was found to be the best model, and achieved 84.6% accuracy along with 90.2% sensitivity and 76.7% specificity. RF_PF% of PORH was the main predictor of DPN. In addition, diabetic duration was also an important risk factor.

Three algorithms for identifying women with T1DM, T2DM, and GDM based on International Classification of Diseases---tenth revision (ICD-10) codes were assessed: delivery hospitalization records (Algorithm #1), outpatient clinics during pregnancy (Algorithm #2), and delivery hospitalization plus outpatient clinics during pregnancy (Algorithm #3). In a subset of women with clinic visits between 2005 and 2009, we examined the performance of an additional Algorithm #4 based on Algorithm #3 plus outpatient clinics in the 2 years before pregnancy. Using the diabetes clinical registry as the ""gold standard,"" we calculated true positive rates and agreement levels for the algorithms. The clinical registry included data on 928 pregnancies, of which 90 were T1DM, 89 were T2DM, and 749 were GDM. Algorithm #3 had the highest true positive rate for the detection of T1DM, T2DM, and GDM of 94%, 72%, and 99.9%, respectively, resulting in an overall agreement of 97% in diagnosis between the administrative databases and the clinical registry. Algorithm #4 did not provide much improvement over Algorithm #3 in overall agreement.

The relationship between SIRI and the risk of diabetic cardiovascular complications is still unclear. The purpose of our study was to address the correlation between SIRI and the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. A total of 8759 individuals were selected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (2015-2020) in our study. Comparing with control (n = 6446) and pre-DM (n = 350) individuals, the DM patients (n = 1963) show the higher SIRI level (all P < 0.001) and prevalence of CVD (all P < 0.001). Furthermore, in a fully adjusted model, we observed the increase of tertiles of SIRI was a risk factor for CVD in DM patients (the middle tertile: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.13-3.13; the highest tertile: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.03-3.22; all P < 0.05), while the relationship between hypersensitive CRP (hs-CRP) and the risk of diabetic cardiovascular complications was not observed (all P > 0.05).

The findings unveiled a distinctive gene profile in the hearts of <i>db/db</i> mice with decreased levels of <i>nppb</i> mRNA and increased levels of <i>Myh7</i>, indicating potential cardiac dysfunction. The mRNA levels of <i>USP18</i> (deubiquitinating enzyme), <i>PSMB8</i>, and <i>PSMB9</i> (proteasome β-subunits) were down-regulated in <i>db/db</i> mice, while the mRNA levels of RNF167 (E3 ligase) were increased. Corresponding LMP2 and LMP7 proteins were down-regulated in <i>db/db</i> mice, and RNF167 was elevated in <i>Adult</i> diabetic mice. The reduced expression of LMP2 and LMP7, along with increased RNF167 expression, may contribute to the future cardiac deterioration commonly observed in diabetes.

Consensus opinion drives most of the guidelines and recommendations for management of diabetes in surgical patients. Pathophysiology is often complex with varying levels of glucose and surgical stress. Establishing well-controlled diabetes prior to surgical intervention should be standard practice in non-emergent procedures. We review the best practices for implementing preoperative assessment, with diabetes with a focus on diabetes medications. The management of a patient preoperatively varies by region and country.

There is a close relationship between insulin resistance (IR) and NAFLD, with a five-fold higher prevalence of NAFLD in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) compared to that in patients without T2DM. IR is involved in the progression of disease conditions such as steatosis and NASH, as well as hepatic fibrosis progression. The mechanisms underlying these processes involve genetic factors, hepatic fat accumulation, alterations in energy metabolism, and inflammatory signals derived from various cell types including immune cells. In NASH-associated fibrosis, the principal cell type responsible for extracellular matrix production is the hepatic stellate cell (HSC). HSC activation by IR involves ""direct"" and ""indirect"" pathways.

Despite its high prevalence, optimal treatment to prevent complications of PTDM is unknown. Medical therapy of pre-existent DM or PTDM after transplant is challenging because of frequent interactions between antidiabetic and immunosuppressive agents. There is also frequent need for medication dose adjustments due to residual kidney disease and a higher risk of medication side effects in patients treated with immunosuppressive agents. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have demonstrated a favorable cardio-renal profile in patients with DM without a transplant and hence hold great promise in this patient population although there is concern about the higher risk of urinary tract infections.

For this cross-sectional study, we used medical routine data from an electronic medical record database. Data from 71 general practitioners and all their patients with diabetes were included. Starting in July 2018, we retrieved 12-month retrospective data about practice, general practitioner and patient characteristics, laboratory values, comorbidities and co-medication. Based on this data, we assessed quality indicator performance of process and intermediate outcomes for glycated hemoglobin, blood pressure, cholesterol and associations of practice, general practitioner and patient characteristics with individual and cumulative quality indicator performance. We calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using regression methods. We assessed 3,383 patients with diabetes (57% male, mean age 68.3 years). On average, patients fulfilled 3.56 (standard deviation: 1.89) quality indicators, whereas 17.2% of the patients fulfilled all six quality indicators.

31665258,Differential epigenetic factors in the prediction of cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients.,"Hyperglycaemia can strongly alter the epigenetic signatures in many types of human vascular cells providing persistent perturbations of protein-protein interactions both in micro- and macro-domains. The establishment of these epigenetic changes may precede cardiovascular (CV) complications and help us to predict vascular lesions in diabetic patients. Importantly, these epigenetic marks may be transmitted across several generations (transgenerational effect) and increase the individual risk of disease. Aberrant DNA methylation and imbalance of histone modifications, mainly acetylation and methylation of H3, represent key determinants of vascular lesions and, thus, putative useful biomarkers for prevention and diagnosis of CV risk in diabetics. Moreover, a differential expression of some micro-RNAs (miRNAs), mainly miR-126, may be a useful prognostic biomarker for atherosclerosis development in asymptomatic subjects. Recently, also environmental-induced chemical perturbations in mRNA (epitranscriptome), mainly the N6-methyladenosine, have been associated with obesity and diabetes. Importantly, reversal of epigenetic changes by modulation of lifestyle and use of metformin, statins, fenofibrate, and apabetalone may offer useful therapeutic options to prevent or delay CV events in diabetics increasing the opportunity for personalized therapy. Network medicine is a promising molecular-bioinformatic approach to identify the signalling pathways underlying the pathogenesis of CV lesions in diabetic patients. Moreover, machine learning tools combined with tomography are advancing the individualized assessment of CV risk in these patients. We remark the need for combining epigenetics and advanced bioinformatic platforms to improve the prediction of vascular lesions in diabetics increasing the opportunity for CV precision medicine.",European heart journal.

37863813,Copper and Diabetes: Current Research and Prospect.,"Copper is an essential trace metal for normal cellular functions; a lack of copper is reported to impair the function of important copper-binding enzymes, while excess copper could lead to cell death. Numerous studies have shown an association between dietary copper consumption or plasma copper levels and the incidence of diabetes/diabetes complications. And experimental studies have revealed multiple signaling pathways that are triggered by copper shortages or copper overload in diabetic conditions. Moreover, studies show that treated with copper chelators improve vascular function, maintain copper homeostasis, inhibit cuproptosis, and reduce cell toxicity, thereby alleviating diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, and cardiomyopathy. However, the mechanisms reported in these studies are inconsistent or even contradictory. This review summarizes the precise and tight regulation of copper homeostasis processes, and discusses the latest progress in the association of diabetes and dietary copper/plasma copper. Further, the study pays close attention to the therapeutic potential of copper chelators and copper in diabetes and its complications, and hopes to provide new insight for the treatment of diabetes.",Molecular nutrition & food research,2023-Dec,"Chang W, Li P",2,1230,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Baseline characteristics were comparable, albeit women in the PDM group arrived at medical attention significantly later, 55% after 15 weeks gestation. Women with PDM needed significantly less treatment to achieve glycemic control and glycated hemoglobin remained lower throughout pregnancy. Maternal and fetal outcomes were similar between groups, although significantly higher rates of macrosomia and neonatal jaundice were observed in the T2DM group. The lack of clear guidelines causes a delay in the first prenatal visit of women with PDM. Comparable pregnancy outcomes may tip the balance toward acceptance of early treatment. Establishing clear guidelines will enable primary caregivers to refer prediabetic women sooner for lifestyle modifications and treatment if needed.","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",2023-Dec,"Schiller T, Barak O, Winter Shafran Y, Barak Sacagiu M, Cohen L, Vaisbuch E, Zornitzki T, Kirzhner A",8,1347,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

A prospective study.,"Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is a reliable risk factor of cardiovascular diseases in diabetic patients, but information about this relationship in elderly patients is scarce. The aim of this study is to analyze, the relationship between HbA1c levels and the risk of mayor adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with diabetes over 70 years. Prospective study of subjects with diabetes using electronic health records from the universal public health system in the Valencian Community, Spain, 2008-2012. We included men and women aged≥70 years with diabetes who underwent routine health examinations in primary care. Primary endpoint was the incidence of MACE: all-cause mortality and/or hospital admission due to coronary heart disease or stroke. A standard Cox and Cox-Aalen models were adjusted. 5016 subjects were included whit a mean age of 75.1 years (46.7% men). During an average follow-up of 49 months (4.1 years), 807 (16.1%) MACE were recorded. The incidence of MACE was 20.6 per 1000-person-years. Variables significantly associated to the incidence of MACE were male gender (HR: 1.61), heart failure (HR: 2.26), antiplatelet therapy (HR: 1.39), oral antidiabetic treatment (HR: 0.74), antithrombotics (HR: 1.79), while age, creatinine, HbA1c and peripheral arterial disease were time-depend associated variables.

The aim of this paper is to create a state of the nation report of diabetes in the UK. Diabetes UK collates information about diabetes from diverse sources. This paper synthesizes these data to create a national report. Some 7% of the UK population are now living with diabetes; approximately one million people have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, 40 000 children have diabetes and more than 3000 children are diagnosed every year. Forty-nine per cent of people with type 1 diabetes were offered structured education, but only 7.6% attended; the corresponding figures for type 2 diabetes were 90% and 10.4%, respectively. Among people with diabetes, 28% reported having issues obtaining medication or equipment for self-management. Fifty-seven per cent of people with type 1 diabetes and 42% with type 2 diabetes do not receive all eight annual health checks. Around 40% of people with diabetes have diminished psychological well-being. One-third of people have a microvascular complication at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes is responsible for 530 myocardial infarctions and 175 amputations every week. The National Health Service spends at least £10 billion a year on diabetes, equivalent to 10% of its budget; 80% is spent treating complications. One in six hospital inpatients has diabetes.

31876542,Diabetic Kidney Disease: Past and Present.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) afflicting humans has been recognized as a disease for >3000 years. However, very little was known about its etiology and pathogenesis until about a century ago when increasing knowledge about anatomy and physiology of the human body gradually led to our understanding that the hormone insulin produced by the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas plays a crucial role in the metabolism of glucose and maintaining the blood sugar level within a normal range. DM is caused by inadequate insulin production (type 1) or insulin resistance (type 2). For thousands of years, DM has been considered as a disease of the kidney; however, with the understanding of the pathogenesis of DM, it became clear that diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a complication and not a cause of DM. DKD is associated with increased matrix expansion that manifests morphologically as a diffuse or nodular expansion of the mesangium and diffuse thickening of the glomerular and tubular basement membranes. Hyperglycemia plays a crucial role in the development of pathologic changes within the kidney. Once established, DKD usually undergoes a slow but relentless progression to end-stage renal disease. However, recent studies have shown that its progression can be slowed or even reversed by strict control of hyperglycemia. Morphologically, DKD may resemble several other glomerular diseases that must be ruled out before a definitive diagnosis. Patients with DM may also develop nondiabetic glomerular or interstitial diseases with or without DKD.

This retrospective study determined PTDM across organs by comparing incidence and risk factors among 346 liver and 407 kidney transplant recipients from a single center. Univariate and multivariate regression-based analyses were conducted to determine association of various risk factors and PTDM in the two cohorts, as well as differences in glucometrics and insulin use across time points. There was a higher incidence of PTDM among liver versus kidney transplant recipients (30% vs. 19%) at 1-year post-transplant. Liver transplant recipients demonstrated a 337% higher odds association to PTDM (OR 3.37, 95% CI (1.38-8.25), p<0.01). 1-month FBG was higher in kidney patients (135 mg/dL vs 104 mg/dL; p < .01), while 1-month insulin use was higher in liver patients (61% vs 27%, p < .01). Age, BMI, insulin use, and inpatient FBG were also significantly associated with differential PTDM risk. Kidney and liver transplant patients have different PTDM risk profiles, both in terms of absolute PTDM risk as well as time course of risk.

IGT is a prediabetic state characterized by elevated blood glucose levels that do not meet the criteria for diabetes. The review explores the potential benefits of pitavastatin in reducing cardiovascular risk and improving lipid profiles in individuals with IGT. It also examines the glycemic effects of pitavastatin, including its impact on fasting blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, and beta-cell function. The review highlights the need for individualized treatment approaches, taking into account the patient's overall cardiovascular risk profile and glycemic control needs. While pitavastatin has shown modest improvements in glycemic control, it is not a substitute for lifestyle modifications or standard antidiabetic medications. Future directions for research include long-term follow-up studies, mechanistic investigations, and comparative analyses to further understand the glycemic effects of pitavastatin in IGT. Overall, this narrative review provides valuable insights for healthcare professionals involved in the management of individuals with IGT, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive approach to reduce cardiovascular risk and optimize glycemic control.",Current problems in cardiology,2023-Nov,"Arsh H, Ali A, Khenhrani RR, Simran F, Dino U, Tamang S, Manoj F, Bai S, Bai M, Panjwani GR, Kumar D, Rani D, Partab F, Malik J",14,1323,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Moreover, the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus is very high in Africa and approximates to around 62%. Nearly 75% of the total deaths due to diabetes are in individuals lesser than 60 years of age. The multifaceted disease of diabetes mellitus produces chronic complications such as, neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, microangiopathy etc. These patients of diabetes mellitus are more susceptible to infections due to compromised immune system. Hence these patients of diabetes mellitus and undiagnosed diabetes mellitus are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 infections. The dual impact of pathophysiology of COVID-19 infections in diabetes mellitus may increase morbidity and mortality in these patients. Hence there is need of health awareness in diabetics as well in the high-risk group for diabetes such as persons with hypertension and obesity. The scarcity of health resources, shortage of trained medical personnel and disease burden of infectious and non-infectious diseases has laid a heavy impact on the economy in Africa and this has been further strained due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ability to predict future glucose values can further optimize such devices. In this study, we used machine learning to train models in predicting future glucose levels based on prior CGM and accelerometry data. We used data from The Maastricht Study, an observational population-based cohort that comprises individuals with normal glucose metabolism, prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes. We included individuals who underwent >48h of CGM (n = 851), most of whom (n = 540) simultaneously wore an accelerometer to assess physical activity. A random subset of individuals was used to train models in predicting glucose levels at 15- and 60-minute intervals based on either CGM data or both CGM and accelerometer data. In the remaining individuals, model performance was evaluated with root-mean-square error (RMSE), Spearman's correlation coefficient (rho) and surveillance error grid. For a proof-of-concept translation, CGM-based prediction models were optimized and validated with the use of data from individuals with type 1 diabetes (OhioT1DM Dataset, n = 6). Models trained with CGM data were able to accurately predict glucose values at 15 (RMSE: 0.19mmol/L; rho: 0.96) and 60 minutes (RMSE: 0.59mmol/L, rho: 0.72). Model performance was comparable in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Incorporation of accelerometer data only slightly improved prediction. The error grid results indicated that model predictions were clinically safe (15 min: >99%, 60 min >98%). Our prediction models translated well to individuals with type 1 diabetes, which is reflected by high accuracy (RMSEs for 15 and 60 minutes of 0.43 and 1.73 mmol/L, respectively) and clinical safety (15 min: >99%, 60 min: >91%).

38060094,The Emerging Role of Prediabetes and Its Management: Focus on L-Arginine and a Survey in Clinical Practice.,"The worldwide impressive growth of metabolic disorders observed in the last decades, especially type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, has generated great interest in the potential benefits of early identification and management of patients at risk. In this view, prediabetes represents a high-risk condition for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases, and an ideal target to intercept patients before they develop type 2 diabetes gaining a prominent role even in international guidelines. For prediabetic individuals, lifestyle modification is the cornerstone of diabetes prevention, with evidence of about 50% relative risk reduction. Accumulating data also show potential benefits from pharmacotherapy. In this context, the only available data pertain to metformin as a pharmaceutical drug and vitamin D and L-arginine as nutraceuticals. L-arginine appears to be a very interesting tool in the clinical management of patients with pre-diabetes. In this review we summarize the current knowledge on the role of L-arginine in prediabetes as a potentially useful preventive strategy against the progression to type 2 diabetes, with a particular focus on the underlying molecular mechanisms and the past and ongoing trials. In this article we also report the interesting data about the perception of the prediabetic condition and its therapeutic management in the clinical practice in Italy. An early identification and a prompt management of people with prediabetes appears to be of paramount importance to prevent the progression to diabetes and avoid its cardiovascular consequences.",High blood pressure & cardiovascular prevention : the official journal of the Italian Society of Hypertension,2023-Nov,"Volpe M, Ferrera A, Piccinocchi R, Morisco C",4,1617,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36305978,Screening for diabetes in the adult population above the age of 20 years among inhabitants of rural agricultural and rural desert areas of Egypt.,"The present study focused on identifying the current prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in rural desert and rural agricultural areas of Egypt and comparing these findings to those of previous studies that reported lower prevalence rates of DM in rural desert versus rural agricultural areas. The study included a total of 15,000 participants aged 20 years or older; 10,000 were from rural agricultural areas and 5000 were from rural desert areas in Egypt. The prevalence of DM and impaired fasting glucose for each group was recorded, participants were interviewed, medical history was obtained, physical examinations were performed, and fasting plasma glucose was used for diagnosis of DM and IFG using American Diabetes Association criteria. The prevalence of DM was 12.7% in agricultural areas and 4.7% in desert areas. The prevalence of newly diagnosed cases was 15.8% and 9.9% in agricultural and desert areas, respectively. The prevalence of IFG was 11.14% in agricultural and 8.04% in desert areas. These results suggest that living in a rural area makes patients at a higher risk of developing DM (OR = 2.968 CI (2.570-3.428) p < 0.001) and IFG (OR = 1.43, CI (1.272-1.616), p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that increased age, living in agricultural areas, higher body mass index and positive family history of diabetes were the significant predictors affecting the prevalence of DM. The prevalence of DM, IFG, and overall dysglycemia (DM + IFG) in Egypt has generally increased in rural areas, with a lower prevalence in rural desert compared to rural agricultural areas.",Acta diabetologica,2023-Feb,"Arab MM, Elsewy FZ, Badrah MH, Fathalla RM, Abdou MS, Kassab HS",6,1600,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37726607,Association between diabetic nephropathy and left ventricular longitudinal myocardial function in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients with preserved ejection fraction.,"Left ventricular (LV) longitudinal myocardial dysfunction can be observed even in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) (T2DM) patients with preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF), and is considered the earliest marker of DM-related cardiac dysfunction. Furthermore, diabetic nephropathy (DN), a common complication in DM, is strongly associated with LV longitudinal myocardial function in T2DM patients, but its association with type 1 DM (T1DM) has not been fully investigated. We studied 125 asymptomatic T1DM patients with preserved LVEF, and 75 age-, gender-, LVEF-matched non-diabetic healthy controls. Two-dimensional speckle-tracking strain LV was used to assess longitudinal myocardial function as global longitudinal strain (GLS). GLS of T1DM patients was significantly lower than that of normal controls (19.7 ± 3.6% vs. 20.6 ± 1.8%, P = 0.049). GLS of T1DM patients with DN was significantly lower that of T1DM patients without DN (17.3 ± 3.7% vs. 20.2 ± 3.5%, P < 0.001), but that of T1DM patients without DN was similar compared to normal controls (20.6 ± 1.8% vs. 20.2 ± 3.5%, P = 0.37). Moreover, multiple regression analysis identified DN the independent determinant parameters for GLS of T1DM patients also correlated significantly with duration of T1DM. Impaired LV longitudinal myocardial function was observed in asymptomatic T1DM patients with preserved LVEF, and DN was associated with LV longitudinal myocardial dysfunction. These findings are clinically useful for better management of T1DM patients to prevent impending development of cardiovascular disease.",The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,2022-Sep,"Ota E, Tanaka H, Mochizuki Y, Yamauchi Y, Shiraki H, Yamashita K, Shono A, Suzuki M, Sumimoto K, Yokoi A, Urai S, Hirota Y, Ogawa W, Hirata KI",14,1575,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Ordinary least squares regression analyses were used to examine the associations among education, annual household income, diabetes onset, and diabetes management (Hba1c). <b>Results:</b> Education, but not income, was inversely associated with Hba1c in undiagnosed participants. Income, but not education, was inversely associated with Hba1c among diagnosed participants. <b>Discussion:</b> These results support the idea that education and income provide non-fungible social and economic resources that vary in their consequences for Hba1c level depending on whether someone has been diagnosed with diabetes. The social resources provided by education may be more important in delaying the onset of disease, whereas resources provided by income may be more important for disease management.",Journal of aging and health,2020-Oct,"Allen K, McFarland M",2,1095,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35119212,Relationship between onset age of type 2 diabetes mellitus and vascular complications based on propensity score matching analysis.,"To assess the relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus onset age and vascular complications in China. A retrospective review of 3,568 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using a propensity score-matched (PSM) cohort analysis was carried out in two different age of onset groups (age 40 and 60 years). These groups were then subdivided into two groups, early-onset diabetes (EOD40 and EOD60; the onset age before 40 and 60 years, respectively) and late-onset diabetes (LOD40 and LOD60: the onset age after 40 and 60 years, respectively). Macrovascular and microvascular complications were analyzed before and after PSM. Patients categorized in both the early-onset disease (EOD) groups had a higher risk of developing macro- and microvascular complications before PSM. After PSM, no differences existed between the EOD and late-onset disease groups in the risk of macrovascular complications. Compared with the late-onset disease group, the odds ratio of having a microvascular complication of diabetic retinopathy, chronic kidney disease and diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the 40-year-old EOD group increased to 2.906, 1.967 and 1.672 (P < 0.05), respectively. The odds ratio of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the 60-year-old EOD group was 1.763 and 1.675 (P < 0.05), respectively. The earlier the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the higher risk of microvascular, but not necessarily macrovascular, complications. It is not too late to prevent diabetes at any age.

Data were obtained from five rounds of the World Health Organization STEPwise approach to Surveillance (STEPS) cross-sectional surveys. Participants were 7665 and 93,733 adults with and without known diabetes, respectively, aged 25-65 years. We used logistic and linear regressions to assess the trends of risk factors. Individuals with known diabetes compared to those without the condition, experienced greater reductions in mean levels of systolic blood pressure (3.0 vs. 0.5 mmHg among women and 3.9 vs. 1.6 mmHg among men), diastolic blood pressure (6.4 vs. 5.11 mmHg in women and 3.3 vs. 1.8 mmHg in men), and non-HDL cholesterol (42.4 vs. 27.2 mg/dL among women and 30.3 vs. 21.0 mg/dL among men) throughout these years. Men with diabetes also showed a greater reduction in the prevalence of daily cigarette smoking compared to their non-diabetic counterparts (7.3% vs. 2.3%). Fasting plasma glucose decreased among subjects with diabetes but increased among those without diabetes. Significant increases were observed in proportions who met goals for blood pressure, triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in both groups; however, almost half of diabetic subjects did not achieve risk factor goals in 2016. Secondary prevention in diabetic patients was more effective than primary prevention in the general population; however, the rate of diabetic patients who met the designated goals for each risk factor was still suboptimal.",Scientific reports,2020-Jul,"Malekzadeh H, Lotfaliany M, Ostovar A, Hadaegh F, Azizi F, Yoosefi M, Farzadfar F, Khalili D",8,1616,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

31596548,Emerging trends and the clinical impact of food insecurity in patients with diabetes.,"Food insecurity is a major public health concern in the United States affecting 15 million households according to data in 2017 from the US Department of Agriculture. Food insecurity, or the inability to consistently obtain nutritious food, disproportionately affects socioeconomically disadvantaged households, as well as those with chronic diseases including diabetes mellitus (DM). This review article explores the literature over the past 10 years pertaining to the complex relationship between food insecurity, social determinants of health, and chronic disease with an emphasis on diabetes and glycemic control. Those with diabetes and food insecurity together have been shown to have worse glycemic control compared to those who are food secure, but it remains unclear exactly how food insecurity affects glycemic control. Prior interventional studies have targeted aspects of food insecurity in patients with diabetes but have reported variable outcomes with respect to improvement in glycemic control despite effectively reducing rates of food insecurity. Additionally, few data exist regarding long-term outcomes and diabetes-related complications in this population. It is likely that many factors at both the community and individual levels impact glycemic control outcomes in the setting of food insecurity. Further studies are needed to better understand these factors and to create multifaceted targets for future interventional studies aimed at improving glycemic control in this population.",Journal of diabetes,2020-Mar,"Flint KL, Davis GM, Umpierrez GE",3,1507,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32359350,Prognostic importance of visit-to-visit blood pressure variability for micro- and macrovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes: The Rio de Janeiro Type 2 Diabetes Cohort Study.,"The prognostic importance of an increased visit-to-visit blood pressure variability (BP-VVV) for the future development of micro- and macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes has been scarcely investigated and is largely unsettled. We aimed to evaluate it in a prospective long-term follow-up study with 632 individuals with type 2 diabetes. BP-VVV parameters (systolic and diastolic standard deviations [SD] and variation coefficients) were measured during the first 24-months. Multivariate Cox analysis, adjusted for risk factors and mean BP levels, examined the associations between BP-VVV and the occurrence of microvascular (retinopathy, microalbuminuria, renal function deterioration, peripheral neuropathy) and macrovascular complications (total cardiovascular events [CVEs], major adverse CVEs [MACE] and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality). Improvement in risk discrimination was assessed by the C-statistic and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) index. Over a median follow-up of 11.3 years, 162 patients had a CVE (132 MACE), and 212 patients died (95 from cardiovascular diseases); 153 newly-developed or worsened diabetic retinopathy, 193 achieved the renal composite outcome (121 newly-developed microalbuminuria and 95 deteriorated renal function), and 171 newly-developed or worsened peripheral neuropathy. Systolic BP-VVV was an independent predictor of MACE (hazard ratio: 1.25, 95% CI 1.03-1.51 for a 1-SD increase in 24-month SD), but not of total CVEs, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and of any microvascular outcome. However, no BP-VVV parameter significantly improved cardiovascular risk discrimination (increase in C-statistic 0.001, relative IDI 0.9%). Systolic BP-VVV was an independent predictor of MACE, but it did not improve cardiovascular risk stratification. The goal of anti-hypertensive treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes shall remain in controlling mean BP levels, not on decreasing their visit-to-visit variability.",Cardiovascular diabetology,2020-May,"Cardoso CRL, Leite NC, Salles GF",3,1987,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Various pharmaceutical interventions and animal models have been used to investigate the genetic, environmental, and etiological aspects of diabetes and its effects. In recent years for the development of ant-diabetic remedies, numerous novel genetically modified animals, pharmaceutical substances, medical techniques, viruses, and hormones have been developed to screen diabetic complications.

The family physician program (FPP) proposed by WHO is a health strategy to provide primary health care and improve the community's awareness of non-communicable diseases. Since there was no clear focus on the causal effect of FPP on the prevalence, screening, and awareness of HTN and DM, the primary objective of this study is to determine the causal effect of FPP on these factors in Iran, which is an EMR country. We conducted a repeated cross-sectional design based on two independent surveys of 42,776 adult participants in 2011 and 2016, of which 2301 individuals were selected from two regions where the family physician program was implemented (FPP) and where it wasn't (non-FPP). We used an Inverse Probability Weighting difference-in-differences and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation analysis to estimate the average treatment effects on treated (ATT) using R version 4.1.1. The FPP implementation increased the screening (ATT = 36%, 95% CI: (27%, 45%), P-value < 0.001) and the control of hypertension (ATT = 26%, 95% CI: (1%, 52%), P-value = 0.03) based on 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines that these results were in keeping with JNC7. There was no causal effect in other indexes, such as prevalence, awareness, and treatment. The DM screening (ATT = 20%, 95% CI: (6%, 34%), P-value = 0.004) and awareness (ATT = 14%, 95% CI: (1%, 27%), P-value = 0.042) were significantly increased among FPP administered region. However, the treatment of HTN decreased (ATT = -32%, 95% CI: (-59%, -5%), P-value = 0.012). This study has identified some limitations related to the FPP in managing HTN and DM, and presented solutions to solve them in two general categories.

MODY is frequently misdiagnosed as type 1 diabetes (T1). Though several studies from India have reported on the genetic aspects of MODY, the clinical profile, complications and treatments given have not been reported so far, nor compared with T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D). To determine the prevalence, clinical features, and complications of common forms of genetically proven MODY seen at a tertiary diabetes centre in South India and compare them with matched individuals with T1D and T2D. Five hundred and thirty individuals identified as 'possible MODY' based on clinical criteria, underwent genetic testing for MODY. Diagnosis of MODY was confirmed based on pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants found using Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) and American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) criteria. The clinical profile of MODY was compared with individuals with type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes, matched for duration of diabetes. Retinopathy was diagnosed by retinal photography; nephropathy by urinary albumin excretion > 30 µg/mg of creatinine and neuropathy by vibration perception threshold > 20 v on biothesiometry. Fifty-eight patients were confirmed to have MODY (10.9%). HNF1A-MODY (n = 25) was the most common subtype followed by HNF4A-MODY (n = 11), ABCC8-MODY (n = 11), GCK-MODY (n = 6) and HNF1B-MODY (n = 5). For comparison of clinical profile, only the three 'actionable' subtypes - defined as those who may respond to sulphonylureas, namely, HNF1A, HNF4A and ABCC8-MODY, were included. Age at onset of diabetes was lower among HNF4A-MODY and HNF1A-MODY than ABCC8-MODY, T1D and T2D. Prevalence of retinopathy and nephropathy was higher among the three MODY subtypes taken together (n = 47) as compared to T1D (n = 86) and T2D (n = 86).

We searched for randomized controlled trials with at least 24 months of lifestyle interventions in prediabetes or T2D populations. Data were extracted by pairs of reviewers and discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Descriptive syntheses were performed, and the risk of bias was assessed. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs were estimated using a pairwise meta-analysis with both a random-effects model and a general linear mixed model (GLMM). Certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework, and trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted to assess if current information is enough for definitive conclusions. Subgroup analysis was performed by glycemic status. Six clinical trials were included. Among 12 841 participants, the combined RR for cancer mortality comparing lifestyle interventions with usual care was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.81-1.10 using GLMM and 0.82-1.09 using random-effects model). Most studies had a low risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence was moderate. TSA showed that the cumulative Z curve reached futility boundary while total number did not reach detection boundary.

32654398,"Role of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine in the homeostasis of metabolic organs, and its potential links with diabetes and its complications.","Recent studies using genetically manipulated mouse models have shown the pivotal role of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine modification (O-GlcNAcylation) in the metabolism of multiple organs. The molecular mechanism involves the sensing of glucose flux by the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, which leads to the adjustment of cellular metabolism to protect against changes in the environment of each organ through O-GlcNAcylation. More recently, not only glucose, but also fluxes of amino acids and fatty acids have been reported to induce O-GlcNAcylation, affecting multiple cellular processes. In this review, we discuss how O-GlcNAcylation maintains homeostasis in organs that are affected by diabetes mellitus: skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver and pancreatic β-cells. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of O-GlcNAcylation in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms whereby cellular homeostasis is maintained, despite changes in metabolic flux, these studies might provide new targets for the treatment and prevention of diabetes and its complications.",Journal of diabetes investigation,2021-Feb,"Morino K, Maegawa H",2,1104,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38928130,Targeting Protein Kinases to Protect Beta-Cell Function and Survival in Diabetes.,"The prevalence of diabetes is increasing worldwide. Massive death of pancreatic beta-cells causes type 1 diabetes. Progressive loss of beta-cell function and mass characterizes type 2 diabetes. To date, none of the available antidiabetic drugs promotes the maintenance of a functional mass of endogenous beta-cells, revealing an unmet medical need. Dysfunction and apoptotic death of beta-cells occur, in particular, through the activation of intracellular protein kinases. In recent years, protein kinases have become highly studied targets of the pharmaceutical industry for drug development. A number of drugs that inhibit protein kinases have been approved for the treatment of cancers. The question of whether safe drugs that inhibit protein kinase activity can be developed and used to protect the function and survival of beta-cells in diabetes is still unresolved. This review presents arguments suggesting that several protein kinases in beta-cells may represent targets of interest for the development of drugs to treat diabetes.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024-Jun,Dalle S,1,1039,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Self-management training and education of diabetes are critical in diabetes care and management. It is essential that patients with diabetes must have a comprehensive understanding of the nature of the disease, risk factors, complications, and possible treatment modalities to attenuate the complications. Over the last few years, DM in Saudi Arabia has been rapidly growing at an alarming rate. It has affected around one-fifth of the adult population, and by 2030, the numbers are predicted to rise further and exceed more than double the present number. An estimated tenfold increase has been reported over the past three decades in Saudi Arabia. However, there has not been much research focusing on understanding the knowledge and awareness of DM in Saudi Arabia as compared to developed nations. This review aims to present an overview of the current knowledge and awareness level of DM among the population of Saudi Arabia through an extensive review of the currently available literature. The review findings could be of immense assistance to the government, healthcare systems, educational institutions, and researchers to develop evidence-based programs, policies, and guidelines towards increasing the knowledge and awareness about diabetes and its management, so that early detection and management can be ensured to control the escalating burden of diabetes in Saudi Arabia.",Current diabetes reviews,2021-,"Robert AA, Al Awad AD, Al Dawish MA",3,1561,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

31676569,CTRP13 Preserves Endothelial Function by Targeting GTP Cyclohydrolase 1 in Diabetes.,"Endothelial dysfunction plays a crucial role in the progress of diabetic vasculopathy. C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein 13 (CTRP13) is a secreted adipokine that can ameliorate atherosclerosis and vascular calcification. However, the role of CTRP13 in regulating endothelial function in diabetes has yet to be explored. In this study, CTRP13 treatment improved endothelium-dependent relaxation in the aortae and mesenteric arteries of both <i>db/db</i> mice and streptozotocin-injected mice. CTRP13 supplement also rescued the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation ex vivo in the <i>db/db</i> mouse aortae and in high glucose (HG)-treated mouse aortae. Additionally, CTRP13 treatment reduced reactive oxygen species overproduction and improved nitric oxide (NO) production and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) coupling in the aortae of diabetic mice and in HG-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Mechanistically, CTRP13 could increase GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) expression and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) levels to ameliorate eNOS coupling. More importantly, CTRP13 rescued HG-induced inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) activity. Increased PKA activity enhanced phosphorylation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and its recruitment to the GCH1 promoter, thus activating GCH1 transcription and, ultimately, endothelial relaxation. Together, these results suggest that CTRP13 preserves endothelial function in diabetic mice by regulating GCH1/BH4 axis-dependent eNOS coupling, suggesting the therapeutic potential of CTRP13 against diabetic vasculopathy.",Diabetes,2020-Jan,"Wang C, Chao Y, Xu W, Liang M, Deng S, Zhang D, Huang K",7,1593,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

37436529,A cohort follow-up study for diabetic retinopathy screening incidence in the North Denmark Region.,"To evaluate diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening incidence in a universal healthcare system. Registry-based cohort study based on a Danish regional population from 2009 to 2018. Individuals with diabetes were identified by medication. Screening attendance was estimated by surrogate measures using local and nationwide databases reported by cumulative incidence. 18,832 patients were included. By the end of the first year, the cumulative incidence of screening for DR was 60.2% and by the end of the second year 74.2%. The cumulative incidence was 93.9% overall, 97.7% for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and 93.4% for patients with type 2 diabetes. Screening proportions per 1, 2 and 5 years were calculated. Females, patients with T1D, and patients attending screening at hospitals had a higher Hazard Ratio of 1.084, 1.157, and 1.573, respectively. The Cochran-Armitage trend test indicated increased screening frequency from 2009 to 2018. Validation of DR screening was done at hospitals with a mean positive predictive value of 86.78%. Cumulative incidence curves showed a small right shift when censoring the first, second and third screening visits. Nearly all patients were screened for DR over a 5-year timespan. Female patients with T1D who attended screening at hospitals were significantly more likely to be screened.

This observational study included all episodes of DKA from April 2014 to September 2020 in a UK tertiary care hospital. Data were collected on diabetes type, demographics, biochemical and clinical features at presentation, and DKA management. From 786 consecutive DKA, 583 (75.9%) type 1 diabetes and 185 (24.1%) type 2 diabetes episodes were included in the final analysis. Those with type 2 diabetes were older and had more ethnic minority representation than those with type 1 diabetes. Intercurrent illness (39.8%) and suboptimal compliance (26.8%) were the two most common precipitating causes of DKA in both cohorts. Severity of DKA as assessed by pH, glucose and lactate at presentation was similar in both groups. Total insulin requirements and total DKA duration were the same (type 1 diabetes 13.9 units (9.1-21.9); type 2 diabetes 13.9 units (7.7-21.1); p=0.4638). However, people with type 2 diabetes had significantly longer hospital stay (type 1 diabetes: 3.0 days (1.7-6.1); type 2 diabetes: 11.0 days (5.0-23.1); p<0.0001). In this population, a quarter of DKA episodes occurred in people with type 2 diabetes. DKA in type 2 diabetes presents at an older age and with greater representation from ethnic minorities. However, severity of presentation and DKA duration are similar in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, suggesting that the same clinical management protocol is equally effective.

35435085,The Risk for Developing Vision Threatening Diabetic Retinopathy is Influenced by Heredity to Diabetes.,"<b>Purpose:</b> Clustering of vision threatening diabetic retinopathy within specific families can be the result of similarities in life style but may also be due to a common genetic background. An evaluation of the role of heredity for the development of diabetic retinopathy may help adjusting control intervals in screening program to each patient's individual risk profile.<b>Methods:</b> Survival analysis was used to study whether family history of diabetes among men and women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes together with the degree of heredity could be added as risk factors to improve the prediction of the risk for developing proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and diabetic macular edema (DME). The study was conducted on data from 12,281 patients followed in the Aarhus area, Denmark, from 1 January 2003 to 1 July 2019.<b>Results:</b> The risk for developing PDR was significantly reduced 2-11 years after known onset of diabetes in the presence of female family members with type 1 diabetes, and the risk for developing DME significantly increased 4-24 years after onset of diabetes in the presence of family members with type 2 diabetes of any sex. These hereditary factors were independent of other studied risk factors such as previous cataract surgery, age of onset of diabetes, metabolic regulation and blood pressure.<b>Conclusions:</b> The presence of family members with diabetes affects the risk for developing vision threatening diabetic retinopathy and affects the risk for developing PDR and DME differently. This evidence may help individualizing the control intervals in screening programmes for diabetic retinopathy.",Current eye research,2022-Sep,Bek T,1,1650,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Existing interventions were identified from a systematic review and our own gray literature search. We then characterized interventions using the Behavior Change Wheel, a framework to inform and drive behavior change, and matched interventions to behavioral targets, audiences, and identified barriers and facilitators. Feedback from the CPEG DKA prevention working group was incorporated into the intervention plan. We identified 27 interventions. Our proposed target behaviors are: (1) prompt recognition of symptoms of diabetes in children; (2) urgent attendance to medical care with a request for an office-based test for diabetes; and (3) rapid confirmation of diagnosis and urgent consultation with pediatric diabetes experts. We initially identified four possible intervention functions including education, training, environment restructuring, and enablement. Feedback from the working group favored education intervention functions including symptom recognition messages targeting parents, caregivers, teachers, and providers and messages about how to make a rapid diagnosis and need for urgent referral targeting providers.

Macrophages are crucial effector cells that play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of diabetic wounds, through their polarization into distinct functional phenotypes. The field of epigenetics has emerged as a rapidly advancing research area, as this phenomenon has the potential to markedly affect gene expression, cellular differentiation, tissue development and susceptibility to disease. Understanding epigenetic mechanisms is crucial to further exploring disease pathogenesis. A growing body of scientific evidence has highlighted the pivotal role of epigenetics in the regulation of macrophage phenotypes. Various epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modification and non‑coding RNAs, are involved in the modulation of macrophage phenotype differentiation in response to the various environmental stimuli present in diabetic wounds. The present review provided an overview of the various changes that take place in macrophage phenotypes and functions within diabetic wounds and discussed the emerging role of epigenetic modifications in terms of regulating macrophage plasticity in diabetic wounds.

We conducted surveys of 1) US CF center directors and 2) Endocrinologists affiliated with the CFF-sponsored EnVision program to characterize CFRD screening practices, describe provider perceived barriers to screening, and identify strategies for improving screening. The surveys queried OGTT protocols, alternate screening strategies, and perceived barriers to screening. CF center characteristics and procedures for coordinating OGTTs were compared between centers achieving ≥50% versus <50% OGTT completion. Endocrinologists received additional questions regarding OGTT interpretation and management. The survey response rate was 18% (51/290) from CF Centers and 63% (25/40) from Endocrinologists. The majority (57%) of CF centers utilized 2 OGTT timepoints (0,120 min). The majority (72%) of Endocrinologists utilized 3 timepoints (0,60,120 min). Four percent of CF centers and 8% of Endocrinologists utilized other timepoints. Forty-nine percent of CF centers reported ≥50% OGTT completion in the past year. Completion of ≥50% OGTT was 5 times more likely when patient reminders were consistently provided (p = 0.017). Both CF Centers and Endocrinologists employed alternative screening strategies including HbA1c (64%, 92%), fasting plasma glucose (49%, 67%), continuous glucose monitoring (30%, 58%), and home fingerstick monitoring (55%, 50%).

The DM prevalence increased with elevated aldosterone levels [OR = 3.20 (1.77, 5.78), P value < 0.001]. The rate of CCVD in newly diagnosed diabetic PA patients was higher than that in nondiabetic PA patients at diagnosis (11.9% vs. 5.0%, P = 0.005). Furthermore, multivariate logistic analysis revealed that HT duration [1.055 (1.002,1.111), P = 0.041] and newly diagnosed DM [2.600 (1.072,6.303), P = 0.034] were significantly associated with CCVD in PA patients. The prevalence of newly diagnosed DM in PA patients was higher than that in the general population. Aldosterone level was an independent risk factor for DM not for CCVD. CCVD was correlated with longer HT duration and newly diagnosed DM. Therefore, it is crucial to screen DM at the diagnosis in PA patients.",Endocrine,2022-Sep,"Zhang C, Jiang Y, Su T, Jiang L, Zhou W, Zhong X, Wu L, Wang W",8,1204,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36286346,Prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can remain undiagnosed for many years, during which micro- and macro-vascular complications may develop. This study aimed to assess the worldwide prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. We systematically searched electronic databases for relevant studies published from inception to 01 January 2022. Selected studies reported the prevalence of DR among patients with newly diagnosed T2DM, specifying the case definition used. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to derive the pooled prevalence. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were used to investigate variations in the prevalence estimates in terms of available variables. Data from 77 studies including 99,847 patients with newly diagnosed T2DM were included from 26 countries. The pooled prevalence of DR among patients with newly diagnosed T2DM was 13.1% (95% CI, 11.1%-15.1%; I<sup>2</sup>  = 97.0%). DR was higher in clinic-based samples compared with community-based samples (15.0%, 95% CI = 12.4%-17.8% vs. 11.5%, 95% CI = 8.9%-14.5%; p = 0.05; I<sup>2</sup>  = 97.0%) and was higher in countries in the WHO African 19.2% (95% CI, 14.6%-24.3%; I<sup>2</sup>  = 76.0%), South-East Asia 15.4% (95% CI, 10.0%-21.6%; I<sup>2</sup>  = 79.1%), and European 15.0% (95% CI, 11.2%-19.2%; I<sup>2</sup>  = 82.0%) regions. A higher proportion of female patients was significantly associated with a lower prevalence of DR in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. We observed that the prevalence of DR in patients with newly diagnosed T2DM has remained unchanged over time. Globally, DR is a prevalent complication among patients with newly diagnosed T2DM indicating the importance of establishing effective strategies to promote regular screening for the early diagnosis of T2DM alongside routine ophthalmic assessment at the time of T2DM diagnosis to reduce the burden of vision-threatening retinopathy.",Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews,2023-Jan,"Cai K, Liu YP, Wang D",3,1927,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35972261,Effect of State-Led Delivery System and Payment Reforms on Population-Level Detection and Management of Diabetes.,"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services State Innovation Models (SIM) initiative has invested more than $1 billion to test state-led delivery system and payment reforms that can affect diabetes care management. We examined whether SIM implementation between 2013 and 2017 was associated with diagnosed diabetes prevalence or with hospitalization or 30-day readmission rate among diagnosed adults. The quasiexperimental design compared study outcomes before and after the SIM initiative in 12 SIM states versus five comparison states using difference-in-differences (DiD) regression models of 21,055,714 hospitalizations for adults age ≥18 years diagnosed with diabetes in 889 counties from 2010 to 2017 across the 17 states. For readmission analyses, comparative interrupted time series (CITS) models included 11,812,993 hospitalizations from a subset of nine states. Diagnosed diabetes prevalence changes were not significantly different between SIM states and comparison states. Hospitalization rates were inconsistent across models, with DiD estimates ranging from -5.34 to -0.37 and from -13.16 to 0.92, respectively. CITS results indicate that SIM states had greater increases in odds of 30-day readmission during SIM implementation compared with comparison states (round 1: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.07; 95% CI 1.04, 1.11; P < 0.001; round 2: AOR 1.06; 95% CI 1.03, 1.10; P = 0.001). The SIM initiative was not sufficiently focused to have a population-level effect on diabetes detection or management. SIM states had greater increases in 30-day readmission for adults with diabetes than comparison states, highlighting potential unintended effects of engaging in the multipayer alignment efforts required of state-led delivery system and payment reforms.",Diabetes care,2022-Oct,"Rodriguez HP, Fulton BD, Phillips AZ, Rubio K",4,1770,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33967016,A 5-year assessment of the epidemiology and natural history of possible diabetes in remission.,"Type 2 diabetes is considered a chronic and progressive disease. The term diabetes in remission has no consensus definition and the question whether diabetes ""remission"" or ""cure"" can achieve any long-term benefits in people with type 2 diabetes remains unclear. The aim of our study was a review of our district wide diabetes population to determine the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of those who had a diagnosis of diabetes but did not meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes at the point of assessment in 2014 and then to review their diabetes outcomes over a 5-year time frame. In a whole population based non-interventional epidemiological study amongst 17,308 people with diabetes, we identified 991 with diet treated type 2 diabetes who met the baseline criteria for diabetes in remission (HbA1c < 48 mmol/mol (6.5%)). Over the next 5 years, 385 (39%) people had a cumulative HbA1c attainment of <48 mmol/mol (6.5%) and remained free of diabetes medication. In this erstwhile remission group only 130 (13%) were free of any vasculopathy, whilst 255 (26%) had some form of micro or macrovascular disease, of which 64 people had been without micro or macrovascular vascular complications at baseline. Only 20 people had a HbA1c consistently ≤37 mmol/mol (5.7%) who were free of diabetes vascular complications and of diabetes medication. The definition of 'diabetes in remission' remains unclear most especially regarding the inclusion of baseline prevalent or incident macro or microvascular disease, the durability of potential remission is poor, and the likelihood of cure is remote.",Primary care diabetes,2021-Aug,"Gillani SMR, Raghavan R, Singh BM",3,1605,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32156282,Health-related quality of life and associated factors among patients with diabetes mellitus at the University of Gondar referral hospital.,"Diabetes mellitus, which has a wide range of effects on the physical, social and psychological aspects of the well-being of a person, is a common and challenging chronic disease that causes a significant rate of morbidity and mortality. However, studies in our country, by and large, focused on the impact of the disease in terms of mortality and morbidity alone. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and associated factors of diabetic patients at the University of Gondar referral hospital, Ethiopia. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted at the University of Gondar referral hospital from April to May 2017. A generic World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to measure the HRQOL. The data were analyzed by Stata version 12. Multiple Linear Regression analysis with P-value 0.05 was used to measure the degree of association between HRQOL and independent variables. A total of 408 patients with Diabetes Mellitus were included in the study. The HRQOL scores for physical, psychological, social and environmental domains were 50.9, 54.5, 55.8 and 47.3, respectively. Diabetes-related complications had a significant association with all except the psychological domain. Higher HRQOL was associated with exercising, following the recommended diet, foot care, sensible drinking and the absence of co-morbidities. However, old age, unemployment and being single and widower had a significant association with lower HRQOL. The environmental and physical domains of HRQOL scores were the lowest compared to the social and psychological domains. Old age and living in rural area had a significant association with a lower HRQOL, whereas the absence of diabetes-related complications, exercising, general diet and foot care had a significant association with better HRQOL of patients. Therefore, strong advice on the recommended lifestyle is important, and old patients and rural dwellers should get due attention. In addition, the prevention of diabetes-related complications is important to improve the patient HRQOL which is an important outcome measurement from the patient's perspective related to the impact of the disease. Therefore, including HRQOL assessment as part of routine management is necessary.",Health and quality of life outcomes,2020-Mar,"Aschalew AY, Yitayal M, Minyihun A",3,2317,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38718275,Impact of Gender on Chronic Complications in Participants With Type 2 Diabetes: Evidence From a Cross-Sectional Study.,"This study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence of diabetes complications between men and women with Type 2 diabetes (T2D), as well as how gender relates to these complications. In this cross-sectional study, complications of diabetes, including coronary artery disease (CAD), retinopathy, neuropathy and diabetic kidney disease (DKD), were evaluated in 1867 participants with T2D. Additionally, baseline characteristics of the individuals, including anthropometric measurements, metabolic parameters and the use of dyslipidaemia drugs and antihyperglycaemic agents, were assessed. Gender differences in complications were examined using the chi-squared test. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to investigate the relationship between gender and T2D complications, with and without adjusting for the characteristics of the studied population. In the studied population, 62.1% had at least one complication, and complications were 33.5% for DKD, 29.6% for CAD, 22.9% for neuropathy and 19.1% for retinopathy. The prevalence of CAD and neuropathy was higher in men. However, DKD and retinopathy were more prevalent among women. Odds ratios of experiencing any complication, CAD and retinopathy in men compared with women were 1.57 (95% CI: 1.27-2.03), 2.27 (95% CI: 1.72-2.99) and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.52-0.98), respectively, after adjusting for demographic factors, anthropometric measures, metabolic parameters and the consumption of dyslipidaemia drugs and antihyperglycaemic agents. The prevalence of diabetes complications was significantly higher in men with diabetes, highlighting the need for better treatment adherence. CAD was associated with the male gender, whereas retinopathy was associated with the female gender. Men and women with diabetes should be monitored closely for CAD and retinopathy, respectively, regardless of their age, diabetes duration, anthropometric measures, laboratory findings and medications.","Endocrinology, diabetes & metabolism",2024-May,"Mokhtarpour K, Yadegar A, Mohammadi F, Aghayan SN, Seyedi SA, Rabizadeh S, Esteghamati A, Nakhjavani M",8,1939,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We constructed a new diabetes index using logistic regression (LR) and calculated the probability of diabetes in the validation sets. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and Cox regression analysis to measure the performance of the internal and external validation sets, respectively. We constructed a gender-specific diabetes prediction model, having a resultant AUROC of 0.93 and 0.94 for men and women, respectively. Based on this probability, we classified participants into five groups and analyzed cumulative incidence from the KoGES dataset. Group 5 demonstrated significantly worse outcomes than those in other groups. Our novel model for predicting diabetes, based on two large-scale population-based cohort studies, showed high sensitivity and selectivity.

Spotlight AQ, a novel ""smart"" adaptive patient questionnaire, is designed to improve consultations by rapidly identifying patient priorities and presenting these in the context of best-practice care pathways to aid consultations. We aimed to determine Spotlight AQ's feasibility in routine care. The Spotlight prototype tool was trialed at three centers: two UK primary care centers and one US specialist center (June-September 2020). Participants with type 1 (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) completed the questionnaire prior to their routine consultations. Results were immediately available and formed the basis of the clinical discussion and decision-making within the clinic visit. A convenience sample of 49 adults took part, <i>n</i>=31 T1D, (<i>n</i>=18 female); and <i>n</i>=18 T2D (<i>n</i>=10 male, <i>n</i>=4 female, <i>n</i>=4 gender unreported). Each identified two priority concerns. ""Psychological burden of diabetes"" was the most common priority concern (T1D <i>n =</i> 27, 87.1%) followed by ""gaining more skills about particular aspects of diabetes"" (T1D <i>n</i>=19, 61.3%), ""improving support around me"" (<i>n</i>=8, 25.8%) and ""diabetes-related treatment issues"" (<i>n</i>=8, 25.8%). Burden of diabetes was widespread as was lack of confidence around self-management. Similarly, psychological burden of diabetes was the primary concern for participants with T2D (<i>n</i>=18,100%) followed by ""gaining more skills about aspects of diabetes"" (<i>n</i>=7, 38.9%), ""improving support around me"" (<i>n</i>=7, 38.9%) and ""diabetes-related treatment issues"" (<i>n</i>=4; 22.2%).

Despite the Indonesian Government's ongoing effort to impose regulation for collaborative TB-DM management, the involvement of private primary care providers (PPCs) has not been considered before the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to capture the PPCs' existing practices and explore their challenges, opportunities, and potential roles in the collaborative TB-DM services and control. A descriptive qualitative research design was used to collect data. Two Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 13 healthcare workers (HCWs) from different private clinics and eight private/solo general practitioners (GPs) from Yogyakarta City, Indonesia. We triangulated these data with data from FGDs of HCWs community health centers (CHCs) and in-depth interviews of three regional health regulators, five hospitals staff members, and a representative of national health insurance. The discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and subjected to thematic analysis. PPCs have not been initiated into the implementation of the collaborative TB-DM programme. The themes identified in this study were health system-related barriers, knowledge and perception of HCWs, lack of implementation of bi-directional screening, and needs of multisector role. The potential roles identified for PPCs include involvement in health promotion, bi-directional screening, patient referral, and data reporting according to the TB-DM programme indicators. However, more thorough improvement of PPCs' capacity and logistic supplies are needed to provide comprehensive TB treatment. Although PPCs' involvement in implementing collaborative TB-DM services has yet to be considered, their potential role should not be neglected. Therefore, it is essential to increase their involvement by enhancing their capacity and improving the Public-Private Mix.

One set comprised 62 easily accessible examination results of commonly used variables from a tertiary university hospital. The second set comprised 27 of the 62 variables included in the national routine health checkups. Gradient boosting and random forest algorithms were used to develop the models. Internal validation was performed using the stratified 10-fold cross-validation method. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) for the 62-variable DM model making 12-month predictions for subjects without diabetes was the largest (0.928) among those of the eight DM prediction models. The ROC-AUC dropped by more than 0.04 when training with the simplified 27-variable set but still showed fairly good performance with ROC-AUCs between 0.842 and 0.880. The accuracy was up to 11.5% higher (from 0.807 to 0.714) when fasting glucose was included.

35936377,Analysis and Recognition of Clinical Features of Diabetes Based on Convolutional Neural Network.,"Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic noncommunicable disease, the main manifestation of which is the long-term high blood sugar level in patients due to metabolic disorders. However, due to excessive reliance on the clinical experience of ophthalmologists, our diagnosis takes a long time, and it is prone to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. In recent years, with the development of deep learning, its application in the auxiliary diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy has become possible. How to use the powerful feature extraction ability of deep learning algorithm to realize the mining of massive medical data is of great significance. Therefore, under the action of computer-aided technology, this paper processes and analyzes the retinal images of the fundus through traditional image processing and convolutional neural network-related methods, so as to achieve the role of assisting clinical treatment. Based on the admission records of diabetic patients after data analysis and feature processing, this paper uses an improved convolutional neural network algorithm to establish a model for predicting changes in diabetic conditions. The model can assist doctors to judge the patient's treatment effect by using it based on the case records of inpatient diagnosis and treatment and to predict the risk of readmission of inpatients after discharge. It also can help to judge the effectiveness of the treatment plan. The results of the study show that the model proposed in this paper has a lower probability of misjudging patients with poor recovery as good recovery, and the prediction is more accurate.",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2022-,"Wang R, Li P, Yang Z",3,1610,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

32815212,Visits at the primary clinic do not reduce ketoacidosis rates at presentation in type 1 diabetes mellitus.,"The rate of diabetic ketoacidosis at time of diagnosis of type 1 diabetes remains high. We examined whether visits to a primary care clinic up to a month prior to diagnosis of new onset diabetes affected ketoacidosis rates. Retrospective chart review of children who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2014. Data collection included demographics, age at diagnosis, number of visits to the primary care clinic during the month prior the diagnosis, relevance to diabetes and outcome of those visits and the presence of ketoacidosis at diagnosis. We examined the relationship between the rate of ketoacidosis at diagnosis and the number of visits in the clinic, and to the demographic characteristics. Of 159 patients, 115 visited their clinic in the month prior to diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. The rate of ketoacidosis at diagnosis was similar between those who visited the clinic and those who did not (37.4% compared to 38.6%). There was no difference in ketoacidosis rates between the different ethnic and socio-economic groups. Medical encounters in the month prior to diagnosis of type 1 diabetes did not reduce ketoacidosis rates in children.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",2021-Mar,"Yona A, Haim A, Friger M, Chechik TG, Loewenthal N, Hershkovitz E",6,1186,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Having a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a potent risk factor for the later development of T2DM. To explore the characteristics of women diagnosed with GDM in a single centre and their follow up for progression to T2DM. A retrospective cohort study using anonymised data of one hundred and fifty four (154) women with GDM receiving maternity care at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (OUHFT) in 2010 and their follow up until 2018. The prevalence of GDM in women delivering in Oxfordshire in 2010 was 3.4%. 70% of pregnant women were overweight or obese (with 51% being obese) at booking. Gestational weight gain (GWG) was excessive in 29% of women, when compared to Institute of Medicine (IOM) guidelines. Almost a quarter of women (23.4%) had no follow up after delivery. Over a median follow up of 3.5 years (range 0-8 years) nearly one in six (16.9%) of the total cohort (22% of those tested) went on to develop T2DM. 74% of women with GDM were multiparous, and 65% of nulliparous women were tested compared to 81% of multiparous women. There was a significant difference between multiparous women (53.8%) compared to nulliparous women (46.2%) developing T2DM (p=0.01). There was no significant difference in BMI (p=0.866) or GWG (p=0.83) in women who progressed to T2DM versus those who did not. The risk of T2DM after GDM is substantial however, follow up rates of this population is poor. Subsequent screening of women with GDM and their management crosses secondary and primary care with scope for improvement in counselling of women of the importance of annual reviews, in data collection and follow up in both obstetrics and general practice. The implementation of a recall system, an education programme for general practitioners and/or a registry of women diagnosed with GDM could be useful to identify those at high risk of developing T2DM as well as providing a platform for the potential development of interventions to prevent progression to T2DM after GDM.",Primary care diabetes,2020-Dec,"Walker E, Flannery O, Mackillop L",3,2079,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33153226,Role of Phosphodiesterase in the Biology and Pathology of Diabetes.,"Glucose metabolism is the initiator of a large number of molecular secretory processes in β cells. Cyclic nucleotides as a second messenger are the main physiological regulators of these processes and are functionally divided into compartments in pancreatic cells. Their intracellular concentration is limited by hydrolysis led by one or more phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzymes. Literature data confirmed multiple expressions of PDEs subtypes, but the specific roles of each in pancreatic β-cell function, particularly in humans, are still unclear. Isoforms present in the pancreas are also found in various tissues of the body. Normoglycemia and its strict control are supported by the appropriate release of insulin from the pancreas and the action of insulin in peripheral tissues, including processes related to homeostasis, the regulation of which is based on the PDE- cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway. The challenge in developing a therapeutic solution based on GSIS (glucose-stimulated insulin secretion) enhancers targeted at PDEs is the selective inhibition of their activity only within β cells. Undeniably, PDEs inhibitors have therapeutic potential, but some of them are burdened with certain adverse effects. Therefore, the chance to use knowledge in this field for diabetes treatment has been postulated for a long time.",International journal of molecular sciences,2020-Nov,"Kilanowska A, Ziółkowska A",2,1337,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This remains true despite initiation of renal replacement therapy. As such, we were interested in identifying any potential differences in access durability and postoperative outcomes in diabetic patients who receive arteriovenous fistulas versus grafts for hemodialysis. Diabetic patients undergoing their first arteriovenous (AV) access creation surgery in the Vascular Quality Initiative from January 2011 to January 2022 were included in our study. After exclusions, the study included two groups: those receiving AV fistulas and those receiving AV grafts for hemodialysis. Demographic characteristics were summarized and compared between these two groups using chi-square analysis or unpaired <i>t</i>-test. After propensity score matching was conducted, the effect of procedure type on functional patency, along with secondary outcomes including wound infection were assessed using chi-square analysis. A total of 20,159 diabetic patients who used their hemodialysis access were included in our study; 16,205 received AV fistulas while 3954 received AV grafts. Patients receiving AV grafts were more likely to be older, female, and have higher pre-operative catheter usage. After propensity score matching, patients who received AV grafts had a shorter time-to-use their conduit (50 vs 166 days, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), however, patients who received AV fistulas were more likely to have longer functional patency use for hemodialysis when compared to those who received AV grafts (mean survival time: 3.3 vs 2.9 years, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). These results were consistent between diabetics with insulin-dependent or insulin-independent diabetes. Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus had an increased risk for significantly inferior clinical outcomes related to newly created AV grafts, including lower rates of mid-term functional patency and higher rates of worse post-operative outcomes when compared to diabetics who received AV fistulas.",The journal of vascular access,2025-Sep,"Cleary CM, Wu R, Amankwah KS, Boutrous ML",4,2095,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate complete blood count and blood smear alterations and to describe their relationship with, and incidence of comorbid diseases in, diabetic dogs. Three-hundred twelve diabetic dogs, 286 dogs diagnosed with systemic, nondiabetic illnesses, and 506 healthy dogs were identified during the study period. Groups were compared using contingency tables and logistic regression. Associations between statistically significant complete blood count and blood smear alterations and comorbidities were evaluated using multivariable analysis. High-grade codocytosis and anisocytosis were identified more frequently in diabetic dogs, whereas high-grade reactive lymphocytosis and keratocytosis were identified less frequently (P < .001). Diabetic dogs with high-grade codocytosis had lower red blood cell, hemoglobin, hematocrit and higher white blood cell counts (P < .001). Diabetic ketoacidosis was diagnosed more frequently in diabetic dogs with high-grade codocytosis when compared with those with low-grade codocytosis (P < .001) or when compared with any other cell morphologic alterations.

Distinctive data for diabetes (both type 1 and type 2) and related complications were retrieved from national databases. The prevalence of diabetes was higher in people with ID than in the general population (9.9% versus 6.6%). Largest differences were seen in younger age groups. Women with ID had diabetes more often than men with ID. Complications were less common in people with ID than in the general population (IR 58.6 vs. 70.4). In particular, cardiological complications were noted less, while surgical interventions and hospitalization occurred more often. Although diabetes was 1.5 times more prevalent in people with ID than in other people, related complications were less common, followed different patterns and were more severe than in the general population.

We performed a single center, observational study in a cohort of 238 DM patients (mean age ± SD 52.15 ± 17.27 years, 54% female) as a part of the Silesia Diabetes-Heart Project. Having gathered patients' medical history, demographic data, laboratory test results, results from the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (assessing diabetic peripheral neuropathy) and Ewing's battery examination (determining the presence of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy), we managed use a ML approach to predict the occurrence of overt CVD on the basis of five most discriminative predictors with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86 (95% CI 0.80-0.91). Those features included the presence of past or current foot ulceration, age, the treatment with beta-blocker (BB) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi). On the basis of the aforementioned parameters, unsupervised clustering identified different CV risk groups. The highest CV risk was determined for the eldest patients treated in large extent with ACEi but not BB and having current foot ulceration, and for slightly younger individuals treated extensively with both above-mentioned drugs, with relatively small percentage of diabetic ulceration. Using a ML approach in a prospective cohort of patients with DM, we identified important factors that predicted CV risk. If a patient was treated with ACEi or BB, is older and has/had a foot ulcer, this strongly predicts that he/she is at high risk of having overt CVD.",Cardiovascular diabetology,2023-Aug,"Kwiendacz H, Wijata AM, Nalepa J, Piaśnik J, Kulpa J, Herba M, Boczek S, Kegler K, Hendel M, Irlik K, Gumprecht J, Lip GYH, Nabrdalik K",13,1722,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34773673,Diabetes management in the face of adversity: Experiences of asylum-seekers in Belgian reception centres.,"Diabetes poses a heavy burden on patients due to its progressive and chronic nature; it requires continuous management to promote a high-quality and long life. Disease management is especially challenging in emergency settings. We examined how displaced people with diabetes experienced managing their illness before and throughout the process of fleeing their home communities and seeking resettlement in Europe. We designed an interview instrument with closed- and open-ended questions about diabetes diagnosis and management before fleeing the home country, during migration, stays in transit countries and reception in the European Union. We interviewed 20 asylum-seekers living in Belgian reception centres with diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Primary topics emerging from interviews were availability, accessibility, and quality. Belgium was described as a setting with high availability, accessibility and quality of diabetes management components (medication, tools, care) compared with other settings before and during migration. Even in Belgium, maintaining a healthy diet as an asylum-seeker was difficult. Other concerns such as safety, other health issues and the asylum request itself often outweighed diabetes management. Displaced people in non-Western countries need attention for nutrition and diabetes medicine, so aid agencies should consider providing for those needs. For people seeking asylum in the West and living in temporary facilities, care should be paid to the dietary options available for those with diabetes.

The 2-year follow-up has provided new insights on the frequency of ADEs, including severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), during use of FLASH. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> The RELIEF study included 31,446 PwDT1 and 41,027 PwDT2 with a first delivery of FreeStyle Libre (FSL) between August 1 and December 31, 2017. Hospitalizations for DKA, severe hypoglycemia, diabetes-related coma, and hyperglycemia were recorded for the 12 months before and 24 months after FSL initiation. Persistence of the FSL system use was estimated through a Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Change in usual blood glucose monitoring was estimated through acquisition of blood glucose test strips. <b><i>Results:</i></b> In the 2 years after FSL initiation, hospitalizations for ADEs were reduced by 49% and by 48% in PwDT1 or PwDT2, respectively, driven by reductions in DKA. After 2 years, 88% of patients persisted with the system and estimated mean consumption of blood glucose test strips had fallen after 2 years by -82% and by -84% in type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Use of FSL consistently reduces the rates of hospitalization for ADEs, mainly DKA, 2 years after initiation, confirming this is not a transitory effect.

To enable the optimal resource allocation across different prevention and treatment policies for the management of T2D-related complications, detailed cost estimates related to the complications of T2D are needed. Therefore, the objective of the study was to provide reliable and sufficiently detailed real-world estimates of costs associated with different T2D complications in a Finnish university hospital setting. A cohort of T2D patients living in the catchment area of a university hospital during 2012 and 2016 was identified from the comprehensive national FinDM diabetes database for longitudinal assessment of T2D associated complication treatment costs. Data on patient-level events were extracted from the FinDM data and complemented with all accountable services and related detailed costing data gathered from the university hospital's electronic patient information systems by using unique personal identity codes. Patients were screened for their first diagnoses of complications using the same national quality registry definitions as in the FinDM database. Multivariable gamma regression model with a log link function was applied to study the association between baseline factors and complication costs. In addition, an interactive online tool was developed to create predicted costs for complication costs with selected baseline factors. A total of 27 255 prevalent and incident patients with T2D were identified from the national FinDM register. Finally, a total of 16 148 complication episodes for 7 895 patients were included in the cost analyses. The mean estimated one-year hospital treatment costs of T2D-related complication varied from 6 184 to 24 507 euros per complication. Regression analyses showed that coexisting conditions are significantly associated with initial and recurrent complication costs. The study shows updated Finnish cost estimates and their main cost drivers for T2D-related complications treated in the university hospital setting.

Whether this is true in Emilia-Romagna region in recent years is unknown and the aim of this study is to describe the role of educational level both on diabetes prevalence and health outcomes among the adult population with and without diabetes enrolled in the Emilian Longitudinal Study. Inequalities in diabetes prevalence were evaluated through standardised estimates and prevalence ratios by educational level and inequalities in outcomes through standardised hospitalisation and mortality ratios and rate ratios by educational level. The lower the education the greater the diabetes prevalence; such differences were larger among women and younger age groups. Diabetes conferred a higher risk of hospitalisation and mortality; those outcomes also presented a social gradient with the less educated bearing the higher risk. However, educational differences were slightly stronger among the disease-free subjects, especially in the case of mortality. In both genders, inequalities tended to disappear with age. This study confirms that diabetes increases the risk of unfavourable outcomes, but does not increase social inequalities in outcomes as might be expected. Similarly to what has been previously shown, it is likely that the protective effect of diabetes on the negative health effects of the low social position is attributable to the disease integrated care approach.","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2020-Aug,"Bartolini L, Caranci N, Gnavi R, Di Girolamo C",4,1620,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Recent studies have shown that metformin is associated with improved outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and DM and may be a potential candidate for drug repurposing. We aimed to investigate the effects of metformin on outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and DM. Databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, Clinicaltrials.gov and Cochrane library) were searched up to 10 April 2021 for studies reporting data on metformin use in COVID-19 patients with DM. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Certainty of evidence was rated using the GRADE approach. The primary outcome was mortality reported as odds ratio (OR). A random-effects meta-analysis was carried out on both unadjusted and adjusted ORs. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020221842. In total, 2 916 231 patients from 32 cohort studies were included in the quantitative and qualitative synthesis. The meta-analysis showed that metformin was significantly associated with lower mortality in COVID-19 patients with DM in both unadjusted (OR 0.61 [95% confidence interval: 0.53-0.71], P < .00001, I<sup>2</sup>  = 70%) and adjusted (OR 0.78 [95% confidence interval: 0.69-0.88], P < .00001, I<sup>2</sup>  = 67%) models. Poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients with DM can be attributed to inadequate glycaemic control and weakened immune responses.

We aimed to assess the association between obesity and macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes. This study consisted of 111,830 patients (age range: 1-106) with diabetes including 10,641 T1D (3187 obese [38.2% men] and 7454 non-obese [45.5% men]) and 101,189 T2D (51,873 obese [27.5% men] and 49,316 non-obese [33.4% men]) from the National Program for Prevention and Control of Diabetes (NPPCD-2021) in Iran, who attended academic tertiary care outpatient clinics from February 2016 to April 2021. A pooled logistic regression model was used to examine the association between obesity and diabetic complications. Among patients with T1D, a significant association was found between obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD), neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy (OR= 1.75, 1.56, 1.80 and 1.92, P-value= 0.001, 0.004, 0.001 and <0.001, respectively). In T2D, a statistically significant association was found between obesity and CVD, neuropathy and nephropathy (OR= 1.63, 1.98, 1.21, respectively, P-values <0.001). Obesity was independently associated with CVD, neuropathy and nephropathy in patients with T1D and T2D and with retinopathy only in T1D, to different degrees. The association between obesity and retinopathy and neuropathy was the strongest among T1D and T2D, respectively.

The initial publications on this condition began appearing in the second half of the 1990s and quite surprisingly, the search for new NDM genes is still ongoing with great vigor. Between 2018 and early 2024, six brand new NDM-genes have been discovered (CNOT1, FICD, ONECUT1, PDIA6, YIPF5, ZNF808) and three genes known to cause different diseases were identified as NDM-genes (EIF2B1, NARS2, KCNMA1). In addition, NDM cases carrying mutations in three other genes known to give rise to diabetes during childhood have been also identified (AGPAT2, BSCL2, PIK3R1). As a consequence, the list of NDM genes now exceeds 40. This genetic heterogeneity translates into many different mechanism(s) of disease that are being investigated with state-of-the-art methodologies, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and human embryonic stem cells (hESC) manipulated with the CRISPR technique of genome editing.

36932771,Pre-Ramadan diabetes risk stratification and patient education.,"The fast (Sawm) is one of the religious obligations ""Pillars"" of Islam. The target audience of pre-Ramadan diabetes risk stratification and pre-education are the healthcare providers (particularly the Primary care physicians), diabetic patients and community members including general public. As per IDF-DAR (International Diabetes Federation & Diabetes and Ramadan International Alliance) guideline, it is advisable that healthcare providers should arrange pre-Ramadan session (appointment) at least 6-8 weeks prior to Ramadan quantify/stratify the patient risk category and educate all the diabetic patients on Ramadan aspects of Diabetes Mellitus. Diabetic patients are classified in to three risk groups (very high risk, moderate risk and low risk) based on specific patient characteristics. The physician should estimate the effect of fast on the patient, whether he will be able to fast or not, and the patient will estimate his ability and endurance to fast. The mode of Pre-Ramadan diabetes patient education could be group sessions or one to one consultation. Patient education should include information on risks, glucose monitoring, nutrition, exercise and medication adjustment. Studies have shown that pre-Ramadan counseling reduces the incidence of hypoglycaemia. Altering the drug dosage, dietary counseling and patient education, together with regular blood glucose monitoring enables the patients to fast without major complications. Patients classified as very high/high risk including T1DM and pregnant women with diabetes need close medical supervision and focused Ramadan-specific education if they insist on fasting. With the correct advice and support from healthcare providers most people with T2DM can fast safely during Ramadan.",JPMA.

33606663,Differences between transient neonatal diabetes mellitus subtypes can guide diagnosis and therapy.,"Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) is caused by activating mutations in ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes (KATP/TNDM) or by chromosome 6q24 abnormalities (6q24/TNDM). We wanted to assess whether these different genetic aetiologies result in distinct clinical features. Retrospective analysis of the Italian data set of patients with TNDM. Clinical features and treatment of 22 KATP/TNDM patients and 12 6q24/TNDM patients were compared. Fourteen KATP/TNDM probands had a carrier parent with abnormal glucose values, four patients with 6q24 showed macroglossia and/or umbilical hernia. Median age at diabetes onset and birth weight were lower in patients with 6q24 (1 week; -2.27 SD) than those with KATP mutations (4.0 weeks; -1.04 SD) (P = 0.009 and P = 0.007, respectively). Median time to remission was longer in KATP/TNDM than 6q24/TNDM (21.5 weeks vs 12 weeks) (P = 0.002). Two KATP/TNDM patients entered diabetes remission without pharmacological therapy. A proband with the ABCC8/L225P variant previously associated with permanent neonatal diabetes entered 7-year long remission after 1 year of sulfonylurea therapy. Seven diabetic individuals with KATP mutations were successfully treated with sulfonylurea monotherapy; four cases with relapsing 6q24/TNDM were treated with insulin, metformin or combination therapy. If TNDM is suspected, KATP genes should be analyzed first with the exception of patients with macroglossia and/or umbilical hernia. Remission of diabetes without pharmacological therapy should not preclude genetic analysis. Early treatment with sulfonylurea may induce long-lasting remission of diabetes in patients with KATP mutations associated with PNDM.

This study aims to identify the medical expenses of patients with diabetes in different regions of China and examine the differences in inpatient medical expenses and the impacts of them on these patients. This study is a longitudinal analysis of medical expenses for inpatients with diabetes for different years; horizontal analysis of medical expenses among different regions; and literature review. Data were derived from China's Medical Insurance Department database. We selected inpatients with diabetes in the eastern, central, and western regions of China for the period 2013-2015 and randomly selected data through systematic sampling. Among the 4150 patients with diabetes considered in this study, the patients' medical expenses were found to differ significantly across regions, years, ages, medical insurance types, medical institution levels, total medical expenses, medical insurance fund payments, and out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses. In addition, there were significant differences in total medical expenses for male and female patients. Furthermore, medical insurance type, patients' age, medical institution level, and year significantly influenced total medical expenses. Inpatients with diabetes in different regions exhibited significant differences in total medical expenses, medical insurance fund payments, and OOP expenses. China should invest more in chronic disease treatment in its central and western regions, narrow the regional differences in medical expenses, and endeavor to ensure equity in the availability and cost of medical services. Moreover, patients with diabetes must be encouraged to access primary care to reduce their medical expenses.",Public health,2020-Aug,"Zhang X, Yang S, Zhang X",3,1853,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

But rarely, they may present with alkalemia instead of acidosis. Diabetic ketoalkalosis which has been reported in adults can also be present in children with type 1 DM. The usual factors causing alkalemia were not found in our patients. This entity may manifest in both newly diagnosed and treated patients. The first patient, an 8 year male presented with features of DKA, was diagnosed for the first time as type 1 DM, but was found to have alkalemia. The second patient, a 7 year female was a known case of Type 1 DM on insulin, who presented with dehydration and alkalemia. Both were treated with hydration and insulin and made complete recovery.

37448463,Optimizing strategies to identify high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.,"The success of diabetes prevention based on early treatment depends on high-quality screening. This study compared the diagnostic properties of currently recommended screening strategies against alternative score-based rules to identify those at high risk of developing diabetes. The study used data from ELSA-Brasil, a contemporary cohort followed up for a mean (standard deviation) of 7.4 (0.54) years, to develop risk functions with logistic regression to predict incident diabetes based on socioeconomic, lifestyle, clinical, and laboratory variables. We compared the predictive capacity of these functions against traditional pre-diabetes cutoffs of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h plasma glucose (2hPG), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) alone or combined with recommended screening questionnaires. Presenting FPG > 100 mg/dl predicted 76.6% of future cases of diabetes in the cohort at the cost of labeling 40.6% of the sample as high risk. If FPG testing was performed only in those with a positive American Diabetes Association (ADA) questionnaire, labeling was reduced to 12.2%, but only 33% of future cases were identified. Scores using continuously expressed clinical and laboratory variables produced a better balance between detecting more cases and labeling fewer false positives. They consistently outperformed strategies based on categorical cutoffs. For example, a score composed of both clinical and laboratory data, calibrated to detect a risk of future diabetes ≥20%, predicted 54% of future diabetes cases, labeled only 15.3% as high risk, and, compared to the FPG ≥ 100 mg/dl strategy, nearly doubled the probability of future diabetes among screen positives. Currently recommended screening strategies are inferior to alternatives based on continuous clinical and laboratory variables.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2023-,"Bracco PA, Schmidt MI, Vigo A, Mill JG, Vidigal PG, Barreto SM, Sander MF, da Fonseca MJM, Duncan BB",9,1809,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34352986,Management of Cardiovascular Risk in Perimenopausal Women with Diabetes.,"Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of mortality in women and men with diabetes. Due to age and worsening of risk factors over the menopausal transition, risk of coronary heart disease events increases in postmenopausal women with diabetes. Randomized studies have conflicted regarding the beneficial impact of estrogen therapy upon intermediate cardiovascular disease markers and events. Therefore, estrogen therapy is not currently recommended for indications other than symptom management. However, for women at low risk of adverse events, estrogen therapy can be used to minimize menopausal symptoms. The risk of adverse events can be estimated using risk engines for the calculation of cardiovascular risk and breast cancer risk in conjunction with screening tools such as mammography. Use of estrogen therapy, statins, and anti-platelet agents can be guided by such calculators particularly for younger women with diabetes. Risk management remains focused upon lifestyle behaviors and achieving optimal levels of cardiovascular risk factors, including lipids, glucose, and blood pressure. Use of pharmacologic therapies to address these risk factors, particularly specific hypoglycemic agents, may provide some additional benefit for risk prevention. The minimal benefit for women with limited life expectancy and risk of complications with intensive therapy should also be considered.",Diabetes & metabolism journal,2021-Jul,Kim C,1,1399,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We used data from 2223 patients with acute stroke consecutively admitted to an Italian Stroke Unit (SU) between 2010 and 2015. Information from medical records and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measured on admission was retrospectively used to screen for diabetes and prediabetes defined according to standard criteria. Overall rate of diabetes undiagnosed at admission and diabetes still undiagnosed at SU discharge were 9.7% and 6.7% but age-specific prevalence peaked up to 12.0% and 9.0% after age 80. At admission, the proportion of all undiagnosed diabetes on total diabetes cases was one out of every two cases before age 60 and three out of every four cases after age 80. In these same age intervals, one out of every three diabetes cases was still undiagnosed at SU discharge. Regardless of age, about three out of ten patients with acute stroke had prediabetes. Less than 2% of these patients had a prediabetes diagnosis before or after SU admission. In patients with acute stroke, diabetes is substantially underdiagnosed before age 60 and after age 80.

32558488,PPAR-α Agonist Fenofibrate Ameliorates Oxidative Stress in Testicular Tissue of Diabetic Rats.,"Oxidative stress has the potential to induce impotence, especially in diabetic patients. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) agonists can potentiate antioxidants in a wide variety of tissues. However, no available evidence exists showing a direct antioxidant effect on testicular tissue in the setting of diabetes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether PPAR-α agonists can act directly to protect testicular tissue from oxidative damage. Male Wistar rats (180-200 g) were randomly allocated into four groups: normal control (N), normal treated (NF), diabetic (D), and diabetic treated (DF) (n = 6 for each group). Diabetes was induced by a single intravenous injection of streptozotocin STZ (40 mg/kg). Two treatment groups (diabetic and nondiabetic) were treated with fenofibrate daily for 8 weeks (80 mg/kg orally). At the end of 8 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and blood and testicular tissue samples collected. Nitrate, malondialdehyde, and glutathione levels, and the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes were evaluated. The data were analyzed via two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with P < 0.05 taken as significant. Diabetes significantly augmented free radicals, as attested by an increase in nitrate levels in testicular tissue, reduced activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes, and enhanced malondialdehyde content. These changes lead to oxidative stress in testicular tissues. Treatment with fenofibrate in the diabetic group improved oxidative stress by potentiation of antioxidant elements and a reduction in nitrate and malondialdehyde production. Diabetes has a potent effect in promoting the development of oxidative damage in testicular tissue. The PPAR-a agonist fenofibrate improves the redox state and may prevent oxidative stress in the setting of diabetes-induced oxidative stress.",Critical reviews in eukaryotic gene expression,2020-,"Yaribeygi H, Mohammadi MT, Jamialahmadi T, Sahebkar A",4,1883,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This study aimed to determine the incidence and patient-related factors related to diabetes-related amputations amongst patients that were referred to the quaternary hospital between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2015. A retrospective cohort study. Data were retrieved from the medical record for each diabetes patient that was managed at IALCH during the study period. The following variables were collected: sociodemographic parameters (age, gender, and ethnicity) and diabetes-related parameters (type of diabetes) and additional complications. Ninety-nine patients (0, 73%) of all diabetes patients managed were new diabetes-related lower-extremity amputations. There were statistically significant increased odds of female patients (OR: 1, 7) and patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes (OR: 1, 64) to have new diabetes-related amputations.

Using nationally available data and existing clinical and demographic information from members participating in cardiometabolic V1C programs, a microsimulation approach was used to estimate potential reduction in onset of disease sequelae and associated gross savings (ie, excluding the cost of V1C programs) in health care costs. Members of each program were propensity matched to similar records in the combined 2012-2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey files based on age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, and diagnosis status of diabetes and/or hypertension. V1C program-attributed changes in clinical outcomes combined with baseline biometric levels and other risk factors were used as inputs to model disease onset and related gross health care costs. Across the V1C programs, sustained improvements in weight loss, hemoglobin A1c, and blood pressure levels were estimated to reduce incidence of modeled disease sequelae by 2% to 10% over the 5 years following enrollment. As a result of sustained improvement in biometrics and reduced disease onset, the estimated gross savings in medical expenditures across the programs would be $892 to $1342 after 1 year, and cumulative estimated gross medical savings would be $2963 to $4346 after 3 years and $5221 to $7756 after 5 years. In addition, high program engagement was associated with greater health and economic benefits.

Increased S1P can lead to tissue fibrosis that is also one of the pathways for developing diabetic cardiomyopathy. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) increase S1P in cells. The study is aimed at using aminoguanidine (AG) as an AGEs blocker drug to prevent diabetic cardiomyopathy. <i>Materials and methods.</i> 210 rats were enrolled in the study. Diabetes mellitus type-2 was induced, and rats were divided into AG treated diabetic and nondiabetic groups. The heart histology was assessed with Masson's trichrome and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Cardiac function was measured with transthoracic echocardiography. S1P level and SphK1 gene expression were measured by western-blot and RT-qPCR, respectively. Results showed that S1P level increases in diabetes, and its augmentation in cardiac tissue with K6PC-5 leads to cardiac fibrosis. 50 and 200 mg/kg of AG prevented cardiac fibrosis, but 100 mg/kg had no significant preventive effect. AG suppressed the SphK1 gene expression and reduced the fibrotic effect of S1P. AG preserved cardiac function by keeping ejection fraction and fractional shortening within the normal range in diabetic rats. AG has a suppressor effect on SphK1 gene expression besides its AGEs blocker role. AG is a potential drug to use in diabetic patients for preventing the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Other drugs that have AGEs or S1P blocker effects are a good choice for diabetic cardiomyopathy prevention.",Cardiovascular therapeutics,2022-,"Heydari AH, Fathi M, Heydari S, Heidari ME",4,1538,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Functionally, circRNAs have been elucidated to soak up microRNAs (miRNAs) and RNA binding proteins (RBPs), serve as protein scaffolds, maintain mRNA stability, and regulate gene transcription and translation. Notably, circRNAs are strongly implicated in the regulation of β-cell functions, insulin resistance, adipocyte functions, inflammation as well as oxidative stress via acting as miRNA sponges and RBP sponges. Basic and clinical studies have demonstrated that aberrant alterations of circRNAs expressions are strongly associated with the initiation and progression of diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications.

36924001,Continuing the quality improvement of an electronic personal health record and interactive website for people with diabetes in Scotland (My Diabetes My Way).,"eHealth applications have the potential to enable patients to take more control over managing their own health, helping to delay and prevent complications. My Diabetes My Way (MDMW) is an electronic personal health record/educational platform available to people with diabetes in Scotland. This study aims to assess user experience with respect to demographic subgroups, examine effectiveness of previous improvements made to the platform and inform its ongoing development. All active MDMW users (22,665) were invited to take part in a questionnaire combining Likert scale and free-response items relating to system utility. Likert responses were used to generate a 'utility score'. This was used in regression analyses to determine predictors of system utility scoring. Free-response answers were analysed thematically and themes were generated. A total of 4713 (21%) MDMW users responded to the questionnaire. Most agreed that MDMW helps them to track changes over time, prepare for face-to-face consultations, remember information discussed in consultations and reduced the need to contact their general practitioner. Free-response answers showed that users valued earlier enhancements made to the site (e.g. linking Fitbit data), and highlighted areas needing further improvement. Evidence of the 'digital divide' was seen in respondent demographics, and some users mentioned 'lack of digital skills' as a barrier to engaging with the platform. User experience of MDMW was positive. Users agreed with statements that MDMW facilitates diabetes self management. Several areas of potential improvement were identified, including linking more wearable device data, and assisting/directing users to gain the digital skills required to engage fully with MDMW.",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2023-Jul,"Shields C, Conway NT, Allardice B, Wake DJ, Cunningham SG",5,1758,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This was a cross-sectional analysis of participants with diabetes and poor glycemic control in an ongoing trial (n = 353). We compared the prevalence of unmet needs, self-care behaviors, and diabetes outcomes in successive cohorts of enrollees surveyed pre-pandemic (prior to March 11, 2020, n = 182), in the early stages of the pandemic (May-September, 2020, n = 75), and later (September 2020-January 2021, n = 96) stratified by income and gender. Adjusted multivariable regression models were used to examine trends. More participants with low income reported food insecurity (70% vs. 83%, p < 0.05) and needs related to access to blood glucose supplies (19% vs. 67%, p < 0.05) during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels. In adjusted models among people with low incomes, the odds of housing insecurity increased among participants during the early pandemic months compared with participants pre-pandemic (OR 20.2 [95% CI 2.8-145.2], p < 0.01). A1c levels were better among participants later in the pandemic than those pre-pandemic (β = -1.1 [95% CI -1.8 to -0.4], p < 0.01), but systolic blood pressure control was substantially worse (β = 11.5 [95% CI 4.2-18.8, p < 0.001). Adults with low-incomes and diabetes were most impacted by the pandemic. A1c may not fully capture challenges that people with diabetes are facing to manage their condition; systolic blood pressures may have worsened and problems with self-care may forebode longer-term challenges in diabetes control.",Primary care diabetes,2022-Feb,"Patel MR, Zhang G, Leung C, Song PXK, Heisler M, Choe HM, Mehdipanah R, Shi X, Resnicow K, Rajaee G, Piette JD",11,1695,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36253327,Estimating willingness to pay for diabetes complications.,"Maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for a health benefit is connected to perceived value. This two-center study aims to analyse diabetic patients' WTP for obtaining a specific preventive treatment package to reduce severe diabetic complications and determine the factors that impact this value. This cross-sectional research included 557 diabetics from two cities in Iran. The WTP for a preventative package minimising major diabetes complications (cardiovascular, renal, ocular, and diabetic foot) by 50% and 100% was tested using eight scenarios. The Diabetes Attitude Scoring Questionnaire (DAS-3) was used to examine patient attitudes toward diabetes. To determine WTP, a two-stage hurdle method was used. The level of significance was fixed to 0.05. Around 80% of 557 people interviewed (mean age 47.54) stated they wanted to pay for a diabetes prevention package. This package's WTP varied from 169.4 to $374.5 depending on the complication and degree of risk reduction. The largest value diabetic patients willing to pay for preventative packages that reduce the chance of blindness was reported, while the lowest cost was stated for the diabetic foot. WTP is influenced by wealth, location of study, marital status, and attitude toward special training, but not by the type of diabetes, inpatient or outpatient setting, or the complications diabetes patients are impacted by. Patients' diabetes attitudes were mainly negative. The score of the attitude of patients towards diabetes was generally suboptimal. Most diabetic patients were willing to pay for a preventive package and this value was not affected by the type of diabetes and its severity. Our research found that diabetic individuals are willing to pay the most for a preventative package that reduces the chance of blindness, and the least for diabetic foot care. WTP can help health officials allocate resources and manage budgets. The attitude of diabetic patients toward diabetes still needs further interventional research, however.",Primary care diabetes,2022-Dec,"Ghahramani S, Sepehrpoor M, Kazerooni AR, Jahromi AT, Khoshsoroor D, Barzegar D, Seifooripour R, Moradi N, Roodsarabi F, Manzouri A, Sayari M",11,2003,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Data from 175,628 individuals with diabetes in the Health Improvement Network were used to assess the risk of STDR across Townsend Deprivation Index quantiles using Cox proportional hazard regression. Among individuals with T1D, the risk of STDR was three times higher (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.67, 95% CI 1.05-7.78) in the most deprived quintile compared with the least deprived quintile. In T2D, the most deprived quintile had a 28% higher risk (aHR 1.28; 95% CI 1.15-1.43) than the least deprived quintile. Increasing socioeconomic deprivation is associated with a higher risk of developing STDR in people with diabetes.

32250529,Using RWE research to extend clinical trials in diabetes: An example with implications for the future.,"Although randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) are seen as the gold standard for evidence in clinical medicine, a number of considerations are increasing the use of real-world data (RWD) to generate evidence. A series of methodological challenges must be overcome in order for such real-world evidence (RWE) to gain acceptance. In diabetes, RWE faces some particular issues that have limited its development. As the natural history of diabetes progresses, patients' disease changes over time and treatments will be modified as a result. This evolving disease and treatment pattern requires application of methods that account for such changes over time. Research developing RWE in diabetes and other conditions has sometimes been subject to important biases, and researchers should be aware of, and take steps to mitigate potential for bias in order to enhance the evidence produced. We review a RWE study that replicated and extended evidence provided by a RCT regarding the effects of weekly exenatide relative to basal insulin (glargine or detemir) to illustrate a potential application of RWE. This study observed a 0.7% decrease in HbA1C for weekly exenatide relative to a 0.5% decrease in HbA1C for the comparator along with a 2 kg weight loss for weekly exenatide relative to a 0.25 kg weight gain, effects that were close to those from the RCT. Further, the RWE study was able to extend results to patient populations that were not well represented in the RCT. Despite numerous challenges, RWE can be used to complement evidence from RCTs.","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",2020-Apr,"Seeger JD, Nunes A, Loughlin AM",3,1546,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

38719663,Relationship between fibrosis-4 score and microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the most prevalent chronic liver disease globally and is linked to augmented susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiovascular disease, and microvascular complications inherent to DM, such as nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. The fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) scoring system, a noninvasive tool, is useful for predicting the extent of liver fibrosis across diverse pathologies. This study aimed to assess the potential predictive role of FIB-4 scores in microvascular complications associated with diabetes. The medical records of patients with type 2 DM admitted to our endocrinology clinic between February 2019 and December 2020 were retrospectively evaluated. Parameters including demographic attributes, fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, thrombocyte levels, and microvascular complications were recorded. The FIB-4 score was computed, and patients were categorized based on these scores (<1.3 and ≥ 1.3). The analysis included 312 patients with a median age of 60 (50-68 years); 39.7 % were men. The median duration of diabetes was 10 years (5-20 years), and the median FIB-4 score was 0.93 (0.63-1.34). Neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy were observed in 50.6 %, 31.4 %, and 34 % of the patients, respectively. Although the FIB-4 score did not differ significantly between patients with and without neuropathy or retinopathy, patients with nephropathy exhibited higher FIB-4 scores. Notably, patients with FIB-4 scores ≥ 1.3 demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of nephropathy. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that higher FIB-4 scores were significantly associated with an increased risk of nephropathy. The FIB-4 score is a cost-effective and straightforward tool with potential applicability in predicting nephropathy in individuals with type 2 DM.",Arab journal of gastroenterology : the official publication of the Pan-Arab Association of Gastroenterology,2024-Aug,"Erdogan BT, Tam AA, Baser H, Cuhaci Seyrek FN, Polat SB, Ersoy R, Topaloglu O, Cakir B",8,1893,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
34319011,Emerging Targets in Type 2 Diabetes and Diabetic Complications.,"Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic, chronic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and elevated blood glucose levels. Although a large drug portfolio exists to keep the blood glucose levels under control, these medications are not without side effects. More importantly, once diagnosed diabetes is rarely reversible. Dysfunctions in the kidney, retina, cardiovascular system, neurons, and liver represent the common complications of diabetes, which again lack effective therapies that can reverse organ injury. Overall, the molecular mechanisms of how type 2 diabetes develops and leads to irreparable organ damage remain elusive. This review particularly focuses on novel targets that may play role in pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Further research on these targets may eventually pave the way to novel therapies for the treatment-or even the prevention-of type 2 diabetes along with its complications.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",2021-Sep,"Demir S, Nawroth PP, Herzig S, Ekim Üstünel B",4,908,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This study was based on the 1999-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database and included 6,891 patients with DM for cross-sectional analysis. Multivariate adjusted models and restricted cubic spline (RCS) models were employed to assess the association between the insulin resistance index and the risk of DN. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore the impact of different population characteristics. The results indicated that higher quartiles of METS-IR, TyG, TG/HDL, and TyG-BMI were associated with a significantly increased risk of DN. After adjusting for multiple covariates, including gender, age, and race, the associations between these indices and the risk of DN remained significant, with corresponding odds ratios (ORs) of 1.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29-1.76), 2.06 (95% CI: 1.77-2.40), 1.61 (95% CI: 1.38-1.88), and 1.57 (95% CI: 1.35-1.84), with all P-values less than 0.001. RCS analysis indicated a nonlinear relationship between these indices and the risk of DN. The TyG index exhibited a highly consistent association with the risk of DN in all models. Non-insulin-based insulin resistance indices are significantly associated with the risk of DN. The TyG index is a superior tool for assessing the risk of DN. These indices can assist in identifying patients at risk of DN, thereby enabling the implementation of more effective preventive and therapeutic strategies.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,"Zhang F, Han Y, Mao Y, Li W",4,1642,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Admission to residential aged care (RAC) can create many interruptions to usual food choices and diabetes self-management, and we know little about the concerns of the emerging ageing population. This is a qualitative study employing focus groups and inductive thematic analysis involving 18 older adults with diabetes between the ages of 60 and 88, living in their own homes within an Australian city. Focus groups were recruited on a sequential basis and progressively analysed using an inductive process until data saturation was reached. Focus groups were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim for thematic analysis. Three key themes were generated: autonomy, individualised dietary management and the food service system. Older adults speculated that they would want a collaborative approach to maintain their health in ageing and to self-manage their diabetes while feasible. Participants wanted autonomy over food choices, flexible meal timings and quality meals. There was a significant anxiety that aged care staff and existing food service systems in RAC could not support these preferences. Community-dwelling older adults with diabetes would highly value aged care services that facilitated autonomy, individualised nutrition support and flexibility, but feared this will not be feasible. The introduction of new diabetes and RAC guidelines may require an implementation plan to include the full food service system, from staff education to meal preparation, ordering and service.",Australasian journal on ageing,2022-Sep,"Farrer O, Miller M, Yaxley A, Walton K",4,1632,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Prevalence of diabetic nephropathy, and retinopathy, in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is declining, but it is not known if this is true also for diabetic neuropathy. To investigate the relationship between large fibre diabetic neuropathy and other diabetic complications. Neuropathy, defined here as large fibre neuropathy, was assessed by measuring vibration perception thresholds at four different frequencies on the sole of the foot, using a standard VibroSense Meter and/or neuropathic symptoms, in 599 individuals with T1DM. Retinopathy status was graded using the International Clinical Disease Severity Scale. Grade of albuminuria and previous history of any macrovascular complications were registered. Diabetic individuals without retinopathy had similar vibration thresholds as age- and gender-matched control participants without diabetes, whereas those without microalbuminuria had higher thresholds than controls. Two individuals out of 599 (0.3%) had microalbuminuria, but not retinopathy or neuropathy, and 12/134 (9%) without retinopathy had signs of neuropathy. Totally 119/536 (22%) of the patients without microalbuminuria had neuropathy. Vibration thresholds increased with the rising severity of retinopathy and grade of albuminuria. In a multinomial logistic regression analysis, neuropathy was associated with retinopathy (OR 2.96 [1.35-6.49], p=0.007), nephropathy (OR 6.25 [3.21-12.15]; p=6.7×10-8) and macrovascular disease (OR 2.72 [1.50-4.93], p=0.001).

PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Library, Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Database, Google Scholar, and PROSPERO were searched from inception to 2018. Studies published in English evaluating the effect of pharmacist interventions on diabetes outcomes were included. Two independent reviewers were involved in screening of titles and abstracts, selection of studies, and methodological quality assessment. Seven SRs were included in the study. Three of them included only randomized controlled trials, while the rest involved other study designs. Educational interventions by clinical pharmacists within the healthcare team were the most common types of interventions reported across all SRs. Pharmacist's interventions compared to usual care resulted in favorable significant improvements in hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>), fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, body mass index, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein and triglycerides in more than 50% of the SRs. Improvement in HbA<sub>1c</sub> was the mostly reported clinical outcome of pharmacist intervention in the literature (reported in six SRs). Pharmacist's interventions led to significant cost-saving ($8-$85,000 per person per year), cost-utility, and cost-benefit (benefit-to-cost ratio range from 1:1 to 8.5:1) versus usual care. Pharmacist's interventions improved patients' quality of life (QoL) in three SRs; however, no conclusion can be drawn due to the use of diverse QoL assessment tools. Most SRs support the benefit of pharmacist care on diabetes-related clinical, humanistic, and economic outcomes in primary care settings. Improvements in diabetes outcomes can significantly reduce the burden of diabetes on healthcare system. Hence, the incorporation of pharmacists into multidisciplinary diabetes care teams is beneficial and should be strongly considered by clinicians and health policymakers.",Primary care diabetes,2020-Oct,"Abdulrhim S, Sankaralingam S, Ibrahim MIM, Awaisu A",4,2201,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

For over 40 years, glucose biosensors have been used for diabetes management. Measurement of blood glucose is an indirect method for calculating the insulin administration dosage, which is critical for insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Research and development efforts aiming towards continuous-insulin-monitoring biosensors in combination with existing glucose biosensors are expected to offer a more accurate estimation of insulin sensitivity, regulate insulin dosage and facilitate progress towards development of a reliable artificial pancreas, as an ultimate goal in diabetes management and personalised medicine. Conventional laboratory analytical techniques for insulin detection are expensive and time-consuming and lack a real-time monitoring capability. On the other hand, biosensors offer point-of-care testing, continuous monitoring, miniaturisation, high specificity and sensitivity, rapid response time, ease of use and low costs. Current research, future developments and challenges in insulin biosensor technology are reviewed and assessed. Different insulin biosensor categories such as aptamer-based, molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-based, label-free and other types are presented among the latest developments in the field.

This study assesses the extent of screening for DM complications among individuals with type 2 DM attending primary health facilities in rural Eastern Cape (EC), SA. The study adopted a descriptive, cross-sectional design and obtained data from 372 individuals with type 2 diabetes attending six selected primary healthcare centres (PHCs) in two EC districts. Demographic and clinical data were obtained through questionnaire-based interviews and reviews of medical records. We assessed the extent of screening for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), fasting lipogram, eye examination, foot examination and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the past year. Participants mean age was 62 (standard deviation [s.d.] ± 11) years, and their mean duration of diagnosis was 9 (s.d. ± 8) years. In the past year, HbA1c result was available for 71 (19.1%) of the participants; 60 (16.1%) had eGFR results, while only 33 (8.9%) had documented lipid results. In total, 52 (14.0%) had carried out eye examinations, while only 9 (2.3%) had undergone foot examinations in the past year. About two-thirds of the participants (59.9%) had not undergone any form of complication screening in the past year, and none had undergone the complete screening panel. The coverage of screening for DM complications was low across all indicators. Studies to understand barriers to and facilitators of DM complications screening at PHCs are required. Also, interventions to improve diabetes complication screening in the region are needed and should target the primary healthcare providers.",South African family practice : official journal of the South African Academy of Family Practice/Primary Care,2022-Apr,"Owolabi EO, Goon DT, Ajayi AI, Adeniyi OV, Chu KM",5,1715,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39546942,'Online boundary-work': How people with diabetes negotiate what counts as legitimate knowledge in Facebook peer support groups.,"People with chronic conditions such as diabetes use social media to interact with peers. While these online interactions allow them to exchange advice and gain insight into how others cope with their condition, concerns about 'misinformation' being shared are persistently raised, especially among medical professionals. Rather than assessing whether information shared on social media is 'correct' from a clinical perspective, we explore how people with diabetes negotiate what counts as legitimate knowledge as they interact in Facebook groups. Empirically, we draw on a six-month observation of interactions in two Danish Facebook groups for people with type 1 and 2 diabetes, including a data sample of 300 posts and 7797 comments. Observations were carried out in 2021. Guided by the concept of boundary-work (Gieryn, 1983), we analyse how members of the Facebook groups demarcate legitimate knowledge from what they deem illegitimate, enacted as they scrutinise peer advice and knowledge claims. We refer to this ongoing process as 'online boundary-work' and draw out three distinct negotiations, specifying how group members (a) recognise sharing of personal experiences as useful but do not necessarily accept them as valid forms of self-management advice, (b) support each other in evaluating medical issues but delegate certain treatment decisions and responsibility to professionals and (c) do not necessarily agree on the most accurate answer but mobilise scientific or professionally managed sources to legitimise or question claims. Our work contributes to the science and technology studies (STS) literature on how social media facilitates a collective space for people with chronic conditions to 'diagnose' issues in daily self-management and reflect on solutions, especially through sharing personal experiences. By demonstrating how these activities involve an ongoing, collective task of negotiating what counts as legitimate knowledge, we elucidate the effort people with diabetes put into upholding peer support groups as digital spaces for solidarity and knowledge useful to daily self-management. However, as we highlight, online boundary-work does not necessarily result in consensus, prevent certain types of advice from being shared or guarantee that answers are considered useful to members or 'correct' from a clinical perspective.",Social science & medicine (1982),2024-Dec,"Kjærulff EM, Nexø MA, Papoutsi C, Langstrup H",4,2359,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38812811,Combination therapy is it in the future for successfully treating peripheral diabetic neuropathy?,"In 2022, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 11.3% of the United States population, 37.3 million people, had diabetes and 38% of the population had prediabetes. A large American study conducted in 2021 and supported by many other studies, concluded that about 47% of diabetes patients have peripheral neuropathy and that diabetic neuropathy was present in 7.5% of patients at the time of diabetes diagnosis. In subjects deemed to be pre-diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance there was a wide range of prevalence estimates (interquartile range (IQR): 6%-34%), but most studies (72%) reported a prevalence of peripheral neuropathy ≥10%. There is no recognized treatment for diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) other than good blood glucose control. Good glycemic control slows progression of DPN in patients with type 1 diabetes but for patients with type 2 diabetes it is less effective. With obesity and type 2 diabetes at epidemic levels the need of a treatment for DPN could not be more important. In this article I will first present background information on the ""primary"" mechanisms shown from pre-clinical studies to contribute to DPN and then discuss mono- and combination therapies that have demonstrated efficacy in animal studies and may have success when translated to human subjects. I like to compare the challenge of finding an effective treatment for DPN to the ongoing work being done to treat hypertension. Combination therapy is the recognized approach used to normalize blood pressure often requiring two, three or more drugs in addition to lifestyle modification to achieve the desired outcome. Hypertension, like DPN, is a progressive disease caused by multiple mechanisms. Therefore, it seems likely as well as logical that combination therapy combined with lifestyle adjustments will be required to successfully treat DPN.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,Yorek M,1,1872,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35287684,"Glycemic control and atrial fibrillation: an intricate relationship, yet under investigation.","Atrial fibrillation (AF) and diabetes mellitus (DM) constitute two major closely inter-related chronic cardiovascular disorders whose concurrent prevalence rates are steadily increasing. Although, the pathogenic mechanisms behind the AF and DM comorbidity are still vague, it is now clear that DM precipitates AF occurrence. DM also affects the clinical course of established AF; it is associated with significant increase in the incidence of stroke, AF recurrence, and cardiovascular mortality. The impact of DM on AF management and prognosis has been adequately investigated. However, evidence on the relative impact of glycemic control using glycated hemoglobin levels is scarce. This review assesses up-to-date literature on the association between DM and AF. It also highlights the usefulness of glycated hemoglobin measurement for the prediction of AF and AF-related adverse events. Additionally, this review evaluates current anti-hyperglycemic treatment in the context of AF, and discusses AF-related decision-making in comorbid DM.

More than 80% of the displaced population lives in lower- and middle-income countries, which also host 81% of the global population living with diabetes. Most crises are protracted, often lasting decades, and humanitarian aid organizations are providing long-term primary care to both the local and displaced populations. Humanitarian crises are extremely varied in nature and occur in contexts that are diverse and dynamic. The scope of providing diabetes care varies depending on the phase of the crisis. This paper describes key challenges and possible solutions to improving diabetes care in crisis settings. It focuses on (1) ensuring a reliable supply of life preserving medications and diagnostics, (2) restoring and maintaining access to health care, and (3) adapting service design to the context.

35644783,A Scoping Review of Foot Screening in Adults With Diabetes Mellitus Across Canada.,"Regular foot screening by a knowledgeable health-care provider is the cornerstone of ulcer and amputation prevention in people with diabetes. However, information on foot screening practices among Canadians with diabetes remains sparse. Therefore, we sought to synthesize available data on the frequency and approach to diabetic foot screening across Canada. We conducted a scoping review by searching MEDLINE and Embase databases, alongside a grey literature search, for both English- and French-language reports. Data on patients' demographics, setting as well as the frequency of and approach to foot screening were abstracted. Title and abstract screening, full-text review and data abstraction were conducted in duplicate, with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. The search yielded 21 reports including information on diabetic foot screening practices in Canada. In a consolidated study sample of 13,388 Canadians with diabetes, 7,277 (53%) reported receiving a foot examination by a health-care provider at least once in the past year. The majority of reports did not provide information on the demographics of patients being screened or details on the approach to foot screening. No report mentioned the use of a triage algorithm applied to the results of foot screening. In this work, we identified the limited frequency and uncertain quality of diabetic foot screening across Canada. Further research should focus on better understanding disparities and barriers to regular diabetic foot screening.",Canadian journal of diabetes,2022-Jul,"Patel J, Zamzam A, Syed M, Blanchette V, Cross K, Albalawi Z, Al-Omran M, de Mestral C",8,1516,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38714097,Incremental Healthcare Costs of Diabetes Mellitus in a Middle-Income Country Using Administrative Healthcare Data.,"To estimate the incremental medical cost of diabetes mellitus using information from administrative databases in Colombia. We carried out a retrospective cohort study with administrative health databases from Colombian population affiliated in the contributory health insurance scheme. We used an operative definition to select the cohort with diabetes. Incremental cost and cost ratio of diabetes were estimated using an inverse probability weighting of treatment approach to find the causal effect of having the disease. Weights were calculated by a propensity score method using a Random Forest model. The flexibility of this machine learning algorithm allows to have a better specification and bias reduction. Additionally, we reported incremental costs and cost ratios with confidence intervals using bootstrapping and analyzed costs by age groups and complications associated with diabetes. The estimated prevalence of diabetes was 2834 per 100 000 cases, in 2018. The group with diabetes was comprised 634 015 people and the control group 1 524 808. The calculated annual direct medical cost was $860, for which the incremental cost was $493 and the cost ratio 2.34. The incremental annual cost for some type of complication ranges from $1239 to $2043, renal complication being the most expensive. Incremental cost by age groups ranges from $347 to $878, being higher in younger people. Although the cost of diabetes in Colombia ranges among the global averages and is similar to other Latin-American countries, a greater incremental cost was found in patients with renal, circulatory, and neurologic complications.",Value in health regional issues,2024-Sep,"Castro-Villarreal S, Miksi S, Beltrán-Ostos A, Valencia CF",4,1622,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This study included 174,546 patients. The relationship between introducing chronic disease management in a region and the self-awareness of disease status was analyzed using a generalized estimating equation model. Poisson regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of policy adoption on medication adherence and risk-reduction behavior in patients with hypertension and diabetes. Finally, we used a difference-in-differences model to assess the net effectiveness of policies. Overall, regions with policies implemented showed more condition awareness and drug adherence than those without; however, this was only significant in regions where patients and physicians were incentivized. Risk-reduction behavior for patients with diabetes was higher in regions with policies implemented than in those without. The policy had a net effect of significantly and non-significantly increasing disease awareness and medication adherence, respectively. Chronic disease management policies at the primary care level that incentivized both patients and physicians improved patient self-management. However, the effects on patients with diabetes and hypertension differed.

31794280,Cognitive impairment with diabetes mellitus and metabolic disease: innovative insights with the mechanistic target of rapamycin and circadian clock gene pathways.,"<b>Introduction</b>: Dementia is the 7th leading cause of death that imposes a significant financial and service burden on the global population. Presently, only symptomatic care exists for cognitive loss, such as Alzheimer's disease.<b>Areas covered</b>: Given the advancing age of the global population, it becomes imperative to develop innovative therapeutic strategies for cognitive loss. New studies provide insight to the association of cognitive loss with metabolic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Diabetes mellitus is increasing in incidence throughout the world and affects 350 million individuals. Treatment strategies identifying novel pathways that oversee metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders offer exciting prospects to treat dementia. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and circadian clock gene pathways that include AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), Wnt1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP1), erythropoietin (EPO), and silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 <i>(Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) (SIRT1) provide novel strategies to treat cognitive loss that has its basis in metabolic cellular dysfunction.

39501153,Endothelial dysfunction in prediabetes and diabetes mellitus in patients with normal coronary arteries.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a global health issue associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk. Endothelial dysfunction is a known precursor to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, and its role in the pathogenesis of DM complications is well-documented. There is limited information in the evaluation of endothelial function in prediabetic patients using flow-mediated dilation (FMD), and studies have not excluded patients with known atherosclerosis or coronary artery disease. Thus, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the endothelial functions using FMD from the brachial artery of DM and prediabetes patients who had normal coronary arteries. This study included 73 participants: 25 with DM, 25 with prediabetes, and 23 normoglycemic controls, all with normal coronary arteries on angiography. FMD measurements were conducted following established protocols, and statistical analysis was performed using standard methods to compare FMD levels among groups. The groups were comparable in clinical and demographic characteristics, except for fasting plasma glucose levels. Significant differences in FMD levels were observed: 10.1% in the DM group, 16.5% in the prediabetes group, and 14.8% in the control group (P = 0.004). Diabetic patients had significantly lower FMD levels than both prediabetic and normoglycemic individuals. No significant difference in FMD was found between prediabetic and control groups. Diabetic patients exhibited significant endothelial dysfunction compared to normoglycemic individuals, while prediabetic patients did not show similar dysfunction. These findings suggest a window of opportunity in the prediabetic stage for early intervention to prevent advanced endothelial dysfunction. ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN15351014. Registry date: 23/09/2024.

35993472,A Strategic Investigation on Diabetic Nephropathy; Its Conceptual Model and clinical Manifestations: A Review.,"Diabetes is a major health issue, and its complications can lead to various health problems. Nephropathy has been recognised since the 1930s, when Kimmelstiel and Wilson first reported the characteristic nodular glomerulosclerosis lesions in diabetic kidneys. Diabetic nephropathy (DN), commonly known as diabetic kidney disease, is a condition in which people with diabetes have excessive quantities of urine albumin excretion, diabetic glomerular lesions, and a reduction in their glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Type 1 diabetes (autoimmune -cell destruction and absolute insulin insufficiency), type 2 diabetes (relative insulin deficit and resistance), and others are the three forms of diabetes (e.g., pancreatic disease). Diabetes nephropathy is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal failure worldwide. Much research has been conducted in both basic science and clinical therapies to enhance the understanding of the mechanism of diabetic nephropathy and expand available therapeutics. Diabetic nephropathy prevention continues to rely on screening for microalbuminuria and treating hyperglycemia. However, several studies suggest that managing diabetic kidney disease is more challenging. Despite comparable hyperglycemic management, some studies suggest that the incidence of renal problems varies by patient. As a result, there has been a great deal of interest in studying the inherent renal protective effects of various antihyperglycemic drugs. This study aims to provide information about the diabetic kidney disease conceptual model, pathogenesis, screening, and diagnosis. It will also address the treatment and prevention of diabetic nephropathy, focusing on comparing the mechanisms, safety profiles, and efficacy of different antihyperglycemic medications.",Current diabetes reviews,2023-,"Wal P, Tyagi S, Pal RS, Yadav A, Jaiswal R",5,1802,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

33121986,Implicating the effect of ketogenic diet as a preventive measure to obesity and diabetes mellitus.,"Obesity and diabetes are the two major metabolic complications linked with bad eating habits and the sedentary (lazy) lifestyle. In the worst-case situation, metabolic problems are a causative factor for numerous other conditions. There is also an increased demand to control the emergence of such diseases. Dietary and lifestyle improvements contribute to their leadership at an elevated level. The present review, therefore, recommends the use of the ketogenic diet (KD) in obesity and diabetes treatment. The KD involves a diet that replaces glucose sugar with ketone bodies and is effective in numerous diseases, such as metabolic disorders, epileptic seizures, autosomal dominant polycystic disease of the kidney, cancers, peripheral neuropathy, and skeletal muscle atrophy. A lot of high profile pathways are available for KD action, including sustaining the metabolic actions on glucose sugar, suppressing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, altering homeostasis of the systemic ketone bodies, contributing to lowering diabetic hyperketonemia, and others. The KD regulates the level of glucose sugar and insulin and can thus claim to be an effective diabetes approach.

Phytochemicals represent a rich source of plant-derived molecules that are of pivotal importance to the identification of compounds with therapeutic potential. In this review, we aim to discuss recent advances in the identification of a large array of phytochemicals with immense potential in the management of diabetes and its complications. Given that metabolic inflammation has been established as a key pathophysiological event that drives the progression of diabetes, we focus on the protective effects of representative phytochemicals in metabolic inflammation. This paper also discusses the potential of phytochemicals in the development of new drugs that target the inflammation in the management of diabetes and its complications.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2021-Jan,"Kong M, Xie K, Lv M, Li J, Yao J, Yan K, Wu X, Xu Y, Ye D",9,1296,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

38526612,A muscarinic receptor antagonist reverses multiple indices of diabetic peripheral neuropathy: preclinical and clinical studies using oxybutynin.,"Preclinical studies indicate that diverse muscarinic receptor antagonists, acting via the M<sub>1</sub> sub-type, promote neuritogenesis from sensory neurons in vitro and prevent and/or reverse both structural and functional indices of neuropathy in rodent models of diabetes. We sought to translate this as a potential therapeutic approach against structural and functional indices of diabetic neuropathy using oxybutynin, a muscarinic antagonist approved for clinical use against overactive bladder. Studies were performed using sensory neurons maintained in vitro, rodent models of type 1 or type 2 diabetes and human subjects with type 2 diabetes and confirmed neuropathy. Oxybutynin promoted significant neurite outgrowth in sensory neuron cultures derived from adult normal rats and STZ-diabetic mice, with maximal efficacy in the 1-100 nmol/l range. This was accompanied by a significantly enhanced mitochondrial energetic profile as reflected by increased basal and maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity. Systemic (3-10 mg/kg/day s.c.) and topical (3% gel daily) oxybutynin reversed paw heat hypoalgesia in the STZ and db/db mouse models of diabetes and reversed paw tactile allodynia in STZ-diabetic rats. Loss of nerve profiles in the skin and cornea of db/db mice was also prevented by daily topical delivery of 3% oxybutynin for 8 weeks. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled interventional trial was performed in subjects with type 2 diabetes and established peripheral neuropathy. Subjects received daily topical treatment with 3% oxybutynin gel or placebo for 6 months. The a priori designated primary endpoint, significant change in intra-epidermal nerve fibre density (IENFD) in skin biopsies taken before and after 20 weeks of treatments, was met by oxybutynin but not placebo. Secondary endpoints showing significant improvement with oxybutynin treatment included scores on clinical neuropathy, pain and quality of life scales. This proof-of-concept study indicates that muscarinic antagonists suitable for long-term use may offer a novel therapeutic opportunity for treatment of diabetic neuropathy.

33668000,Nanotherapeutic approach to treat diabetic foot ulcers using tissue-engineered nanofiber skin substitutes: A review.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease associated with long-term multisystem complications, among which nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are recognized as major cause of morbidity and mortality. Treating DFUs with surgical procedures such as synthetic or biological skin grafts or skin substitutes has several limitations, where none of the currently available skin substitutes is ideal. OVID/Medline and PubMed databases were searched using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) or Title/Abstract words (""diabetic foot ulcers"", ""skin substitutes"", and ""nanofibers""), to identify published research studies on DFUs and nanofibers. Electrospinning nanotechnology is being used in the biomedical field to produce polymeric nanofibers impregnated with drugs for wound healing, burns and diabetic ulcers. Those nanofibers also enable seeding of cells into them and culturing them in vitro to synthesize tissue-like structures. Knowing the advantages of generating patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and organoids in three-dimension (3D), including skin organoids, it is worth mingling these technologies to develop tissue-engineered biological skin substitutes. Nanofiber-skin substitutes hold promise for treatment of patients suffering from DFUs and inspire novel strategies that could be applied to other organ systems as well, introducing a new era of ""regenerative and personalized medicine"".",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2021-,"Bahmad HF, Poppiti R, Alexis J",3,1432,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36792169,"Knowledge, attitude, and practice toward pre-diabetes among the public, patients with pre-diabetes and healthcare professionals: a systematic review.","The prevalence of pre-diabetes is increasing globally, affecting an estimated 552 million people by 2030. While lifestyle interventions are the first line of defense against progression toward diabetes, information on barriers toward pre-diabetes management and how to overcome these barriers are scarce. This systematic review describes the publics' and healthcare professionals' knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) toward pre-diabetes and determines the barriers toward pre-diabetes management. A systematic search for studies examining KAP towards pre-diabetes was conducted in six databases from inception to September 2022. Studies that quantitatively assessed at least two KAP elements using questionnaires were included. The quality of studies was assessed using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Barriers and enablers were identified and mapped onto the Capability, Motivation, and Behaviour model to identify factors that influence behavior change. Twenty-one articles that surveyed 8876 participants were included in this review. Most of the reviews (n=13) were directed to healthcare professionals. Overall, positive attitudes toward diabetes prevention efforts were observed, although there were still knowledge deficits and poor behavior toward pre-diabetes management. Barriers and enablers were detected at patients (eg, goals and intention), healthcare professionals (eg, clinical judgement) and system (eg, access and resources) levels. The use of different survey instruments to assess KAP prevented a head-to-head comparison between studies. Most studies conducted among patients were from middle-income countries, while among healthcare professionals (HCPs) were from high-income countries, which may produce some biasness. Nevertheless, the development of pre-diabetes intervention should focus on: (1) increasing knowledge on pre-diabetes and its management; (2) imparting practical skills to manage pre-diabetes; (3) providing resources for lifestyle management; (4) improving the accessibility of lifestyle management programs; and (5) other HCPs and human support to pre-diabetes management.",BMJ open diabetes research & care,2023-Feb,"Teoh KW, Ng CM, Chong CW, Bell JS, Cheong WL, Lee SWH",6,2171,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38065628,Post-transplant diabetes mellitus: Findings in nutritional status and body composition.,"Weight gain and changes in body composition are associated with the onset of diabetes after kidney transplantation, and detailing these changes can help prevent this situation. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation and changes in the nutritional status and body composition in patients with diabetes one year from surgery. This survey was a single-center, prospective cohort study. Twenty-nine patients over 18 years old who underwent isolated kidney transplantation, without diabetes, were included and followed up for one year. At hospital discharge after transplantation and one year later, anthropometric (weight, height and abdominal circumference), body composition (electrical bioimpedance), routine biochemical and dietary intake assessments were performed. Most of the patients were male (75%), and the mean age was 48.0±11.8 years old. In the first-year post-surgery 27.6% of patients had DM and the diagnosis was made, on average, 4 months after transplantation. The group with diabetes had, from the beginning to the end of the study, greater weight and body fat, especially abdominal fat. The non-diabetic group, after one year, showed an increase in phase angle, body weight and body masses, more pronounced of fat-free mass, when compared with fat mass gain. Both groups showed weight gain, but in the non-diabetic group these changes can be interpreted as an improvement in the nutritional profile. Metabolic abnormalities associated with immunosuppression and eating habits, combination that maintains increased the risk for diabetes for long time, keeping this group with priority in nutritional care.","Endocrinologia, diabetes y nutricion",2023-Dec,"Pereira Barretto L, Moreira Gomes P, Rossin Guidorizzi N, Moyses Neto M, Almeida Romao E, Garcia Chiarello P",6,1672,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The aim of the present work is to review the most up-to-date novelties in terms of CFRD diagnosis and therapy. This review is timely and relevant because it allows an update for the early and correct classification of glucose abnormalities in cystic fibrosis and because it favours an appropriate therapeutic approach. Confirm that Oral Glucose Tolerance Test is still the diagnostic gold standard despite the advent of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems; this latter is spreading very rapidly, however, to date, there is still no strong evidence to hypothesize the use of CGM for diagnostic purposes. CGM has indeed proven to be very useful in managing and guiding CFRD therapy. Tailored and personalized insulin therapy is still the recommended therapy for children and adolescents with CFRD, although nutritional intervention and oral hypoglycaemic treatment are equally important and efficacious. Finally CFTR modulators have allowed the increase of the life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients and have proven effective not only in improving the pulmonary function and the nutritional status but also the glucose control.",Current opinion in pediatrics,2023-Aug,"Schiaffini R, Pampanini V",2,1300,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

This study aimed to explore perceptions of healthcare providers across Europe concerning 1) the impact of covid-19 on delivery of diabetes care; 2) impact of changes in diabetes care on experienced workload; 3) experiences with video consultation in diabetes care. Cross-sectional survey among healthcare providers in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Turkey, Ukraine and Sweden, with a focus on primary care. The survey was completed by 180 healthcare providers. During the COVID-19 pandemic 57.1% of respondents provided less diabetes care and 72.8% observed a negative impact on people with diabetes. More than half of respondents (61.9%) expressed worries to some extent about getting overloaded by work. Although the vast majority considered their work meaningful (85.6%). Almost half of healthcare providers (49.4%) thought that after the pandemic video-consultation could be blended with face-to-face contact. Less diabetes care was delivered and a negative impact on people with diabetes was observed by healthcare providers. Despite healthcare providers' feeling overloaded, mental wellbeing seemed unaffected. Video consultations were seen as having potential. Given the remaining covid-19 risks and from the interest of proactive management of people with diabetes, these findings urge for further exploration of incorporating video consultation in diabetes care.",Primary care diabetes,2023-Apr,"Van Grondelle SE, Van Bruggen S, Rauh SP, Van der Zwan M, Cebrian A, Seidu S, Rutten GEHM, Vos HMM, Numans ME, Vos RC",10,1431,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
37963648,Patient-reported outcome measures in diabetes outpatient care: a scoping review.,"Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are increasingly used in clinical diabetes care to increase patient involvement and improve healthcare services. The objectives were to identify instruments used to measure PROs in outpatient diabetes clinics and to investigate the use of these PRO measures alongside the experiences of patients and healthcare personnel in a clinical setting. A scoping review was conducted according to the framework of Arksey and O'Malley with scoping searches of Cinahl, EMBASE, Medline and Health and Psychosocial Instruments. Studies reporting on adults with diabetes in a clinical setting where the PRO measure response directly affected patient care were eligible for inclusion. In total, 35 197 citations were identified, of which 7 reports presenting 4 different PRO measures were included in the review. All four of the included items measured psychosocial aspects of diabetes, and three included elements of the Problem Areas in Diabetes scale. All the patients were satisfied with the use of PRO measures in clinical care, whereas the level of satisfaction among healthcare personnel with PRO measures varied within and among studies. The limited number of eligible studies in this review suggests that research on PRO measures for diabetes outpatient care is scarce. Patients welcome the opportunity to express their concerns through the systematic collection of PRO measures, and some healthcare personnel value the broader insight that PRO measures provide into the impact of diabetes on patients' lives. However, the heterogeneity among services and among patients challenges the implementation of PRO measures. Research is needed to explore how PRO measures in clinical outpatient care affect healthcare personnel workflow. https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/46AHC.",BMJ open diabetes research & care,2023-Nov,"Torbjørnsen A, Jensen AL, Singstad T, Weldingh NM, Holmen H",5,1803,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The aims of this systematic review are to investigate the evidence for the diagnosis and subsequent treatment, to clarify the objective methods for determining remission and to evaluate the evidence for the prevention of re-activation in people with CNO, DM and intact skin. We performed a systematic review based on clinical questions in the following categories: Diagnosis, Treatment, Identification of Remission and Prevention of Re-Activation in people with CNO, DM and intact skin. Included controlled studies were assessed for methodological quality and key data from all studies were extracted. We identified 37 studies for inclusion in this systematic review. Fourteen retrospective and observational studies relevant to the diagnosis of active CNO with respect to clinical examination, imaging and blood laboratory tests in patients with DM and intact skin were included. We identified 18 studies relevant to the treatment of active CNO. These studies included those focused on offloading (total contact cast, removable/non-removable knee high devices), medical treatment and surgical treatment in the setting of active CNO. Five observational studies were identified regarding the identification of remission in patients who had been treated for active CNO. We did not identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria for the prevention of re-activation in patients with DM and intact skin who had been previously treated for active CNO and were in remission.

The reported incidence of NODAT varies from 14 to 37% in renal transplant recipients worldwide; however, NODAT is yet to be studied in the Irish renal transplant population. Primary aims of this project were to estimate the incidence, to determine associated risk factors and to assess the long-term consequences of NODAT on graft survival and patient survival in the Irish renal transplant population. Retrospective data collection of 415 renal transplant recipients over a 12-year period was performed to record presence of NODAT, patient characteristics and perioperative management. Preoperative screening was reviewed in a subgroup of patients to determine concordance with the International Consensus Guidelines. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier survival functions estimating NODAT detection over time, graft and patient survival. Risk factor association was determined using Cox proportional-hazards models. NODAT incidence was 10.2% in the first 5 years of post-transplant. Risk factors for developing NODAT were recipient age and body weight. Risk of NODAT was highest in the first year of post-transplant and conferred decreased patient survival; however, it did not significantly affect graft survival. Only seven patients of a subgroup of 21 patients who developed NODAT had preoperative testing for diabetes. NODAT incidence in the Irish renal transplant population is slightly below international figures.

36604111,<i>TXNIP</i> DNA methylation is associated with glycemic control over 28 years in type 1 diabetes: findings from the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC) study.,"DNA methylation (DNAme) has been cross-sectionally associated with type 2 diabetes and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in the general population. However, longitudinal data and data in type 1 diabetes are currently very limited. Thus, we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) in an observational type 1 diabetes cohort to identify loci with DNAme associated with concurrent and future HbA1cs, as well as other clinical risk factors, over 28 years. Whole blood DNAme in 683 597 CpGs was analyzed in the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications study of childhood onset (<17 years) type 1 diabetes (n=411). An EWAS of DNAme beta values and concurrent HbA1c was performed using linear models adjusted for diabetes duration, sex, pack years of smoking, estimated cell type composition variables, and technical/batch covariates. A longitudinal EWAS of subsequent repeated HbA1c measures was performed using mixed models. We further identified methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) for significant CpGs and conducted a Mendelian randomization. DNAme at cg19693031 (Chr 1, <i>Thioredoxin-Interacting Protein</i> (<i>TXNIP</i>)) and cg21534330 (Chr 17, <i>Casein Kinase 1 Isoform Delta</i>) was significantly inversely associated with concurrent HbA1c. In longitudinal analyses, hypomethylation of cg19693031 was associated with consistently higher HbA1c over 28 years, and with higher triglycerides, pulse rate, and albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) independently of HbA1c. We further identified 34 meQTLs in <i>SLC2A1/SLC2A1-AS1</i> significantly associated with cg19693031 DNAme. Our results extend prior findings that <i>TXNIP</i> hypomethylation relates to worse glycemic control in type 1 diabetes by demonstrating the association persists over the long term. Additionally, the associations with triglycerides, pulse rate, and ACR suggest <i>TXNIP</i> DNAme could play a role in vascular damage independent of HbA1c. These findings strengthen potential for interventions targeting TXNIP to improve glycemic control in type 1 diabetes through its role in <i>SLC2A1</i>/glucose transporter 1-mediated glucose regulation.",BMJ open diabetes research & care,2023-Jan,"Miller RG, Mychaleckyj JC, Onengut-Gumuscu S, Orchard TJ, Costacou T",5,2135,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32613289,Importance of Identifying Novel Biomarkers of Microvascular Damage in Type 1 Diabetes.,"Microvascular complications of type 1 diabetes, which primarily include diabetic kidney disease, retinopathy, and neuropathy, are characterized by damage to the microvasculature of the kidney, retina, and neurons. The pathogenesis of these complications is multifactorial, and several pathways are implicated. These complications are often silent during their early stages, and once symptoms develop, there might be little to be done to cure them. Thus, there is a strong need for novel biomarkers to identify individuals at risk of microvascular complications at an early stage and guide the implementation of new therapeutic options for preventing their development and progression. Recent advancements in proteomics, metabolomics, and other 'omics' have led to the identification of several potential biomarkers of microvascular complications. However, biomarker discovery has met several challenges and, up to now, there are no new biomarkers that have been implemented into clinical practice.

To compare claims with diabetes specialists for youths with type 1 vs type 2 diabetes and the association between specialist claims with multidisciplinary and acute care utilization. This cross-sectional study used Optum Clinformatics Data Mart commercial claims. Individuals included in the study were youths younger than 19 years with type 1 or 2 diabetes as determined by a validated algorithm and prescription claims.

Statistical analysis was performed from September 2022 to January 2024. The primary outcome was the number of ambulatory claims from an endocrine and/or diabetes physician or advanced practice clinician associated with a diabetes diagnosis code; secondary outcomes included multidisciplinary and acute care claims. Claims were analyzed for 4772 youths (mean [SD] age, 13.6 [3.7] years; 4300 [90.1%] type 1 diabetes; 472 [9.9%] type 2 diabetes; 2465 [51.7%] male; 128 [2.7%] Asian, 303 [6.4] Black or African American, 429 [9.0%] Hispanic or Latino, 3366 [70.5%] non-Hispanic White, and 546 [11.4%] unknown race and ethnicity). Specialist claims were lower in type 2 compared with type 1 diabetes (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.61 [95% CI, 0.52-0.72]; P < .001) in propensity score-weighted analyses. The presence of a comorbidity was associated with increased specialist claims for type 1 diabetes (IRR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.03-1.10]) and decreased claims for type 2 diabetes (IRR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.67-0.87]). Pooling diagnosis groups and adjusted for covariates, each additional specialist claim was associated with increased odds of a claim with a diabetes care and education specialist (odds ratio [OR], 1.31 [95% CI, 1.25-1.36]), dietitian (OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.09-1.19]), and behavioral health clinician (OR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.12-1.20]). For acute care claims, each additional specialist claim was associated with increased odds of admission (OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.11-1.24]) but not for emergency claims (OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.98-1.82]). This cross-sectional study found that youths with type 2 diabetes were significantly less likely to have specialist claims despite insurance coverage, indicating other barriers to care, which may include medical complexity.

An understanding of early diabetes-specific RBC changes associated with impaired RBCD is essential in investigating mechanisms that predispose to diabetic vascular complications. We conducted an outpatient cross-sectional study of participants in a well-controlled diabetes cohort (N81) and nondiabetic controls (N78) at the National Institutes of Health. First, between-group differences in RBCD measures were assessed with shear stress-gradient ektacytometry. Differences in structural RBC parameters were assessed using osmotic gradient ektacytometry and NaCl osmotic fragility. Functional RBC changes were assessed using hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation: p50. All shear-stress gradient RBCD measures were significantly altered in the diabetes cohort vs. nondiabetic controls, even after adjustment for confounding covariates (p < 0.001). Adjusted for diabetes-status and demographic factors, significant predictors of reduced RBCD included older age, Black race, male gender, hyperglycemia, and vascular complications (all p < 0.05). Reduced RBCD was also associated with aberrant osmotic-gradient parameters, with a left-shift on osmotic gradient profile indicative of dehydrated RBCs in diabetes. A structure-function relationship was observed with reduced RBCD associated with reduced osmotic fragility (P < 0.001) and increased hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation (P < 0.01). Findings suggest impaired RBCD incurs similar demographic and clinical risk factors as diabetic vascular disease, with early pathophysiological RBC changes indicative of disordered RBC hydration in diabetes. Findings provide strong evidence for disordered oxygen release as a functional consequence of reduced RBCD.

Operational research is needed to determine the best way to manage individuals with both conditions. This pilot study aimed to develop, and field test an integrated, multidisciplinary program addressing the management of individuals with TB and DM and other associated chronic conditions in the Indian primary healthcare setting. This pilot study used a randomized controlled trial design with mixed-methods evaluation and was conducted in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, a southern state of India. All the 120 patients newly diagnosed with TB from 10 participating villages were screened for DM and associated cardiovascular risk factors. Non-physician health workers were trained to follow-up patients for a period of 8 months to encourage treatment adherence, monitor treatment response including blood glucose levels and provide lifestyle advice. The intervention was well-accepted by the providers and patients. However, there were no statistically significant variations observed for mean blood glucose levels (mean [SD]: 5.3 [-23.3 to 33.8]) of patients for both intervention and control group participants in this feasibility study. Awareness about diabetes and tuberculosis comorbidity and cardiovascular risk increased among the non-physician health workers in the intervention arm of the study.

33957141,Interdisciplinary assessment and diagnostic algorithm: The role of the diabetologist.,"In recent years, many studies have revealed the importance of heart failure (HF) development in type 2 diabetes (T2D), which increases the morbidity and mortality during the course of diabetes. In this context, it became important to emphasize the role of both cardiologists and diabetologists in the early diagnosis and further adequate treatment of HF in T2D. While HF appears in two major forms, with reduced or preserved ejection fraction (EF), namely HFrEF and HFpEF, it became important to define the optimal approach to the diagnostics. Regarding HFrEF, the role of cardiological methods remained dominant, while the complexity of early diagnosis requires nowadays more active participation of diabetologists. The absence of abundant symptoms and echocardiographic findings imposed the need for the use of risk markers based on metabolic variables and low-grade inflammation parameters. Following that unmet need, numerous studies have defined the possible relationship between metabolic variables in diabetes and the risk for HF. Moreover, attempts have been made to integrate biochemical and clinical parameters into risk score engines and some of them gave promising results.

35728217,Establishing a database of patients with diabetes and an interest in research participation.,"To establish interest in medical research and student training, based on demographics of those attending public-funded diabetes services and types of research. Patients who attended the Auckland Diabetes Centre (ADC) between July 2018 and July 2019 were invited via text message (SMS) to register their interest in being contacted for future health research projects and medical training. Consenting adults were enrolled in the Auckland Diabetes Centre Volunteer Database (ADCVD) and sent a survey on the acceptability of various types of research and factors influencing participation. Relationships between ADCVD enrolment and other variables were determined using Fisher's exact test. Qualitative data were coded to generate key themes using an inductive approach. Of 2,884 patients contacted, 527 were enrolled in the ADCVD (response rate: 18.3%); and of these, 176 completed surveys (response rate: 33.3%). Most respondents were NZ European (n=92, 52.3%), male (n=125, 70.6%), and from the least deprived areas (n=35, 19.9%). The type of research did not affect interest. Motivations to participate centred around a hope to improve their own diabetes and that of future generations. SMS-based recruitment from a diabetes clinic results in modest interest in participation in teaching and research from predominantly those of NZ European ethnicity and living in areas of least socio-economic deprivation.",The New Zealand medical journal,2022-May,"Tweedie-Cullen RY, Tay A, Zou Y, Brandon R, Yeu R, Ruru S, Carmichael H, Schmiedel O, Murphy R",9,1408,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
32097907,Recent Epidemiological Status of Ocular and Other Major Complications Related to Diabetes Mellitus in Japan.,"To investigate the epidemiological status of diabetes mellitus (DM)-related complications in Japan. The subjects were 3.11 million Japanese individuals who were registered in the Japanese claim database between 2005 and 2014. Subjects with a diagnosis associated with codes related to DM and/or DM-related complications as classified by the International Classification of Diseases version 10 and those who were prescribed any therapeutic agents for DM were considered to have DM. The status of ocular, renal, and neural complications was investigated. A total of 66,923 patients with DM were included. The prevalence of subjects with DM was 3.8% in 2005 and 4.2% in 2014. The most frequent complication was diabetic retinopathy (23.6%, 95% CI: 21.7-25.5%), followed by diabetic nephropathy (14.8%, 95% CI: 14.0-15.6%) and diabetic neuropathy (4.9%, 95% CI: 4.5-5.3%). Among the subjects with ocular complications, 1.8% had proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 1.1% had diabetic macular edema (DME), 0.3% had neovascular glaucoma, and 1.5% had vitreous hemorrhage. Only DME significantly increased during the study period. The frequencies of the ocular and neural complications significantly decreased, while that of renal complications significantly increased during the study period. Ocular complications were the most common DM-related major complications in Japan. Notably, DME significantly increased in recent years.",Ophthalmologica. Journal international d'ophtalmologie.

37937649,"Awareness of the diagnosis, treatment, and control of diabetes mellitus in Brazil.","To estimate the proportions of awareness, treatment, and control of diabetes mellitus (DM) in the Brazilian adult population. This is a cross-sectional study, with data from a representative sample of the Brazilian population, taken from the National Health Survey(PNS 2014/2015). Outcomes were defined based on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurements, self-reported DM diagnosis, and use of hypoglycemic agents or insulin. The proportion of DM awareness, treatment, and control was estimated according to sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, and access to health services, and their respective 95% confidence intervals. DM prevalence in the Brazilian population was of 8.6% (95%CI: 7.8-9.3): 68.2% (95%CI: 63.9-72.3) were aware of their diagnosis, 92.2% (95%CI: 88.6-94.7) of those who were aware were undergoing drug treatments, and, of these, 35.8% (95%CI: 30.5-41.6) had controlled HbA1c levels. The proportions of DM awareness, control, and treatment were lower in men aged 18 to 39 years, individuals with low education, without health insurance, and beneficiaries of the Bolsa Família program. Approximately one in ten Brazilians has DM. A little more than half of this population is aware of their diagnosis, a condition measured by HbA1c dosage and clinical diagnosis. Among those who know, the vast majority are undergoing drug treatments. However, less than half of these have their HbA1c levels controlled.

38944250,Diabetic peripheral neuropathy and glycemic variability assessed by continuous glucose monitoring: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-derived metrics have been used to accurately assess glycemic variability (GV) to facilitate management of diabetes mellitus, yet their relationship with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is not fully understood. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between GV metrics and the risk of developing DPN. Nine studies totaling 3,649 patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. A significant association was found between increased GV, as indicated by metrics including standard deviation (SD) with OR and 95% CI of 2.58 (1.45-4.57), mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) with OR and 95% CI of 1.90 (1.01-3.58), mean of daily difference (MODD) with OR and 95% CI of 2.88 (2.17-3.81) and the incidence of DPN. Our findings support a link between higher GV and an increased risk of DPN in patients with diabetes. These findings highlight the potential of GV metrics as indicators for the development of DPN, advocating for their inclusion in diabetes management strategies to potentially mitigate neuropathy risk. Longitudinal studies with longer observation periods and larger sample sizes are necessary to validate these associations across diverse populations.",Diabetes research and clinical practice,2024-Jul,"Jia Y, Long D, Yang Y, Wang Q, Wu Q, Zhang Q",6,1264,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38265639,Yoga or Mindfulness on Diabetes: Scoping Review for Theoretical Experimental Framework.,"About one in 11 adults worldwide suffers from diabetic disease with constantly increasing prevalence; from the 529 million patients registered in 2021, the number of people with diabetes was predicted to rise to approximately 1.31 billion in 2050. In Italy, 5.9% of the population is diabetic, with a higher prevalence with increasing age and in the South of the country. Yoga and Mindfulness could represent a valid support for the care of diabetic subjects especially in a stressful caring context such as the Covid-19 pandemic. A scoping review was conducted to achieve the goals of the study. Yoga or Mindfulness interventions on diabetic subjects were specifically analyzed and qualitative-quantitative data collected in the selected randomized controlled trials were extensive for possible meta-analysis. The review was conducted by two independent practitioners and a third one was consulted in case of conflict. The PRISMA method was used for both the selection and reporting of the studies to be included. Specific PICOS and search strategies have been developed on PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO databases. Included in the review were: randomised controlled trials, full dissertation articles and papers in English with a time limit on May 31, 2022. The Review included 22 studies; 12 on Mindfulness, 9 on Yoga and one about both disciplines; among these, one studied patients with Type 1 Diabetes, 14 with Type 2 Diabetes, 6 with both and one with Gestational Diabetes. Only one paper studied adolescent subjects while the other 21 focused on a range of adult subjects. The studies showed that Yoga and Mindfulness have strong potential not only on stress management, but also on clinical-metabolic parameters. The recent Covid-19 pandemic has certainly redesigned a new way of treating and managing chronic diseases, such as diabetes. An increasingly fragile population, and with the growing need to reduce overall stress levels, could find alternative practices in Yoga and Mindfulness to support conventional therapies.",Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita,2024-,"Cangelosi G, Acito M, Grappasonni I, Nguyen CTT, Tesauro M, Pantanetti P, Morichetti L, Ceroni E, Benni A, Petrelli F",10,2030,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Although it is well-accepted that local inflammation leads to a progressive loss of functional beta cell mass that eventually causes the onset of the disease, the development of islet inflammation remains unclear. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to explore the cell type-specific molecular response of primary human pancreatic cells exposed to an inflammatory environment. We identified a duct subpopulation presenting a unique proinflammatory signature among all pancreatic cell types. Overall, the findings of this study point towards a role for duct cells in the propagation of islet inflammation, and in immune cell recruitment and activation, which are key steps in the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus.",Frontiers in immunology,2024-,"Muñoz García A, Juksar J, Groen N, Zaldumbide A, de Koning E, Carlotti F",6,803,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36012395,Fast Tacrolimus Metabolism Does Not Promote Post-Transplant Diabetes Mellitus after Kidney Transplantation.,"Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) after kidney transplantation induced by tacrolimus is an important issue. Fast tacrolimus metabolism, which can be estimated by concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratio, is associated with increased nephrotoxicity and unfavorable outcomes after kidney transplantation. Herein, we elucidate whether fast tacrolimus metabolism also increases the risk for PTDM. Data from 596 non-diabetic patients treated with tacrolimus-based immunosuppression at the time of kidney transplantation between 2007 and 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. The median follow-up time after kidney transplantation was 4.7 years (IQR 4.2 years). Our analysis was complemented by experimental modeling of fast and slow tacrolimus metabolism kinetics in cultured insulin-producing pancreatic cells (INS-1 cells). During the follow-up period, 117 (19.6%) patients developed PTDM. Of all patients, 210 (35.2%) were classified as fast metabolizers (C/D ratio < 1.05 ng/mL × 1/mg). Fast tacrolimus metabolizers did not have a higher incidence of PTDM than slow tacrolimus metabolizers (p = 0.496). Consistent with this, insulin secretion and the viability of tacrolimus-treated INS-1 cells exposed to 12 h of tacrolimus concentrations analogous to the serum profiles of fast or slow tacrolimus metabolizers or to continuous exposure did not differ (p = 0.286). In conclusion, fast tacrolimus metabolism is not associated with increased incidence of PTDM after kidney transplantation, either in vitro or in vivo. A short period of incubation of INS-1 cells with tacrolimus using different concentration profiles led to comparable effects on cell viability and insulin secretion in vitro. Consistent with this, in our patient, collective fast Tac metabolizers did not show a higher PTDM incidence compared to slow metabolizers.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022-Aug,"Jehn U, Wiedmer N, Boeckel GR, Pavenstädt H, Thölking G, Reuter S",6,1827,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
33431598,Service user and community clinician design of a partially virtual diabetic service improves access to care and education and reduces amputation incidence.,"Design of an integrated diabetes service based on needs of service users (persons living with diabetes) and community clinicians in a semirural low-income health district of the UK. One hundred and eighty-five service users engaged through public meetings, questionnaires and focus groups. General practice staff contributed views through workshops and questionnaires. Analysis of feedback indicated service user needs for better access to education, dietary advice and foot care. General practice staff endorsed these views and requested regular access to secondary care in the community. Seven hundred persons registered with diabetes attended eight well-being events in the community. From 2017 virtual practice multidisciplinary patient reviews, virtual referral of foot cases and non-face-to-face helplines were developed. A National Health Service (NHS) approved 'App' and web-based personalized education support for those recently diagnosed with diabetes was introduced. Engagement in education for those recently diagnosed with diabetes increased from 5% to 71%. Weight and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels before and 6 months after starting the program were 99.4±25 and 95.5±24.2 kg and 59.3±16 and 54.8±12.9 mmol/mol, respectively, p=0.00003 and 0.003. Of those engaging at well-being events, 44 had missed regular follow-up. One hundred and seventy-five cases were reviewed virtually with practice staff by the secondary care team avoiding referral to the hospital diabetic clinic. One hundred and seventy-six referrals were made to the virtual multidisciplinary diabetic foot team clinic. Major amputation incidence declined from 13 to 3 major procedures/10 000 per annum and minor amputation from 26 to 18/10 000. Percentage bed day occupancy by persons with diabetes fell significantly in the district general hospital. Integrated community-based diabetes care delivery has been achieved with partially virtual reviews.

33605920,Evaluation of the effects of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections on blood glucose levels in diabetes mellitus and nondiabetes mellitus patients with adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder.,"The aim of this study was to assess the effect of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections on blood glucose levels in diabetes mellitus (DM) and non-DM patients with adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder and investigate the risk factors for hyperglycemia. The study included 40 DM and 38 non-DM patients. The DM status, HbA1c levels, baseline fasting blood glucose (FBG) level, and post-injection 1-, 7-, 15-, and 21-day FBG levels were evaluated retrospectively. The FBG levels were significantly higher 1 and 7 day after the glucocorticoid injection as compared with the baseline levels (P = 0.001 and <0.001, respectively). The increase was greatest in DM patients and then returned to baseline levels 15-day post-injection. In terms of the mean difference in post-injection and baseline FBG levels, the increase on day 1 was statistically significantly greater in the DM group as compared with that in the non-DM group (P = 0.01). Linear regression model showed that only the baseline FBG level predicted the glucose level 1-day post-treatment (β = 0.839, P < 0.01). Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections can safely be administered as a treatment for adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder in patients with well-controlled DM. Baseline FBG levels may predict peak blood glucose levels in patients with well-controlled DM. We recommend that DM patients with adhesive capsulitis should undergo frequent monitoring of blood glucose in the 2 week following intraarticular glucocorticoid injection treatment.",Nigerian journal of clinical practice,2021-Feb,"Akin-Takmaz S, Babaoglu G, Başar H, Baltacı B",4,1505,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35046015,Diabetic hand: prevalence and incidence of diabetic hand problems using data from 1.1 million inhabitants in southern Sweden.,"'The diabetic hand' has traditionally referred to hand complications due to diabetes mellitus (DM), including trigger finger (TF) and Dupuytren's disease (DD). Recent publications have also proposed DM as a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), ulnar nerve entrapment (UNE), and possibly osteoarthritis (OA) of the first carpometacarpal (CMC-1) joint. This study aimed to explore prevalence and incidence of diabetic hand complications among the population in southern Sweden. Approximately 1.1 million inhabitants in the region of Skåne aged ≥18 years, whereof 50 000 with DM, were included. Data on incident CTS, UNE, TF, DD, and OA of the CMC-1 joint between 2004 and 2019 were collected from the Skåne Healthcare Register and cross-linked with the National Diabetes Register. Prevalences on December 31, 2019 and 10-year incidence ratios were calculated for type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and the population without DM, stratified for sex. Prevalence ratios and incidence rate ratios with 95% CIs were used for group comparisons. The prevalences of all five studied diagnoses were higher in both men and women with T1D and T2D (p<0.01) and both T1D and T2D had more concomitant prevalent diagnoses (p<0.0001). The 10-year incidence rates of all diagnoses were higher among T1D and T2D (p<0.0001), except OA of the CMC-1 joint in men with T1D (p=0.055). CTS, UNE, and possibly also OA of the CMC-1 joint should be included together with TF and DD when referring to 'the diabetic hand'. The incidence of hand disorders was up to eight times higher among T1D, and both T1D and T2D had more concomitant prevalent diagnoses compared with the population without DM. Future studies should elucidate the pathophysiology behind diabetic hand complications to enable development of effective preventive measures in patients with diabetes.",BMJ open diabetes research & care,2022-Jan,"Rydberg M, Zimmerman M, Gottsäter A, Svensson AM, Eeg-Olofsson K, Dahlin LB",6,1855,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The 10-g monofilament and a foot exam are the commonly used methods for screening diabetic neuropathy, but this primarily identifies moderate to severe diabetic neuropathy. Small fibres are damaged early and are associated with the development of painful diabetic neuropathy, foot ulceration, and Charcot foot. Tests of small fibre damage include thermal thresholds, microneurography, evoked potentials, sudomotor function, laser Doppler flare, skin biopsy, and corneal confocal microscopy.

37828591,"Patient's experiences of diabetes care at a tertiary health facility in Lilongwe, Malawi.","Little is known about experiences of rural people with diabetes care at a tertiary health facility in low-income settings. Understanding their experiences is essential for developing effective diabetes care interventions. The study employed a qualitative narrative inquiry. Participants were identified at a diabetes clinic at a tertiary-level healthcare facility. Ten participants from the rural areas attending the diabetes clinic were purposively selected. Data were collected through in-depth interviews in the privacy of the homes of the study participants and analysis was done using the Riessman approach to thematic narrative analysis. In this study, the following four themes emerged: (1) the long pathway to a diagnosis of diabetes; (2) Poverty-related hardships and diabetic clinic attendance; (3) The impact of health worker attitudes and behavior on diabetes care; and (4) Low resources and their impact on self-management. Rural-based patients living with diabetes encounter enormous challenges as they access diabetes care. One of the challenges is delayed diagnosis of diabetes. There is a need to introduce point-of-care (POC) testing to improve diabetes diagnosis. In addition, there is a need to strengthen awareness campaigns among the population so that people are well informed about the signs and symptoms of diabetes to promote early diagnosis. Diabetes care must be decentralized from tertiary hospitals to primary health centers.

32634859,Histological validation of a type 1 diabetes clinical diagnostic model for classification of diabetes.,"Misclassification of diabetes is common due to an overlap in the clinical features of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Combined diagnostic models incorporating clinical and biomarker information have recently been developed that can aid classification, but they have not been validated using pancreatic pathology. We evaluated a clinical diagnostic model against histologically defined type 1 diabetes. We classified cases from the Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) biobank as type 1 (n = 111) or non-type 1 (n = 42) diabetes using histopathology. Type 1 diabetes was defined by lobular loss of insulin-containing islets along with multiple insulin-deficient islets. We assessed the discriminative performance of previously described type 1 diabetes diagnostic models, based on clinical features (age at diagnosis, BMI) and biomarker data [autoantibodies, type 1 diabetes genetic risk score (T1D-GRS)], and singular features for identifying type 1 diabetes by the area under the curve of the receiver operator characteristic (AUC-ROC). Diagnostic models validated well against histologically defined type 1 diabetes. The model combining clinical features, islet autoantibodies and T1D-GRS was strongly discriminative of type 1 diabetes, and performed better than clinical features alone (AUC-ROC 0.97 vs. 0.95; P = 0.03). Histological classification of type 1 diabetes was concordant with serum C-peptide [median < 17 pmol/l (limit of detection) vs. 1037 pmol/l in non-type 1 diabetes; P < 0.0001]. Our study provides robust histological evidence that a clinical diagnostic model, combining clinical features and biomarkers, could improve diabetes classification. Our study also provides reassurance that a C-peptide-based definition of type 1 diabetes is an appropriate surrogate outcome that can be used in large clinical studies where histological definition is impossible.

Considering the high number of expats from different ethnicity a more thorough approach is necessary. Unfortunately, there are very few studies addressing this issue. The study uses the chi-square test to investigate the dependence of the progression of DNP on ethnic origin. The study uses Pearson Correlation to find the association between three prevalent scales used for the measurement of painful diabetes peripheral neuropathy. Student t-test was used further to investigate the significance of the association. With a p-value (0.004) and p-value (0.015), the study concludes that DPN risk is dependent on the ethnic origin of the residents. The study further found that there is a significant association between three scales for measuring painful diabetes peripheral neuropathy (pDNP), Douleur Neuropathique en 4 questions (DN4), Neurological Symptoms Score (NSS), and Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANNS). The p-value for all pairwise comparisons for the strength of association between scales was found significant at the level of significance 0.05. The study concludes that the risk of DNP is high in Arab-origin residents in UAE and the reasons behind the finding need to be empirically tested to customize its management.

34987478,The Role of Mesenchymal Stromal Cells-Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles in Diabetes and Its Chronic Complications.,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are applied in regenerative medicine of several tissues and organs nowadays by virtue of their self-renewal capabilities, multiple differentiation capacity, potent immunomodulatory properties, and their ability to be favourably cultured and manipulated. With the continuous development of ""cell-free therapy"" research, MSC-derived small extracellular vesicles (MSC-sEVs) have increasingly become a research hotspot in the treatment of various diseases. Small extracellular vesicles (SEVs) are membrane vesicles with diameters of 30 to 150 nm that mediate signal transduction between adjacent or distal cells or organs by delivering non-coding RNA, protein, and DNA. The contents and effects of sEVs vary depending on the properties of the originating cell. In recent years, MSC-sEVs have been found to play an important role in the occurrence and development of diabetes mellitus as a new way of communication between cells. Diabetes mellitus is a common metabolic disease in clinic. Its complications of the heart, brain, kidney, eyes, and peripheral nerves are a serious threat to human health and has been a hot issue for clinicians. MSC-sEVs could be applied to repair or prevent damage from the complications of diabetes mellitus through anti-inflammatory effects, reduction of endoplasmic reticulum-related protein stress, polarization of M2 macrophages, and increasing autophagy. Therefore, we highly recommend that MSC-sEVs-based therapies to treat diabetes mellitus and its chronic complication be further explored. The analysis of the role and molecular mechanisms of MSC-sEVs in diabetes and its related complications will provide new idea and insights for the prevention and treatment of diabetes.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2021-,"Li FX, Lin X, Xu F, Shan SK, Guo B, Lei LM, Zheng MH, Wang Y, Xu QS, Yuan LQ",10,1742,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Regular users of analgesics included those using prescription analgesics ≥ 15 days per month at least 6 times over 2 years after the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (baseline). The effectiveness of analgesics in patients with diabetes was evaluated using metformin adherence and three models: model 1 was adjusted for age and sex; model 2 was further adjusted for body mass index (BMI), exercise, cholesterol, hypertension, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI); and model 3 was further adjusted for analgesics. Based on stringent extraction criteria, the sample had a cancer incidence of 4.6%. The hazard ratios of models 1 and 2 were 0.830 and 0.865, respectively. The adjusted hazard ratio for all variables, including acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen, was 0.871 (model 3). Regular use of analgesics by patients with diabetes decreased their risk of subsequent cancer development in this large national cohort. Compared with participants who did not develop cancer, those with cancer were older and more likely to be male, did not exercise, have more comorbidities (as assessed by CCI), and did not use analgesics regularly.",International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,2023-Feb,"Park IB, Seo HJ",2,1381,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

BMI trajectories were significantly associated with diabetes risk in older age (slowly increasing vs. stable: ARR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.54; rapidly increasing vs. stable: ARR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.25, 1.79). This association was strongest for normal-initial-BMI participants (slowly increasing: ARR = 1.34, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.88; rapidly increasing: ARR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.37, 3.11). Participants with a higher genetic liability to diabetes and a rapidly increasing BMI trajectory had the highest risk for diabetes (ARR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.67, 2.76). These findings confirmed that BMI is the leading risk factor for diabetes and that although the normal BMI group has the lowest incidence rate for diabetes, people with normal BMI are most sensitive to changes in BMI.",American journal of epidemiology,2024-May,"Luo Y, Liu Z, Luo J, Li R, Wei Z, Yang L, Li J, He L, Su Y, Peng X, Hu X",11,1398,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35331118,Diagnostic Dilemmas and Current Treatment Approaches in Latent Onset Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults: A Concise Review.,"Latent Onset Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA) is an autoimmune disorder between T1DM and T2DM and is often misdiagnosed as T2DM due to its late-onset. The disease is characterized by β-cell failure and slow progression to insulin dependence. Early diagnosis is significant in limiting disease progression. C-peptide levels and autoantibodies against β-cells are the most critical diagnostic biomarkers in LADA. The review aims to provide an overview of the biomarkers used to diagnose LADA, and the following treatment approaches. We have summarized LADA's pathophysiology and the autoantibodies involved in the condition, diagnostic approaches, and challenges. There are clear shortcomings concerning the feasibility of autoantibody testing. Finally, we have explored the treatment strategies involved in the management of LADA. In conclusion, the usual management includes treatment with metformin and the addition of low doses of insulin. Newer oral hypoglycaemic agents, such as GLP-1RA and DPP-4 inhibitors, have been brought into use. Since the disease is not entirely understood at the research level and in clinical practice, we hope to encourage further research in this field to assess its prevalence. Large randomized controlled trials are required to compare the efficacy of different available treatment options.",Current diabetes reviews,2023-,"Chandran L, Singh S A, Vellapandian C",3,1329,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35938768,A multi-faceted approach improves inpatient diabetes care at a tertiary hospital.,"The results of the National Diabetes Inpatient Audit in 2013 showed that the Royal London Hospital had performed worse than the national average in several domains. The aim of this study was to improve inpatient diabetes care at the Royal London Hospital. A multi-faceted intervention was designed via a Commission for Quality and Innovation workstream which spanned from April 2014 to March 2016. The National Diabetes Inpatient Audit results of 2013, 2016 and 2019 were compared to look at the outcomes and analyse the changes brought about by the intervention. There were statistically significant improvements in medication errors, prescription errors, glucose management errors and insulin errors in 2016 and 2019 as compared to 2013. More inpatients with diabetes were visited by the diabetes team, received foot assessment and patient feedback improved in both 2016 and 2019 as compared to 2013. A multi-faceted approach led to significant improvements in patient outcomes and experience, resulting in Royal London Hospital performing well above the national average in the National Diabetes Inpatient Audit in 2016 and 2019.

Data from the NHIS-HEALS cohort between 2002 and 2015 were longitudinally analyzed. Subjects were divided into three groups: metformin non-users with diabetes mellitus (DM), metformin users with DM, and no DM group. CRC was defined using the ICD-10 code (C18.0-C20.0) at the time of admission. Cox proportional hazard regression models were adopted after stepwise adjustment for confounders to investigate the association between metformin usage and colorectal cancer risk. During the follow-up period, of the total 323,430 participants, 2341 (1.33%) of the 175,495 males and 1204 (0.81%) of the 147,935 females were newly diagnosed with CRC. The estimated cumulative incidence of CRC was significantly different among the three groups based on Kaplan-Meier's survival curve (p values < 0.05 in both sexes). Compared with metformin non-users, hazard ratios (95% CIs) of metformin users and the no DM group were 0.66 (0.51-0.85) and 0.72 (0.61-0.85) in males and 0.59 (0.37-0.92) and 0.93 (0.66-1.29) in females, respectively, after being fully adjusted.

34913986,Diabetic kidney disease in children and adolescents: an update.,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), previously encountered predominantly in adult patients, is rapidly gaining center stage as a childhood morbidity and one that pediatric nephrologists are likely to encounter with increasing frequency. This is in large part due to the obesity epidemic and the consequent rise in type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, as well as the more aggressive diabetes phenotype in today's youth with more rapid β-cell decline and faster development and progression of diabetes-related complications along with lower responsiveness to the treatments used in adults. DKD, an end-organ complication of diabetes, is at the very least a marker of, and more likely a predisposing factor for, the development of adverse cardiovascular outcomes and premature mortality in children with diabetes. On an optimistic note, several new therapeutic approaches are now available for the management of diabetes in adults, such as GLP1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and DPP4 inhibitors, that have also been shown to have a favorable impact on cardiorenal outcomes. Also promising is the success of very low-energy diets in inducing remission of diabetes in adults. However, the addition of these pharmacological and dietary approaches to the management toolbox of diabetes and DKD in children and adolescents awaits thorough assessment of their safety and efficacy in this population. This review outlines the scope of diabetes and DKD, and new developments that may favorably impact the management of children and young adults with diabetes and DKD.","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2022-Nov,"Lopez LN, Wang W, Loomba L, Afkarian M, Butani L",5,1566,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39078862,A systematic review on the level of risk perception of diabetes mellitus: The role of environmental factor.,"Risk perception plays important role in motivating preventive health behaviours. The objective of this systematic review was to explore the level of diabetes risk perception among individuals with and without apparent risk for diabetes, and to consider the effect of environmental factors on the level of diabetes risk perception. This systematic review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The literature search was carried out through PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Original articles written in English and published between 2013 and 2023 were considered. Study quality was appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Narrative synthesis was undertaken due to methodological heterogeneity in the included studies. A total of 13 cross-sectional studies, two randomized controlled trials, two cohort studies, two mixed methods studies and one quasi-experiment with a control group were included. An overall low level of diabetes risk perception was reported particularly in those without apparent risk for diabetes. The 20 included studies reported widely varied measures for calculating diabetes risk perception. The influence of environmental factors on the risk perception of diabetes was highlighted. The use of study-specific and non-validated measures in the included studies weakens the authors' ability to compare across studies. The role of language and publication bias within this systematic review should be acknowledged as we included only English-language studies published in peer-reviewed journals. Another limitation is the exclusion of dimensions of risk perception such as optimistic bias as search terms. The overall low risk perception of diabetes calls for urgent need of public health interventions to increase the risk perception of diabetes. In the future, researchers should ensure the validity and reliability of the measures being used. The influence of environmental factors on the diabetes risk perception indicates that diabetes preventive interventions targeting environmental factors may be effective in increasing the risk perception of diabetes.",PloS one,2024-,"Jane Ling MY, Ahmad N, Noor Aizuddin A, Ja'afar MH",4,2163,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
36372965,Understanding the planning and preparation for diabetes self-management of grey nomads when travelling in rural and remote Australia: An exploratory survey.,"Many older Australians with chronic health conditions, including diabetes, are taking to the road in a recreational vehicle following retirement and are colloquially known as grey nomads. This exploratory online survey aimed to ascertain the issues on the road for grey nomads with diabetes and their experiences of self-management of their diabetes whilst in rural and remote regions of Australia. Following ethical approval and piloting, an online survey was distributed through social media sites used by grey nomads and those with diabetes. From the closed and open-ended responses from travelers with diabetes in rural and remote areas, the demographics of this cohort were explored, as well as their self-management of diabetes. A total of 103 grey nomads with diabetes responded and 81 completed all survey questions. There was wide variation in the respondents' answers in regard to their self-management including their preparation for travel; their knowledge of diabetes and accessing health-care services; their management of illness; and their experiences whilst travelling including the effects of COVID-19. It was identified that there was a need for an increase in preparation prior to travel, and several important checks were identified for this planning specific to rural and remote areas of Australia, including the expectations of health services in these regions. A pretravel checklist for travellers with diabetes is recommended to contribute to better self-management of grey nomads with diabetes on the road in order to alleviate the issues identified.",Australasian journal on ageing,2023-Jun,"De Bellis A, McCloud C, Abigail W, Hill P, Giles J, Apolloni M, Gregoric C",7,1576,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35041752,A Clinical Update on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) traditionally refers to abnormal glucose tolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. GDM has long been associated with obstetric and neonatal complications primarily relating to higher infant birthweight and is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for future maternal and offspring cardiometabolic disease. The prevalence of GDM continues to rise internationally due to epidemiological factors including the increase in background rates of obesity in women of reproductive age and rising maternal age and the implementation of the revised International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups' criteria and diagnostic procedures for GDM. The current lack of international consensus for the diagnosis of GDM reflects its complex historical evolution and pragmatic antenatal resource considerations given GDM is now 1 of the most common complications of pregnancy. Regardless, the contemporary clinical approach to GDM should be informed not only by its short-term complications but also by its longer term prognosis. Recent data demonstrate the effect of early in utero exposure to maternal hyperglycemia, with evidence for fetal overgrowth present prior to the traditional diagnosis of GDM from 24 weeks' gestation, as well as the durable adverse impact of maternal hyperglycemia on child and adolescent metabolism. The major contribution of GDM to the global epidemic of intergenerational cardiometabolic disease highlights the importance of identifying GDM as an early risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, broadening the prevailing clinical approach to address longer term maternal and offspring complications following a diagnosis of GDM.",Endocrine reviews,2022-Sep,"Sweeting A, Wong J, Murphy HR, Ross GP",4,1735,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Although exercise is beneficial in diabetes, previous studies have showed contradictory and inconclusive results on how it effects DR. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In this before-after clinical trial, 40 patients with diabetic retinopathy were enrolled by convenient sampling method in Shahid Labbafinejad Hospital in Tehran during 2021-2022. Before the intervention, central macular thickness (CMT, microns) measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fasting blood sugar (FBS, mg/dl) were obtained. Then, patients took part in a 12-week moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (3 sessions per week, each session 45 min). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 26.0. Out of 40 examined patients, 21 (52.5 %) were male and 19 (47.5 %) were female. The mean age of the patients was 50.8 years. The mean rank of FBS (mg/dl) significantly decreased from 21.12 before the exercise to 8.75 after the exercise (p < 0.001). Also, the mean rank of CMT (microns) showed a significant decrease from 21.11 before the intervention to 16.20 after the exercise (p < 0.001). There was a significant positive correlation between patients' age and FBS (mg/dl) before (rho = 0.457, p = 0.003) and after (rho = 0.365, p = 0.021) the intervention. Also, a significant positive correlation was found between patients' age and CMT (microns) before (rho = 0.525, p = 0.001) and after (rho = 0.461, p = 0.003) moderate exercise. Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise leads to lower FBS (mg/dl) and CMT (microns) in patients with diabetic retinopathy, so it may be beneficial for diabetic patients to avoid sedentary lifestyle.",Microvascular research,2023-Sep,"Soleimani A, Soltani P, Karimi H, Mirzaei M, Esfahanian F, Yavari M, Esfahani MP",7,1850,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39375857,Individualized treatment of diabetes mellitus in older adults.,"The population of older adults with diabetes mellitus is growing but heterogeneous. Because geriatric syndromes, comorbidity or multimorbidity, the complexity of glucose dynamics, and socioeconomic conditions are associated with the risk of severe hypoglycemia and mortality, these factors should be considered in individualized diabetes treatment. Because cognitive impairment and frailty have similar etiologies and risk factors, a common strategy can be implemented to address them through optimal glycemic control, management of vascular risk factors, diet, exercise, social participation, and support. To prevent frailty or sarcopenia, optimal energy intake, adequate protein and vitamin intake, and resistance or multi-component exercise are recommended. For hypoglycemic drug therapy, it is important to reduce hypoglycemia, to use sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, taking into account the benefits for cardiovascular disease and the risk of adverse effects, and to simplify treatment to address poor adherence. Glycemic control goals for older adults with diabetes should be set according to three categories, based on cognitive function and activities of daily living, using the Dementia Assessment Sheet for Community-based Integrated Care System 8-items. This categorization can be used to determine treatment strategies for diabetes when combined with the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA). Based on the CGA, frailty prevention, treatment simplification, and social participation or services should be implemented for patients in Category II and above. Measures against hypoglycemia and for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease should also be promoted. Treatment based on categorization and CGA by multidisciplinary professionals would be an individualized treatment for older adults with diabetes.

A total of 1428 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients screened in 2017 were analyzed in a retrospective study. Retinal photographs were reviewed by an ophthalmologist for the presence and stage of DR, as well as for additional nondiabetic findings. The following grading categories of DR were used: without DR, mild non-proliferative DR (NPDR), moderate NPDR, severe non-proliferative NPDR, proliferative DR (PDR), clinically significant macular edema (CSME) and ungradable finding. Severe NPDR, PDR and CSME were classified as vision-threatening DR. Out of 1428 DM patients, 27 were diagnosed with type 1 DM and 1401 with type 2 DM, 353 of them had newly diagnosed type 2 DM. Without DR category was recorded in 85.2% of all eyes screened, 2.8% were ungradable, and 12% showed varying stages of DR. Vision-threatening DR was found in 2.8% and additional nondiabetic findings in 5.2% of all screened eyes. In the group of newly diagnosed type 2 DM, 92.5% of screened eyes were without DR, 3.1% were ungradable and 4.3% showed varying stages of DR.

The use of new antidiabetic medications in the prevention and treatment of diabetic kidney disease is a growing area of research interest. We sought to characterize the risk of developing a composite kidney outcome among patients receiving a new antidiabetic medication of the SGLT-2i, GLP-1ra, and DPP-4i drug classes. We conducted a systematic literature search in MEDLINE to identify randomized trials observing kidney safety endpoints associated with the use of new antidiabetic medications. Two independent reviewers selected the 7 eligible studies for analysis. Included studies were published between January 2013 and March 2020, conducted with adult participantss, published full-text in English, and observed composite kidney outcomes. A network meta-analysis was conducted within a Bayesian framework using a fixed-effects model with uninformative priors. A qualitative assessment of transitivity was conducted to ensure similar distribution of potential modifiers across studies. Included studies were generally comparable in mean age, glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and mean duration of T2DM at baseline. Compared with placebo, dapagliflozin was associated with the greatest reduction in risk of developing the composite kidney outcome (hazard ratio 0.53; 95% credible interval, 0.43-0.66) followed by empagliflozin, canagliflozin, semaglutide, and liraglutide. Linagliptin did not show a significant reduction in risk of the outcome. This analysis was limited by the scarcity of data for kidney safety endpoints in large, randomized clinical trials.

36197636,Progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes mellitus induced by overnutrition.,"Prediabetes has developed into a global pandemic, its prevalence increasing year by year. Although lifestyle changes are advocated as the basis for prediabetes treatment, some patients fail to choose or adhere to appropriate interventions. The basis for selecting an appropriate intervention is determining the stage and cause of the disease. In this review, we aimed to examine the various types and disease processes of prediabetes caused by overnutrition, the present review supporting the hypothesis that overnutrition-induced hyperinsulinemia precedes insulin resistance (IR) and independently causes β-cell dysfunction. Tissue insulin resistance is the main feature of prediabetes with the crosstalk between tissues promoting the formation of systemic insulin resistance. Finally, both β-cell dysfunction induced by hyperinsulinemia or IR and reduced β-cell mass can lead to abnormal insulin secretion and contribute to development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Hence, overnutrition can cause multiple prediabetes phenotypes resulting in development of T2DM through different trajectories. Future diagnosis and treatment should therefore more carefully consider the disease phenotype and stage of development in patients with prediabetes to reduce the incidence of T2DM.","Hormones (Athens, Greece)",2022-Dec,"Zhang Y, Shen T, Wang S",3,1282,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We assessed the diagnostic performance of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA<sub>1c</sub> as alternatives to oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)-derived 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG) using sensitivity and specificity in 263 kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) from a clinical trial. Between visits at 6, 12, and 24 months after transplantation, 28%-31% of patients switched glycemic category (normal glucose tolerance [NGT], IGT/IFG, PTDM). Correlations of FPG and HbA<sub>1c</sub> against 2hPG were lower at 6 months (r = 0.59 [FPG against 2hPG]; r = 0.45 [HbA<sub>1c</sub> against 2hPG]) vs. 24 months (r = 0.73 [FPG against 2hPG]; r = 0.74 [HbA<sub>1c</sub> against 2hPG]). Up to 69% of 2hPG-defined PTDM cases were missed by conventional HbA<sub>1c</sub> and FPG thresholds. For prediabetes, concordance of FPG and HbA<sub>1c</sub> with 2hPG ranged from 6%-9%. In conclusion, in our well-defined randomized trial cohort, one-third of KTRs switched glycemic category over 2 years and although the correlations of FPG and HbA<sub>1c</sub> with 2hPG improved with time, their diagnostic concordance was poor for PTDM and, especially, prediabetes.

36872136,Reducing Sitting Time in Type 1 Diabetes: Considerations and Implications.,"Sedentary behaviours are ubiquitous in modern society, with Western populations spending approximately 50% of their waking hours in low levels of energy expenditure. This behaviour is associated with cardiometabolic derangements and increased morbidity and mortality. In individuals living with or at risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), ""breaking up"" sedentariness by interrupting prolonged periods of sitting has been shown to acutely improve glucose management and cardiometabolic risk factors related to diabetes complications. As such, current guidelines recommend interrupting prolonged periods of sitting with short, frequent activity breaks. However, the evidence underpinning these recommendations remains preliminary and is focussed on those with or at risk of developing T2D, with little information regarding whether and how reducing sedentariness may be effective and safe in those living with type 1 diabetes (T1D).

It remains unknown, however, whether and how multiple diabetes complications co-occur with cognitive dysfunction, particularly in youth-onset diabetes. Using data from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study cohort, a prospective longitudinal cohort, we examined clustering of complications and their underlying clinical factors with performance on cognitive tests in young adults with youth-onset T1D or T2D. Cognition was assessed via the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery. The main cognitive variables were age-corrected scores for composite fluid cognition and associated cognitive subdomains. Diabetes complications included retinopathy, microalbuminuria, and peripheral neuropathy (PN). Lipids, systolic blood pressure (SBP), hemoglobin A1c, and other clinical factors were included in the analyses. Clustering was applied separately to each group (T1D=646; T2D=165). A three-cluster(C) solution was identified for each diabetes type. Mean values and frequencies of all factors were compared between resulting clusters. The average age-corrected score for composite fluid cognition differed significantly across clusters for each group (p<0.001). People with T1D and the lowest average fluid cognition scores had the highest frequency of self-reporting at least one episode of hypoglycemia in the year preceding cognitive testing and the highest prevalence of PN. Persons with T2D and the lowest average fluid cognition scores had the highest SBP, the highest central systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and highest prevalence of PN. These findings highlight shared (PN) and unique factors (hypoglycemia in T1D; SBP in T2D) that could be targeted to potentially mitigate cognitive issues in young people with youth-onset diabetes.",Pediatric diabetes,2023-,"Shapiro ALB, Bellatorre A, Dabelea D, Stafford JM, D'Agostino R, Shah AS, Urbina EM, Barrett CE, Pihoker C, Marcovina S, Liese AD, Mottl AK, Jensen ET, Wilkening G",14,1862,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
35201556,The Impact of Diet on Bone and Fracture Risk in Diabetes.,"The purpose of this review is to summarize the recently published scientific evidence on the effects of diet on diabetes and skeletal health. The impact of diet on overall health has been a growing topic of interest among researchers. An inappropriate eating habit is a relatively modified risk factor for diabetes in adults. Parallel with the significant increase in the incidence of diabetes mellitus worldwide, many studies have shown the benefits of lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise for people with, or at risk of developing, diabetes. In the last years, accumulating evidence suggests that diabetes is a risk factor for bone fragility. As lifestyle intervention represents an effective option for diabetes management and treatment, there is potential for an effect on bone health. Healthy lifestyle is critical to prevent bone fragility. However, more studies are needed to fully understand the impact of diet and weight loss on fracture risk in diabetics.",Current osteoporosis reports,2022-Feb,"Faraj M, Napoli N",2,981,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
31584372,A Molecular Approach on the Protective Effects of Mangiferin Against Diabetes and Diabetes-related Complications.,"Diabetes and its related complications are now a global health problem without an effective therapeutic approach. There are many herbal medicines which have attracted much attention as potential therapeutic agents in the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications due to their multiple targets. The aim of this study is to review available knowledge of mangiferin focusing on its mode of action. Mangiferin was extensively reviewed for its antidiabetic activity using online database like Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar as well as some offline textbooks. A critical discussion based on the mechanism of action and the future perspectives is also given in the present manuscript. Mangiferin is a natural C-glucoside and mainly obtained from its primary source, the leaves of mango tree (Mangifera indica L.). Therapeutic and preventive properties of mangiferin include antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antiallergic, neuroprotective, and cognition-enhancing effects. It dissolves well in water, so it can be easily extracted into infusions and decoctions and hence, a number of researches have been made on the therapeutic effect of this molecule. Recently, mangiferin has been proved to be an effective remedy in diabetes and diabetes-related complications. It is a beneficial natural compound for type 2 diabetes mellitus as it improves insulin sensitivity, modulates lipid profile and reverts adipokine levels to normal. This study concludes that mangiferin has the potential to treat diabetes and it can be developed as a therapeutic agent for diabetes and the complications caused by diabetes.",Current diabetes reviews,2020-,"Aswal S, Kumar A, Chauhan A, Semwal RB, Kumar A, Semwal DK",6,1624,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The intervention group included patients with diabetes who participated in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) testing during their initial dental screening appointment. The participants whose HbA1c value was ≤ 9.0% were expedited into the scheduling queue for the next comprehensive examination appointment. Health literacy was assessed regarding patients' understanding of the connection between oral health and diabetes. The mean number of days between screening and treatment plan development was decreased by 38.4%. Of the participants in the intervention group with an HbA1c value ≤ 9.0%, 44% rated their understanding of the connection between diabetes and gum disease as ""poor"", whereas 86% of the patients who were ineligible due to an HbA1c value ≥ 9.1% rated their understanding as ""very good"" or ""excellent"". Patients with diabetes will continue to benefit from this quality improvement project to minimize barriers to dental care and improve overall health outcomes as this intervention is adopted as a permanent practice change. The need has been highlighted for comprehensive education in practice settings concerning medical and dental collaboration, and patient awareness of the interrelationship between diabetes mellitus and oral disease. An increase in oral examinations, assessment of routine oral health behaviors, and referral to dental providers from the primary care setting is warranted.",Journal of dental education,2022-Oct,"Baxter M, Hardin-Fanning F, Witt C",3,1644,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Exercise is being increasingly recommended as part of the therapeutic regimen for DM but the management of different forms of physical activity is difficult for individuals with diabetes, trainers, and physicians. Regular exercise can improve health and well-being, helping individuals to achieve their target lipid profile, body composition, cardio-respiratory fitness, and glycemic goals. People with diabetes tend to be as inactive as the general population, with a large percentage of individuals not achieving the minimum amount of recommended physical activity levels. Indeed, several barriers to exercise exist for persons with diabetes, including sports eligibility, multi-modality management of diabetic athletes, and inadequate knowledge about adequate type and intensity of exercise. The aim of the present review is to provide the current understanding of mechanisms, recommendations, and beneficial effects of different modalities of exercise for the treatment of DM.",Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology,2022-Sep,"Palermi S, Iacono O, Sirico F, Modestino M, Ruosi C, Spera R, De Luca M",7,1076,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38863921,"Prevailing Food Intake, Physical Activity and Health Beliefs in a Rural Agricultural Community in the Philippines: Factors to Consider Prior to a Diabetes Prevention Program.","A diabetes prevention program is being proposed in the rural agricultural town of San Juan, Batangas, Philippines. This study aims to determine the prevailing level of food intake, physical activity, and health beliefs prior to any intervention. Adults were recruited via random sampling with proportional allocation. Interviews were done to determine food intake and physical activity. Small group discussions were held to determine prevailing health beliefs. The average energy intake (1,547 kcal/d) is only 72% of the recommended values for Filipinos. Only 12% of the respondents achieved the recommended energy intake. Carbohydrates comprise a large part (71%) of calorie intake. A majority (91%) already have moderate to high levels of physical activity. There are prevailing health beliefs that need to be considered when dietary modifications and physical activity interventions are to be done. Internationally recommended diabetes prevention interventions such as reducing calorie intake and increasing physical activity may not be directly applicable here. We recommend that the features of a diabetes prevention program for this locale must include the following: 1) introduction of affordable plant sources of proteins; 2) decreasing the proportion of rice as a source of carbohydrates in the diet; 3) maintaining the level of physical activity; and 4) being sensitive to the prevailing health beliefs.",Journal of the ASEAN Federation of Endocrine Societies,2024-,"Sandoval MA, Paz-Pacheco E, Cañete E, Patal P, Cating-Cabral MT, Lantion-Ang FL, Paterno E, Juban N, Jimeno C",9,1413,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The prevalence and pattern of delayed diagnosis of DM were defined using the Thai Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for Diabetes, 2017, and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2017. The cut-off time for FPG level confirmation of 3 months was used to evaluate delayed diagnoses and associated factors. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify variables associated with delayed diagnoses. <b>Results:</b> Of 260 participants, 96.9% and 85.4% had delayed diagnoses as defined by the Thai CPG and the ADA, respectively. Factors significantly associated with delayed diagnosis were hypertension, non-cash insurance, and >10 years of physician experience. <b>Conclusion:</b> Undiagnosed diabetes and diagnosis delay should be a concern in tertiary settings. Senior physicians should focus on patients with higher FPG levels, particularly those who have hypertension, and use non-cash insurance schemes.",International journal of public health,2022-,"Dulyapach K, Ngamchaliew P, Vichitkunakorn P, Sornsenee P, Choomalee K",5,1273,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
38486325,Screening for Coronary Artery Disease in Asymptomatic Pilots with Diabetes Mellitus.,"<b>INTRODUCTION:</b> Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a cause of death in 75% of patients with diabetes. Its often asymptomatic nature delays diagnosis. In aeronautics, it can cause in-flight incapacitation, beyond which it represents a major fear for the medical expert. Screening for CAD is still a topical subject with the advent of new cardiovascular (CV) risk biomarkers and more effective screening tests. We report the experience of the Aeromedical Expertise Center of Rabat in this screening of diabetic pilots, with a recommendations review.<b>METHODS:</b> A prospective study over 1 yr included diabetic pilots who benefited from systematic screening for CAD after a CV risk stratification. Coronary angiography is performed if a screening test is positive. Subsequent follow-up is carried out in consultation with the attending physician with regular evaluation in our center.<b>RESULTS:</b> There were 38 pilots included in our study. The average age was 55 ± 4.19 yr and about 73% had a high CV risk. CAD was detected in 4 cases (10.52%) who had abnormal resting electrocardiograms and required revascularization with the placement of active stents. Approximately 75% of pilots with CAD returned to fly through a waiver with restrictions.<b>DISCUSSION:</b> Screening for coronary disease in diabetics is controversial, and current recommendations are not unanimous. In our study, the screening did not identify coronary diabetic pilots who could benefit from bypass surgery. Nevertheless, coronary disease was diagnosed, justifying grounding to preserve flight safety, which is an absolute priority in aviation medicine.<b>Zerrik M, Moumen A, El Ghazi M, Smiress FB, Iloughmane Z, El M'hadi C, Chemsi M. <i>Screening for coronary artery disease in asymptomatic pilot with diabetes mellitus</i>.

The systematic review follow the protocol registered in Prospero (CRD42020182899). Two authors independently searched the PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. Discrepancies were resolved by a third author. The review included observational studies investigating the relationship between CAN and DPN in individuals with DM. Initially, out of 1165 studies, only 16 were selected, with 42.8 % involving volunteers with one type of diabetes, 14.3 % with both types of diabetes and 14.3 % not specify the type. The total number of volunteers was 2582, mostly with type 2 DM. It was analyzed that there is a relationship between CAN and DPN. It was observed that more severe levels of DPN are associated with worse outcomes in autonomic tests. Some studies suggested that the techniques for evaluating DPN might serve as risk factors for CAN.

A total of 11,103 people of either sex older than 60 years were enrolled from 17 districts of Shanghai. The EQ-5D-3L was used to assess the HRQoL of older people. The Wilcoxon rank sum test and t-test were used to compare the difference in HRQoL between people with or without diabetes. After univariate regression, multiple linear regression and ordinal logistic regression were conducted to evaluate the influence of diabetes mellitus and other confounding variables on the EQ VAS scores and on the five dimensions of the EQ-5D. Twelve percent of all participants had diabetes mellitus, and the proportion was almost the same between men and women. The EQ VAS scores of people with diabetes mellitus were approximately 3.70 points lower than those of people without diabetes (95% CI = -4.40,  -2.99, p < 0.001) after adjusting for confounding variables. People with diabetes mellitus had increased problems with mobility (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.33, 1.85), self-care (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.35, 2.01), usual activities (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.51, 2.11), pain/discomfort (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.24, 1.64), and anxiety/depression (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.07, 1.64).

39213491,"Etiopathogenesis and Management of Prameha Poorvaroopa (Prediabetes), Prameha and Madhumeha (Diabetes Mellitus): An Ancient Perspective.","Prameha was identified in 1552 BCE as a Maharoga (major disease), one of the eight grave diseases of Ancient medical history. Initial days of recognition labeled Prameha as a rich man's disease, as found prevalent among people of higher socio-economic background. This fact was thereby linked with the diagnosis of diabetes and the invention of iron in the Iron Age, as wealthy part of the population who initiated consumption of newly harvested rice and wheat were found majorly diagnosed. Gradually, with the knowledge sought from Rigveda, Atharvaveda, Ayurveda, and Samhitas, the causes and types were identified, and further search conducted in Ayurveda resulted in denominating Prameha based on the body constitution and predominant dosha with its etiology in lifestyle and dietary factors, which, in the current scenario is known as diabetes mellitus. The objective of the current review is to find out and collate the information sought from published ancient literature on the origin and classification of Prameha with etiological factors. Articles published between 1982 and 2021 in scientific domain was searched using several keywords in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Google, to find treatment approaches adopted by ancient medics to manage Prameha, Madhumeha, and Prameha Poorvaroopa. Classical literature was reviewed to understand the traditional approaches applied in the context of scientific interpretations. Content of this scriptural review was derived mainly from Rigveda, Atharvaveda, Ayurveda, Sushrutha Samhita, Charaka Samhita, Bhela Samhita, Harita Samhita, and Papillad Samhita.

34784864,An Insight into the Polymeric Nanoparticles Applications in Diabetes Diagnosis and Treatment.,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a type of chronic metabolic disease that has affected millions of people worldwide and is known with a defect in the amount of insulin secretion, insulin functions, or both. This deficiency leads to an increase in the amounts of glucose, which could be accompanied by long-term damages to other organs such as eyes, kidneys, heart, and nervous system. Thus, introducing an appropriate approach for diagnosis and treatment of different types of DM is the aim of several researches. By the emergence of nanotechnology and its application in medicine, new approaches were presented for these purposes. The object of this review article is to introduce different types of polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs), as one of the most important classes of nanoparticles, for diabetic management. To achieve this goal, at first, some of the conventional therapeutic and diagnostic methods of DM will be reviewed. Then, different types of PNPs, in two forms of natural and synthetic polymers with different properties, as a new method for DM treatment and diagnosis will be introduced. In the next section, the transport mechanisms of these types of nano-carriers across the epithelium, via paracellular and transcellular pathways will be explained. Finally, the clinical use of PNPs in the treatment and diagnosis of DM will be summarized. Based on the results of this literature review, PNPs could be considered one of the most promising methods for DM management.",Mini reviews in medicinal chemistry,2023-,"Dehghani P, Rad ME, Zarepour A, Sivakumar PM, Zarrabi A",5,1474,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

A random sample from the Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II cohort (n = 360) was invited to participate. Knowledge was assessed using 10 multiple-choice questions covering how diabetes affects the eyes, frequency of ophthalmic screening, risk factors, prevention, available treatments, and prognosis. DR was assessed from fundus photographs. Multiple linear regression was used to identify independent associates of the knowledge score (KS). We included 264 participants (mean ± SD age 72.1 ± 9.2 years, 56.8% male, median [IQR] diabetes duration 15.4 [11.1-22.3] years). The mean ± SD KS out of 10 was 5.3 ± 1.8. Most (67%) participants knew diabetes can affect the eye and lead to blindness. Only 13.6% knew that DR screening intervals depend on risk factors. Those with moderate non-proliferative DR (NPDR) or worse had a better knowledge score (B = 1.37,P = 0.008) after adjusting for age (B = -0.03, P = 0.004) and education beyond primary school (B = 1.75, P < 0.001).

Furthermore, impaired metabolism of glycoprotein components plays the main role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of glycoprotein levels in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. All relevant papers in the English language were compiled by searching electronic databases, including Scopus, PubMed and Cochrane library. The keywords of glycoprotein, diabetes mellitus, glycan, glycosylation, and inhibitor were searched until January 2019. Glycoproteins are pivotal elements in the regulation of cell proliferation, growth, maturation and signaling pathways. Moreover, they are involved in drug binding, drug transportation, efflux of chemicals and stability of therapeutic proteins. These functions, structure, composition, linkages, biosynthesis, significance and biological effects are discussed as related to their use as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its complications. The findings revealed several chemical and natural compounds have significant beneficial effects on glycoprotein metabolism.

Hence, to quantify and compare the attributable burden of key modifiable risk factors associated with increased Blood Glucose (BG) among Indian states and districts. The study used the National Family Health Survey (2015-16) data to estimate Population Attributable Risk (PAR) for increased BG (>140 mg/dl) among men aged 15-54 years in 640 districts of 36 States/Union Territories (UTs), India. We have considered three key modifiable factors such as high Body Mass Index (BMI), use of tobacco and alcohol. Population Attributable Risk techniques were employed to address the attributable burden of increased blood glucose due to modifiable risk factors. Substantial variations were found in the burden of increased BG due to high BMI, alcohol and tobacco use in India. The overall burden of increased BG due to high BMI, tobacco and alcohol in India was 28.5%, 2.1% and 6.4%, respectively. Regional variations in BG were found in high BMI, tobacco and alcohol consumption groups. The high burden of increased BG related to the above key modifiable risk factors mostly seen in North-Eastern' districts due to alcohol, Southern and Northern' districts was due to high BMI. However, the higher burden due to tobacco was reported in Central, Eastern and North-Eastern' districts. Three modifiable risk factors are contributing significantly to increased BG among men. Since there are regional differences in their contributions, state/district, specific targeted interventions may be necessary to control increased BG among men in India.",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,2021-,"Biradar RA, Singh DP, Prasad JB",3,1618,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Health check-up participants who underwent 3 sequential health examinations during 2012-2016 and were followed up from 2017 to 2021 were enrolled and categorized into two subcohorts: (a) progression from normoglycaemia to prediabetes subcohort (n = 9373) and (b) progression from prediabetes to diabetes subcohort (n = 4563). Cumulative TyG (cumTyG) and TyG variability from Exams 1-3 were the exposures of interest in our study. The outcomes were newly incident prediabetes or diabetes. In the prediabetes development subcohort, 2,074 participants developed prediabetes over a 2.42-year follow-up. Higher cumTyG (HR, 2.02; 95 % CI, 1.70-2.41), but not greater TyG variability alone, was significantly associated with increased prediabetes risk. In the diabetes development subcohort, 379 participants developed diabetes over a 3.0-year follow-up. Higher cumTyG (HR, 3.54; 95 % CI, 2.29-5.46), but not greater TyG variability alone, was significantly associated with increased diabetes risk. The ""cumTyG+variability"" combination had the highest predictive value for prediabetes and diabetes beyond a single baseline TyG measurement. Higher cumTyG exposure independently predicts prediabetes and diabetes incidence.

39000583,Associations between Diabetes Mellitus and Selected Cancers.,"Cancer is one of the major causes of mortality and is the second leading cause of death. Diabetes mellitus is a serious and growing problem worldwide, and its prevalence continues to grow; it is the 12th leading cause of death. An association between diabetes mellitus and cancer has been suggested for more than 100 years. Diabetes is a common disease diagnosed among patients with cancer, and evidence indicates that approximately 8-18% of patients with cancer have diabetes, with investigations suggesting an association between diabetes and some particular cancers, increasing the risk for developing cancers such as pancreatic, liver, colon, breast, stomach, and a few others. Breast and colorectal cancers have increased from 20% to 30% and there is a 97% increased risk of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma or endometrial cancer. On the other hand, a number of cancers and cancer therapies increase the risk of diabetes mellitus. Complications due to diabetes in patients with cancer may influence the choice of cancer therapy. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of the associations between diabetes mellitus and cancer are still unknown. The aim of this review is to summarize the association of diabetes mellitus with selected cancers and update the evidence on the underlying mechanisms of this association.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024-Jul,"Pliszka M, Szablewski L",2,1310,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Considering the 10.5 % global prevalence of diabetes coupled with the numbers of Muslims performing the Hajj, ∼ 1.8 million in 2023, it is estimated that Muslims with diabetes performing Hajj may exceed 340,000 this year. During Hajj the pattern and amount of their meal, fluid intake and physical activity are markedly altered. Many people with diabetes insist on doing the Hajj duty, thereby creating a medical challenge for themselves and their health care providers. It is therefore important that medical professionals be aware of the potential risks that may be associated with Hajj. People with diabetes may face many health hazards during Hajj including but not limited to the killer triad which might occur during Hajj: Hypoglycemia, Foot injury and Infections.

Although this has improved cancer care but so has the increase in the incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) including endocrinopathies. ICI-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) is a rare irAE with an approximate incidence of 1%. Due to paucity of data in literature about ICI-induced DM, we conducted a study to report the incidence and characteristics of new onset and worsening of DM in patients treated with ICIs. We conducted a retrospective review of patients who received ICIs during 10-year period. We identified patients with newly diagnosed DM and worsening of preexisting DM. Among 2,477 patients who received one or multiple ICIs, 14 patients developed new onset DM and 11 patients experienced worsening of pre-existing DM. Median time to new onset or worsening DM from ICI treatment initiation was ∼ 12 weeks. Median hemoglobin A1c was 6.2% at baseline and 8.5% at the onset of ICI-induced DM. Seven patients presented with diabetes ketoacidosis (DKA), all in the new onset group. (p = 0.02) No significant difference was observed between two groups regarding personal history of autoimmune disorder or family history of DM. (p greater than 0.05) Positive autoantibodies were found in three patients [two with Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GAD65) antibodies and one with insulin autoantibodies (IAA)].

33279099,Psychobiology of Appetite and Food Reward in Adults with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes: Is there a Role for Exercise?,"Hyperglycemia is the defining feature of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and results from deficient insulin production, impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake or both. It is now well established that hyperglycemia results in profound metabolic complications, but the effect of diabetes and its associated metabolic effects on homeostatic and hedonic appetite control has received less attention. Inappropriate food choices and excess food intake might promote weight gain, further exacerbating the metabolic consequences of T1D and T2D. The need to control blood glucose through diet, physical activity and/or medication as a consequence of impaired insulin secretion and/or sensitivity adds a further level of physiological and behavioural complexity to the processes underlying food choice and appetite control. Alterations in appetite-related processes have been noted in people with T2D, but the effect of T1D on appetite is largely unexplored. Peripheral neuroendocrine signalling appears disrupted in people with T2D, and brain regions involved in the central modulation of appetite might display central insulin resistance. However, it is difficult to isolate the consequences of T2D from those of obesity. Health-care policy advocates the use of physical activity as a means of preventing and treating T2D via the promotion of weight loss and its independent influence on insulin sensitivity. Exercise-induced perturbations to energy balance can elicit biological and behavioural compensation that attenuates weight loss, and diabetes pathophysiology might alter the strength of such compensation. However, the effect of exercise on appetite in people living with diabetes has yet to be fully explored.",Canadian journal of diabetes,2020-Dec,"Hopkins M, Beaulieu K, Finlayson G",3,1730,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Until now, little is known about the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in gastroenterology inpatients. To improve detection of undiagnosed diabetes, a routine screening procedure for gastroenterology inpatients, based on hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) measurement, was established. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the implemented diabetes screening. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed according to the guideline of the German Diabetes Association in patients with an HbA<sub>1c</sub> of ≥6.5% anld/or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥126 mg/dL. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for undiagnosed diabetes. Within a 3-month period, 606 patients were eligible for a diabetes screening. Pre-existing diabetes was documented in 120 patients (19.8 %), undiagnosed diabetes was found in 24 (3.9%), and 162 patients (26.7%) met the definition for prediabetes. Steroid medication use, age, and liver cirrhosis due to primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) were identified as risk factors for undiagnosed diabetes. The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in gastroenterology inpatients is markedly elevated in comparison to the general population, and a substantial number of inpatients are in a prediabetic status, underlining the need for diabetes screening. In addition to previously described risk factors of patient age and steroid medication use, we identified PSC-related liver cirrhosis (but not liver cirrhosis due to another etiology) as an independent risk factor for undiagnosed diabetes.",Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie,2022-Sep,"Fründt T, Schröder N, Hölzemer A, Pinnschmidt H, de Heer J, Behrends BC, Renne T, Lautenbach A, Lohse AW, Schrader J",10,1818,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01
39170741,Polyunsaturated fatty acids and diabetic microvascular complications: a Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational studies and clinical trials have implicated polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in potentially safeguarding against diabetic microvascular complication. Nonetheless, the causal nature of these relationships remains ambiguous due to conflicting findings across studies. This research employs Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the causal impact of PUFAs on diabetic microvascular complications. We identified instrumental variables for PUFAs, specifically omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, using the UK Biobank data. Outcome data regarding diabetic microvascular complications were sourced from the FinnGen Study. Our analysis covered microvascular outcomes in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, namely diabetic neuropathy (DN), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). An inverse MR analysis was conducted to examine the effect of diabetic microvascular complications on PUFAs. Sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the robustness of the results. Finally, a multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis was conducted to determine whether PUFAs have a direct influence on diabetic microvascular complications. The study indicates that elevated levels of genetically predicted omega-6 fatty acids substantially reduce the risk of DN in type 2 diabetes (odds ratio (OR): 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.47-0.82, <i>p</i> = 0.001). A protective effect against DR in type 2 diabetes is also suggested (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.62-0.92, <i>p</i> = 0.005). MVMR analysis confirmed the stability of these results after adjusting for potential confounding factors. No significant effects of omega-6 fatty acids were observed on DKD in type 2 diabetes or on any complications in type 1 diabetes. By contrast, omega-3 fatty acids showed no significant causal links with any of the diabetic microvascular complications assessed. Our MR analysis reveals a causal link between omega-6 fatty acids and certain diabetic microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes, potentially providing novel insights for further mechanistic and clinical investigations into diabetic microvascular complications.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2024-,"Liu B, Liu R, Gu Y, Shen X, Zhou J, Luo C",6,2118,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Devastating macrovascular complications (cardiovascular disease) and microvascular complications (such as diabetic kidney disease, diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy) lead to increased mortality, blindness, kidney failure and an overall decreased quality of life in individuals with diabetes. Clinical risk factors and glycaemic control alone cannot predict the development of vascular complications; numerous genetic studies have demonstrated a clear genetic component to both diabetes and its complications. Early research aimed at identifying genetic determinants of diabetes complications relied on familial linkage analysis suited to strong-effect loci, candidate gene studies prone to false positives, and underpowered genome-wide association studies limited by sample size. The explosion of new genomic datasets, both in terms of biobanks and aggregation of worldwide cohorts, has more than doubled the number of genetic discoveries for both diabetes and diabetes complications.

Here, we evaluated and compared their prospective associations with the development of sight-threatening DR (STDR), another important diabetic microvascular complication. Baseline serum AFABP, PEDF, and FGF21 levels were measured in 4760 Chinese individuals with type 2 diabetes and without STDR at baseline. The associations of these biomarkers with incident STDR were analyzed using Cox regression analysis. Among these 4760 participants (mean diabetes duration of 11 years and ≥ 50% with nonproliferative DR at baseline), 172 participants developed STDR over a median follow-up of 8.8 years. Participants with incident STDR had comparable baseline serum FGF21 levels but significantly higher baseline serum AFABP and PEDF levels (both P < .001) than those without. However, in multivariable Cox regression analysis, only serum AFABP remained independently associated with incident STDR (hazard ratio 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05-1.55; P = .013). The addition of serum AFABP to a clinical model of conventional STDR risk factors including diabetes duration, glycemic control, albuminuria, and baseline DR status significantly improved the c statistics (P < .001), net reclassification index (P = .0027), and integrated discrimination index (P = .033) in predicting incident STDR among participants without DR or with mild DR at baseline.

In-hospital screening for hyperglycaemia may present a valuable opportunity for early diabetes diagnosis by identifying at-risk individuals. This systematic review investigates the extent to which random blood glucose testing in acute and inpatient hospital settings predicts undiagnosed diabetes. Two databases were systematically searched for studies in which adult patients received an in-hospital random blood glucose test, followed by a diagnostic HbA1c test. The primary outcome was the proportion of hyperglycaemic individuals diagnosed with diabetes by HbA1c. A total of 3245 unique citations were identified, and 12 were eligible for inclusion. Ten different blood glucose thresholds, ranging from 5.5 to 11.1 mmol/L, were used to detect hyperglycaemia, indicating that there is no consistent clinical definition for hyperglycaemia. The proportion of participants with hyperglycaemia in each study ranged from 3.3% to 62.1%, with a median (Q<sub>1</sub> , Q<sub>3</sub> ) of 34.5% (5.95%, 61.1%). The proportion of hyperglycaemic participants found to have a diabetes-range HbA1c varied from 4.1% to 90%, with a median (Q<sub>1</sub> , Q<sub>3</sub> ) of 18.9% (11.5%, 61.1%). Meta-analysis was not possible due to substantial heterogeneity between study protocols. All studies consistently identified a proportion of hyperglycaemic hospital patients as having a diabetes-range HbA1c, showing that in-hospital blood glucose screening can facilitate diabetes diagnosis. The proportion of hyperglycaemic participants with undiagnosed diabetes varied substantially, indicating a need for further research and consistency in defining in-hospital hyperglycaemia.

39541789,Diabetes and the associated complications: The role of antioxidants in diabetes therapy and care.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). Poorly managed diabetes can lead to complications affecting multiple organ systems. Antioxidants play a crucial role in reducing oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), primarily triggered by uncontrolled high blood sugar levels in diabetes. Antioxidants like vitamin C, E, selenium, and alpha-lipoic acid, when used as supplements, have shown promise in reducing oxidative stress markers and improving antioxidant status in laboratory and animal studies and diabetic patients. Antioxidant supplementation may help reduce the risk of diabetic complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, antioxidants also have anti-inflammatory properties, which could be beneficial in reducing inflammation associated with diabetes. Antioxidant supplementation has been shown to enhance endothelial function, insulin sensitivity, and glucose metabolism, thereby aiding in glycemic control and overall diabetic management. Combining antioxidants with certain medications may have therapeutic benefits, such as effectively neutralizing free radicals and enhancing the regulation of antioxidant defense systems. This review presents an update on diabetes, the sources of free radical generation, the body's natural defense mechanisms, the clinical evidence regarding using antioxidants in managing diabetic complications, and the potential new therapeutic approaches. Overall, antioxidant supplementation may offer some benefits in managing diabetic complications. However, further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms of action, determine the optimal supplementation, explore potential interactions with other medications, and conduct long-term studies to establish the possible use of antioxidants for optimal benefits in diabetes care.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2024-Dec,"Dilworth L, Stennett D, Facey A, Omoruyi F, Mohansingh S, Omoruyi FO",6,1919,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

Early diagnosis and timely management is vital in preventing the progression of the disease which may require amputation. Conventional methods take a long time for healing. This study aims to compare negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) and conventional saline dressings in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) healing. This prospective randomized study was conducted in 45 patients with grade 1 and 2 DFUs. 22 patients in group A received NPWT and 23 patients in group B received saline dressings. The formation of granulation tissue, reduction in ulcer size, duration of hospital stay and time for complete healing of wounds were assessed. The formation of granulation tissue (91.14 vs 52.61%, p < 0.001) and reduction in ulcer size (40.78 vs 21.18%, p = 0.008) at 14 days was significantly more in group A.

A retrospective study of all kidney biopsies in T2DM patients over a three-year period submitted to the Pathology Departments of Apollo Hospitals, Hyderabad, and Yashoda Hospitals, Secunderabad, India, was analyzed. The clinical data were analyzed for the type of biopsy lesions and the clinical predictors of nondiabetic renal pathology in these biopsies. The result of this study was compared with another study published by one of the authors in 2006. A total of 1029 biopsies were obtained from the records. Pure DGS was seen in 341 (33.1%) and nondiabetic renal lesions were seen in 482 (46.8%) biopsies. The most common histological lesion in the isolated nondiabetic renal disease group was interstitial nephritis (acute and chronic). Incidence of minimal change disease and membranous nephropathy is significantly less in the current cohort. The factors which were predictive of isolated nondiabetic lesions were short duration of diabetes and renal failure (unexplained/rapid deterioration). 66.9% of biopsies show nondiabetic-renal lesion histopathology in T2DM patients.

For patients with CKD not receiving dialysis, comparing pre- and post-intervention, there were improvements in HbA1c (-13.0 mmol/mol, p < 0.001), SBP (-13.7 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), and weight (-2.9 kg, p < 0.0001). Furthermore, there was an increase in guideline-directed therapies, with notable usage of SGLT2i (62.9%) and GLP1-RA (28.4%), while access to diabetes technology increased to 89%. This new model of care resulted in improved metabolic outcomes, increased utilisation of guideline-directed therapies, and enhanced access to diabetes technologies.

34489872,Roles and Mechanisms of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 Inhibitors in Vascular Aging.,"Vascular aging is characterized by alterations in the constitutive properties and biological functions of the blood vessel wall. Endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are indispensability elements in the inner layer and the medial layer of the blood vessel wall, respectively. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, as a hypoglycemic agent, play a protective role in reversing vascular aging regardless of their effects in meliorating glycemic control in humans and animal models of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through complex cellular mechanisms, including improving EC dysfunction, promoting EC proliferation and migration, alleviating EC senescence, obstructing EC apoptosis, suppressing the proliferation and migration of VSMCs, increasing circulating endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) levels, and preventing the infiltration of mononuclear macrophages. All of these showed that DPP4 inhibitors may exert a positive effect against vascular aging, thereby preventing vascular aging-related diseases. In the current review, we will summarize the cellular mechanism of DPP4 inhibitors regulating vascular aging; moreover, we also intend to compile the roles and the promising therapeutic application of DPP4 inhibitors in vascular aging-related diseases.",Frontiers in endocrinology,2021-,"Cao F, Wu K, Zhu YZ, Bao ZW",4,1289,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov, and Cochrane Library for ""published"" research from their inception until November 2023. Two researchers independently reviewed the studies' inclusion and exclusion criteria. Our meta-analysis included 13 studies on MSC treatment for diabetes. The MSC-treated group had a significantly lower HbA1c at the last follow-up compared to the baseline (MD: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.33 to 1.57, <i>P</i>-value: 0.003< 0.05), their insulin requirement was significantly lower (MD: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.31, <i>P</i>-value: 0.002< 0.05), the level of FBG with MSC transplantation significantly dropped compared to baseline (MD: 1.78, 95% CI: -1.02 to 4.58, <i>P</i>-value: 0.212), the FPG level of the MSC-treated group was significantly lower (MD: -0.77, 95% CI: -2.36 to 0.81, <i>P</i>-value: 0.339 > 0.05), and the fasting C-peptide level of the MSC-treated group was slightly high (MD: -0.02, 95% CI: -0.07 to 0.02, <i>P-</i>value: 0.231 > 0.05).

Retrospective observational cohort study. Sample Research Database offered by Korean National Health Insurance Service, between 2002 and 2013. Two datasets, focusing on diabetes and hypertensions one by one, are constructed. The number of participants for the datasets is 133 329 (diabetes) and 101 738 (hypertension), respectively. A bivariate probit model with selection was adopted to investigate the impact of general health checks on the diagnosis of critical chronic diseases. The dependent variable was an indicator variable denoting whether a participant has been treated for diabetes (or hypertension) or not for the first time during the sample period. An indicator variable that indicates whether that participant is eligible for free general health checks or not in the focal year (year of the first treatment or last year in the sample) was used as instrument variables to control for the self-selection problem of undergoing general health checks. We found that there exists substantial self-selection between undergoing general health checks and diagnosis for chronic diseases. The correlations between the unobserved factors influencing the decisions to obtain general health checks and those determining the detection of chronic diseases are highly significant and positive (ie, 0.188 (p<0.001) in diabetes and 0.220 (p<0.001) in hypertension). We confirmed that these positive, significant correlations generate upward bias in the estimated effect of general health checks on the detection and treatment of diabetes (0.312 (p<0.001) when self-selection ignored but 0.099 (p<0.001) when self-selection considered) and hypertension (0.293 (p<0.001) when self-selection ignored but insignificant when self-selection considered). The effect of general health checks and people's self-selection behaviour may differ by socio-economic characteristics of individuals. The general health check is effective in detecting chronic diseases among low-income individuals rather than high-income individuals, implying that general health checks are contributing to helping medically underprivileged low-income people detect and treat their chronic diseases. High-income individuals showed stronger self-selection behaviour than low-income individuals and this may overstate the effect of general health checks if the self-selection is overlooked, particularly among high-income individuals. Self-selection due to unobserved factors between undergoing general health checks and diagnosis of chronic diseases are substantial. After accounting for this, the effect of general health checks on the detection and treatment of diabetes and hypertension is insignificant or marginal. The increases in the treatments of the two diseases following general health checks are 1% and insignificant in diabetes and hypertension, respectively.",BMJ open,2023-Mar,"Yoon S, Jun DB, Park S",3,3034,diabetes,2025-11-02 18:32:01

The immune system plays a crucial role in the susceptibility, persistence, and clearance of these infections. With 70-80% of immune cells being present in the gut, there is an intricate interplay between the intestinal microbiota, the intestinal epithelial layer, and the local mucosal immune system. In addition to the local mucosal immune responses in the gut, it is increasingly recognized that the gut microbiome also affects systemic immunity. Clinicians are more and more using the increased knowledge about these complex interactions between the immune system, the gut microbiome, and human pathogens. The now well-recognized impact of nutrition on the composition of the gut microbiota and the immune system elucidates the role nutrition can play in improving health. This review describes the mechanisms involved in maintaining the intricate balance between the microbiota, gut health, the local immune response, and systemic immunity, linking this to infectious diseases throughout life, and highlights the impact of nutrition in infectious disease prevention and treatment.",Nutrients,2021-Mar,"Wiertsema SP, van Bergenhenegouwen J, Garssen J, Knippels LMJ",4,1247,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

36140733,Next Generation and Other Sequencing Technologies in Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have become increasingly available for use in the clinical microbiology diagnostic environment. There are three main applications of these technologies in the clinical microbiology laboratory: whole genome sequencing (WGS), targeted metagenomics sequencing and shotgun metagenomics sequencing. These applications are being utilized for initial identification of pathogenic organisms, the detection of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and for epidemiologic tracking of organisms within and outside hospital systems. In this review, we analyze these three applications and provide a comprehensive summary of how these applications are currently being used in public health, basic research, and clinical microbiology laboratory environments. In the public health arena, WGS is being used to identify and epidemiologically track food borne outbreaks and disease surveillance. In clinical hospital systems, WGS is used to identify multi-drug-resistant nosocomial infections and track the transmission of these organisms. In addition, we examine how metagenomics sequencing approaches (targeted and shotgun) are being used to circumvent the traditional and biased microbiology culture methods to identify potential pathogens directly from specimens. We also expand on the important factors to consider when implementing these technologies, and what is possible for these technologies in infectious disease diagnosis in the next 5 years.",Genes,2022-Aug,"Hilt EE, Ferrieri P",2,1479,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

They have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer and neurological, cardiovascular, and autoimmune diseases. Several recent studies have suggested that miRNAs are key players in regulating the differentiation, maturation, and activation of immune cells, thereby influencing the host immune response to infection. The resultant upregulation or downregulation of miRNAs from infection influences the protein expression of genes responsible for the immune response and can determine the risk of disease progression. Recently, miRNAs have been explored as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in various infectious diseases. This review summarizes our current understanding of the role of miRNAs during viral, fungal, bacterial, and parasitic infections from a clinical perspective, including critical functional mechanisms and implications for their potential use as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Clinical microbiology reviews,2023-Dec,"Kimura M, Kothari S, Gohir W, Camargo JF, Husain S",5,1055,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

An appropriate supply of arginine has long been associated with the improvement of immune responses. In addition to being a building block for protein synthesis, arginine serves as a substrate for distinct metabolic pathways that profoundly affect immune cell biology; especially macrophage, dendritic cell and T cell immunobiology. Arginine availability, synthesis, and catabolism are highly interrelated aspects of immune responses and their fine-tuning can dictate divergent pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory immune outcomes. Here, we review the organismal pathways of arginine metabolism in humans and rodents, as essential modulators of the availability of this semi-essential amino acid for immune cells. We subsequently review well-established and novel findings on the functional impact of arginine biosynthetic and catabolic pathways on the main immune cell lineages. Finally, as arginine has emerged as a molecule impacting on a plethora of immune functions, we integrate key notions on how the disruption or perversion of arginine metabolism is implicated in pathologies ranging from infectious diseases to autoimmunity and cancer.",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2021-Jul,"Martí I Líndez AA, Reith W",2,1317,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

33573529,Protection against severe infectious disease in the past.,"Before the 20<sup>th</sup> century many deaths in England, and most likely a majority, were caused by infectious diseases. The focus here is on the biggest killers, plague, typhus, smallpox, tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid, dysentery, childhood infections, pneumonia, and influenza. Many other infectious diseases including puerperal fever, relapsing fever, malaria, syphilis, meningitis, tetanus and gangrene caused thousands of deaths. This review of preventive measures, public health interventions and changes in behavior that reduced the risk of severe infections puts the response to recent epidemic challenges in historical perspective. Two new respiratory viruses have recently caused pandemics: an H1N1 influenza virus genetically related to pig viruses, and a bat-derived coronavirus causing COVID-19. Studies of infectious diseases emerging in human populations in recent decades indicate that the majority were zoonotic, and many of the causal pathogens had a wildlife origin. As hunter-gatherers, humans contracted pathogens from other species, and then from domesticated animals and rodents when they began to live in settled communities based on agriculture. In the modern world of large inter-connected urban populations and rapid transport, the risk of global transmission of new infectious diseases is high. Past and recent experience indicates that surveillance, prevention and control of infectious diseases are critical for global health. Effective interventions are required to control activities that risk dangerous pathogens transferring to humans from wild animals and those reared for food.",Pathogens and global health,2021-May,Mercer A,1,1615,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Within R&D efforts, the goal is to obtain effective prophylactic and therapeutic approaches, which depends on a comprehensive knowledge of the etiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of these diseases. In this process, the accessibility of animal models is a priority bottleneck because it plays a key role in bridging the gap between in-depth understanding and control efforts for infectious diseases. Here, we reviewed preclinical animal models for high priority disease in terms of their ability to simulate human infections, including both natural susceptibility models, artificially engineered models, and surrogate models. In addition, we have thoroughly reviewed the current landscape of vaccines, antibodies, and small molecule drugs, particularly hopeful candidates in the advanced stages of these infectious diseases. More importantly, focusing on global trends and novel technologies, several aspects of the prevention and control of infectious disease were discussed in detail, including but not limited to gaps in currently available animal models and medical responses, better immune correlates of protection established in animal models and humans, further understanding of disease mechanisms, and the role of artificial intelligence in guiding or supplementing the development of animal models, vaccines, and drugs. Overall, this review described pioneering approaches and sophisticated techniques involved in the study of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and clinical theatment of WHO high-priority pathogens and proposed potential directions.

This shift underscores the growing need for more cost‑effective and universally accessible sequencing assays to improve patient care and public health. Therefore, targeted NGS (tNGS) is gaining prominence. tNGS involves enrichment of target pathogens in patient samples based on multiplex PCR amplification or probe capture with excellent sensitivity. It is increasingly used in clinical diagnostics due to its practicality and efficiency. The present review compares the principles of different enrichment methods. The high positivity rate of tNGS in the detection of pathogens was found in respiratory samples with specific instances. tNGS maintains high sensitivity (70.8‑95.0%) in samples with low pathogen loads, including blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, tNGS is effective in detecting drug‑resistant strains of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, allowing identification of resistance genes and guiding clinical treatment decisions, which is difficult to achieve with mNGS. In the present review, the application of tNGS in clinical settings and its current limitations are assessed.

Diagnostic stewardship (DS) is an auxiliary to antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and comprises ordering the right tests, for the right patient, at the right time. It also promotes the judicious use of rapid and novel molecular diagnostic tools to enable the initiation of proper antibiotic therapy, while avoiding excessive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Proper interpretation of test results is crucial to avoid overdiagnosis and excessive healthcare costs. Although many rapid diagnostic tools have been developed with a high diagnostic yield, they are often limited by accessibility, cost, and lack of knowledge regarding their use. Careful consideration of clinical signs and symptoms with knowledge of the local epidemiology are essential for DS. This enables appropriate interpretation of microbiological results. Multidisciplinary teams that include well trained professionals should cooperate to promote DS. Challenges and barriers to the implementation of DS are mostly caused by scarcity of resources and lack of trained personnel and, most importantly, lack of knowledge.

Given the importance of cognition in aging trajectories, the objective of this article was to review current knowledge on cognitive outcomes of infectious diseases in older adults, and to emphasize the importance of considering cognition as a domain of interest in its own rights in these diseases. A MEDLINE/PubMed database search was conducted to identify articles reporting cognitive impairment associated with various severe acute infections and specific chronic infectious conditions such as human immune deficiency virus, the herpes virus family, hepatitis C virus, Lyme borreliosis, Helicobacter pylori, periodontitis, and emerging pathogens like SARS-CoV-2, as well as potentially preventive strategies like vaccination. Taken together, the studies examined in the present review emphasize that numerous acute and chronic infectious diseases share mechanisms that, when added to specific risk factors frequently found in older persons, contribute to considerably increase the risk of cognitive outcomes such as cognitive decline and dementia.

Two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses was executed utilizing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly connected with MDD and infectious diseases as instrumental variables (IVs). A series of sensitivity analyses were subsequently conducted. Genetic variants linked to MDD were employed as instrumental variables sourced from a genome-wide meta-analyses comprising 500,199 individuals. Summary-level data on five infectious diseases, including candidiasis, pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), and urinary tract infections (UTI), were acquired from the UK Biobank and FinnGen study. Our findings evinced that genetically predicted MDD exhibited a heightened risk of candidiasis (OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.06-2.17; P = 2.38E-02), pneumonia (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.29; P = 3.16E-02), URTI (OR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.12-1.36; P = 3.71E-05), and UTI (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.12-1.42; P = 8.90E-05). Additionally, we identified bidirectional causal relationships between UTI and MDD.

38300015,Child Health Needs and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Workforce: 2020-2040.,"Pediatric infectious diseases (PID) physicians prevent and treat childhood infections through clinical care, research, public health, education, antimicrobial stewardship, and infection prevention. This article is part of an American Board of Pediatrics Foundation-sponsored supplement investigating the future of the pediatric subspecialty workforce. The article offers context to findings from a modeling analysis estimating the supply of PID subspecialists in the United States between 2020 and 2040. It provides an overview of children cared for by PID subspecialists, reviews the current state of the PID workforce, and discusses the projected headcount and clinical workforce equivalents of PID subspecialists at the national, census region, and census division levels over this 2-decade period. The article concludes by discussing the education and training, clinical practice, policy, and research implications of the data presented. Adjusting for population growth, the PID workforce is projected to grow more slowly than most other pediatric subspecialties and geographic disparities in access to PID care are expected to worsen. In models considering alternative scenarios, decreases in the number of fellows and time spent in clinical care significantly affect the PID workforce. Notably, model assumptions may not adequately account for potential threats to the PID workforce, including a declining number of fellows entering training and the unknown impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and future emerging infections on workforce attrition. Changes to education and training, clinical care, and policy are needed to ensure the PID workforce can meet the future needs of US children.",Pediatrics,2024-Feb,"Kelly MS, Cataldi JR, Schlaudecker EP, Shah SS, Vinci RJ, Myers AL",6,1692,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37801882,Economic sanctions and spread of infectious diseases.,"Economic sanctions can induce economic crises and compromise the determinants of health. In the literature, economic crises have been found to increase the risk of infectious disease outbreaks. Presumably, sanctions can increase the risk of infectious disease spreads, indirectly. However, non-economic factors can fuel the adverse impact of sanctions, including political consequences of sanctions and civil war. We performed a systematic literature review of articles in Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and the grey literature to assess empirically the impact of economic sanctions on the spread of infectious diseases within and beyond the borders of sanctioned countries. Our review did not identify any study meeting our inclusion criteria. Most of the studies did not control for major socio-political events, particularly armed conflicts in the sanctioned countries. This discovery underscores a notable gap in the examination of the impact of economic sanctions on the propagation of infectious diseases, presenting a threat to global health. Using the social-ecological model, we hypothesize how the economic crisis resulting from economic sanctions affects determinants of health, increases the risk of the spread of infectious diseases and hinders the response capacity of health systems.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2023-Dec,"Aloosh M, Aloosh A",2,1326,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39386170,Aptamers: precision tools for diagnosing and treating infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases represent a significant global health challenge, with bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasitic protozoa being significant causative agents. The shared symptoms among diseases and the emergence of new pathogen variations make diagnosis and treatment complex. Conventional diagnostic methods are laborious and intricate, underscoring the need for rapid, accurate techniques. Aptamer-based technologies offer a promising solution, as they are cost-effective, sensitive, specific, and convenient for molecular disease diagnosis. Aptamers, which are single-stranded RNA or DNA sequences, serve as nucleotide equivalents of monoclonal antibodies, displaying high specificity and affinity for target molecules. They are structurally robust, allowing for long-term storage without substantial activity loss. Aptamers find applications in diverse fields such as drug screening, material science, and environmental monitoring. In biomedicine, they are extensively studied for biomarker detection, diagnostics, imaging, and targeted therapy. This comprehensive review focuses on the utility of aptamers in managing infectious diseases, particularly in the realms of diagnostics and therapeutics.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2024-,"Sujith S, Naresh R, Srivisanth BU, Sajeevan A, Rajaramon S, David H, Solomon AP",7,1203,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Metabolomics has been used to study a variety of infectious diseases and applications. The most common application of metabolomics is for prognostic and diagnostic purposes, specifically the screening of disease-specific biomarkers by either NMR-based or mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. In addition, metabolomics is of great significance for the discovery of druggable metabolic enzymes and/or metabolic regulators through the use of state-of-the-art flux analysis, for example, via the elucidation of metabolic mechanisms. This review discusses the application of metabolomics technologies to biomarker screening, the discovery of drug targets in infectious diseases such as viral, bacterial and parasite infections and immunometabolomics, highlights the challenges associated with accessing metabolite compartmentalization and discusses the available tools for determining local metabolite concentrations.",Molecular omics,2021-Jun,"Tounta V, Liu Y, Cheyne A, Larrouy-Maumus G",4,1096,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) is a naturally occurring adaptive immune system in bacteria that has been developed as a tool for performing genomic alterations in any genome of interest, including humans and microbes. Accordingly, several studies have been conducted to investigate how the technology can be utilized in infectious diseases to improve diagnostics, disrupt antimicrobial resistance, and cure chronic infections. This review provides an overview of the CRISPR-Cas system and how it has been applied in studies on infectious diseases.

32031431,Companion and complementary diagnostics for infectious diseases.,"Companion diagnostics (CDx) are important in oncology therapeutic decision-making, but specific regulatory-approved CDx for infectious disease treatment are officially lacking. While not approved as CDx, several ID diagnostics are used as CDx. The diagnostics community, manufacturers, and regulatory agencies have made major efforts to ensure that diagnostics for new antimicrobials are available at or near release of new agents. This review highlights the status of Complementary and companion diagnostic (c/CDx) in the infectious disease literature, with a focus on genotypic antimicrobial resistance testing against pathogens as a class of diagnostic tests. CRISPR, sepsis markers, and narrow spectrum antimicrobials, in addition to current and emerging technologies, present opportunities for infectious disease c/CDx. Challenges include slow guideline revision, high costs for regulatory approval, lengthy buy in by agencies, discordant pharmaceutical/diagnostic partnerships, and higher treatment costs. The number of patients and available medications used to treat different infectious diseases is well suited to support competing diagnostic tests. However, newer approaches to treatment (for example, narrow spectrum antibiotics), may be well suited for a small number of patients, i.e. a niche market in support of a CDx.

Based on current knowledge, this review aimed to determine whether bacterial lysate has comparable functions in infectious diseases and cancer treatment. In infectious diseases, including respiratory and urinary tract infections, immune system activation by bacterial lysate can identify and combat pathogens. Commercially available bacterial lysates, including OM-85, Ismigen, Lantigen B, and LW 50020, were effective in children and adults in treating respiratory tract infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rhinitis, and rhinosinusitis with varying degrees of success. Moreover, OM-89, Uromune, Urovac, Urivac, and ExPEC4V showed therapeutic benefits in controlling urinary tract infections in adults, especially women. Bacterial lysate-based therapeutics are safe, well-tolerated, and have few side effects, making them a good alternative for infectious disease management. Furthermore, a nonspecific immunomodulation by bacterial lysates may stimulate innate immunity, benefiting cancer treatment. ""Coley's vaccine"" has been used to treat sarcomas, carcinomas, lymphomas, melanomas, and myelomas with varying outcomes. Later, several similar bacterial lysate-based therapeutics have been developed to treat cancers, including bladder cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and myeloma; among them, BCG for in situ bladder cancer is well-known. Proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-<i>α</i>, may activate bacterial antigen-specific adaptive responses that could restore tumor antigen recognition and response by tumor-specific type 1 helper cells and cytotoxic T cells; therefore, bacterial lysates are worth investigating as a vaccination adjuvants or add-on therapies for several cancers.",Journal of immunology research,2024-,"Rahman MM, Grice ID, Ulett GC, Wei MQ",4,1943,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Tuberculosis (TB) has been a constant companion of humans for thousands of years and has heavily influenced population health in almost every phase of cultural and demographic evolution. TB in human populations has been dramatically influenced by behavior, demographic and epidemiological shifts, and other comorbidities through history. This paper critically discusses TB and some of its major comorbidities through history within a biocultural framework to show how transitions in human demography and culture affected the disease-scape of TB.

However, the perceived infection risk can preclude traditional, invasive, complete diagnostic autopsy. Post-mortem examination is especially important in emerging infectious diseases with potentially unknown infection risks, but rapid acquisition of good quality tissue samples is needed as part of the scientific and public health response. Needle biopsy post-mortem is a minimally invasive, rapid, closed-body autopsy technique that was originally developed to minimise the infection risk to practitioners. Since its inception, needle biopsy post-mortem has also been used as a technique to support complete diagnostic autopsy provision in poorly resourced regions and to facilitate post-mortem examinations in communities that might have religious or cultural objections to an invasive autopsy.

This tubular system is capable of rapidly transport small molecules such as viruses, antigens, chemokines, cytokines, and immunoglobulins through lymphoid organs. This structure plays an important role in guiding the cells to their particular niches, therefore participating in cell cooperation, antigen presentation, and cellular activation. The remodeling of conduits has been described in chronic inflammation and infectious diseases to improve the transport of antigens to specific T and B cells in lymphoid tissue. However, malnutrition and infectious agents may induce extracellular matrix remodeling directly or indirectly, leading to the microarchitecture disorganization of secondary lymphoid organs and their conduit system. In this process, the fibers and cells that compound the conduit system may also be altered, which affects the development of a specific immune response.

The objective of this study was to understand the relative frequency of diagnostic delays for six infectious diseases commonly seen by infectious diseases (ID) consultants and to examine contributing factors for these delays. A 25-item survey to examine diagnostic delays in six infectious diseases was sent to all infectious diseases physicians in the Emerging Infections Network (EIN) who provide care to adult patients. Diseases included (1) tuberculosis, (2) non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections, (3) syphilis, (4) epidural abscess, (5) infective endocarditis, and (6) endemic fungal infections (e.g., histoplasmosis, blastomycosis). A total of 533 of 1,323 (40%) EIN members responded to the survey. Respondents perceived the diagnosis not being considered initially and the appropriate test not being ordered as the two most important contributors to diagnostic delays. Unusual clinical presentations and not consulting ID physicians early enough were also reported as a contributing factor to delays. Responses recorded in open-text fields also indicated errors related to testing as a likely cause of delays; specifically, test-related errors included ordering the wrong laboratory test, laboratory delays (specialized labs not available at the facility), and lab processing delays. Diagnostic delays commonly occur for the infectious diseases we considered.

Four mortality patterns are recognized: the common U- and L-shaped curves of endemic infections and the unique W- and J-shaped curves of pandemic infections. We suggest that these patterns result from different sets of human genetic and immunological determinants. In this model, it is the interplay between (1) monogenic genotypes affecting immunity to primary infection that preferentially manifest early in life and related genotypes or their phenocopies, including auto-antibodies, which manifest later in life and (2) the occurrence and persistence of adaptive, acquired immunity to primary or cross-reactive infections, which shapes the age-dependent pattern of human deaths from infection.",Immunity,2024-Jul,"Abel L, Casanova JL",2,859,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This study aims to explore the spatial and temporal evolutionary characteristics of the incidence of Class B notifiable infectious diseases in China from 2007 to 2020, and to forecast the trend of it as well. Hopefully, it will provide a reference for the formulation of infectious disease prevention and control strategies. Data on the incidence rates of Class B notifiable infectious diseases in 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China from 2007 to 2020 were collected for the prediction of the spatio-temporal evolution and spatial correlation as well as the incidence of Class B notifiable infectious diseases in China based on global spatial autocorrelation and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). From 2007 to 2020, the national incidence rate of Class B notifiable infectious diseases (from 272.37 per 100,000 in 2007 to 190.35 per 100,000 in 2020) decreases year by year, and the spatial distribution shows an ""east-central-west"" stepwise increase. From 2007 to 2020, the spatial clustering of the incidence of Class B notifiable infectious diseases is significant and increasing year by year (Moran's I index values range from 0.189 to 0.332, p < 0.05). The forecasted incidence rates of Class B notifiable infectious diseases nationwide from 2021 to 2024 (205.26/100,000, 199.95/100,000, 194.74/100,000 and 189.62/100,000) as well as the forecasted values for most regions show a downward trend, with only some regions (Guangdong, Hunan, Hainan, Tibet, Guangxi and Guizhou) showing an increasing trend year by year. The current study found that since there were significant regional disparities in the prevention and control of infectious diseases in China between 2007 and 2020, the reduction of the incidence of Class B notifiable infectious diseases requires the joint efforts of the surrounding provinces. Besides, special attention should be paid to provinces with an increasing trend in the incidence of Class B notifiable infectious diseases to prevent the re-emergence of certain traditional infectious diseases in a particular province or even the whole country, as well as the outbreak and spread of emerging infectious diseases.",BMC public health,2022-Jun,"Wang RN, Zhang YC, Yu BT, He YT, Li B, Zhang YL",6,2420,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare, offering promising solutions to address this challenge. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the pivotal role AI can play in the early diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. It explores how AI-driven diagnostic tools, including machine learning algorithms, deep learning, and image recognition systems, enhance the accuracy and efficiency of disease detection and surveillance. Furthermore, it delves into the potential of AI to predict disease outbreaks, optimise treatment strategies, and personalise interventions based on individual patient data and how AI can be used to gear up the drug discovery and development (D3) process.The ethical considerations, challenges, and limitations associated with the integration of AI in infectious disease management are also examined.

Uniquely, infectious disease testing is technologically diverse spaces in laboratory medicine, where multiple platforms and approaches may be required to support clinical decision-making. Despite advances in laboratory informatics, the vast array of infectious disease data is constrained by human analytical limitations. Machine learning can exploit multiple data streams, including but not limited to laboratory information and overcome human limitations to provide physicians with predictive and actionable results. As a quickly evolving area of computer science, laboratory professionals should become aware of AI/ML applications for infectious disease testing as more platforms are become commercially available. In this review we: (a) define both AI/ML, (b) provide an overview of common ML approaches used in laboratory medicine, (c) describe the current AI/ML landscape as it relates infectious disease testing, and (d) discuss the future evolution AI/ML for infectious disease testing in both laboratory and point-of-care applications. The review provides an important educational overview of AI/ML technique in the context of infectious disease testing. This includes supervised ML approaches, which are frequently used in laboratory medicine applications including infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, sepsis, hepatitis, malaria, meningitis, Lyme disease, and tuberculosis.

For this purpose, we use rich municipal-monthly panel data. We exploit the fact that municipalities closer to the main migration entry points have a disproportionate exposure to infected migrants when the cumulative migration flows increase. We find that higher refugee inflows are associated with increments in the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as chickenpox and tuberculosis, as well as sexually transmitted diseases, namely syphilis. However, we find no significant effects of migration on the propagation of vector-borne diseases.

They have pioneered disease prevention from the Crusades to the World Wars and continue to do so today. Predeployment vaccinations and chemoprophylaxis are effective in preventing communicable disease, as is reliable vector destruction and bite prevention, especially in the era of multidrug resistant organisms. These measures are unlikely to be fully possible in disasters, but reactive vaccination and efforts to reduce exposure to communicable disease should be a priority. Communicable diseases can be challenging to diagnose-the UK Defence Medical Services have become familiar with tools such as multiplex PCR and mass spectrometry. These have the potential to accurately identify organisms and sensitivity patterns in austere environments. Management of communicable diseases depends on accurate diagnosis and has a largely well-established evidence base but can be limited by a lack of resources and skills in an austere setting, therefore telemedicine can assist diagnosis and treatment of infections by projecting specialist skill. Systems such as EpiNATO2 are useful in monitoring diseases and identifying trends in order to establish control measures. Many of these tools and techniques are effective in austere environments and offer learning opportunities for those providing care in similar settings.

32462426,The human genetic determinism of life-threatening infectious diseases: genetic heterogeneity and physiological homogeneity?,"Multicellular eukaryotes emerged late in evolution from an ocean of viruses, bacteria, archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes. These macroorganisms are exposed to and infected by a tremendous diversity of microorganisms. Those that are large enough can even be infected by multicellular fungi and parasites. Each interaction is unique, if only because it operates between two unique living organisms, in an infinite diversity of circumstances. This is neatly illustrated by the extraordinarily high level of interindividual clinical variability in human infections, even for a given pathogen, ranging from a total absence of clinical manifestations to death. We discuss here the idea that the determinism of human life-threatening infectious diseases can be governed by single-gene inborn errors of immunity, which are rarely Mendelian and frequently display incomplete penetrance. We briefly review the evidence in support of this notion obtained over the last two decades, referring to a number of focused and thorough reviews published by eminent colleagues in this issue of Human Genetics. It seems that almost any life-threatening infectious disease can be driven by at least one, and, perhaps, a great many diverse monogenic inborn errors, which may nonetheless be immunologically related. While the proportions of monogenic cases remain unknown, a picture in which genetic heterogeneity is combined with physiological homogeneity is emerging from these studies.

Emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases are likely to provide a continued threat to global health in the short- to medium-term future. A good deal of knowledge about the drivers of infectious disease emergence has been developed based on numerous examples from the recent past. Sharing of diagnostic resources across human and animal health sectors, sharing of human and animal health surveillance data, development of skills in the interpretation of that data and awareness of issues related to the validation and interpretation of diagnostic test data are necessary prerequisites for an effective endemic disease surveillance system.

34319148,The Standardization and Control of Serology and Nucleic Acid Testing for Infectious Diseases.,"Historically, the detection of antibodies against infectious disease agents was achieved using test systems that utilized biological functions such as neutralization, complement fixation, hemagglutination, or visualization of binding of antibodies to specific antigens, by testing doubling dilutions of the patient sample to determine an endpoint. These test systems have since been replaced by automated platforms, many of which have been integrated into general medical pathology. Methods employed to standardize and control clinical chemistry testing have been applied to these serology tests. However, there is evidence that these methods are not suitable for infectious disease serology. An overriding reason is that, unlike testing for an inert chemical, testing for specific antibodies to infectious disease agents is highly variable; the measurand for each test system varies in choice of antigen, antibody classes/subclasses, modes of detection, and assay kinetics, and individuals' immune responses vary with time after exposure, individual immune-competency, nutrition, treatment, and exposure to variable circulating sero- or genotypes or organism mutations. Therefore, unlike that of inert chemicals, the quantification of antibodies cannot be standardized using traditional methods. However, there is evidence that the quantification of nucleic acid testing, reporting results in international units, has been successful across many viral load tests. Similarly, traditional methods used to control clinical chemistry testing, such as Westgard rules, are not appropriate for serology testing for infectious diseases, mainly due to variability due to frequent reagent lot changes. This review investigates the reasons why standardization and control of infectious diseases should be further investigated and more appropriate guidelines should be implemented.",Clinical microbiology reviews,2021-Dec,Dimech W,1,1870,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) are essential in reducing the incidence of MDRO by conserving antimicrobial use, minimizing treatment durations, and improving the appropriate use of diagnostic testing. However, the role of ASP in transplant infectious diseases (TID) is still evolving, necessitating greater collaboration between ASP and transplant programs. This collaboration will mitigate infection risks, reduce infection-associated costs, and improve outcomes.

Indeed, directly transmitted pathogens have long been considered a major cost of group living in humans and other social animals, as well as a driver of the evolution of group size and social behaviour. As the risk and frequency of emerging infectious diseases rise, the ability of social taxa to respond appropriately to changing infectious disease pressures could mean the difference between persistence and extinction. Here, we examine changes in the social behaviour of humans and wildlife in response to infectious diseases and compare these responses to theoretical expectations. We consider constraints on altering social behaviour in the face of emerging diseases, including the lack of behavioural plasticity, environmental limitations and conflicting pressures from the many benefits of group living. We also explore the ways that social animals can minimize the costs of disease-induced changes to sociality and the unique advantages that humans may have in maintaining the benefits of sociality despite social distancing.",Proceedings.

33435521,Magnesium in Infectious Diseases in Older People.,"Reduced magnesium (Mg) intake is a frequent cause of deficiency with age together with reduced absorption, renal wasting, and polypharmacotherapy. Chronic Mg deficiency may result in increased oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation, which may be linked to several age-related diseases, including higher predisposition to infectious diseases. Mg might play a role in the immune response being a cofactor for immunoglobulin synthesis and other processes strictly associated with the function of T and B cells. Mg is necessary for the biosynthesis, transport, and activation of vitamin D, another key factor in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. The regulation of cytosolic free Mg in immune cells involves Mg transport systems, such as the melastatin-like transient receptor potential 7 channel, the solute carrier family, and the magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1). The functional importance of Mg transport in immunity was unknown until the description of the primary immunodeficiency XMEN (X-linked immunodeficiency with Mg defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and neoplasia) due to a genetic deficiency of MAGT1 characterized by chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection. This and other research reporting associations of Mg deficit with viral and bacterial infections indicate a possible role of Mg deficit in the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its complications.

We conducted a methodologic review of test validation studies for OIE-listed diseases in wild mammals published between 2008 and 2017 and focused on study design, statistical analysis, and reporting of results. Most published papers addressed <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> infection in one or more wildlife species. Our review revealed limitations or missing information about sampled animals, identification criteria for positive and negative samples (case definition), representativeness of source and target populations, and species in the study, as well as information identifying animals sampled for calculations of DSe and DSp as naturally infected captive, free-ranging, or experimentally challenged animals. The deficiencies may have reflected omissions in reporting rather than design flaws, although lack of random sampling might have induced bias in estimates of DSe and DSp. We used case studies of validation of tests for hemorrhagic diseases in deer and white-nose syndrome in hibernating bats to demonstrate approaches for validation when new pathogen serotypes or genotypes are detected and diagnostic algorithms are changed, and how purposes of tests evolve together with the evolution of the pathogen after identification. We describe potential benefits of experimental challenge studies for obtaining DSe and DSp estimates, methods to maintain sample integrity, and Bayesian latent class models for statistical analysis.

33148705,SHERLOCK and DETECTR: CRISPR-Cas Systems as Potential Rapid Diagnostic Tools for Emerging Infectious Diseases.,"Infectious diseases are one of the most intimidating threats to human race, responsible for an immense burden of disabilities and deaths. Rapid diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases offers a better understanding of their pathogenesis. According to the World Health Organization, the ideal approach for detecting foreign pathogens should be rapid, specific, sensitive, instrument-free, and cost-effective. Nucleic acid pathogen detection methods, typically PCR, have numerous limitations, such as highly sophisticated equipment requirements, reagents, and trained personnel relying on well-established laboratories, besides being time-consuming. Thus, there is a crucial need to develop novel nucleic acid detection tools that are rapid, specific, sensitive, and cost-effective, particularly ones that can be used for versatile point-of-care diagnostic applications. Two new methods exploit unpredicted <i>in vitro</i> properties of CRISPR-Cas effectors, turning activated nucleases into basic amplifiers of a specific nucleic acid binding event. These effectors can be attached to a diversity of reporters and utilized in tandem with isothermal amplification approaches to create sensitive identification in multiple deployable field formats. Although still in their beginning, SHERLOCK and DETECTR technologies are potential methods for rapid detection and identification of infectious diseases, with ultrasensitive tests that do not require complicated processing.

34307196,Developing Recombinant Antibodies by Phage Display Against Infectious Diseases and Toxins for Diagnostics and Therapy.,"Antibodies are essential molecules for diagnosis and treatment of diseases caused by pathogens and their toxins. Antibodies were integrated in our medical repertoire against infectious diseases more than hundred years ago by using animal sera to treat tetanus and diphtheria. In these days, most developed therapeutic antibodies target cancer or autoimmune diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic was a reminder about the importance of antibodies for therapy against infectious diseases. While monoclonal antibodies could be generated by hybridoma technology since the 70ies of the former century, nowadays antibody phage display, among other display technologies, is robustly established to discover new human monoclonal antibodies. Phage display is an <i>in vitro</i> technology which confers the potential for generating antibodies from universal libraries against any conceivable molecule of sufficient size and omits the limitations of the immune systems. If convalescent patients or immunized/infected animals are available, it is possible to construct immune phage display libraries to select <i>in vivo</i> affinity-matured antibodies. A further advantage is the availability of the DNA sequence encoding the phage displayed antibody fragment, which is packaged in the phage particles. Therefore, the selected antibody fragments can be rapidly further engineered in any needed antibody format according to the requirements of the final application. In this review, we present an overview of phage display derived recombinant antibodies against bacterial, viral and eukaryotic pathogens, as well as microbial toxins, intended for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2021-,"Roth KDR, Wenzel EV, Ruschig M, Steinke S, Langreder N, Heine PA, Schneider KT, Ballmann R, Fühner V, Kuhn P, Schirrmann T, Frenzel A, Dübel S, Schubert M, Moreira GMSG, Bertoglio F, Russo G, Hust M",18,1669,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Taking in account the complexity of inflammasome activation and that several regulatory steps are involved in maintaining its physiologic role in homeostasis and innate immune response, it does not surprise that several genetic variants in inflammasome components have been associated with common pathologies in the general population, such as autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular diseases, obesity and associated metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Moreover, the susceptibility to infectious agents and/or to develop severe complications during infections also has been related to inflammasome genetics. In this work, we revised genetic association studies about polymorphisms of main inflammasome genes in sterile as well as infectious diseases, trying to depict the genetic contribution of inflammasome in disease pathogenesis.",European journal of human genetics : EJHG,2020-Oct,"Fernandes FP, Leal VNC, Souza de Lima D, Reis EC, Pontillo A",5,1201,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

34970269,PANoptosis: A New Insight Into Oral Infectious Diseases.,"The oral microbiome, one of the most complex and intensive microbial ecosystems in the human body, comprises bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. Dysbiosis of the oral microbiome is the initiating factor that leads to oral infectious diseases. Infection is a sophisticated biological process involving interplay between the pathogen and the host, which often leads to activation of programmed cell death. Studies suggest that pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis are involved in multiple oral infectious diseases. Further understanding of crosstalk between cell death pathways has led to pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis being integrated into a single term: PANoptosis. PANoptosis is a multifaceted agent of the immune response that has important pathophysiological relevance to infectious diseases, autoimmunity, and cancer. As such, it plays an important role in innate immune cells that detect and eliminate intracellular pathogens. In addition to the classical model of influenza virus-infected and <i>Yersinia</i>-infected macrophages, other studies have expanded the scope of PANoptosis to include other microorganisms, as well as potential roles in cell types other than macrophages. In this review, we will summarize the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying inflammation and tissue destruction caused by oral pathogens. We present an overview of different pathogens that may induce activation of PANoptosis, along with the functional consequences of PANoptosis in the context of oral infectious diseases. To advance our understanding of immunology, we also explore the strategies used by microbes that enable immune evasion and replication within host cells. Improved understanding of the interplay between the host and pathogen through PANoptosis will direct development of therapeutic strategies that target oral infectious diseases.",Frontiers in immunology,2021-,"Jiang W, Deng Z, Dai X, Zhao W",4,1867,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

These opportunities create a ""double-edge sword,"" as the ethical governance of such approaches often lags behind technological achievements. The aim was to investigate ethical issues identified from utilizing artificial intelligence-augmented surveillance or early warning systems to monitor and detect common or novel infectious disease outbreaks. In a number of databases, we searched relevant articles that addressed ethical issues of using artificial intelligence, digital surveillance systems, early warning systems, and/or big data analytics technology for detecting, monitoring, or tracing infectious diseases according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, and further identified and analyzed them with a theoretical framework. This systematic review identified 29 articles presented in 6 major themes clustered under individual, organizational, and societal levels, including awareness of implementing digital surveillance, digital integrity, trust, privacy and confidentiality, civil rights, and governance. While these measures were understandable during a pandemic, the public had concerns about receiving inadequate information; unclear governance frameworks; and lack of privacy protection, data integrity, and autonomy when utilizing infectious disease digital surveillance. The barriers to engagement could widen existing health care disparities or digital divides by underrepresenting vulnerable and at-risk populations, and patients' highly sensitive data, such as their movements and contacts, could be exposed to outside sources, impinging significantly upon basic human and civil rights. Our findings inform ethical considerations for service delivery models for medical practitioners and policymakers involved in the use of digital surveillance for infectious disease spread, and provide a basis for a global governance structure.

Floods account for the majority of the related disasters in both developed and developing countries. Flooding alters the natural balance of the environment and frequently establish a favorable habitat for pathogens and vectors to thrive. Diseases caused by pathogens that require vehicle transmission from host to host (waterborne) or a host/vector as part of their life cycle (vector-borne) are those most likely to be affected by flooding. Considering the most notable recent destructive floods events of July 2021 that affected several Central Europe countries, we conducted a systematic literature review in order to identify documented sporadic cases and outbreaks of infectious diseases in humans in Europe, where hydrometeorological hazards, mainly floods, were thought to have been involved. The occurrence of water-, rodent-, and vector-borne diseases in several European countries is highlighted, as flooding and the harsh post-flood conditions favor their emergence and transmission. In this context, strategies for prevention and management of infectious disease outbreaks in flood-prone and flood-affected areas are also proposed and comprise pre- and post-flood prevention measures, pre- and post-outbreak prevention measures, as well as mitigation actions when an infectious disease outbreak finally occurs.

There is a new subclass of antibodies calledheavy-chain antibodies that belong to the IgG isotype. However, they are low in molecular weight and lost the first constant domain (CH1). Their single-domain antigen-binding fragments, identified as nanobodies, have unique characteristics, which make them superior in comparison with the conventional antibodies. Low molecular weight and small size, high stability and solubility, ease of expression, good tissue penetration, and low-cost production make nanobodies an appropriate alternative to use against infectious disease. In this research, we review the properties of nanobodies and their potential applications in controlling human infections and inflammations.",Immunological investigations,2020-Nov,"Sanaei M, Setayesh N, Sepehrizadeh Z, Mahdavi M, Yazdi MH",5,1026,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

32120036,Rapid diagnostic tests for infectious diseases in the emergency department.,"Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for infectious diseases, with a turnaround time of less than 2 hours, are promising tools that could improve patient care, antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention in the emergency department (ED) setting. Numerous RDTs have been developed, although not necessarily for the ED environment. Their successful implementation in the ED relies on their performance and impact on patient management. The aim of this narrative review was to provide an overview of currently available RDTs for infectious diseases in the ED. PubMed was searched through August 2019 for available studies on RDTs for infectious diseases. Inclusion criteria included: commercial tests approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or Conformité Européenne (CE) in vitro diagnostic devices with data on clinical samples, ability to run on fully automated systems and result delivery within 2 hours. A nonexhaustive list of representative commercially available FDA- or CE-approved assays was categorized by clinical syndrome: pharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection, lower respiratory tract infection, gastrointestinal infection, meningitis and encephalitis, fever in returning travellers and sexually transmitted infection, including HIV. The performance of tests was described on the basis of clinical validation studies. Further, their impact on clinical outcomes and anti-infective use was discussed with a focus on ED-based studies. Clinicians should be familiar with the distinctive features of each RDT and individual performance characteristics for each target. Their integration into ED work flow should be preplanned considering local constraints of given settings.

However, the impacts of the microbiome on immune system development, susceptibility to infectious diseases, and vaccine-elicited immune responses are emerging areas of interest. In this review, we provide an overview of development of the microbiome during childhood. We highlight available data suggesting that the microbiome is critical to maturation of the immune system and modifies susceptibility to a variety of infections during childhood and adolescence, including respiratory tract infections, Clostridioides difficile infection, and sexually transmitted infections. We discuss currently available and investigational therapeutics that have the potential to modify the microbiome to prevent or treat infections among children. Finally, we review the accumulating evidence that the gut microbiome influences vaccine-elicited immune responses among children. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have led to an explosion of studies associating the human microbiome with the risk and severity of infectious diseases. As our knowledge of the extent to which the microbiome influences childhood infections continues to grow, microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics will increasingly be incorporated into clinical practice to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases among children.",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,2024-Jul,"Heston SM, Hurst JH, Kelly MS",3,1410,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37232312,Surveillance and risk assessment for early detection of emerging infectious diseases in livestock.,"Those who work in the area of surveillance and prevention of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) face a challenge in accurately predicting where infection will occur and who (or what) it will affect. Establishing surveillance and control programmes for EIDs requires substantial and long-term commitment of resources that are limited in nature. This contrasts with the unquantifiable number of possible zoonotic and non-zoonotic infectious diseases that may emerge, even when the focus is restricted to diseases involving livestock. Such diseases may emerge from many combinations of, and changes in, host species, production systems, environments/habitats and pathogen types. Given these multiple elements, risk prioritisation frameworks should be used more widely to support decision-making and resource allocation for surveillance. In this paper, the authors use recent examples of EID events in livestock to review surveillance approaches for the early detection of EIDs, and highlight the need for surveillance programmes to be informed and prioritised by regularly updated risk assessment frameworks. They conclude by discussing some unmet needs in risk assessment practices for EIDs, and the need for improved coordination in global infectious disease surveillance.",Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),2023-May,"Drewe JA, Snary EL, Crotta M, Alarcon P, Guitian J",5,1272,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This existential threat forces us to recognise that our existence is completely dependent upon well-functioning ecosystems that sustain the diversity of life on our planet, including that required for human health. By synthesising data on the ecology, epidemiology and evolutionary biology of various pathogens, we are gaining a better understanding of factors that underlie disease emergence and spread. However, our knowledge remains rudimentary with limited insight into the complex feedback loops that underlie ecological stability, which are at risk of rapidly unravelling once certain tipping points are breached. In this paper, we consider the impact of climate change and biodiversity collapse on the ever-present risk of infectious disease emergence and spread. We review historical and contemporaneous infectious diseases that have been influenced by human environmental manipulation, including zoonoses and vector- and water-borne diseases, alongside an evaluation of the impact of migration, urbanisation and human density on transmissible diseases.

Over the years, zoonoses have become increasingly significant threats to global health. They form the dominant group of diseases among the emerging infectious diseases (EID) and currently account for 73% of EID. Approximately 25% of zoonoses originate in domestic animals. The etiological agents of zoonoses include different pathogens, with viruses accounting for approximately 30% of all zoonotic infections. Zoonotic diseases can be transmitted directly or indirectly, by contact, via aerosols, through a vector, or vertically in utero. Zoonotic diseases are found in every continent except Antarctica. Numerous factors associated with the pathogen, human activities, and the environment play significant roles in the transmission and emergence of zoonotic diseases.

We review the challenges involved in modelling the dynamics of wildlife-human interfaces governing infectious disease emergence and spread. We argue that we need a better understanding of the dynamic nature of such interfaces, the underpinning diversity of pathogens and host-pathogen association networks, and the scales and frequencies at which environmental conditions enable spillover and host shifting from animals to humans to occur. The major drivers of the emergence of zoonoses are anthropogenic, including the global change in climate and land use. These, and other ecological processes pose challenges that must be overcome to counterbalance pandemic risk.

In response to this ongoing threat, significant efforts are underway to develop vaccines and antimicrobial agents. However, pathogens evolve resistance mechanisms, complicating their control. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the limitations of focusing solely on the pathogen-killing strategies of immunology and microbiology to address complex, multisystemic infectious diseases. This highlights the urgent need for practical advancements, such as microbiome therapeutics, that address these limitations while complementing traditional approaches. Our review emphasizes key outcomes in the field, including evidence of probiotics reducing disease severity and insights into host-microbiome crosstalk that have informed novel therapeutic strategies. These findings underscore the potential of microbiome-based interventions to promote physiological function alongside existing strategies aimed at enhancing host immune responses and pathogen destruction. This narrative review explores microbiome therapeutics as next-generation treatments for infectious diseases, focusing on the application of probiotics and their role in host-microbiome interactions. While offering a novel perspective grounded in a cooperative defense system, this review also addresses the practical challenges and limitations in translating these advancements into clinical settings.",Cells,2024-Dec,"Seo H, Kim S, Beck S, Song HY",4,1531,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35844858,Epidemiology and Economic Burden of Continuing Challenge of Infectious Diseases in India: Analysis of Socio-Demographic Differentials.,"Unlike other low- and middle-income countries, infectious diseases are still predominant, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are emerging without replacing the burden of infectious diseases in India, where it is imposing a double burden of diseases on households in the country. This study aimed to analyse the socio-economic and demographic differentials in the magnitude of economic burden and coping strategies associated with health expenditure on infectious diseases in India. National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) data on ""Key Indicators of Social Consumption in India: Health, (2017-18)"" have been employed in this study. The findings of the study revealed that more than 33% of the individuals are still suffering from infectious diseases out of the total ailing population in India. Based on the various socio-economic and demographic covariates, infectious diseases are highly prevalent among individuals with marginalized characteristics, such as individuals residing in rural areas, females, 0-14 age groups, Muslims, illiterates, scheduled tribes (STs), and scheduled castes (SCs), large family households, and economically poor people in the country. The per capita out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure on infectious diseases is INR 7.28 and INR 29.38 in inpatient and outpatient care, respectively. Whereas, monthly per patient OOP expenditure on infectious diseases by infection-affected populations is INR 881.56 and INR 1,156.34 in inpatient and outpatient care in India. The study found that people residing in rural areas, SCs followed by other backward classes (OBCs), illiterates, poor, and very poor are more dependent on borrowings, sale of assets, and other distressed sources of financing. However, under National Health Policy 2017, many initiatives, such as ""Ayushman Bharat,"" PM-JAY, and National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) in 2021, have been launched by the government of India in the recent years. These initiatives are holistically launched for ensuring better health facilities, but it is early to make any prediction regarding its outcomes; hopefully, the time will define it over the passing of a few more years.

Two reviewers independently determined inclusion and exclusion. Of 2,887 articles identified, 354 studies met inclusion criteria, the majority of which were application papers. Studies of airborne diseases were dominant, followed by vector-borne diseases. Most research used aggregated data instead of point data, and a significant proportion of articles used a repetition of a spatial clustering method, instead of using a ""true"" space-time detection approach, potentially leading to the detection of false positives. Noticeably, most articles did not make their data available, limiting replicability.

33491541,Drivers of Infectious Disease Seasonality: Potential Implications for COVID-19.,"Not 1 year has passed since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its emergence, great uncertainty has surrounded the potential for COVID-19 to establish as a seasonally recurrent disease. Many infectious diseases, including endemic human coronaviruses, vary across the year. They show a wide range of seasonal waveforms, timing (phase), and amplitudes, which differ depending on the geographical region. Drivers of such patterns are predominantly studied from an epidemiological perspective with a focus on weather and behavior, but complementary insights emerge from physiological studies of seasonality in animals, including humans. Thus, we take a multidisciplinary approach to integrate knowledge from usually distinct fields. First, we review epidemiological evidence of environmental and behavioral drivers of infectious disease seasonality. Subsequently, we take a chronobiological perspective and discuss within-host changes that may affect susceptibility, morbidity, and mortality from infectious diseases. Based on photoperiodic, circannual, and comparative human data, we not only identify promising future avenues but also highlight the need for further studies in animal models. Our preliminary assessment is that host immune seasonality warrants evaluation alongside weather and human behavior as factors that may contribute to COVID-19 seasonality, and that the relative importance of these drivers requires further investigation. A major challenge to predicting seasonality of infectious diseases are rapid, human-induced changes in the hitherto predictable seasonality of our planet, whose influence we review in a final outlook section. We conclude that a proactive multidisciplinary approach is warranted to predict, mitigate, and prevent seasonal infectious diseases in our complex, changing human-earth system.",Journal of biological rhythms,2021-Feb,"Kronfeld-Schor N, Stevenson TJ, Nickbakhsh S, Schernhammer ES, Dopico XC, Dayan T, Martinez M, Helm B",8,1939,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

However, despite their lower abundance, viruses within the gut microbiota are gaining recognition for their crucial role in shaping the structure and function of the intestinal microbiota, with significant effects on the host as a whole, particularly the immune system. Similarly, environmental factors such as stress are key in modulating the host immune system, which in turn influences the composition of the gut virome and neurological functions through the bidirectional communication of the gut-brain axis. In this context, alterations in the host immune system due to stress and/or dysbiosis of the gut virome are critical factors in the development of both infectious and noninfectious diseases. The molecular mechanisms and correlation patterns between microbial species are not yet fully understood. This literature review seeks to explore the interconnected relationship between stress and the gut virome, with a focus on how this interaction is influenced by the host's immune system.

The results were classified into two broad categories: communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases. Gastrointestinal infections including travellers' diarrhoea were the most common infectious diseases reported by medical students abroad, followed by respiratory tract infections and skin infections. Blood-borne and sexually transmitted infection and systemic febrile infections due to vector-borne pathogens were rarely reported. Only six of the 16 studies addressed microbial carriage. The acquisition of resistant bacteria appeared to be frequent. Traffic accidents and mental health problems were also reported. One of the lessons learned from this review is the requirement for large-scale epidemiological studies to evaluate the burden of infectious diseases such as gastrointestinal, respiratory and blood-borne infections with microbiological documentation.

Diagnostic strategies that rely solely on pathogen detection often are insufficient due to poor test characteristics, inability to differentiate colonization from infection, or protracted delay to result. Understanding the human response across different pathogens on a clinical and molecular level can provide more accurate, timely, and useful answers, especially in critical illness and diagnostic uncertainty. Improvements in understanding the human immune response including genomics, protein analysis, gene expression, and cellular morphology have led to rapid innovation of new host response-based diagnostic tests. This review describes the limitations of pathogen-focused technology and the benefits of examining the breadth of immune response to diagnose infection. It then explores biomarkers that have been studied for this purpose and scrutinizes the performance of host-based multianalyte testing.

33667294,The State of Microbiome Science at the Intersection of Infectious Diseases and Antimicrobial Resistance.,"Along with the rise in modern chronic diseases, ranging from diabetes to asthma, there are challenges posed by increasing antibiotic resistance, which results in difficult-to-treat infections, as well as sepsis. An emerging and unifying theme in the pathogenesis of these diverse public health threats is changes in the microbial communities that inhabit multiple body sites. Although there is great promise in exploring the role of these microbial communities in chronic disease pathogenesis, the shorter timeframe of most infectious disease pathogenesis may allow early translation of our basic scientific understanding of microbial ecology and host-microbiota-pathogen interactions. Likely translation avenues include development of preventive strategies, diagnostics, and therapeutics. For example, as basic research related to microbial pathogenesis continues to progress, Clostridioides difficile infection is already being addressed clinically through at least 2 of these 3 avenues: targeted antibiotic stewardship and treatment of recurrent disease through fecal microbiota transplantation.",The Journal of infectious diseases,2021-Jun,"Ranallo RT, McDonald LC, Halpin AL, Hiltke T, Young VB",5,1098,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34502556,The Roles of c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase (JNK) in Infectious Diseases.,"c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) are among the most crucial mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and regulate various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, and inflammation. Microbes heavily rely on cellular signaling pathways for their effective replication; hence, JNKs may play important roles in infectious diseases. In this review, we describe the basic signaling properties of MAPKs and JNKs in apoptosis, autophagy, and inflammasome activation. Furthermore, we discuss the roles of JNKs in various infectious diseases induced by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, as well as their potential to serve as targets for the development of therapeutic agents for infectious diseases. We expect this review to expand our understanding of the JNK signaling pathway's role in infectious diseases and provide important clues for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2021-Sep,"Chen J, Ye C, Wan C, Li G, Peng L, Peng Y, Fang R",7,922,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34034912,What can phylodynamics bring to animal health research?,"Infectious diseases are a major burden to global economies, and public and animal health. To date, quantifying the spread of infectious diseases to inform policy making has traditionally relied on epidemiological data collected during epidemics. However, interest has grown in recent phylodynamic techniques to infer pathogen transmission dynamics from genetic data. Here, we provide examples of where this new discipline has enhanced disease management in public health and illustrate how it could be further applied in animal health. In particular, we describe how phylodynamics can address fundamental epidemiological questions, such as inferring key transmission parameters in animal populations and quantifying spillover events at the wildlife-livestock interface, and generate important insights for the design of more effective control strategies.",Trends in ecology & evolution,2021-Sep,"Guinat C, Vergne T, Kocher A, Chakraborty D, Paul MC, Ducatez M, Stadler T",7,854,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32070807,Infectious diseases occurring in the context of substance use disorders: A concise review.,"Prevalence of infectious diseases is substantially higher among patients with substance use disorders (SUD). Factors associated with drug use including sharing needles and injecting supplies, presence of contaminants in drugs and drug use related paraphernalia, risky behaviors associated with drug use, immune suppression secondary to chronic drug use, poverty and homelessness all increase the risk of infections. Persons with SUD have low rates of health care utilization and may miss opportunities for early diagnosis and care of infectious complications of substance use. When infectious diseases are comorbid with drug use, they are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and result in significant healthcare costs. Patients with SUD may be rescued from an overdose, detoxified or treated for a SUD but facilities and clinicians are often reluctant to assume responsibility for evaluation and treatment of concurrent infectious or medical diseases. Increased screening for these disorders, utilizing vaccinations and other preventative strategies including clean supplies and safe injecting sites and providing comprehensive substance use and infectious disease treatment have the potential to significantly improve patient related outcomes and enhance public health. In this paper we review the prevalence of various common infectious diseases among persons who use drugs, their clinical presentation, mode of transmission, screening and diagnosis. We detail some of the common mechanisms by which persons who use drugs are at increased risk of contracting infections. We also discuss preventive and treatment strategies for infectious diseases occurring in the context of SUD.",Journal of the neurological sciences,2020-Apr,"Kolla BP, Oesterle T, Gold M, Southwick F, Rummans T",5,1697,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33804605,Infectious Diseases Seeker (IDS): An Innovative Tool for Prompt Identification of Infectious Diseases during Outbreaks.,"Several technologies for rapid molecular identification of pathogens are currently available; jointly with monitoring tools (i.e., web-based surveillance tools, infectious diseases modelers, and epidemic intelligence methods), they represent important components for timely outbreak detection and identification of the involved pathogen. The application of these approaches is usually feasible and effective when performed by healthcare professionals with specific expertise and skills and when data and resources are easily accessible. Contrariwise, in the field situation where healthcare workers or first responders from heterogeneous competences can be asked to investigate an outbreak of unknown origin, a simple and suitable tool for rapid agent identification and appropriate outbreak management is highly needed. Most especially when time is limited, available data are incomplete, and accessible infrastructure and resources are inadequate. The use of a prompt, user-friendly, and accessible tool able to rapidly recognize an infectious disease outbreak and with high sensitivity and precision may be a game-changer to support emergency response and public health investigations. This paper presents the work performed to implement and test an innovative tool for prompt identification of infectious diseases during outbreaks, called Infectious Diseases Seeker (IDS). IDS is a standalone software that runs on the most common operative systems. It has been built by integrating a database containing an interim set of 60 different disease causative agents and COVID-19 data and is able to work in an off-line mode without requiring a network connection. IDS has been applied in a real and complex scenario in terms of concomitant infectious diseases (yellow fever, COVID-19, and Lassa fever), as can be in the second part of 2020 in Nigeria. The outcomes have allowed inferring that yellow fever (YF), and not Lassa fever, was affecting the area under investigation. Our result suggests that a tool like IDS could be valuable for the quick and easy identification and discrimination of infectious disease outbreaks even when concurrent outbreaks occur, like for the case study of YF and COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021-Mar,"Baldassi F, Carestia M, Moramarco S, Malizia A, Gaudio P",5,2225,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
31734357,Sniffing animals as a diagnostic tool in infectious diseases.,"Scents and odours characterize some microbes when grown in the laboratory, and experienced clinicians can diagnose patients with some infectious diseases based on their smell. Animal sniffing is an innate behaviour, and animals' olfactory acuity is used for detecting people, weapons, bombs, narcotics and food. We briefly summarized current knowledge regarding the use of sniffing animals to diagnose some infectious diseases and the potential use of scent-based diagnostic instruments in microbiology. Information was sought through PubMed and extracted from peer-reviewed literature published between January 2000 and September 2019 and from reliable online news. The search terms 'odour', 'scent', 'bacteria', 'diagnostics', 'tuberculosis', 'malaria' and 'volatile compounds' were used. Four major areas of using sniffing animals are summarized. Dogs have been used to reliably detect stool associated with toxigenic Clostridioides difficile and for surveillance. Dogs showed high sensitivity and moderate specificity for detecting urinary tract infections in comparison to culture, especially for Escherichia coli. African giant pouched rats showed superiority for diagnosing tuberculosis over microscopy, but inferiority to culture/molecular methods. Several approaches for detecting malaria by analysing host skin odour or exhaled breath have been explored successfully. Some microbial infections produce specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can be analysed by spectrometry, metabolomics or other analytical approaches to replace animal sniffing. The results of sniffing animal studies are fascinating, and animal sniffing can provide intermediate diagnostic solutions for some infectious diseases. Lack of reproducibility, and cost of animal training and housing are major drawbacks for wider implementation of sniffing animals. The ultimate goal is to understand the biological background of this animal ability and to characterize the specific VOCs that animals are recognizing. VOC identification, improvement of odour sampling methods and development of point-of-care instruments could allow implementation of scent-based tests for major human pathogens.",Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,2020-Apr,"Cambau E, Poljak M",2,2179,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Simulated causality inference experiments have shown preliminary promise in improving understanding of the transmission of infectious diseases but still lack sufficient quantitative causal inference studies based on real-world data. Here, we investigate the causal interactions between three different infectious diseases and related factors, using causal decomposition analysis, to characterize the nature of infectious disease transmission. We show that the complex interactions between infectious disease and human behavior have a quantifiable impact on transmission efficiency of infectious diseases.

34024014,Transdermal drug delivery systems for fighting common viral infectious diseases.,"Transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) have many advantages and represent an excellent alternative to oral delivery and hypodermic injections. TDDS are more convenient and less invasive tools for disease and viral infection treatment, prevention, detection, and surveillance. The emerging development of microneedles for TDDS has facilitated improved skin barrier penetration for the delivery of macromolecules or hydrophilic drugs. Microneedle TDDS patches can be fabricated to deliver virus vaccines and potentially provide a viable alternative vaccine modality that offers improved immunogenicity, thermostability, simplicity, safety, and compliance as well as sharp-waste reduction, increased cost-effectiveness, and the capacity for self-administration, which could improve vaccine distribution. These advantages make TDDS-based vaccine delivery an especially well-suited option for treatment of widespread viral infectious diseases including pandemics. Because microneedle-based bioassays employ transdermal extraction of interstitial fluid or blood, they can be used as a minimally invasive approach for surveying disease markers and providing point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. For cutaneous viral infections, TDDS can provide localized treatment with high specificity and less systemic toxicity. In summary, TDDS, especially those that employ microneedles, possess special attributes that can be leveraged to reduce morbidity and mortality from viral infectious diseases. In this regard, they may have considerable positive impact as a modality for improving global health. In this article, we introduce the possible role and summarize the current literature regarding TDDS applications for fighting common cutaneous or systemic viral infectious diseases, including herpes simplex, varicella or herpes zoster, warts, influenza, measles, and COVID-19.",Drug delivery and translational research,2021-Aug,"Wang FY, Chen Y, Huang YY, Cheng CM",4,1859,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37919210,Leveraging Donor Populations to Study the Epidemiology and Pathogenesis of Transfusion-Transmitted and Emerging Infectious Diseases.,"The tragedy of transfusion-associated hepatitis and HIV spurred a decades-long overhaul of the regulatory oversight and practice of blood transfusion. Consequent to improved donor selection, testing, process control, clinical transfusion practice and post-transfusion surveillance, transfusion in the United States and other high-income countries is now a very safe medical procedure. Nonetheless, pathogens continue to emerge and threaten the blood supply, highlighting the need for a proactive approach to blood transfusion safety. Blood donor populations and the global transfusion infrastructure are under-utilized resources for the study of infectious diseases. Blood donors are large, demographically diverse subsets of general populations for whom cross-sectional and longitudinal samples are readily accessible for serological and molecular testing. Blood donor collection networks span diverse geographies, including in low- and middle-income countries, where agents, especially zoonotic pathogens, are able to emerge and spread, given limited tools for recognition, surveillance and control. Routine laboratory storage and transportation, coupled with data capture, afford access to rich epidemiological data to assess the epidemiology and pathogenesis of established and emerging infections. Subsequent to the State of the Science in Transfusion Medicine symposium in 2022, our working group (WG), ""Emerging Infections: Impact on Blood Science, the Blood Supply, Blood Safety, and Public Health"" elected to focus on ""leveraging donor populations to study the epidemiology and pathogenesis of transfusion-transmitted and emerging infectious diseases."" The 5 landmark studies span (1) the implication of hepatitis C virus in post-transfusion hepatitis, (2) longitudinal evaluation of plasma donors with incident infections, thus informing the development of a widely used staging system for acute HIV infection, (3) explication of the dynamics of early West Nile Virus infection, (4) the deployment of combined molecular and serological donor screening for Babesia microti, to characterize its epidemiology and infectivity and facilitate routine donor screening, and (5) national serosurveillance for SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The purpose of this article is to present a framework for research and practice response to emergent infectious diseases that addresses multiple transdisciplinary actions to limit exposure or mitigate adverse outcomes for individuals and communities. Recent experience with new strains of emergent infectious diseases reinforces the importance of intervening at multiple levels, from genomics to political messaging to create multipronged, transdisciplinary interventions to contain the threat.

38787222,Is Pollution the Primary Driver of Infectious Syndemics?,"Syndemics, the adverse interaction of two or more coterminous diseases or other negative health conditions, have probably existed since human settlement, plant and animal domestication, urbanization, and the growth of social inequality beginning about 10-12,000 years ago. These dramatic changes in human social evolution significantly increased opportunities for the spread of zoonotic infectious diseases in denser human communities with increased sanitation challenges. In light of a growing body of research that indicates that anthropogenic air pollution causes numerous threats to health and is taking a far greater toll on human life and wellbeing than had been reported, this paper proposes the possibility that air pollution is now the primary driver of infectious disease syndemics. In support of this assertion, this paper reviews the growth and health impacts of air pollution, the relationship of air pollution to the development and spread of infectious diseases, and reported cases of air pollution-driven infectious disease syndemics, and presents public health recommendations for leveraging the biosocial insight of syndemic theory in responding to infectious disease.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2024-Apr,Singer M,1,1186,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

In this work, we intended to investigate the diagnostic value and clinical acceptance of paired-samples mNGS as compared to the culture method. A total of 361 patients with suspected infection were retrospectively included. With reference to the clinical diagnosis, we compared the diagnostic performance and clinical acceptance in pathogen detection between mNGS and culture tests. Moreover, the pathogen concordance of paired blood and respiratory tract (RT) samples in mNGS assay was investigated. Among 511 samples, 62.04% were shown to be pathogen positive by mNGS, and that for clinical diagnosis was 51.86% (265/511). When compared to culture assay (<i>n</i> = 428), mNGS had a significantly higher positivity rate (51.87% vs. 33.18%). With reference to the clinical diagnosis, the sensitivity of mNGS outperformed that of culture (89.08% vs. 56.72%). Importantly, mNGS exhibited a clinically accepted rate significantly superior to that of culture. In addition, the mNGS result from 53 paired blood and RT samples showed that most pairs were pathogen positive by both blood and RT, with pathogens largely being partially matched. Through this large-scale study, we further illustrated that mNGS had a clinically accepted rate and sensitivity superior to those of the traditional culture method in diagnosing infections. Moreover, blood and paired RT samples mostly shared partial-matched positive pathogens, especially for pathogens with abundant read numbers in RT, indicating that both blood and RT mNGS can aid the identification of pathogens for respiratory system infection.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2024-,"Li Z, Tan L, Zhang J, Long Q, Chen Z, Xiang Z, Wu W, Guo Z, Liu H, Hu B, Yang B, Hu M",12,1710,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This paper explored the significance of mathematical modeling in epidemic control efforts, focusing on the interplay between vaccination strategies, disease transmission rates, and population immunity. To facilitate meaningful comparisons of vaccination strategies, we maintained a consistent framework by fixing the vaccination capacity to vary from 10 to 100% of the total population. As an example, at a 50% vaccination capacity, the pulse strategy averted approximately 45.61% of deaths, while continuous and hybrid strategies averted around 45.18 and 45.69%, respectively. Sensitivity analysis further indicated that continuous vaccination has a more direct impact on reducing the basic reproduction number $ R_0 $ compared to pulse vaccination. By analyzing key parameters such as $ R_0 $, pulse vaccination coefficients, and continuous vaccination parameters, the study underscores the value of mathematical modeling in shaping public health policies and guiding decision-making during disease outbreaks.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2024-Sep,"Bolatova D, Kadyrov S, Kashkynbayev A",3,1197,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Microbiologists are often part of such teams, along with public health specialists, clinicians and entomologists, and can contribute to the response in multiple ways. The role of a microbiologist is critical not only for laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases, but also for situational analysis and evaluation, planning, prevention and control. The task begins with risk assessment, specifically for identification of diseases epidemic and endemic to the area. Evaluation of existing laboratory setups and establishment of services where none exist is a priority, including facilitation of a tiered laboratory system. Training of laboratory staff at short notice in field settings, biosafety and biomedical waste management are niche areas where microbiologists can contribute. Emerging focus areas include establishment of modular laboratories, infection prevention and control in community evacuation centres and considerations for reopening of healthcare facilities closed due to extensive natural damage.

31284037,Profiling infectious diseases in Turkey after the influx of 3.5 million Syrian refugees.,"Since 2011, the conflict in Syria has led to over five million refugees. Turkey hosts the highest number of Syrian refugees in the world. By February 2019 over 3.6 million people had fled to Turkey to seek safety. Only 6.1% of Syrian refugees live in temporary shelters. Owing to the disrupted healthcare services, many children coming from the conflict zones are less likely to have received vaccination. In temporary shelters immunization coverage is >95% and the refugee population is receptive to vaccination. The objective of this study was to review the infectious diseases situation among Syrian refugees in Turkey. We have reviewed the reports and studies provided by the governmental and non-governmental organizations and obtained more detailed data from the Ministry of Health in Turkey. Between 2012 and 2016, 1 299 209 cases of respiratory tract infection and 158 058 episodes of diarrhoea with 59 bloody diarrhoeas were reported; 1354 hepatitis A cases and 108 active tuberculosis cases were detected and treated in the temporary shelters for Syrian refugees. Overall in Turkey, 7794 cutaneous leishmaniasis have been reported. Since the influx of Syrian refugees, there has been an increase in cases of leishmaniasis and measles. No significant increase was detected for tuberculosis, other vector-borne infections, and healthcare associated or sexually transmitted infections. The Syrian refugees can be considered as a vulnerable group in Turkey due to their living and working conditions.

33897683,Modulatory Effects of Probiotics During Pathogenic Infections With Emphasis on Immune Regulation.,"In order to inhibit pathogenic complications and to enhance animal and poultry growth, antibiotics have been extensively used for many years. Antibiotics applications not only affect target pathogens but also intestinal beneficially microbes, inducing long-lasting changes in intestinal microbiota associated with diseases. The application of antibiotics also has many other side effects like, intestinal barrier dysfunction, antibiotics residues in foodstuffs, nephropathy, allergy, bone marrow toxicity, mutagenicity, reproductive disorders, hepatotoxicity carcinogenicity, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which greatly compromise the efficacy of antibiotics. Thus, the development of new antibiotics is necessary, while the search for antibiotic alternatives continues. Probiotics are considered the ideal antibiotic substitute; in recent years, probiotic research concerning their application during pathogenic infections in humans, aquaculture, poultry, and livestock industry, with emphasis on modulating the immune system of the host, has been attracting considerable interest. Hence, the adverse effects of antibiotics and remedial effects of probiotics during infectious diseases have become central points of focus among researchers. Probiotics are live microorganisms, and when given in adequate quantities, confer good health effects to the host through different mechanisms. Among them, the regulation of host immune response during pathogenic infections is one of the most important mechanisms. A number of studies have investigated different aspects of probiotics. In this review, we mainly summarize recent discoveries and discuss two important aspects: (1) the application of probiotics during pathogenic infections; and (2) their modulatory effects on the immune response of the host during infectious and non-infectious diseases.",Frontiers in immunology,2021-,"Raheem A, Liang L, Zhang G, Cui S",4,1851,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The first step towards improved livestock health and productivity is to map the presence of livestock diseases. The objective of this review was to summarize studies conducted on such diseases in an emerging economy, Vietnam, and thereby identifying knowledge gaps that may inform the design of surveillance and control programs. Few studies were found to evaluate the distribution of infectious livestock diseases other than avian influenza. Also, many regions with dense livestock populations had received little attention in terms of disease investigation. A large proportion of the studies dealt with zoonoses and food-borne infections which might be due to funding agencies priorities. On the contrary, studies targeting infections that affect livestock and their productivity were few. We think that this limitation in scientific reports on infectious diseases that only affect livestock productivity is a common phenomenon in low and lower middle income countries. More science-based data on such diseases would help policymakers to prioritize which livestock diseases should be subject to animal health programs aimed to support rural livelihoods and economic development.",Animal health research reviews,2021-Jun,"Rajala E, Lee HS, Nam NH, Huong CTT, Son HM, Wieland B, Magnusson U",7,1316,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

34611689,Nanomedicine as a promising strategy for the theranostics of infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi and their global spread pose a great threat to human health. The 2019 World Health Organization report predicted that infection-related mortality will be similar to cancer mortality by 2050. Particularly, the global cumulative numbers of the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have reached 110.7 million cases and over 2.4 million deaths as of February 23, 2021. Moreover, the crisis of these infectious diseases exposes the many problems of traditional diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, such as time-consuming and unselective detection methods, the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, serious side effects, and poor drug delivery. There is an urgent need for rapid and sensitive diagnosis as well as high efficacy and low toxicity treatments. The emergence of nanomedicine has provided a promising strategy to greatly enhance detection methods and drug treatment efficacy. Owing to their unique optical, magnetic, and electrical properties, nanoparticles (NPs) have great potential for the fast and selective detection of bacteria, viruses, and fungi. NPs exhibit remarkable antibacterial activity by releasing reactive oxygen species and metal ions, exerting photothermal effects, and causing destruction of the cell membrane. Nano-based delivery systems can further improve drug permeability, reduce the side effects of drugs, and prolong systemic circulation time and drug half-life. Moreover, effective drugs against COVID-19 are still lacking. Recently, nanomedicine has shown great potential to accelerate the development of safe and novel anti-COVID-19 drugs. This article reviews the fundamental mechanisms and the latest developments in the treatment and diagnosis of bacteria, viruses, and fungi and discusses the challenges and perspectives in the application of nanomedicine.",Journal of materials chemistry.

33058533,"The potential of diagnostic point-of-care tests (POCTs) for infectious and zoonotic animal diseases in developing countries: Technical, regulatory and sociocultural considerations.","Remote and rural communities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately affected by infectious animal diseases due to their close contact with livestock and limited access to animal health personnel). However, animal disease surveillance and diagnosis in LMICs is often challenging, and turnaround times between sample submission and diagnosis can take days to weeks. This diagnostic gap and subsequent disease under-reporting can allow emerging and transboundary animal pathogens to spread, with potentially serious and far-reaching consequences. Point-of-care tests (POCTs), which allow for rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases in non-laboratory settings, have the potential to significantly disrupt traditional animal health surveillance paradigms in LMICs. This literature review sought to identify POCTs currently available for diagnosing infectious animal diseases and to determine facilitators and barriers to their use and uptake in LMICs. Results indicated that some veterinary POCTs have been used for field-based animal disease diagnosis in LMICs with good results. However, many POCTs target a small number of key agricultural and zoonotic animal diseases, while few exist for other important animal diseases. POCT evaluation is rarely taken beyond the laboratory and into the field where they are predicted to have the greatest impact, and where conditions can greatly affect test performance. A lack of mandated test validation regulations for veterinary POCTs has allowed tests of varying quality to enter the market, presenting challenges for potential customers. The use of substandard, improperly validated or unsuitable POCTs in LMICs can greatly undermine their true potential and can have far-reaching negative impacts on disease control. To successfully implement novel rapid diagnostic pathways for animal disease in LMICs, technical, regulatory, socio-political and economic challenges must be overcome, and further research is urgently needed before the potential of animal disease POCTs can be fully realized.",Transboundary and emerging diseases,2021-Jul,"Hobbs EC, Colling A, Gurung RB, Allen J",4,2061,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

NTDs have remained largely unnoticed in the global health agenda. There is a substantial gap between the burden of disease for NTDs in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and research devoted to the affected populations. We created a Latin-American initiative with emerging leaders (EL) from the Interamerican Society of Cardiology (IASC) with the objective to perform multiple systematic reviews of NTDs and other infectious diseases affecting the heart: The NET-Heart Project. To describe the rationale and design considerations of the NET-Heart project. The NET-Heart Project is a collaborative work of the IASC EL program. The main objective of the NET-Heart project is to systematically evaluate the available evidence of NTDs and other infectious diseases and their cardiovascular involvement. As a secondary objective, this initiative aims to offer recommendations and potential diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms that can aid the management of cardiovascular complications of these infectious diseases. After an expert discussion 17 initial infectious diseases were selected, for each disease we created one working group. The project was structured in different phases: Systematic review, brainstorming workshops, analysis and results, manuscript writing and recommendations and evaluation of clinical implications. The NET-Heart project is an innovative collaborative initiative created to assess burden and impact of NTDs and other infectious diseases in CVD.

39241918,Artificial intelligence with mass spectrometry-based multimodal molecular profiling methods for advancing therapeutic discovery of infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases, driven by a diverse array of pathogens, can swiftly undermine public health systems. Accurate diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases-centered around the identification of biomarkers and the elucidation of disease mechanisms-are in dire need of more versatile and practical analytical approaches. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based molecular profiling methods can deliver a wealth of information on a range of functional molecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, and metabolites. While MS-driven omics analyses can yield vast datasets, the sheer complexity and multi-dimensionality of MS data can significantly hinder the identification and characterization of functional molecules within specific biological processes and events. Artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a potent complementary tool that can substantially enhance the processing and interpretation of MS data. AI applications in this context lead to the reduction of spurious signals, the improvement of precision, the creation of standardized analytical frameworks, and the increase of data integration efficiency. This critical review emphasizes the pivotal roles of MS based omics strategies in the discovery of biomarkers and the clarification of infectious diseases. Additionally, the review underscores the transformative ability of AI techniques to enhance the utility of MS-based molecular profiling in the field of infectious diseases by refining the quality and practicality of data produced from omics analyses. In conclusion, we advocate for a forward-looking strategy that integrates AI with MS-based molecular profiling. This integration aims to transform the analytical landscape and the performance of biological molecule characterization, potentially down to the single-cell level. Such advancements are anticipated to propel the development of AI-driven predictive models, thus improving the monitoring of diagnostics and therapeutic discovery for the ongoing challenge related to infectious diseases.",Pharmacology & therapeutics,2024-Nov,"Liu J, Bao C, Zhang J, Han Z, Fang H, Lu H",6,2011,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

China and the USA-due to their unparalleled resources, widespread engagement in activities driving emerging infectious diseases and national as well as geopolitical imperatives to contribute to global health security-play an essential role in our understanding of pandemic threats. Critical to efforts to mitigate risk is building upon existing investments in global capacity to develop training and research focused on the ecological factors driving infectious disease spillover from animals to humans. International cooperation, particularly between China and the USA, is essential to fully engage the resources and scientific strengths necessary to add this ecological emphasis to the pandemic preparedness strategy.

Among them, leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs) consist of activating and inhibitory receptors that play an important role in regulating immune responses modulating the course of disease progression. On the one hand, inhibitory LILRs constitute a safe-guard system that mitigates the inflammatory response, allowing a prompt return to immune homeostasis. On the other hand, because of their unique capacity to attenuate immune responses, pathogens use inhibitory LILRs to evade immune recognition, thus facilitating their persistence within the host. Conversely, the engagement of activating LILRs triggers immune responses and the production of inflammatory mediators to fight microbes. However, their heightened activation could lead to an exacerbated immune response and persistent inflammation with major consequences on disease outcome and autoimmune disorders. Here, we review the genetic organisation, structure and ligands of LILRs as well as their role in regulating the immune response and inflammation. We also discuss the LILR-based strategies that pathogens use to evade immune responses. A better understanding of the contribution of LILRs to host-pathogen interactions is essential to define appropriate treatments to counteract the severity and/or persistence of pathogens in acute and chronic infectious diseases lacking efficient treatments.",Frontiers in immunology,2021-,"Abdallah F, Coindre S, Gardet M, Meurisse F, Naji A, Suganuma N, Abi-Rached L, Lambotte O, Favier B",9,1530,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This is the salient question that this research inquiry unravels for 34 African economies from 2000 to 2017. The empirical evidence revealed the following through a generalized method of moments (SGMM) inter alia: First, the mitigating roles of infectious diseases, such as malaria, HIV prevalence rate and AIDS, on global FDI inflows are unconditionally certified from a statistical and economic sense. Second, the diminishing influences of other confounders, such as low per capita GDP, shallow financial development, excruciating inflationary trend, and natural resource rents curse, are empirically endorsed, on the one hand, while the persistent nature of FDI and trade openness as boosting mechanisms for FDI are unambiguously applauded, on the other hand. Finally, a reduction in the numerical strength of the estimates after accounting for the outliers' effect from the models and the inclusion of additional controls do not diminish the robustness of already established findings, except for the HIV prevalence rate.

31538184,From the Pipeline to the Bedside: Advances and Challenges in Clinical Metagenomics.,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized multiple areas in the field of infectious diseases, from pathogen discovery to characterization of genes mediating drug resistance. Consequently, there is much anticipation that NGS technologies may be harnessed in the realm of diagnostic methods to complement or replace current culture-based and molecular microbiologic techniques. In this context, much consideration has been given to hypothesis-free, culture-independent tests that can be performed directly on primary clinical samples. The closest realizations of such universal diagnostic methods achieved to date are based on targeted amplicon and unbiased metagenomic shotgun NGS approaches. Depending on the exact details of implementation and analysis, these approaches have the potential to detect viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and archaea, including organisms that were previously undiscovered and those that are uncultivatable. Shotgun metagenomics approaches additionally can provide information on the presence of virulence and resistance genetic elements. While many limitations to the use of NGS in clinical microbiology laboratories are being overcome with decreasing technology costs, expanding curated pathogen sequence databases, and better data analysis tools, there remain many challenges to the routine use and implementation of these methods. This review summarizes recent advances in applications of targeted amplicon and shotgun-based metagenomics approaches to infectious disease diagnostic methods.

37335437,SPADE4: Sparsity and Delay Embedding Based Forecasting of Epidemics.,"Predicting the evolution of diseases is challenging, especially when the data availability is scarce and incomplete. The most popular tools for modelling and predicting infectious disease epidemics are compartmental models. They stratify the population into compartments according to health status and model the dynamics of these compartments using dynamical systems. However, these predefined systems may not capture the true dynamics of the epidemic due to the complexity of the disease transmission and human interactions. In order to overcome this drawback, we propose Sparsity and Delay Embedding based Forecasting (SPADE4) for predicting epidemics. SPADE4 predicts the future trajectory of an observable variable without the knowledge of the other variables or the underlying system. We use random features model with sparse regression to handle the data scarcity issue and employ Takens' delay embedding theorem to capture the nature of the underlying system from the observed variable.

It is imperative to understand the best available evidence concerning which public health interventions reduce morbidity, mortality and health inequalities in children aged under five years. To address this gap, we carried out an umbrella review (a systematic reviews of reviews) to identify evidence on the effects of public health interventions (promotion, protection, prevention) on morbidity, mortality and/or health inequalities due to infectious diseases amongst children in LMICs. Ten databases were searched for records published between 2014-2021 alongside a manual search of gray literature. Articles were quality-assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews tool (AMSTAR 2). A narrative synthesis was conducted. We identified 60 systematic reviews synthesizing 453 individual primary studies. A majority of the reviews reported on preventive interventions (n = 48), with a minority on promotion (n = 17) and almost no reviews covering health protection interventions (n = 2). Effective interventions for improving child health across the whole population, as well as the most disadvantaged included communication, education and social mobilization for specific preventive services or tools, such as immunization or bed nets. For all other interventions, the effects were either unclear, unknown or detrimental, either at the overall population level or regarding health inequalities. We found few reviews reporting health inequalities information and the quality of the evidence base was generally low.

36707203,Exploring the role of secretory proteins in the human infectious diseases diagnosis and therapeutics.,"Secretory proteins are playing important role during the host-pathogen interaction to develop the infection or protection into the cell. Pathogens developing infectious disease to human being are taken up by host macrophages or number of immune cells, play an important role in physiological, developmental and immunological function. At the same time, infectious agents are also secreting various proteins to neutralize the resistance caused by host cells and also helping the pathogens to develop the infection. Secretory proteins (secretome) are only developed at the time of host-pathogen interaction, therefore they become very important to develop the targeted and potential therapeutic strategies. Pathogen specific secretory proteins released during interaction with host cell provide opportunity to develop point of care and rapid diagnostic kits. Proteins secreted by pathogens at the time of interaction with host cell have also been found as immunogenic in nature and numbers of vaccines have been developed to control the spread of human infectious diseases.

The sheer diversity of pathogens, AMR mechanisms, and transmission pathways connecting these reservoirs create the need for comprehensive cross-sectoral surveillance to effectively monitor risks. Current approaches are often siloed by discipline and sector, focusing independently on parts of the whole. Here we advocate that integrated surveillance approaches, developed through transdisciplinary cross-sector collaboration, are key to addressing the dual crises of infectious diseases and AMR. We first review the areas of need, challenges, and benefits of cross-sectoral surveillance, then summarise and evaluate the major detection methods already available to achieve this (culture, quantitative PCR, and metagenomic sequencing). Finally, we outline how cross-sectoral surveillance initiatives can be fostered at multiple scales of action, and present key considerations for implementation and the development of effective systems to manage and integrate this information for the benefit of multiple sectors.

39411713,Future applications of host direct therapies for infectious disease treatment.,"New and emerging pathogens, such as SARS-CoV2 have highlighted the requirement for threat agnostic therapies. Some antibiotics or antivirals can demonstrate broad-spectrum activity against pathogens in the same family or genus but efficacy can quickly reduce due to their specific mechanism of action and for the ability of the disease causing agent to evolve. This has led to the generation of antimicrobial resistant strains, making infectious diseases more difficult to treat. Alternative approaches therefore need to be considered, which include exploring the utility of Host-Directed Therapies (HDTs). This is a growing area with huge potential but difficulties arise due to the complexity of disease profiles. For example, a HDT given early during infection may not be appropriate or as effective when the disease has become chronic or when a patient is in intensive care. With the growing understanding of immune function, a new generation of HDT for the treatment of disease could allow targeting specific pathways to augment or diminish the host response, dependent upon disease profile, and allow for bespoke therapeutic management plans. This review highlights promising and approved HDTs that can manipulate the immune system throughout the spectrum of disease, in particular to viral and bacterial pathogens, and demonstrates how the advantages of HDT will soon outweigh the potential side effects.",Frontiers in immunology,2024-,"Thom RE, D'Elia RV",2,1411,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

These include epilepsy, dementia, motor neuron diseases, headache disorders, sleep disorders, and peripheral neuropathy. The highest prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is in SSA. Consequently, there is a high prevalence of neurological disorders associated with HIV infection such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, motor disorders, chronic headaches, and peripheral neuropathy in the region. The pathogenesis of these neurological disorders involves the direct role of the virus, some antiretroviral treatments, and the dysregulated immune system. Furthermore, the high prevalence of epilepsy in SSA (mainly due to perinatal causes) is exacerbated by infections such as toxoplasmosis, neurocysticercosis, onchocerciasis, malaria, bacterial meningitis, tuberculosis, and the immune reactions they elicit. Sleep disorders are another common problem in the region and have been associated with infectious diseases such as human African trypanosomiasis and HIV and involve the activation of the immune system. While most headache disorders are due to benign primary headaches, some secondary headaches are caused by infections (meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess). HIV and neurosyphilis, both common in SSA, can trigger long-standing immune activation in the central nervous system (CNS) potentially resulting in dementia. Despite the progress achieved in preventing diseases from the poliovirus and retroviruses, these microbes may cause motor neuron diseases in SSA.

34328626,The Potential Role of Clinical Metagenomics in Infectious Diseases: Therapeutic Perspectives.,"Clinical metagenomics (CMg) is the process of sequencing nucleic acid of clinical samples to obtain clinically relevant information such as the identification of microorganisms and their susceptibility to antimicrobials. Over the last decades, sequencing and bioinformatic solutions supporting CMg have much evolved and an increasing number of case reports and series covering various infectious diseases have been published. Metagenomics is a new approach to infectious disease diagnosis that is currently being developed and is certainly one of the most promising for the coming years. However, most CMg studies are retrospective, and few address the potential impact CMg could have on patient management, including initiation, adaptation, or cessation of antimicrobials. In this narrative review, we have discussed the potential role of CMg in bacteriology, virology, mycology, and parasitology. Several reports and case-series confirm that CMg is an innovative tool with which one can (i) identify more microorganisms than with conventional methods in a single test, (ii) obtain results within hours, and (iii) tailor the antimicrobial regimen of patients. However, the cost-efficiency of CMg and its real impact on patient management are still to be determined.",Drugs,2021-Sep,"d'Humières C, Salmona M, Dellière S, Leo S, Rodriguez C, Angebault C, Alanio A, Fourati S, Lazarevic V, Woerther PL, Schrenzel J, Ruppé E",12,1266,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39978973,Exploring immunotherapy to control human infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases continue to pose significant challenges to global health, especially with the rise of antibiotic resistance and emerging pathogens. Traditional treatments, while effective, are often limited in the face of rapidly evolving pathogens. Immunotherapy, which harnesses and enhances the body's immune response, offers a promising alternative to conventional approaches for the treatment of infectious diseases. By employing use of monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, cytokine therapies, and immune checkpoint inhibitors, immunotherapy has demonstrated considerable potential in overcoming treatment resistance and improving patient outcomes. Key innovations, including the development of mRNA vaccines, use of immune modulators, adoptive cell transfer, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy are paving the way for more targeted pathogen clearance. Further, combining immunotherapy with conventional antibiotic treatment has demonstrated effectiveness against drug-resistant strains, but this chapter explores the evolving field of immunotherapy for the treatment of bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic infections. The chapter also explores the recent breakthroughs and ongoing clinical trials in infectious disease immunotherapy.",Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology,2025-,"Rai P, Mehrotra S, Prajapati VK",3,1258,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38843434,Climate change and resilience for antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention.,"This review covers recent research regarding the challenges posed by climate change within the areas of antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention, and ways to build resiliency in these fields. Infectious disease patterns are changing as microbes adapt to climate change and changing environmental factors. Capacity for testing and treating infectious diseases is challenged by newly emerging diseases, which exacerbate challenges to antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention.Antimicrobial resistance is accelerated due to environmental factors including air pollution, plastic pollution, and chemicals used in food systems, which are all impacted by climate change.Climate change places infection prevention practices at risk in many ways including from major weather events, increased risk of epidemics, and societal disruptions causing conditions that can overwhelm health systems. Researchers are building resilience by advancing rapid diagnostics and disease modeling, and identifying highly reliable versus low efficiency interventions. Climate change and associated major weather and socioeconomic events will place significant strain on healthcare facilities. Work being done to advance rapid diagnostics, build supply chain resilience, improve predictive disease modeling and surveillance, and identify high reliability versus low yield interventions will help build resiliency in antimicrobial stewardship and infection prevention for escalating challenges due to climate change.",Current opinion in infectious diseases,2024-Aug,"Abeles SR, Kline A, Lee P",3,1506,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37232310,Reshaping surveillance for infectious diseases: less chasing of pathogens and more monitoring of drivers.,"Animal health surveillance, despite its name, tends to focus on looking for disease. Often this involves searching for cases of infection with known pathogens (â€˜pathogen chasing'). Such an approach is both resource intensive and limited by the requirement for prior knowledge of disease likelihood. In this paper, the authors propose the gradual reshaping of surveillance towards the systems level, focusing on the processes (â€˜drivers') that promote disease or health, rather than on the presence or absence of specific pathogens. Examples of relevant drivers include land-use change, increasing global interconnectedness, and finance and capital flows. Importantly, the authors suggest that surveillance should focus on detecting changes in patterns or quantities associated with such drivers. This would generate systems-level, risk-based surveillance information to identify areas where additional attention may be needed, and, over time, inform the implementation of prevention efforts. The collection, integration and analysis of data on drivers is likely to require investment in improving data infrastructures. A period of overlap would allow the two systems (traditional surveillance and driver monitoring) to be compared and calibrated. This would also lead to a better understanding of the drivers and their linkages, and thereby generate new knowledge that can improve surveillance and inform mitigation efforts. Since surveillance of drivers may give signals when changes are occurring, which could act as alerts and enable targeted mitigation, this might even enable disease to be prevented before it happens by directly intervening in the drivers themselves. Such surveillance focused on the drivers could be expected to bring additional benefits, since the same drivers promote multiple diseases. Further, focusing on drivers rather than pathogens should enable control of currently unknown diseases, making this approach particularly timely, given the increasing risk of emergence of new diseases.",Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),2023-May,"Drewe JA, George J, Hasler B",3,2017,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38764304,Analysis and mapping of global research publications on point-of-care testing for infectious diseases.,"This study presents the first comprehensive analysis and mapping of scientific research on point-of-care testing (POCT) in infectious diseases, filling a gap in understanding the evolving landscape of this field. The identification of research themes and global contributions offers valuable insights. This manuscript aims to analyse and map scientific research on POCT in the context of infectious diseases. The study employed a comprehensive search strategy using terms related to POCT and infectious diseases. The search was conducted on the Scopus database, refining results based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The dataset of 1719 research articles was then subjected to descriptive analysis and mapping using VOSviewer. The research findings indicate an exponential growth in POCT-related publications, with 46.8% published post the COVID-19 pandemic. Plos One journal led in publication frequency, and Biosensors and Bioelectronics received the highest citations per article. North America and Western Europe dominated contributions, with notable participation from China, South Africa, and India. The research landscape revealed the following research themes: detection technologies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis, antibiotic optimisation, and schistosomiasis. Clinical trials focused on antibiotic prescribing, HIV, STIs, and specific infections. The findings suggest a shifting landscape towards POCT, emphasising the need for future planning and investment in healthcare systems. The research identifies areas for future exploration, such as the impact of POCT on antibiotic prescribing and its role in combating infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries. Implementation of POCT has the potential to revolutionise infectious disease management, improve patient outcomes, and reduce the global burden of diseases. Better public awareness, healthcare team management, and planning for POCT at entry points are crucial for societal benefit. Results demonstrated the evolving role of POCT in infectious disease management and prevention.",Journal of evaluation in clinical practice,2024-Sep,Sweileh WM,1,2116,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33527632,Emerging infectious disease: An underappreciated area of strategic concern for food security.,"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) increasingly threaten global food security and public health. Despite technological breakthroughs, we are losing the battle with (re)emerging diseases as treatment costs and production losses rise. A horizon scan of diseases of crops, livestock, seafood and food-borne illness suggests these costs are unsustainable. The paradigm of coevolution between pathogens and particular hosts teaches that emerging diseases occur only when pathogens evolve specific capacities that allow them to move to new hosts. EIDs ought to be rare and unpredictable, so crisis response is the best we can do. Alternatively, the Stockholm Paradigm suggests that the world is full of susceptible but unexposed hosts that pathogens could infect, given the opportunity. Global climate change, globalized trade and travel, urbanization and land-use changes (often associated with biodiversity loss) increase those opportunities, making EID frequent. We can, however, anticipate their arrival in new locations and their behaviour once they have arrived. We can 'find them before they find us', mitigating their impacts. The DAMA (Document, Assess, Monitor, Act) protocol alters the current reactive stance and embodies proactive solutions to anticipate and mitigate the impacts of EID, extending human and material resources and buying time for development of new vaccinations, medications and control measures.",Transboundary and emerging diseases,2022-Mar,"Brooks DR, Hoberg EP, Boeger WA, Trivellone V",4,1421,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35285684,Generation of Human Lung Organoid Cultures from Healthy and Tumor Tissue to Study Infectious Diseases.,"Respiratory viruses cause mild to severe diseases in humans every year, constituting a major public health problem. Characterizing the pathogenesis in physiologically relevant models is crucial for developing efficient vaccines and therapeutics. Here, we show that lung organoids derived from human primary or lung tumor tissue maintain the cellular composition and characteristics of the original tissue. Moreover, we show that these organoids sustain viral replication with particular infection foci formation, and they activate the expression of interferon-associated and proinflammatory genes responsible for mediating a robust innate immune response. All together, we show that three-dimensional (3D) lung organoids constitute a relevant platform to model diseases and enable the development of drug screenings. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Three-dimensional (3D) human lung organoids reflect the native cell composition of the lung as well as its physiological properties. Human 3D lung organoids offer ideal conditions, such as timely availability in large quantities and high physiological relevance for reassessment and prediction of disease outbreaks of respiratory pathogens and pathogens that use the lung as a primary entry portal. Human lung organoids can be used in basic research and diagnostic settings as early warning cell culture systems and also serve as a relevant platform for modeling infectious diseases and drug development. They can be used to characterize pathogens and analyze the influence of infection on, for example, immunological parameters, such as the expression of interferon-associated and proinflammatory genes in the context of cancer. In our study, we found that cancer-derived lung organoids were more sensitive to influenza A virus infection than those derived from healthy tissue and demonstrated a decreased innate immune response.",Journal of virology,2022-Apr,"Salgueiro L, Kummer S, Sonntag-Buck V, Weiß A, Schneider MA, Kräusslich HG, Sotillo R",7,1865,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Their small size, good tissue penetration, high stability and solubility, ease of expression, refolding ability, and negligible immunogenicity in the human body have granted them excellence over conventional antibodies. Those exceptional attributes of nanobodies make them promising candidates for various applications in biotechnology, medicine, protein engineering, structural biology, food, and agriculture. This review presents an overview of their structure, development methods, advantages, possible challenges, and applications with special emphasis on infectious diseases-related ones. A showcase of how nanobodies can be harnessed for applications including neutralization of viruses and combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria is detailed. Overall, the impact of nanobodies in vaccine design, rapid diagnostics, and targeted therapies, besides exploring their role in deciphering microbial structures and virulence mechanisms are highlighted.

37395450,Antisense oligonucleotides: a promising therapeutic option against infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases have been one of the biggest health problems of humanity for centuries. Nucleic acid-based therapeutics have received attention in recent years with their effectiveness in the treatment of various infectious diseases and vaccine development studies. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the basic properties underlying the mechanism of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), their applications, and their challenges. The efficient delivery of ASOs is the greatest challenge for their therapeutic success, but this problem is overcome with new-generation antisense molecules developed with chemical modifications. The types, carrier molecules, and gene regions targeted by sequences have been summarized in detail. Research and development of antisense therapy is still in its infancy; however, gene silencing therapies appear to have the potential for faster and longer-lasting activity than conventional treatment strategies. On the other hand, realizing the potential of antisense therapy will require a large initial economic investment to ascertain the pharmacological properties and learn how to optimize them. The ability of ASOs to be rapidly designed and synthesized to target different microbes can reduce drug discovery time from 6 years to 1 year. Since ASOs are not particularly affected by resistance mechanisms, they come to the fore in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. The design-based flexibility of ASOs has enabled it to be used for different types of microorganisms/genes and successful <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> results have been revealed. The current review summarized a comprehensive understanding of ASO therapy in combating bacterial and viral infections.","Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",2024-,"Tekintaş Y, Temel A",2,1739,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Although diverse solutions have been proposed, one viable solution could be the use of immune system modulators. The induction of the immune response can be increased by histone deacetylase inhibitors (iHDAC), which in turn modulate the chromatin and increase the activation of different cellular pathways and nuclear factors such as STAT3, HIF-1α NF-kB, C/EBPα and, AP-1. These pathways are capable to promote several immune response-related molecules including those with antimicrobial properties such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that lead to the elimination of pathogens including multi drug-resistant strains.",Peptides,2021-Jun,"Rodríguez-Carlos A, Jacobo-Delgado YM, Santos-Mena AO, Rivas-Santiago B",4,795,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37963966,Emerging infectious disease surveillance using a hierarchical diagnosis model and the Knox algorithm.,"Emerging infectious diseases are a critical public health challenge in the twenty-first century. The recent proliferation of such diseases has raised major social and economic concerns. Therefore, early detection of emerging infectious diseases is essential. Subjects from five medical institutions in Beijing, China, which met the spatial-specific requirements, were analyzed. A quality control process was used to select 37,422 medical records of infectious diseases and 56,133 cases of non-infectious diseases. An emerging infectious disease detection model (EIDDM), a two-layer model that divides the problem into two sub-problems, i.e., whether a case is an infectious disease, and if so, whether it is a known infectious disease, was proposed. The first layer model adopts the binary classification model TextCNN-Attention. The second layer is a multi-classification model of LightGBM based on the one-vs-rest strategy. Based on the experimental results, a threshold of 0.5 is selected. The model results were compared with those of other models such as XGBoost and Random Forest using the following evaluation indicators: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The prediction performance of the first-layer TextCNN is better than that of other comparison models. Its average specificity for non-infectious diseases is 97.57%, with an average negative predictive value of 82.63%, indicating a low risk of misdiagnosing non-infectious diseases as infectious (i.e., a low false positive rate). Its average positive predictive value for eight selected infectious diseases is 95.07%, demonstrating the model's ability to avoid misdiagnoses. The overall average accuracy of the model is 86.11%. The average prediction accuracy of the second-layer LightGBM model for emerging infectious diseases reaches 90.44%. Furthermore, the response time of a single online reasoning using the LightGBM model is approximately 27 ms, which makes it suitable for analyzing clinical records in real time. Using the Knox method, we found that all the infectious diseases were within 2000 m in our case, and a clustering feature of spatiotemporal interactions (P < 0.05) was observed as well. Performance testing and model comparison results indicated that the EIDDM is fast and accurate and can be used to monitor the onset/outbreak of emerging infectious diseases in real-world hospitals.",Scientific reports,2023-Nov,"Wang M, Yang B, Liu Y, Yang Y, Ji H, Yang C",6,2428,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Both chapters are based on the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission standard, ISO/IEC 17025:2005 'General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories'. This paper provides an update of standards and regulatory bodies relevant for accreditation of quality management systems (QMS), with a focus on ISO/IEC 17025:2017 for testing and calibration laboratories. Important issues and considerations that a laboratory should address in the design and maintenance of its QMS are highlighted and examples provided, in particular aspects of test validation and verification, including measurement uncertainty (MU). A QMS aims to address all aspects of the laboratory operation, including staff, organisational structure, processes, and procedures. Accreditation of a diagnostic laboratory requires three notable components: (a) independent or third-party assessment; (b) suitably validated tests performed by proficient laboratory operators in an adequately equipped laboratory; and (c) ongoing internal and external quality control. Together, these components ensure a test outcome is the result of a standardised process and structured peer review, and demonstrate both competency and ability to produce technically valid diagnostic results that will meet the needs of customers - veterinarians, animal owners, regulators, organisations and industry - as well as the needs of decision-makers involved in animal health and surveillance programmes.",Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),2021-Jun,"Newberry KM, Colling A",2,1789,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

32405321,Tooling-up for infectious disease transmission modelling.,"In this introduction to the Special Issue on methods for modelling of infectious disease epidemiology we provide a commentary and overview of the field. We suggest that the field has been through three revolutions that have focussed on specific methodological developments; disease dynamics and heterogeneity, advanced computing and inference, and complexity and application to the real-world. Infectious disease dynamics and heterogeneity dominated until the 1980s where the use of analytical models illustrated fundamental concepts such as herd immunity. The second revolution embraced the integration of data with models and the increased use of computing. From the turn of the century an emergence of novel datasets enabled improved modelling of real-world complexity. The emergence of more complex data that reflect the real-world heterogeneities in transmission resulted in the development of improved inference methods such as particle filtering. Each of these three revolutions have always kept the understanding of infectious disease spread as its motivation but have been developed through the use of new techniques, tools and the availability of data. We conclude by providing a commentary on what the next revoluition in infectious disease modelling may be.",Epidemics,2020-Sep,"Baguelin M, Medley GF, Nightingale ES, O'Reilly KM, Rees EM, Waterlow NR, Wagner M",7,1269,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Refugees settled at the Thai-Myanmar border are fully dependent on support for health services, shelter, food, education, water, and sanitation. The Non-Governmental Organization Malteser International developed an integrated Primary Health Care program in close cooperation with trained camp residents over 25 years in the two settlements under its supervision. The project has been funded by the European Commission Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO). This was a retrospective primary health care project evaluation. All-cause mortality; morbidity trends in malaria, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), watery diarrhea, and dysentery; and health service utilization covering a time span of 18 years were assessed. Programmatic changes in the Primary Health Care (PHC) project and events with a potential effect on health of the target population were examined. Despite the continuous drain of trained health care workers, the volatile influx of refugees, and the isolated location of the two camps, the initial basic curative health care developed into an integrated and comprehensive PHC project including a SPHERE-compliant water, sanitation, and hygiene program. Malaria, LRTIs, watery diarrhea, and dysentery morbidity dropped twelve, three, two, and fivefold, respectively, over the 18-year period evaluated while the health services utilization dropped from 7.1 to 2.9 consultations per refugee/year. The international community may face situations where integration of refugees into the health services of the host country is not possible. In such a context, integrated and evidence-based PHC adequately funded and implemented by one health agency is an effective and relevant approach to reduce the infectious diseases burden under the constraints of semipermanent living conditions.",Primary health care research & development,2022-Mar,"Mohr O, Benner MT, Sansoenboon A, Kaloy W, McGready R, Carrara VI",6,2038,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Mapping the research outputs of epidemiological modelling studies concerned with transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and public health interventions in Africa will help to identify the areas with substantial levels of research activities, areas with gaps, and research output trends. A scoping review of applied epidemiological models of infectious disease studies that involved first or last authors affiliated to African institutions was conducted. Eligible studies were those concerned with the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and public health interventions. The review was consistent with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews. Four electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed publications up to the end of April 2020. Of the 5927 publications identified, 181 met the inclusion criteria. The review identified 143 publications with first authors having an African institutional affiliation (AIA), while 81 had both first and last authors with an AIA. The publication authors were found to be predominantly affiliated with institutions based in South Africa and Kenya. Furthermore, human immunodeficiency virus, malaria, tuberculosis, and Ebola virus disease were found to be the most researched infectious diseases. There has been a gradual increase in research productivity across Africa especially in the last ten years, with several collaborative efforts spread both within and beyond Africa. Research productivity in applied epidemiological modelling studies of infectious diseases may have increased, but there remains an under-representation of African researchers as leading authors.

From the 1880s until World War I, concerns about ""infection by telephone"" in the British press prompted medical authorities and the National Telephone Company to investigate whether using the telephone, especially in public places, increased the possibility of contracting infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria. This article reconstructs for the first time these transnational debates and the associated medical experiments. In contrast to previous scholarship, which has conceptualized health concerns associated with the telephone primarily within the framework of a nervous modernity, this article argues that the anxieties about ""infectious telephones"" also reflected the complex negotiations surrounding the emergence of new telecommunication networks and medical theories.

33309629,Epidemiological trends of imported infectious diseases in Japan: Analysis of imported 2-year infectious disease registry data.,"The epidemiology of infectious diseases in Japan remains undefined despite the increasing tourism. GeoSentinel, an epidemiological surveillance system for reporting imported infectious diseases, has only two participating facilities in Japan. Although the number of infectious diseases is reported by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, there is no detailed clinical information about these cases. Therefore, we established J-RIDA (Japan Registry for Infectious Diseases from Abroad) to clarify the status of imported infectious diseases in Japan and provide detailed information. J-RIDA was started as a registry of imported infectious diseases. Case registration began in October 2017. Between October 2017 and September 2019, 15 medical institutions participated in this clinical study. The registry collected information about the patient's age, sex, nationality, chief complaint, consultation date, date of onset, whether visit was made to a travel clinic before travel, blood test results (if samples were collected), travel history, and final diagnosis. Of the 3046 cases included in this study, 46.7% to Southeast Asia, 13.0% to Africa, 13.7% to East Asia, 11.5% to South Asia, 7.5% to Europe, 3.8% to Central and South America, 4.6% to North America, 3.9% to Oceania, and 2.8% to Central and west Asia. More than 85% of chief complaints were fever and general symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory symptoms, or dermatologic problems.

Currently, we use PIA in the longitudinal study ZIFCO (Integrated DZIF Infection Cohort within the German National Cohort) in Hannover (Germany) to investigate e.g. associations of risk factors and infectious diseases. Our aim was to assess user acceptance and compliance to determine suitability of PIA for epidemiological research on transient infectious diseases. ZIFCO participants used PIA to answer weekly questionnaires on health status and report spontaneous onset of symptoms. In case of symptoms of a respiratory infection, the app requested participants to self-sample a nasal swab for viral analysis. To assess user acceptance, we implemented the System Usability Scale (SUS) and fitted a linear regression model on the resulting score. For investigation of compliance with submitting the weekly health questionnaires, we used a logistic regression model with binomial response. We analyzed data of 313 participants (median age 52.5 years, 52.4% women). An average SUS of 72.0 reveals good acceptance of PIA. Participants with a higher technology readiness score at the beginning of study participation also reported higher user acceptance. Overall compliance with submitting the weekly health questionnaires showed a median of 55.7%. Being female, of younger age and being enrolled for a longer time decreased the odds to respond. However, women over 60 had a higher chance to respond than women under 60, while men under 40 had the highest chance to respond. Compliance with nasal swab self-sampling was 77.2%. Our findings show that PIA is suitable for the use in epidemiologic studies with regular short questionnaires. Still, we will focus on user engagement and gamification for the further development of PIA to help incentivize regular and long-term participation.",PloS one,2023-,"Ortmann J, Heise JK, Janzen I, Jenniches F, Kemmling Y, Frömke C, Castell S",7,1941,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36512677,Assessment of Urinary Biomarkers for Infectious Diseases Using Lateral Flow Assays: A Comprehensive Overview.,"Screening of biomarkers is a powerful approach for providing a holistic view of the disease spectrum and facilitating the diagnosis and prognosis of the state of infectious diseases. Unaffected by the homeostasis mechanism in the human body, urine accommodates systemic changes and reflects the pathophysiological condition of an individual. Easy availability in large volumes and non-invasive sample collection have rendered urine an ideal source of biomarkers for various diseases. Infectious diseases may be communicable, and therefore early diagnosis and treatment are of immense importance. Current diagnostic approaches preclude the timely identification of clinical conditions and also lack portability. Point-of-care (POC) testing solutions have gained attention as alternative diagnostic measures due to their ability to provide rapid and on-site results. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) are the mainstay in POC device development and have attracted interest owing to their potential to provide instantaneous results in resource-limited settings. The discovery and optimization of a definitive biomarker can render POC testing an excellent platform, thus impacting unwarranted antibiotic administration and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. This Review summarizes the importance of urine as an emerging biological fluid in infectious disease research and diagnosis in clinical settings. We review the academic research related to LFAs. Further, we also describe commercial POC devices based on the identification of urinary biomarkers as diagnostic targets for infectious diseases. We also discuss the future use of LFAs in developing more effective POC tests for urinary biomarkers of various infections.",ACS infectious diseases,2023-Jan,"Patil AA, Kaushik P, Jain RD, Dandekar PP",4,1721,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Compounds generated in the gastrointestinal system by gut microbiota and infectious pathogens may mediate gut-brain interactions, which may circulate throughout the body and spread to numerous organs, including the brain. Studies shown that gut bacteria and disease-causing organisms may pass molecular signals to the brain, affecting neurological function, neurodevelopment, and neurodegenerative diseases. This article discusses microorganism-producing metabolites with neuromodulator activity, signaling routes from microbial flora to the brain, and the potential direct effects of gut bacteria and infectious pathogens on brain cells. The review also considered the neurological aspects of infectious diseases. The infectious diseases affecting neurological functions and the disease modifications have been discussed thoroughly. Recent discoveries and unique insights in this perspective need further validation.

This model and simulation tool dramatically increase the efficiency and efficacy of the tests in a large population at a low cost, particularly when the infection rate is low. The proposed method combines statistical modeling with numerical methods to solve nonlinear equations and obtain optimal batch sizes at each step of tests, with the flexibility to incorporate geographic and demographic information. In theory, this method substantially improves the false positive rate and positive predictive value as well. We also conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to verify this theory. Our simulation results show that our method significantly reduces the false negative rate. More accurate assessment can be made if the dilution effect or other practical factors are taken into consideration. The proposed method will be particularly useful for the early detection of infectious diseases and prevention of future pandemics.

35904943,The Case for Integrating Health Systems to Manage Noncommunicable and Infectious Diseases in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Lessons Learned From Zambia.,"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death in the world, and 80% of all NCD deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that patients with NCDs are at increased risk of becoming severely ill from the virus. Disproportionate investment in vertical health programs can result in health systems vulnerable to collapse when resources are strained, such as during pandemics. Although NCDs are largely preventable, globally there is underinvestment in efforts to address them. Integrating health systems to collectively address NCDs and infectious diseases through a wide range of services in a comprehensive manner reduces the economic burden of healthcare and strengthens the healthcare system. Health system resiliency is essential for health security. In this article, we provide an economically sound approach to incorporating NCDs into routine healthcare services in LMICs through improved alignment of institutions that support prevention and control of both NCDs and infectious diseases. Examples from Zambia's multisector interventions to develop and support a national NCD action plan can inform and encourage LMIC countries to invest in systems integration to reduce the social and economic burden of NCDs and infectious diseases.",Health security,2022-,"Richter P, Aslam M, Kostova D, Lasu AAR, Vliet GV, Courtney LP, Chisenga T",7,1308,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Recent studies have reasoned about potential climate sensitivity of diseases in the Northern/Arctic Region, where climate change is particularly pronounced. By linking disease and climate data for this region, we here comprehensively quantify empirical climate-disease relationships. Results show significant relationships of borreliosis, leptospirosis, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), Puumala virus infection, cryptosporidiosis, and Q fever with climate variables related to temperature and freshwater conditions. These data-driven results are consistent with previous reasoning-based propositions of climate-sensitive infections as increasing threats for humans, with notable exceptions for TBE and leptospirosis. For the latter, the data imply decrease with increasing temperature and precipitation experienced in, and projected for, the Northern/Arctic Region.

This study aimed to explore the capacity of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) in China to deal with infectious diseases now and in the future. A survey was conducted in 2015 among 973 public health professionals at CDCs in Beijing and four provinces, to assess their capacity to deal with emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Although most professionals were confident with the current capacity of CDCs to cope with outbreaks, nearly all indicated more funding was required to meet future challenges. Responses indicated that Yunnan Province faced more challenges than Anhui, Henan and Liaoning Provinces in being completely prepared and able to deal with outbreaks. Participants aged 20-39 years were more likely than those aged 40 and over to believe strategies such as interdisciplinary and international collaborations for disease surveillance and control, would assist capacity building. The capacity of China's CDCs to deal with infectious diseases was excellent. However, findings suggest it is imperative to increase the number of skilled CDC staff, financial support, and strengthen county level staff training and health education programs.","Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",2021-Apr,"Tong MX, Hansen A, Hanson-Easey S, Xiang J, Cameron S, Liu Q, Liu X, Sun Y, Weinstein P, Han GS, Mahmood A, Bi P",12,1307,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39043386,Archaea in the Human Microbiome and Potential Effects on Human Infectious Disease.,"Archaea represent a separate domain of life, next to bacteria and eukarya. As components of the human microbiome, archaea have been associated with various diseases, including periodontitis, endodontic infections, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and urogenital tract infections. Archaea are generally considered nonpathogenic; the reasons are speculative because of limited knowledge and gene annotation challenges. Nevertheless, archaeal syntrophic principles that shape global microbial networks aid both archaea and potentially pathogenic bacteria. Evaluating archaea interactions remains challenging, requiring clinical studies on inflammatory potential and the effects of archaeal metabolism. Establishing a culture collection is crucial for investigating archaea functions within the human microbiome, which could improve health outcomes in infectious diseases. We summarize potential reasons for archaeal nonpathogenicity, assess the association with infectious diseases in humans, and discuss the necessary experimental steps to enable mechanistic studies involving archaea.",Emerging infectious diseases,2024-Aug,"Duller S, Moissl-Eichinger C",2,1089,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34663839,Modelling infectious diseases with herd immunity in a randomly mixed population.,"The conventional susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model tends to magnify the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, and thus the estimated total infections and immunized population may be higher than the threshold required for infection control and eradication. The study developed a new SIR framework that allows the transmission rate of infectious diseases to decline along with the reduced risk of contact infection to overcome the limitations of the conventional SIR model. Two new SIR models were formulated to mimic the declining transmission rate of infectious diseases at different stages of transmission. Model A utilized the declining transmission rate along with the reduced risk of contact infection following infection, while Model B incorporated the declining transmission rate following recovery. Both new models and the conventional SIR model were then used to simulate an infectious disease with a basic reproduction number (r<sub>0</sub>) of 3.0 and a herd immunity threshold (HIT) of 0.667 with and without vaccination. Outcomes of simulations were assessed at the time when the total immunized population reached the level predicted by the HIT, and at the end of simulations. Further, all three models were used to simulate the transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza in the United States and disease burdens were projected and compared with estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the simulated infectious disease, in the initial phase of the outbreak, all three models performed expectedly when the sizes of infectious and recovered populations were relatively small. As the infectious population increased, the conventional SIR model appeared to overestimate the infections even when the HIT was achieved in all scenarios with and without vaccination. For the same scenario, Model A appeared to attain the level predicted by the HIT and in comparison, Model B projected the infectious disease to be controlled at the level predicted by the HIT only at high vaccination rates. For infectious diseases with high r<sub>0</sub>, and at low vaccination rates, the level at which the infectious disease was controlled cannot be accurately predicted by the current theorem. Transmission dynamics of infectious diseases with herd immunity can be accurately modelled by allowing the transmission rate of infectious diseases to decline along with the reduction of contact infection risk after recovery or vaccination. Model B provides a credible framework for modelling infectious diseases with herd immunity in a randomly mixed population.",Scientific reports,2021-Oct,"Law KB, M Peariasamy K, Mohd Ibrahim H, Abdullah NH",4,2597,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36117592,A simple nomogram for predicting infectious diseases in adult kidney transplantation recipients.,"To investigate the risk factors of infectious diseases in adult kidney transplantation recipients and to establish a simple and novel nomogram to guide the prophylactic antimicrobial therapy. Patients who received kidney transplantation between January 2018 and October 2021 were included in the study and were divided into a training and a testing set at a 1:1 ratio. Risk factors correlated to infectious diseases were selected using a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model. The prediction model was built by incorporating the variables selected by the LASSO model into a logistic regression equation. Calibration curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also applied to assess the model calibration and discrimination. A nomogram consisting of the selected factors was established to provide individualized risks of developing infections. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was adopted to estimate the net benefit and reduction in interventions for a range of clinically reasonable risk thresholds. In all, 863 adult kidney recipients were included in the study, and 407 (47.16%) of them developed infectious diseases during the 3-year follow-up period. A total of 8 variables were selected using LASSO regression and were retained for subsequent model construction and infection prediction. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.83 and 0.81 in the training and testing sets, with high F scores of 0.76 and 0.77, sensitivity of 0.76 and 0.81, and specificity of 0.88 and 0.74, respectively. A novel nomogram was developed based on 8 selected predictors (requirement for albumin infusion, requirement for red blood cell infusion, triglyceride, uric acid, creatinine, globulin, neutrophil percentage, and white blood cells). The net benefit indicated that the nomogram would reduce unnecessary interventions at a wide range of threshold probabilities in both sets. Adult kidney transplantation recipients are high-risk hosts for infectious diseases. The novel nomogram consisting of 8 factors reveals good predictive performance and may promote the reasonable antimicrobial prescription.

Infectious diseases maintained by domestic species may impact threatened species such as Asian bovids, as they share natural resources and habitats. To predict the population impact of infectious diseases with different traits, we used stochastic mathematical models to simulate the population dynamics over 100 years for 100 times in a model gaur (<i>Bos gaurus</i>) population with and without disease. We simulated repeated introductions from a reservoir, such as domestic cattle. We selected six bovine infectious diseases; anthrax, bovine tuberculosis, haemorrhagic septicaemia, lumpy skin disease, foot and mouth disease and brucellosis, all of which have caused outbreaks in wildlife populations. From a starting population of 300, the disease-free population increased by an average of 228% over 100 years. Brucellosis with frequency-dependent transmission showed the highest average population declines (-97%), with population extinction occurring 16% of the time. Foot and mouth disease with frequency-dependent transmission showed the lowest impact, with an average population increase of 200%. Overall, acute infections with very high or low fatality had the lowest impact, whereas chronic infections produced the greatest population decline. These results may help disease management and surveillance strategies support wildlife conservation.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2024-Jul,"Horpiencharoen W, Marshall JC, Muylaert RL, John RS, Hayman DTS",5,1451,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34849837,The quantitative genetics of the prevalence of infectious diseases: hidden genetic variation due to indirect genetic effects dominates heritable variation and response to selection.,"Infectious diseases have profound effects on life, both in nature and agriculture. However, a quantitative genetic theory of the host population for the endemic prevalence of infectious diseases is almost entirely lacking. While several studies have demonstrated the relevance of transmission of infections for heritable variation and response to selection, current quantitative genetics ignores transmission. Thus, we lack concepts of breeding value and heritable variation for endemic prevalence, and poorly understand response of endemic prevalence to selection. Here, we integrate quantitative genetics and epidemiology, and propose a quantitative genetic theory for the basic reproduction number R0 and for the endemic prevalence of an infection. We first identify the genetic factors that determine the prevalence. Subsequently, we investigate the population-level consequences of individual genetic variation, for both R0 and the endemic prevalence. Next, we present expressions for the breeding value and heritable variation, for endemic prevalence and individual binary disease status, and show that these depend strongly on the prevalence. Results show that heritable variation for endemic prevalence is substantially greater than currently believed, and increases strongly when prevalence decreases, while heritability of disease status approaches zero. As a consequence, response of the endemic prevalence to selection for lower disease status accelerates considerably when prevalence decreases, in contrast to classical predictions. Finally, we show that most heritable variation for the endemic prevalence is hidden in indirect genetic effects, suggesting a key role for kin-group selection in the evolutionary history of current populations and for genetic improvement in animals and plants.",Genetics,2022-Jan,"Bijma P, Hulst AD, de Jong MCM",3,1806,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We collected data on refugees arriving to our attention in migrant centers in Sardinia, Italy. Socio-demographical data, anamnesis, and clinical features were collected. TST Mantoux was conducted, and X-ray chest (XRC) was performed if TST was positive. Blood-borne virus screening was proposed to all patients. Screening for STDs was offered according to guidelines, anamnesis, and physical examination. Eighty-one patients were included. Seventy (86.4%) were male, and the mean age was 24.8±5.7 years. Thirty-three (40.7%) had scabies. Overall, 40/81 (49.4%) had a positive TST Mantoux. One (2.5%) was hospitalized and died for multi-drug-resistant TB.

Based on 31 provincial data from 2002 to 2018 in China, the impact of urbanization on the spread of infectious diseases from the dimensions of ""population"" and ""land"" is analyzed in this paper by using the GMM (generalized method of moments) model. The empirical study shows that the population increase brought by urbanization does not aggravate the spread of infectious diseases. On the contrary, urban education, employment and entrepreneurship, housing, medical and health care, and other basic public services brought by population urbanization can help reduce the risk of the spread of infectious diseases. The increasing density of buildings caused by land urbanization increases the risk of the spread of infectious diseases.

37268063,One Health: The Role of Pathology as it Pertains to Diagnosis of Zoonoses and Discovery of Emerging Infections.,"Pathologists are an integral part of One Health as they are a critical component of the multidisciplinary team that diagnoses zoonotic diseases and discovers emerging pathogens. Both human and veterinary pathologists are uniquely positioned to identify clusters or trends in patient populations that can be caused by an infectious agent and preface emerging outbreaks. The repository of tissue samples available to pathologists is an invaluable resource that can be used to investigate a variety of pathogens. One Health is an encompassing approach that focuses on optimizing the health of humans, animals (domesticated and sylvatic), and the ecosystem, including plants, water, and vectors. In this integrated and balanced approach, multiple disciplines and sectors from local and global communities work together to promote overall well-being of the 3 components and address threats such as emerging infectious diseases and zoonoses. Zoonoses are defined as infectious diseases that are spread between animals and humans through different mechanisms, including direct contact, food, water, vectors, or fomites. This review highlights examples in which human and veterinary pathologists were an integral part of the multisectoral team that identified uncommon etiologic agents or pathologies that had not been elucidated clinically. As the team discovers an emerging infectious disease, pathologists develop and validate tests for epidemiologic and clinical use and provide surveillance data on these diseases. They define the pathogenesis and pathology that these new diseases cause.

33324602,COVID-19-Zoonosis or Emerging Infectious Disease?,"The World Health Organization defines a zoonosis as any infection naturally transmissible from vertebrate animals to humans. The pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been classified as a zoonotic disease, however, no animal reservoir has yet been found, so this classification is premature. We propose that COVID-19 should instead be classified an ""<i>emerging infectious disease (EID) of probable animal origin</i>."" To explore if COVID-19 infection fits our proposed re-categorization vs. the contemporary definitions of zoonoses, we reviewed current evidence of infection origin and transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 virus and described this in the context of known zoonoses, EIDs and ""spill-over"" events. Although the initial one hundred COVID-19 patients were presumably exposed to the virus at a seafood Market in China, and despite the fact that 33 of 585 swab samples collected from surfaces and cages in the market tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, no virus was isolated directly from animals and no animal reservoir was detected. Elsewhere, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in animals including domesticated cats, dogs, and ferrets, as well as captive-managed mink, lions, tigers, deer, and mice confirming zooanthroponosis.

Taking into account the scarcity of effective formulation to treat infectious diseases, nanotechnology offers a vast possibility of ground-breaking platforms to design new treatment through smart nanostructures for drug delivery purposes. Among the available nanosystems, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) stand out due their multifunctionality, biocompatibility and tunable properties make them emerging and actual nanocarriers for specific and controlled drug release. Considering the high demand for diseases prevention and treatment, this review exploits the MSNs fabrication and their behavior in biological media besides highlighting the most of strategies to explore the wide MSNs functionality as engineered, smart and effective controlled drug release nanovehicles for infectious diseases treatment.

39718814,Impact of psychological fear and media on infectious diseases induced by carriers.,"To manage risks and mitigate the transmission of infectious diseases, individuals often adopt strategies aimed at reducing interpersonal contact by implementing precautionary measures within their daily routines. These behavioral adjustments reduce the disease transmission rates. In this study, we present a novel mathematical model delineating diseases induced by carriers, incorporating multifaceted factors, such as psychological fear, media impact, and sanitation interventions. We analyze the system's dynamics using analytical as well as numerical methods. We find that rapid dissemination of information through social media can lead to oscillations, mitigated by introducing a sufficient baseline number of advertisements. The system undergoes a transition from the disease-free to endemic states via a transcritical bifurcation, occurring when the basic reproduction number surpasses unity. Through a Hopf bifurcation, the system shifts from a stable state to limit cycle oscillations once the growth rate of advertisements is above a critical value. Heightened levels of fear attenuate these oscillations, thereby stabilizing the system at an endemic state. Moreover, the system experiences periodic, higher-periodic, and chaotic oscillations when the growth rate of advertisements varies seasonally. Overall, our findings underscore the significant role of psychological fear, media influence, and sanitation measures in suppressing the prevalence of diseases induced by carriers from the targeted population.","Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2024-Dec,"Pal KK, Rai RK, Tiwari PK",3,1521,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36184529,Risk factors for hospitalization at the pediatric intensive care unit among infants and children younger than 5 years of age diagnosed with infectious diseases.,"Children hospitalized with infectious diseases may develop severe, life-threatening conditions, often requiring admission to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The objectives of this study were to identify independent risk factors for PICU hospitalization with an infectious disease in children <5 years of age. In southern Israel, two populations live side by side: the middle-high income Jewish population and the low-income Bedouin population, both receiving equal and free medical care at the only tertiary medical center in the area. The study population included all children born in southern Israel and hospitalized at PICU with an infectious disease during 1991-2012. Risk factors for PICU hospitalizations were retrospectively studied by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard survival analyses. 9951 Jewish children and 18,002 Bedouin children were enrolled; overall, 1135 episodes of PICU hospitalizations with an infectious disease were recorded (879, 77.4% Bedouin and 256, 22.6% Jewish patients). Bedouin children had a higher risk for PICU hospitalization with an infectious disease compared with Jewish children (adjusted Hazard Ratio [adj. HR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-2.0); maternal multiparity and low-birth weight (<2500 g) were additional risk factors for PICU hospitalization with an infectious disease compared to firstborns (adj. HR = 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.5) or to children with a birth weight ≥2500 g (adj. HR = 1.5, 95% 1.2-1.9). Older age was a protective factor for PICU hospitalization (adj. HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99). Children hospitalized with a central nervous system infection had the highest risk of PICU hospitalization (adj. HR 6.8, 95% CI 5.5-8.4), followed by those with urinary tract infections (UTI, adj. HR 3.1, 95% CI 2.5-3.8) and those with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI, adj. HR 2.9, 95% CI 2.4-3.4). Bedouin ethnicity, low birth weight, maternal multiparity and younger age were significant risk factors for PICU hospitalizations with an infectious disease.

32912135,Comprehensive host-pathogen protein-protein interaction network analysis.,"Infectious diseases are a cruel assassin with millions of victims around the world each year. Understanding infectious mechanism of viruses is indispensable for their inhibition. One of the best ways of unveiling this mechanism is to investigate the host-pathogen protein-protein interaction network. In this paper we try to disclose many properties of this network. We focus on human as host and integrate experimentally 32,859 interaction between human proteins and virus proteins from several databases. We investigate different properties of human proteins targeted by virus proteins and find that most of them have a considerable high centrality scores in human intra protein-protein interaction network. Investigating human proteins network properties which are targeted by different virus proteins can help us to design multipurpose drugs. As host-pathogen protein-protein interaction network is a bipartite network and centrality measures for this type of networks are scarce, we proposed seven new centrality measures for analyzing bipartite networks. Applying them to different virus strains reveals unrandomness of attack strategies of virus proteins which could help us in drug design hence elevating the quality of life. They could also be used in detecting host essential proteins. Essential proteins are those whose functions are critical for survival of its host. One of the proposed centralities named diversity of predators, outperforms the other existing centralities in terms of detecting essential proteins and could be used as an optimal essential proteins' marker. Different centralities were applied to analyze human protein-protein interaction network and to detect characteristics of human proteins targeted by virus proteins. Moreover, seven new centralities were proposed to analyze host-pathogen protein-protein interaction network and to detect pathogens' favorite host protein victims. Comparing different centralities in detecting essential proteins reveals that diversity of predator (one of the proposed centralities) is the best essential protein marker.",BMC bioinformatics,2020-Sep,"Khorsand B, Savadi A, Naghibzadeh M",3,2089,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

As part of a Controversies Conference addressing the evaluation and management of infectious diseases (ID) in deceased donors sponsored by the American Society of Transplantation (AST), two online pre-meeting surveys were developed to inform conference proceedings and assess current practices and opinions on donor screening and antimicrobial management. Survey 1 addressed the current state of deceased donor ID testing, culture data communication, antimicrobial utilization, and involvement of transplant ID during donor management and was distributed to all 56 United States OPOs. Survey 2 evaluated transplant professionals' opinions regarding donor antimicrobial use and was sent to the AST Infectious Disease, Kidney Pancreas, Liver and Intestinal, and Thoracic and Critical Care Community of Practice listservs. Descriptive statistics were performed. Thirty-five (63%) unique responses were received from OPOs for Survey 1. Findings included variability in the timing of donor culture collection, frequent sampling of indwelling catheters, wide variation in the location of culture processing, and availability of additional susceptibility testing. Eighty-eight unique responses were received from approximately 1552 (6%) transplant providers for Survey 2. Of the respondents, 37% would not recommend standard antibiotics prior to organ recovery in the absence of suspected or confirmed infection. These surveys demonstrate variability in donor testing, donor antimicrobial utilization, and transplant provider opinions regarding the need for and selection of antimicrobial agents.

39045894,Tackling transmission of infectious diseases: A probiotic-based system as a remedy for the spread of pathogenic and resistant microbes.,"Built environments (BEs) currently represent the areas in which human beings spend most of their life. Consistently, microbes populating BEs mostly derive from human occupants and can be easily transferred from BE to occupants. The hospital microbiome is a paradigmatic example, representing a reservoir for harmful pathogens that can be transmitted to susceptible patients, causing the healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Environmental cleaning is a crucial pillar in controlling BE pathogens and preventing related infections, and chemical disinfectants have been largely used so far towards this aim. However, despite their immediate effect, chemical-based disinfection is unable to prevent recontamination, has a high environmental impact, and can select/increase antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in treated microbes. To overcome these limitations, probiotic-based sanitation (PBS) strategies were recently proposed, built on the use of detergents added with selected probiotics able to displace surrounding pathogens by competitive exclusion. PBS was reported as an effective and low-impact alternative to chemical disinfection, providing stable rebalance of the BE microbiome and significantly reducing pathogens and HAIs compared to disinfectants, without exacerbating AMR and pollution concerns. This minireview summarizes the most significant results obtained by applying PBS in sanitary and non-sanitary settings, which overall suggest that PBS may effectively tackle the infectious risk meanwhile preventing the further spread of pathogenic and resistant microbes.",Microbial biotechnology,2024-Jul,"D'Accolti M, Soffritti I, Bini F, Mazziga E, Caselli E",5,1578,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

35168624,Deep learning model for multi-classification of infectious diseases from unstructured electronic medical records.,"Predictively diagnosing infectious diseases helps in providing better treatment and enhances the prevention and control of such diseases. This study uses actual data from a hospital. A multiple infectious disease diagnostic model (MIDDM) is designed for conducting multi-classification of infectious diseases so as to assist in clinical infectious-disease decision-making. Based on actual hospital medical records of infectious diseases from December 2012 to December 2020, a deep learning model for multi-classification research on infectious diseases is constructed. The data includes 20,620 cases covering seven types of infectious diseases, including outpatients and inpatients, of which training data accounted for 80%, i.e., 16,496 cases, and test data accounted for 20%, i.e., 4124 cases. Through the auto-encoder, data normalization and sparse data densification processing are carried out to improve the model training effect. A residual network and attention mechanism are introduced into the MIDDM model to improve the performance of the model. MIDDM achieved improved prediction results in diagnosing seven kinds of infectious diseases. In the case of similar disease diagnosis characteristics and similar interference factors, the prediction accuracy of disease classification with more sample data is significantly higher than the prediction accuracy of disease classification with fewer sample data. For instance, the training data for viral hepatitis, influenza, and hand foot and mouth disease were 2954, 3924, and 3015 respectively and the corresponding test accuracy rates were 99.86%, 98.47%, and 97.31%. There is less training data for syphilis, infectious diarrhea, and measles, i.e., 1208, 575, and 190 respectively and the corresponding test accuracy rates were noticeably lower, i.e., 83.03%, 87.30%, and42.11%. We also compared the MIDDM model with the models used in other studies. Using the same input data, taking viral hepatitis as an example, the accuracy of MIDDM is 99.44%, which is significantly higher than that of XGBoost (96.19%), Decision tree (90.13%), Bayesian method (85.19%), and logistic regression (91.26%). Other diseases were also significantly better predicted by MIDDM than by these three models. The application of the MIDDM model to multi-class diagnosis and prediction of infectious diseases can improve the accuracy of infectious-disease diagnosis. However, these results need to be further confirmed via clinical randomized controlled trials.",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2022-Feb,"Wang M, Wei Z, Jia M, Chen L, Ji H",5,2495,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32499776,From Beef to Bees: High-Throughput Kinome Analysis to Understand Host Responses of Livestock Species to Infectious Diseases and Industry-Associated Stress.,"Within human health research, the remarkable utility of kinase inhibitors as therapeutics has motivated efforts to understand biology at the level of global cellular kinase activity (the kinome). In contrast, the diminished potential for using kinase inhibitors in food animals has dampened efforts to translate this research approach to livestock species. This, in our opinion, was a lost opportunity for livestock researchers given the unique potential of kinome analysis to offer insight into complex biology. To remedy this situation, our lab developed user-friendly, cost-effective approaches for kinome analysis that can be readily incorporated into most research programs but with a specific priority to enable the technology to livestock researchers. These contributions include the development of custom software programs for the creation of species-specific kinome arrays as well as comprehensive deconvolution and analysis of kinome array data. Presented in this review are examples of the application of kinome analysis to highlight the utility of the technology to further our understanding of two key complex biological events of priority to the livestock industry: host immune responses to infectious diseases and animal stress responses.

Hospitals typically serve as frontline institutions for detecting infectious diseases. However, accurately identifying warning signals of infectious diseases in a timely manner, especially emerging infectious diseases, can be challenging. Consequently, there is a pressing need to integrate treatment and disease prevention data to conduct comprehensive analyses aimed at preventing and controlling infectious diseases within hospitals. This paper examines the role of medical data in the early identification of infectious diseases, explores early warning technologies for infectious disease recognition, and assesses monitoring and early warning mechanisms for infectious diseases. We propose that hospitals adopt novel multidimensional early warning technologies to mine and analyze medical data from various systems, in compliance with national strategies to integrate clinical treatment and disease prevention. Furthermore, hospitals should establish institution-specific, clinical-based early warning models for infectious diseases to actively monitor early signals and enhance preparedness for infectious disease prevention and control.",Current medical science,2024-Apr,"Zhang L, Li MY, Zhi C, Zhu M, Ma H",5,1263,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Four in five travelers received inpatient care, of which 36% concerned older travelers (65+) who had significantly longer hospital stays. Overall the top three diagnoses were: injuries (29%), infectious diseases (17%), and cardiovascular diseases (17%). Mental illness was reported in nearly 1.5% of the travelers. Incidence proportions were highest in South-Eastern Asia, with enteric infections as most common diagnosis. Injuries and communicable diseases occurred most often in South-Eastern Asia, while non-communicable diseases were mostly reported in South America. One in five travelers who consulted a physician was repatriated back home, mostly on a scheduled flight with or without medical escort. Cardiovascular diseases and injuries were the leading causes of death. Not only communicable diseases, but also injuries and chronic diseases (in particular cardiovascular diseases) frequently affected travelers' health while staying abroad and frequently necessitated hospital-based care.

35860922,"How sex and gender matter in infectious diseases - outcomes of the first Polish conference ""A woman in an infectious diseases circle"".","Occurrence of infectious disease in a woman is an interdisciplinary area of medicine. The common problem of lower recruitment of women to clinical trials leads to the necessity to rely in clinical practice on the exchange of practical experiences, specialist consultations and individualization of treatment. As the COVID-19 pandemic shows, there is a close relationship between infectious diseases and civilization diseases. People suffering from chronic diseases are both more susceptible to infection and the more severe course of an infectious disease. On the other hand, infection may accelerate or initiate the onset of a noncommunicable disease. Women, especially those living with HIV, are a group with an underestimated risk of high blood pressure or some cancers. Therefore, one of the main goals of the conference is to break the stereotypes of thinking about health, in which gender is the main determinant of some screening tests. Late presentation of women to medical care is a significant problem that is of great importance in the diagnosis and treatment of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Women put family and professional responsibilities in the first place, and they are known to downplay their own health problems. It leads to the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases or cancer at the stage of advanced changes, limiting the possibilities of effective therapy. Understanding gender attributed differences in the etiology and epidemiology of diseases allows for the improvement of patient care, as well as determines the right direction of reforms in the area of healthcare. It is essential to build models of care based on an interdisciplinary and patient-centered approach, with broad support from both stakeholders and NGOs.

37547899,Clinical Approach to Evaluation of Underlying Cardiac Device Infection in Patients Hospitalized with Bacteremia.,"More than 400,000 cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), including permanent pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices, are implanted every year in the United States (US). Infection is a serious complication of CIED therapy and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. While CIED pocket infection can be diagnosed based on clinical exam findings, positive blood culture may be the only manifestation of CIED lead infection. Thus, management of bacteremia in patients living with CIEDs requires special consideration. This review summarizes contemporary data in the context of the recently updated 2023 Duke-International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Diseases Criteria for Infective Endocarditis. We have synthesized these data into an algorithmic approach to streamline the diagnostic evaluation of CIED infection in patients presenting with bacteremia.",Methodist DeBakey cardiovascular journal,2023-,"Axell-House DB, Khalil S, Sohail MR",3,936,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

More recently, attention has focused on the ability of non-carcinogenic infections, as well as vaccines, to modify the human epigenome and modulate the immune response. This review explores this rapidly evolving area of investigation and outlines the many and varied ways in which vaccination and natural infection can influence the human epigenome from modulation of the innate and adaptive immune response, to biological ageing and modification of disease risk. The implications of these epigenetic changes on immune regulation and their potential application to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic infection and vaccine development are also discussed.",Epigenetics,2020-,"Bannister S, Messina NL, Novakovic B, Curtis N",4,770,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39689884,The potential of remote sensing for improved infectious disease ecology research and practice.,"Outbreaks of COVID-19 in humans, Dutch elm disease in forests, and highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds and poultry highlight the disruptive impacts of infectious diseases on public health, ecosystems and economies. Infectious disease dynamics often depend on environmental conditions that drive occurrence, transmission and outbreaks. Remote sensing can contribute to infectious disease research and management by providing standardized environmental data across broad spatial and temporal extents, often at no cost to the user. Here, we (i) conduct a review of primary literature to quantify current uses of remote sensing in disease ecology; and (ii) synthesize qualitative information to identify opportunities for further integration of remote sensing into disease ecology. We identify that modern advances in airborne remote sensing are enabling early detection of forest pathogens and that satellite data are most commonly used to study geographically widespread human diseases. Opportunities remain for increased use of data products that characterize vegetation, surface water and soil; provide data at high spatio-temporal and spectral resolutions; and quantify uncertainty in measurements. Additionally, combining remote sensing with animal telemetry can support decision-making for disease management by providing insights into wildlife disease dynamics. Integrating these opportunities will advance both research and management of infectious diseases.",Proceedings.

37232315,Assessing the quality of data for drivers of disease emergence.,"Drivers are factors that have the potential to directly or indirectly influence the likelihood of infectious diseases emerging or re-emerging. It is likely that an emerging infectious disease (EID) rarely occurs as the result of only one driver; rather, a network of sub-drivers (factors that can influence a driver) are likely to provide conditions that allow a pathogen to (re-)emerge and become established. Data on sub-drivers have therefore been used by modellers to identify hotspots where EIDs may next occur, or to estimate which sub-drivers have the greatest influence on the likelihood of their occurrence. To minimise error and bias when modelling how sub-drivers interact, and thus aid in predicting the likelihood of infectious disease emergence, researchers need good-quality data to describe these sub-drivers. This study assesses the quality of the available data on sub-drivers of West Nile virus against various criteria as a case study. The data were found to be of varying quality with regard to fulfilling the criteria. The characteristic with the lowest score was completeness, i.e. where sufficient data are available to fulfil all the requirements for the model. This is an important characteristic as an incomplete data set could lead to erroneous conclusions being drawn from modelling studies. Thus, the availability of good-quality data is essential to reduce uncertainty when estimating the likelihood of where EID outbreaks may occur and identifying the points on the risk pathway where preventive measures may be taken.",Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),2023-May,"Horigan V, Kelly L, Papa A, Koopmans MPG, Sikkema RS, Koren LGH, Snary EL",7,1550,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37818307,Study on the regional risk classification method for the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases based on directed graph theory.,"Emerging infectious diseases are a class of diseases that are spreading rapidly and are highly contagious. It seriously affects social stability and poses a significant threat to human health, requiring urgent measures to deal with them. Its outbreak will very easily lead to the large-scale spread of the virus, causing social problems such as work stoppages and traffic control, thereby causing social panic and psychological unrest, affecting human activities and social stability, and even endangering lives. It is essential to prevent and control the spread of infectious diseases effectively. We aim to propose an effective method to classify the risk level of a new epidemic region by using graph theory and risk classification methods to provide a theoretical reference for the comprehensive evaluation and determination of epidemic prevention and control, as well as risk level classification. Using the graph theory method, we first define the network structure of social groups and construct the risk transmission network of the new epidemic region. Then, combined with the risk classification method, the classification of high, medium, and low risk levels of the new epidemic region is discussed from two cases with common and looped graph nodes, respectively. Finally, the reasonableness of the classification method is verified by simulation data. The directed weighted scale-free network can better describe the transmission law of an epidemic. Moreover, the proposed method of classifying the risk level of a region by using the correlation function between two regions and the risk value of the regional nodes can effectively evaluate the risk level of different regions in the new epidemic region. The experiments show that the number of medium and high risk nodes shows no increasing trend. The number of high-risk regions is relatively small compared to medium-risk regions, and the number of low-risk regions is the largest. It is necessary to distinguish scientifically between the risk level of the epidemic area and the neighboring regions so that the constructed social network model of the epidemic region's spread risk can better describe the spread of the epidemic risk in the social network relations.",Frontiers in public health,2023-,"Liu Y, Wang X, Zhang C",3,2231,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33144202,Antimicrobial stewardship in the emergency department: characteristics and evidence for effectiveness of interventions.,"Emergency departments (EDs) are the entrance gates for patients presenting with infectious diseases into the hospital, yet most antimicrobial stewardship programmes are primarily focused on inpatient management. With equally high rates of inappropriate antibiotic use, the ED is a frequently overlooked yet important unit for targeted antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions. We aimed to (a) describe the specific aspects of antimicrobial stewardship in the ED and (b) summarize the findings from improvement studies that have investigated the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship interventions in the ED setting. (a) a PubMed search for 'antimicrobial stewardship' and 'emergency department', and (b) published reviews on effectiveness combined with publications from the first source. (a) An in depth analysis of selected publications provided four key antimicrobial use processes typically performed by front-line healthcare professionals in the ED: making a (tentative) clinical diagnosis, starting empirical therapy based on that diagnosis, performing microbiological tests before starting that therapy and following up patients who are discharged from the ED. (b) Further, we discuss the literature on improvement strategies in the ED focusing on guidelines and clinical pathways and multifaceted improvement strategies. We also summarize the evidence of microbiologic culture review. Based on our review of the literature, we describe four essential elements of antimicrobial use in the ED. Studying the various interventions targeting these care processes, we have found them to be of a variable degree of success. Nonetheless, while there is a paucity of AS studies specifically targeting the ED, there is a growing body of evidence that AS programmes in the ED are effective with modifications to the ED setting.

These diseases caused the illness and death of many people. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors and consequences of the spread of infectious diseases in Ardabil during the first Pahlavi period. The research method is descriptive and historical-retrospective, which tries to answer the research questions using documentary and library sources. The findings show that malaria, trachoma, smallpox, tuberculosis, rinderpest, venereal diseases, and diphtheria were among the most common infectious diseases. Poverty, illiteracy, poor public health, lack of medical facilities, and the geographical location were the main factors in the spread of these diseases. Considering the critical nature of the issue, the first Pahlavi government tried to control and prevent diseases by carrying out measures such as public education, establishing health and treatment centers and reforming their structure, sending doctors and distributing medicine, and implementing quarantine and vaccination. The results showed that the efforts of the first Pahlavi government in fighting infectious diseases in Ardabil were relatively successful and reduced the prevalence of some diseases.",Archives of Iranian medicine,2024-Dec,"Aghabeiglooei Z, Rezaei Orimi J, Marghoub Khajeh S, Mojahedi M, Ghaffari F",5,1317,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Since it was initially reported in 2019, the duration and intensity of its impacts are still in serious question around the world, and it is about to enter its third year. The first public health revolution failed to achieve its ultimate targets, as previously contained infectious diseases seem to have returned, and new infectious diseases continue to emerge. The prevention and control of infectious diseases is still a public health priority worldwide. After SARS, China adjusted a series of its infectious disease policies. In order to ensure the effectiveness and implementation of prevention and control interventions, the government should integrate the concept of public health. Perhaps we need a global public health system at the government level to fight the potential threat of infectious disease.

34600500,Governance structure affects transboundary disease management under alternative objectives.,"The development of public health policy is inextricably linked with governance structure. In our increasingly globalized world, human migration and infectious diseases often span multiple administrative jurisdictions that might have different systems of government and divergent management objectives. However, few studies have considered how the allocation of regulatory authority among jurisdictions can affect disease management outcomes. Here we evaluate the relative merits of decentralized and centralized management by developing and numerically analyzing a two-jurisdiction SIRS model that explicitly incorporates migration. In our model, managers choose between vaccination, isolation, medication, border closure, and a travel ban on infected individuals while aiming to minimize either the number of cases or the number of deaths. We consider a variety of scenarios and show how optimal strategies differ for decentralized and centralized management levels. We demonstrate that policies formed in the best interest of individual jurisdictions may not achieve global objectives, and identify situations where locally applied interventions can lead to an overall increase in the numbers of cases and deaths. Our approach underscores the importance of tailoring disease management plans to existing regulatory structures as part of an evidence-based decision framework. Most importantly, we demonstrate that there needs to be a greater consideration of the degree to which governance structure impacts disease outcomes.",BMC public health,2021-Oct,"Blackwood JC, Malakhov MM, Duan J, Pellett JJ, Phadke IS, Lenhart S, Sims C, Shea K",8,1526,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The logistic differential equation models can be used for predicting early warning of infectious diseases. The aim of this study is to compare the disease fitting effects of the logistic differential equation (LDE) model and the generalized logistic differential equation (GLDE) model for the first time using data on multiple infectious diseases in Jilin Province and to calculate the early warning signals for different types of infectious diseases using these two models in Jilin Province to solve the disease early warning schedule for Jilin Province throughout the year. Collecting the incidence of 22 infectious diseases in Jilin Province, China. The LDE and GLDE models were used to calculate the recommended warning week (RWW), the epidemic acceleration week (EAW) and warning removed week (WRW) for acute infectious diseases with seasonality, respectively. Five diseases were selected for analysis based on screening principles: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), shigellosis, mumps, Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), and scarlet fever. The GLDE model fitted the above diseases better (0.80 ≤ R<sup>2</sup> ≤ 0.94, P <  0. 005) than the LDE model. The estimated warning durations (per year) of the LDE model for the above diseases were: weeks 12-23 and 40-50; weeks 20-36; weeks 15-24 and 43-52; weeks 26-34; and weeks 16-25 and 41-50. While the durations of early warning (per year) estimated by the GLDE model were: weeks 7-24 and 36-51; weeks 13-37; weeks 11-26 and 39-54; weeks 23-35; and weeks 12-26 and 40-50. Compared to the LDE model, the GLDE model provides a better fit to the actual disease incidence data. The RWW appeared to be earlier when estimated with the GLDE model than the LDE model.

Among contagious diseases, brucellosis is the most common. Non-infectious inflammatory diseases were responsible for 6.3% of cases, of which systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE) 1.9% was the most common; 5% were neoplastic diseases; 5.3% were other diseases; and in 12.8% of cases, the cause was unclear. In 2018-2019, the proportion of infectious diseases in FUO was higher than 2016-2017 (P < 0.05). The proportion of infectious diseases was higher in men and older FUO than in women and young and middle-aged (P < 0.05). According to follow-up, the mortality rate of FUO patients during hospitalization was low at 1.9%. Infectious diseases are the principal cause of FUO.

The objective of this study was to determine patients' experiences with rapid strep and influenza tests administered at community pharmacies, focusing on what impacted patients' decisions to receive care, their perception of the care received, and if offering these tests in community pharmacies expanded their access to care. Seven independently owned pharmacies in Tennessee and Kentucky from November 2020 to April 2021 recruited study participants. Qualitative semi-structured key informant interviews were conducted using the theory of planned behavior as a theoretical framework. Participant interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and independently coded by 2 investigators and reviewed by a third investigator. A qualitative analysis was completed, with a selection of supporting quotations for each theme. Qualitative analysis identified participant perceptions of rapid strep and flu POCT and treatments provided in community pharmacies, consistency and quality of patient care, and if these interventions expanded their access to care. A total of 11 patients participated in the interviews; of which, 9 (81.8%) participants were female, and participants ages ranged from 22 to 64 years (median, 40 years). Of 11, 7 participants received a strep test, 3 participants received a flu test, and 1 participant received both the tests. The analysis uncovered 10 major themes within the following 4 different categories: (1) convenience to patients, (2) quality of care received, (3) improved access to care, and (4) additional interventions for which patients want expanded access to care. Pharmacies offering services like rapid strep and flu tests provide convenience and quality care that can help expand patient access to health care and could help provide expanded access for underserved populations.",Journal of the American Pharmacists Association : JAPhA,2022-,"Sahr M, Blower N, Johnston R",3,2097,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Data on the number of board-certified ID specialists was extracted by gender, prefecture, and hospital from the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases database. The numbers and types of Japanese university hospitals that have a Faculty of Medicine, as well as the DMIs legally determined by the Infectious Diseases Control Law, were collected from the database of the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan. As of November 2022, there were 1,688 board-certified ID specialists in Japan, with 510 employed at 82 university hospitals. Two medical schools had no ID specialists, and six had only one ID specialist. There was no ID specialists in 14.3% of Class I DMIs and 66.7% of Class II DMIs. Additionally, 14.9% of prefectures had no ID specialists at all in their Class II DMIs. The percentage of female doctors among ID specialists was 12.7%, approximately half of the overall male-to-female ratio of medical doctors in Japan. The allocation of Japanese ID specialists to medical schools and legally designated healthcare institutes is inadequate and skewed. Female physicians are expected to play a more active role in this increasing demand.",PloS one,2023-,Hagiya H,1,1333,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33926962,Comparing metapopulation dynamics of infectious diseases under different models of human movement.,"Newly available datasets present exciting opportunities to investigate how human population movement contributes to the spread of infectious diseases across large geographical distances. It is now possible to construct realistic models of infectious disease dynamics for the purposes of understanding global-scale epidemics. Nevertheless, a remaining unanswered question is how best to leverage the new data to parameterize models of movement, and whether one's choice of movement model impacts modeled disease outcomes. We adapt three well-studied models of infectious disease dynamics, the susceptible-infected-recovered model, the susceptible-infected-susceptible model, and the Ross-Macdonald model, to incorporate either of two candidate movement models. We describe the effect that the choice of movement model has on each disease model's results, finding that in all cases, there are parameter regimes where choosing one movement model instead of another has a profound impact on epidemiological outcomes. We further demonstrate the importance of choosing an appropriate movement model using the applied case of malaria transmission and importation on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, finding that one model produces intelligible predictions of <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>, whereas the other produces nonsensical results.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2021-May,"Citron DT, Guerra CA, Dolgert AJ, Wu SL, Henry JM, Sánchez C HM, Smith DL",7,1321,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We examined in this study differences in the use of medicines among different age and sex groups of the study participants. Fifteen different refugee shared accommodation centres in the greater Cologne area, a community centre with a language school and consultation office, and other places frequented by the Syrian community. Syrian AS&Rs registered in NRW and residing in the city of Cologne or surrounding areas. The prevalence of using at least one medicine in the 7 days preceding data collection, and the use of prescribed medicines and self-medication. Of the 1641 Syrian AS&Rs who took part in our study, the overall 7-day prevalence of medicine use was 34.9%. Among adults, headache and hypertension were the most common indications that led to medicine use. By dose, hypertension (954 doses) and diabetes (595 doses) were the first and second most frequent indication. Among children, fever and cough were the most common indication; ibuprofen and hederae helicis folium preparations were the most used medicines. Low prevalence was found of medicine use for the treatment of either infectious diseases or mental disorders. Among the Syrian AS&Rs in NRW who participated in the study, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were common presumed causes of use of medication among adults. We encourage future studies to pay more attention to NCDs medicine use among AS&Rs.

Each year approximately 200 IAC arrive in Denmark. These are at increased risk of infectious diseases rarely seen in Danish children. Studies from the 1990s showed that 60% of IAC had infectious diseases and that the majority of these were undetected without screening. The study is a prospective study of medical records from children seen in the adoption clinic at Copenhagen University Hospital in the period 2009-2013. Screening was done for hepatitis A (HAV), B (HBV) and C (HCV), syphilis, HIV, tuberculosis (TB) and intestinal parasites. In 245 IAC tested, 2% had evidence of recent HAV infection, 3% with HBV and one child with HCV, and no cases of HIV were found. One child had antibodies against syphilis (anti-Trpa AB positivity), and 2% were latently infected with tuberculosis. We found 30% infected with pathogenic intestinal parasites. Only 46% had serologic evidence of immunisation against HBV. The prevalence of infections in IAC was lower than previously reported but compared to the general population, a higher prevalence of intestinal parasites, hepatitis and tuberculosis was found. We recommend that IAC are offered screening shortly after arrival.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",2020-May,"Nielsen AV, Kjaergaard J, Pedersen TM, Helmuth IG, Nygaard U, Nielsen HW, Christensen VB, Kurtzhals JAL, Poulsen A",9,1284,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

31740558,Antimicrobial Therapy in the Context of the Damage-Response Framework: the Prospect of Optimizing Therapy by Reducing Host Damage.,"By design, antimicrobial agents act directly on microbial targets. These drugs aim to eliminate microbes and are remarkably effective against susceptible organisms. Nonetheless, some patients succumb to infectious diseases despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Today, with very few exceptions, physicians select antimicrobial therapy based on its activity against the targeted organism without consideration of how the regimen affects patients' immune responses. An important concept to emerge in the past few decades is that immune responses to microbes can be detrimental by enhancing host damage, which can translate into clinical disease. A central tenet of the damage-response framework (DRF) of microbial pathogenesis is that the relevant outcome of host-microbe interaction is the damage that occurs in the host, which can be due to microbial factors, host factors, or both. Given that host damage can make patients sick, reducing it should be a goal of treating infectious diseases. Inflammation and damage that stem from the host response to an infectious disease can increase during therapy with some antimicrobial agents and decrease during therapy with others. When a patient cannot eliminate a microbe with their own immune response, antimicrobial therapy is essential for microbial elimination, and yet it can affect the inflammatory response. In this essay, we discuss antimicrobial therapy in the context of the DRF and propose that consideration of the DRF may help tailor therapy to a patient's need to augment or reduce inflammation.",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2020-Jan,"Pirofski LA, Casadevall A",2,1557,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37934734,Impact of voluntary testing on infectious disease epidemiology: A game theoretic approach.,"The World Health Organization recommends test-and-treat interventions to curb and even eliminate epidemics of HIV, viral hepatitis, and sexually transmitted infections (e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and trichomoniasis). Epidemic models show these goals are achievable, provided the participation of individuals in test-and-treat interventions is sufficiently high. We combine epidemic models and game theoretic models to describe individual's decisions to get tested for infectious diseases within certain epidemiological contexts, and, implicitly, their voluntary participation to test-and-treat interventions. We develop three hybrid models, to discuss interventions against HIV, HCV, and sexually transmitted infections, and the potential behavioral response from the target population. Our findings are similar across diseases. Particularly, individuals use three distinct behavioral patterns relative to testing, based on their perceived costs for testing, besides the payoff for discovering their disease status. Firstly, if the cost of testing is too high, then individuals refrain from voluntary testing and get tested only if they are symptomatic. Secondly, if the cost is moderate, some individuals will test voluntarily, starting treatment if needed. Hence, the spread of the disease declines and the disease epidemiology is mitigated. Thirdly, the most beneficial testing behavior takes place as individuals perceive a per-test payoff that surpasses a certain threshold, every time they get tested. Consequently, individuals achieve high voluntary testing rates, which may result in the elimination of the epidemic, albeit on temporary basis. Trials and studies have attained different levels of participation and testing rates. To increase testing rates, they should provide each eligible individual with a payoff, above a given threshold, each time the individual tests voluntarily.",PloS one,2023-,"Pepiot A, Supervie V, Breban R",3,1903,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We here present an analysis of the social interactions between the healthcare workers at hospitals and nursing homes. Using data from an automated hand hygiene system, we inferred social interactions between healthcare workers to identify transmission paths of infection in hospitals and nursing homes. A majority of social interactions occurred in medication rooms and kitchens emphasising that health-care workers should be especially aware of following the infection prevention guidelines in these places. Using epidemiology simulations of disease at the locations, we found no need to quarantine all healthcare workers at work with a contagious colleague. Only 14.1% and 24.2% of the health-care workers in the hospitals and nursing homes are potentially infected when we disregard hand sanitization and assume the disease is very infectious. Based on our simulations, we observe a 41% and 26% reduction in the number of infected healthcare workers at the hospital and nursing home, when we assume that hand sanitization reduces the spread by 20% from people to people and 99% from people to objects.

A quasi-experimental study was performed at Thammasat University Hospital between August 2019 and April 2020. Data including baseline characteristics and primary and secondary outcomes were collected from the electronic medical record by the ID pharmacist. The ASP guideline adherence in the ID pharmacist-led intervention group was significantly higher than in the standard ASP group (79% vs 56.6%; P < 0.001), especially with regard to appropriate indication (P < 0.001), dosage regimen (P = 0.005), and duration (P = 0.001). The acceptance rate of ID pharmacist recommendations was 81.8% (44/54). The most common key barriers to following recommendations were physician resistance (11/20; 55%) and high severity of disease in the patient (6/20; 30%). Compared to the standard ASP group, there was a trend toward clinical cure in the ID pharmacist-led intervention group (63.6% vs 56.1%; P = 0.127), while 30-day all-cause mortality (15.9% vs 1.5%; P = 0.344) and median length of stay (20 vs 18 days; P = 0.085) were similar in the 2 groups. Carbapenem (P = 0.042) and fosfomycin (P = 0.014) consumption declined in the ID pharmacist-led intervention group. A marginally significant decrease in the overall incidence of MDR pathogens was also observed in the ID pharmacist-led intervention group (coefficient, -5.93; P = 0.049). Our study demonstrates that an ID pharmacist-led intervention can improve ASP guideline adherence and may reduce carbapenem consumption.",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,2022-Jul,"Jantarathaneewat K, Montakantikul P, Weber DJ, Nanthapisal S, Rutjanawech S, Apisarnthanarak A",6,1837,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This secondary analysis study, based on a web-based cross-sectional survey, recruited participants from January 21 to 31, 2019. The participants were asked to recall the most memorable diagnostic error cases in which they were primarily involved. We gathered data on internists' demographics, time to error recognition, and error location. Factors causing diagnostic errors included environmental conditions, information processing, and cognitive bias. Participants scored the significance of each contributing factor on a Likert scale (0, unimportant; 10, extremely important). The Big Three comprised 54.1 % (n=372) of the 687 cases reviewed. The median physician age was 51.5 years (interquartile range, 42-58 years); 65.6 % of physicians worked in hospital settings. Delayed diagnoses were the most common among malignancies (n=64, 46 %). Diagnostic errors related to malignancy were frequent in general outpatient settings on weekdays and in the mornings and were not identified for several months following the event. Environmental factors often contributed to cardiovascular disease-related errors, which were typically identified within days in emergency departments, during night shifts, and on holidays. Information gathering and interpretation significantly impacted infectious disease diagnoses. The Big Three accounted for the majority of cases recalled by Japanese internists. The most relevant contributing factors were different for each of the three categories. Addressing these errors may require a unique approach based on the disease associations.","Diagnosis (Berlin, Germany)",2024-Aug,"Kunitomo K, Gupta A, Harada T, Watari T",4,1761,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Zoonoses frequently emerge from congregate interfaces where multiple animal species and humans coexist, including farms and markets. Traditional food markets are widespread across the globe and create an interface where domestic and wild animals interact among themselves and with humans, increasing the risk of pathogen spillover. Despite decades of evidence linking markets to disease outbreaks across the world, there remains a striking lack of pathogen surveillance programs that can relay timely, cost-effective, and actionable information to decision-makers to protect human and animal health. However, the strategic incorporation of environmental surveillance systems in markets coupled with novel pathogen detection strategies can create an early warning system capable of alerting us to the risk of outbreaks before they happen. Here, we explore the concept of ""smart"" markets that utilize continuous surveillance systems to monitor the emergence of zoonotic pathogens with spillover potential.IMPORTANCEFast detection and rapid intervention are crucial to mitigate risks of pathogen emergence, spillover and spread-every second counts.

However, to date, there has been insufficient political thrust to make that much-needed climate action a reality. Infectious diseases represent only one facet of the threats arising from climate change. Direct impacts from climate change include the more frequent occurrence and increased magnitude of extreme weather events, as well as changing temperatures and precipitation patterns. For climate-sensitive infectious diseases, these changes implicate a shift in geographical and temporal distribution, seasonality, and transmission intensity. Susceptibility to the deleterious effects of climate change is a net result of the interplay of not only environmental factors, but also human, societal, and economic factors, with social inequalities being a major determinant of vulnerability. The global South is already disproportionately affected by the climate crisis. The financial capacity to pursue adaptation options is also limited and unevenly distributed. Climate change-induced mortality and morbidity from both infectious and non-infectious diseases, among other adverse scenarios, are expected to rise globally in the future.

35699560,The Italian Mandatory Notification System: An Important Public Health Tool For Continuous Monitoring Of Infectious Diseases.,"Infectious diseases still register significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Surveillance through a mandatory notification system allows the continuous analysis of the situation even at a local level and its importance has been highlighted by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aimed to outline the importance of the mandatory notification system as a Public Health tool in the continuous monitoring of infectious diseases. To this aim, we carried out a cross-sectional study examining the notifications reported in the Italian territory of Messina, Sicily, in the period 2001-2020. The institutional websites were examined and the notification data were used to obtain the incidences. Overall, a significant reduction of the incidence notification trend was observed. Chickenpox was by far the most notified infectious disease, followed by scabies, pediculosis, and brucellosis. Outbreaks of brucellosis, measles and hepatitis A occurred. All the diseases decreased over time, except syphilis, for which a significant increase was observed. Surveillance of infectious diseases through a mandatory notification system remains a bulwark of public health despite underreporting. Our study reflects the situation of a typical high-income area, although some unexpected criticisms are highlighted.

35495886,A Secure High-Order Gene Interaction Detecting Method for Infectious Diseases.,"Infectious diseases pose a serious threat to human life, the Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) can analyze susceptibility genes of infectious diseases from the genetic level and carry out targeted prevention and treatment. The susceptibility genes for infectious diseases often act in combination with multiple susceptibility sites; therefore, high-order epistasis detection has become an important means. However, due to intensive computational burden and diversity of disease models, existing methods have drawbacks on low detection power, high computation cost, and preference for some types of disease models. Furthermore, these methods are exposed to repeated query and model inversion attacks in the process of iterative optimization, which may disclose Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) information associated with individual privacy. Therefore, in order to solve these problems, this paper proposed a safe harmony search algorithm for high-order gene interaction detection, termed as HS-DP. Firstly, the linear weighting method was used to integrate 5 objective functions to screen out high-order SNP sets with high correlation, including K2-Score, JS divergence, logistic regression, mutual information, and Gini. Then, based on the Differential Privacy (DP) theory, the function disturbance mechanism was introduced to protect the security of individual privacy information associated with the objective function, and we proved the rationality of the disturbance mechanism theoretically. Finally, the practicability and superiority of the algorithm were verified by experiments. Experimental results showed that the algorithm proposed in this paper could improve the detection accuracy to the greatest extent while guaranteeing privacy.",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2022-,"Wang H, Yin H, Wu X",3,1754,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Analysis of the epidemiological situation was based on aggregated data from MZ-56 reports on infectious diseases, infections and poisoning sent from Sanitary Inspections to NIPH NIHNRI. Case-based data for gonorrhoea were analyzed in relation to transmission route and first place of medical diagnosis between 2017-2018. Between 2013-2018 in Poland 8,436 syphilis cases were diagnosed (mean diagnosis rate was 3.66 per 100,000), 2,395 gonorrhoeae cases, whereas number of Chlamydia trachomatis infections from 2014 to 2018 were 1,179 cases. In this time the decrease of 26.2% in newly recognized gonorrhoea cases were observed, whereas the diagnosis rate for chlamydia was stable grew up: from 0.42 per 100,000 in 2014 year to 0.80 in 2018 year. Most STI cases were recognized among men: male to female ratio for syphilis was 5:1, for gonorrhoea 11:1, whereas for chlamydia there is reverse tendency, there are more cases registered among women (0.8:1). There are lower STI diagnosis rates in Poland compare to European countries and there are visible big disproportion between number of cases among men and women. Distribution of cases in all voivodeships in Poland and often huge disproportion in the number of new cases between these voivodeships indicate on underreporting problem in Poland.",Przeglad epidemiologiczny,2021-,"Niedźwiedzka-Stadnik M, Zakrzewska K",2,1509,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32524902,Metal Nanoparticles in Infection and Immunity.,"Background Enthusiasm for the use of metal nanoparticles in human and veterinary medicine is high. Many articles describe the effects of metal nanoparticles on microbes in vitro, and a smaller number of articles describe effects on the immune system, which is the focus of this review. Methods Articles were retrieved by performing literature searches in Medline, of the National Institute of Medicine, as well as via Google Scholar. Results In vitro studies show that metal nanoparticles have antimicrobial effects. Some metal nanoparticles augment innate host immune defenses, such as endogenous antimicrobial peptides, and nitric oxide. Metal nanoparticles may also function as vaccine adjuvants. Metal nanoparticles can migrate to locations distant from the site of administration, however, requiring careful monitoring for toxicity. Conclusions Metal nanoparticles show a great deal of potential as immunomodulators, as well as direct antimicrobial effects. Before metal particles can be adopted as therapies; however, more studies are needed to determine how nanoparticles migrate though the body and on possible adverse effects.",Immunological investigations,2020-Oct,Crane JK,1,1135,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33044601,"Chinese Medicine, Which Targets Body's Response State, Is An Effective Way to Treat Epidemic Infectious Diseases.","In the fight against epidemic infectious diseases in the past 2,000 years, Chinese medicine (CM) has gradually developed a complete response system including diagnosis and treatment. The focal point of CM in the treatment of infectious diseases is the personalized response state to pathogen, which is a treatment method consistent with the personalized concept of precision medicine. Compared with the methods of directly killing or inactivating pathogens, which are used in modern medicine, CM is an effective treatment modality that has a wider range of points of action in the human body. The remarkable effects achieved while treating SARS in 2003 and the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia and the history of the effective responses to epidemics in the past 2,000 years have fully demonstrated the effectiveness of CM in treating infectious diseases. This article discusses the different treatment mechanisms for infectious diseases in CM and modern medicine and the advantages of CM methods, which will reacquaint the world with CM. The improvement of the diagnosis and treatment system of CM based on scientific concepts and methods and the organic combination of both treatment methods of modern medicine and CM will provide the best solution for humans to defeat epidemic infectious diseases.",Chinese journal of integrative medicine,2022-Feb,Yuan B,1,1321,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

A cross-sectional study. A cross-sectional survey of 879 nurses in infectious diseases department of specialty or general hospitals in China completed online questionnaires on the nurses' risk perception questionnaire, quality of working life, psychological resilience and the social support rating scale. Our study observed that risk perception directly negatively influences the quality of working life of infectious disease nurses, while psychological resilience and social support positively chain mediate this relationship. Critical elements impacting the quality of working life of infectious disease nurses are risk perception, psychological resilience and social support. Managers may think about decreasing the level of risk perception and enhancing the quality of working life of infectious disease nurses by enhancing their psychological resilience and providing support. The quality of working life of infectious disease nurses should be a priority for nursing management; it is critical to maintain their health and well-being, raise the quality of care and lower turnover. Managers should create resilience-building programmes and support tools to assist nurses properly perceive risks and adopt protective strategies to deal with them to improve the quality of working life for nurses.",Nursing open,2024-Sep,"Zhang HL, Wu C, Hu MY, Ma WJ, Xu XL, Shi RJ, Lang HJ",7,1515,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34261848,Infectious disease activity during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan: Lessons learned from prevention and control measures.,"In Japan, the Law Concerning the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Medical Care for Patients with Infectious Diseases (the ""Infectious Diseases Control Law"") classifies infectious diseases as category I-V infectious diseases, pandemic influenza, and designated infectious diseases based on their infectivity, severity, and impact on public health. COVID-19 was designated as a designated infectious disease as of February 1, 2020 and then classified under pandemic influenza as of February 13, 2021. According to national reports from sentinel surveillance, some infectious diseases transmitted by droplets, contact, or orally declined during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. As of week 22 (June 6, 2021), there were 704 cumulative cases of seasonal influenza, 8,144 cumulative cases of chickenpox, 356 cumulative cases of mycoplasma pneumonia, and 45 cumulative cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis; these numbers were significantly lower than those last year, with 563,487 cumulative cases of seasonal influenza, 31,785 cumulative cases of chickenpox, 3,518 cumulative cases of mycoplasma pneumonia, and 250 cumulative cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis. Similarly, many infectious diseases transmitted by droplets or contact declined in other countries and areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. One can reasonably assume that various measures adopted to control the transmission of COVID-19 have played a role in reducing the spread of other infectious diseases, and especially those transmitted by droplets or contact. Extensive and thorough implementation of personal protective measures and behavioral changes may serve as a valuable reference when identifying ways to reduce the spread of infectious diseases transmitted by droplets or contact in the future.",Bioscience trends,2021-Sep,"Sawakami T, Karako K, Song P, Sugiura W, Kokudo N",5,1764,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

33657594,New Approach to the Surveillance of Pediatric Infectious Diseases From Ambulatory Pediatricians in the Digital Era.,"Many ambulatory networks in several countries have established syndromic surveillance systems to detect outbreaks of different illnesses. Here, we describe a new Pediatric and Ambulatory Research in Infectious diseases network that combined automated data extraction from the computers of primary care pediatricians. Pediatricians who used the same software, AxiSanté 5-Infansoft for electronic medical records were specially trained in infectious diseases, encouraged to comply with French treatments' recommendations, use of point-of-care tests and vaccination guidelines. Infectious disease diagnoses in children <16 years old in the records triggered automatic data extraction of complete records. A quality control process and external validation were developed. From September 2017 to February 2020, 107 pediatricians enrolled 57,806 children (mean age 2.9 ± 2.6 years at diagnosis) with at least one infectious disease diagnosis among those followed by the network. Among the 118,193 diagnoses, the most frequent were acute otitis media (n = 44,924, 38.0%), tonsillopharyngitis (n = 13,334, 11.3%), gastroenteritis (n = 12,367, 10.5%), influenza (n = 11,062, 9.4%), bronchiolitis (n = 10,531, 8.9%), enteroviral infections (n = 8474, 7.2%) and chickenpox (n = 6857, 5.8%). A rapid diagnostic test was performed in 84.7% of cases of tonsillopharyngitis and was positive in 44%. The antibiotic recommendations from French guidelines were strictly followed: amoxicillin was the most prescribed antibiotic and less than 10% of presumed viral infections were treated. This ""tailor-made"" network set up with quality controls and external validation represents a new approach to the surveillance of pediatric infectious diseases in the digital era and could highly optimize pediatric practices.",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,2021-Jul,"Cohen R, Béchet S, Gelbert N, Frandji B, Vie Le Sage F, Thiebault G, Kochert F, Cahn-Sellem F, Werner A, Ouldali N, Levy C",11,1794,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Recent theory suggests that a generic feature of dynamical systems approaching a tipping point-early warning signals (EWS) due to critical slowing down (CSD)-can anticipate disease emergence and elimination. Empirical studies documenting CSD in observed disease dynamics are scarce, but such demonstration of concept is essential to the further development of model-independent outbreak detection systems. Here, we use fitted, mechanistic models of measles transmission in four cities in Niger to detect CSD through statistical EWS. We find that several EWS accurately anticipate measles re-emergence and elimination, suggesting that CSD should be detectable before disease transmission systems cross key tipping points. These findings support the idea that statistical signals based on CSD, coupled with decision-support algorithms and expert judgement, could provide the basis for early warning systems of disease outbreaks.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2022-Aug,"Tredennick AT, O'Dea EB, Ferrari MJ, Park AW, Rohani P, Drake JM",6,1089,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

At the Department of Emergency, Huizhou Third People's Hospital as the research subject, the common pre-hospital first aid procedure for infectious diseases was identified. The Petri net was used to model and determine the execution time of each link of the pre-hospital first aid process. The isomorphic Markov chain was used to optimize the pre-hospital first aid procedure for infectious diseases. In terms of the emergency path, deep learning was combined with the reinforcement learning model to construct the reinforcement learning model for ambulance path planning. Isomorphic Markov chain analysis revealed that the patient status when returning to the hospital, the time needed for the ambulance to come to designated location, and the on-site treatment were the main problems in the first aid process, and the time needed for the pre-hospital first aid process was reduced by 25.17% after optimization. In conclusion, Petri net and isomorphic Markov chain can optimize the pre-hospital first aid management strategies for patients with infectious diseases, and the use of deep learning algorithm can effectively plan the emergency path, achieving intelligent and informationalized pre-hospital transfer, which provides a basis for reducing the suffering, mortality, and disability rate of patients with infectious diseases.",Acta clinica Croatica,2023-Apr,"Zeng J, Chen W, Chen W, Wang Y, Li X",5,1617,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

(2018). However, larger studies on the complexity of patients related to the involvement of ID consultation services are missing. Data of patients being treated in 2015 and 2019 in four different German university hospitals was retrospectively collected. Data were collected from the hospitals' software system and included whether the patients received an ID consultation as well as patient clinical complexity level (PCCL), case mix index (CMI) and length of stay (LOS) as a measurement for the patients' complexity. Furthermore, a comparison of patients with distinct infectious diseases treated with or without an ID consultation was initiated. In total, 215.915 patients were included in the study, 3% (n = 6311) of those were seen by an ID consultant. Patients receiving ID consultations had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher PCCL (median 4 vs. 0), CMI (median 3,8 vs. 1,1) and deviation of the expected mean LOS (median 7 days vs. 0 days) than patients in the control group. No differences among hospitals or between years were observed. Comparing patients with distinct infectious diseases treated with or without an ID consultation, the differences were confirmed throughout the groups. Patients receiving ID consultations are highly complex, frequently need further treatment after discharge and have a high economic impact. Thus, ID specialists should be clinically trained in a broad spectrum of diseases and treating these complex patients should be sufficiently remunerated.",Infection,2024-Apr,"Meyer-Schwickerath C, Weber C, Hornuss D, Rieg S, Hitzenbichler F, Hagel S, Ankert J, Hennigs A, Glossmann J, Jung N",10,1640,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The major purpose of this article is to theoretically demonstrate that the Chinese government's intervention in large-scale infectious diseases is successful and efficient. Two potential strategies were considered: strategy 1 was infectious disease without government intervention, and strategy 2 was infectious disease with government intervention. By evolution model, this article illustrates the efficiency of big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China. Without government reimbursement, this article finds that high expenditures accelerate the disease infection. The number of infected persons decreases under big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China. The higher the treatment costs, the more important the government intervention. Big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China can serve as an efficient example to cope with big infectious diseases.","Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",2020-,"Nie KX, Wang C, Li XW",3,986,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33444390,Source identification of infectious diseases in networks via label ranking.,"Outbreaks of infectious diseases would cause great losses to the human society. Source identification in networks has drawn considerable interest in order to understand and control the infectious disease propagation processes. Unsatisfactory accuracy and high time complexity are major obstacles to practical applications under various real-world situations for existing source identification algorithms. This study attempts to measure the possibility for nodes to become the infection source through label ranking. A unified Label Ranking framework for source identification with complete observation and snapshot is proposed. Firstly, a basic label ranking algorithm with complete observation of the network considering both infected and uninfected nodes is designed. Our inferred infection source node with the highest label ranking tends to have more infected nodes surrounding it, which makes it likely to be in the center of infection subgraph and far from the uninfected frontier. A two-stage algorithm for source identification via semi-supervised learning and label ranking is further proposed to address the source identification issue with snapshot. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world network datasets. It turns out that the proposed label ranking algorithms are capable of identifying the propagation source under different situations fairly accurately with acceptable computational complexity without knowing the underlying model of infection propagation. The effectiveness and efficiency of the label ranking algorithms proposed in this study make them be of practical value for infection source identification.",PloS one,2021-,"Zhou J, Jiang Y, Huang B",3,1659,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This study examined core emergency response competencies of Chinese nursing personnel related to the outbreak of major infectious diseases. A survey was conducted among 960 nurses working in a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China. Data were collected on core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel caring for patients with major infectious diseases, measuring overall competency as well as by dimensions of prevention ability, rescue ability, and preparation ability. A t-test and one-way analysis of variance were first analyzed for differences between groups, followed by multiple linear regression to analyze main influencing factors for core emergency response competencies. The average score for core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel delivering care to patients with major infectious diseases was 128.05 (SD 22.23) (range 36-180 points); or 71%, which is equivalent to moderate performance. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that the main influencing factors for these nursing personnel were before participation in emergency drills for infectious diseases, current educational background, and working experience in the realm of infectious disease nursing. The final model explained 8.4% of the variance in core emergency response competencies. These findings indicate that it is necessary to strengthen the training of nursing staff with educational background deficits or no prior work or drill experience related to infectious diseases to effectively improve the core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel relative to infectious diseases.",Journal of emergency nursing,2021-Nov,"Song S, Li X, Bell SA, Yang X, Zhang W",5,1724,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Given the importance of model-based analysis in managing public health crises, there has been an increase in post-pandemic creation of both academia-driven modelling centres, hubs and consortiums and government-driven public health agencies with in-house modelling units or teams. However, in the past, the delineation of roles and responsibilities between government- and academia-led modelling groups has often been unclear. Who should perform which tasks and when? This ambiguity can increase the risk of duplicated work or unaddressed gaps in analysis. It also raises questions about the sustainability of modelling capacity for addressing routine operational analytical needs while also developing new approaches that can be tailored for emergencies. In the sections below, we discuss factors that could inform decisions about where to locate infectious disease modelling activity. Rather than giving a fixed set of rules, we outlined key considerations and trade-offs that could be taken into account to enable academic and government modelling activities to complement each other effectively, which can in turn be refined as new public health crises emerge in future.",Epidemics,2024-Dec,"Pung R, Kucharski AJ",2,1333,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33734349,Why genetic selection to reduce the prevalence of infectious diseases is way more promising than currently believed.,"Genetic selection for improved disease resistance is an important part of strategies to combat infectious diseases in agriculture. Quantitative genetic analyses of binary disease status, however, indicate low heritability for most diseases, which restricts the rate of genetic reduction in disease prevalence. Moreover, the common liability threshold model suggests that eradication of an infectious disease via genetic selection is impossible because the observed-scale heritability goes to zero when the prevalence approaches zero. From infectious disease epidemiology, however, we know that eradication of infectious diseases is possible, both in theory and practice, because of positive feedback mechanisms leading to the phenomenon known as herd immunity. The common quantitative genetic models, however, ignore these feedback mechanisms. Here, we integrate quantitative genetic analysis of binary disease status with epidemiological models of transmission, aiming to identify the potential response to selection for reducing the prevalence of endemic infectious diseases. The results show that typical heritability values of binary disease status correspond to a very substantial genetic variation in disease susceptibility among individuals. Moreover, our results show that eradication of infectious diseases by genetic selection is possible in principle. These findings strongly disagree with predictions based on common quantitative genetic models, which ignore the positive feedback effects that occur when reducing the transmission of infectious diseases. Those feedback effects are a specific kind of Indirect Genetic Effects; they contribute substantially to the response to selection and the development of herd immunity (i.e., an effective reproduction ratio less than one).",Genetics,2021-Apr,"Hulst AD, de Jong MCM, Bijma P",3,1789,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Subways-an important aspect of daily travel in big cities-are high-risk sites for the transmission of urban epidemics. Intensive research examining the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases in subways is necessary to ascertain the risk of disease transmission encountered by commuters. In this study, we improve the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model and propose the susceptible-exposed-infected-asymptomatic infected (SEIA) model. First, we added asymptomatic patients to the improved model as a parameter to explore the role of asymptomatic patients in the transmission of infectious diseases in a subway. The numbers of boarding and alighting passengers were added to the model as two time-varying parameters to simulate the exchange of passengers at each station. The improved model could simulate the transmission of infectious diseases in subways and identify the key factors of transmission. We then produced an example of the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in a subway using real subway passenger data substituted into the model for the calculations. We ascertained that the number of exposed people continuously increased with the operation of the subway. Asymptomatic patients had a greater impact on the transmission of infectious diseases than infected people in the course of transmission. The SEIA model constructed in this study accurately determined the spread of infectious diseases in a subway and may also be applicable to studies on the transmission of infectious diseases in other urban public transport systems.",Frontiers in public health,2024-,"Zhou F, Hou F, Wang J, Ma Q, Luo L",5,1695,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

An age-structured infectious disease model with limited vaccine resources is proposed to explore the optimal vaccination ages. The effective reproduction number [Formula: see text] of the epidemic disease is computed. It is shown that the reproduction number is the threshold value for eradicating disease in the sense that the disease-free steady state is globally stable if [Formula: see text] and there exists a unique endemic equilibrium if [Formula: see text]. The effective reproduction number is used as an objective to minimize the disease spread risk.

33088400,Tackling an emerging epidemic: the burden of non-communicable diseases among people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.,"Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is at a crossroad. Over the last decade, successes in the scale up of HIV care and treatment programs has led to a burgeoning number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in care. At the same time, an epidemiologic shift has been witnessed with a concomitant rise in non-communicable diseases (NCD) related morbidity and mortality. Against low levels of domestic financing and strained healthcare delivery platforms, the NCD-HIV syndemic threatens to reverse gains made in care of people living with HIV (PLHIV). NCDs are the global health disruptor of the future. In this review, we draw three proposals for low and middle-income countries (LMICs) based on existing literature, that if contextually adopted would mitigate against impending poor NCD-HIV care outcomes. First, we call for an adoption of universal health coverage by countries in SSA. Secondly, we recommend leveraging on comparably formidable HIV healthcare delivery platforms through integration. Lastly, we advocate for institutional-response building through a multi-stakeholder governance and coordination mechanism. Based on our synthesis of existing literature, adoption of these three strategies would be pivotal to sustain gains made so far for NCD-HIV care in SSA.",The Pan African medical journal,2020-,"Achwoka D, Mutave R, Oyugi JO, Achia T",4,1260,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39839432,Analysis report on trends in public infectious disease control in China.,"The prevention and control of public infectious diseases is a significant issue in the global health sector. Controlling infectious diseases is crucial for maintaining public health. As the most populous country in the world, China still faces a series of new challenges in the control of public infectious diseases. Therefore, it is of great significance to conduct an in-depth analysis of the trends in the control of public infectious diseases. This study selects the death rate, incidence rate, proportion of prevention and control funds input, and the proportion of professional technical personnel in China from 2018 to 2023 as research samples and conducts statistical analysis through multiple linear regression. Overall, factors such as the incidence rate, proportion of prevention and control funds input, and proportion of professional technical personnel can explain 98.7% of the trend changes in the infectious disease death rate. Through multiple regression analysis, the regression coefficient value of 0.001 for the incidence rate indicates a significant positive impact on the mortality rate, meaning that an increase in the incidence of infectious diseases leads to a rise in mortality. The regression coefficient value of -0.012 for the proportion of funding input suggests a significant negative impact on the mortality rate, implying that increased investment in prevention and control funds will correspondingly reduce the mortality rate of infectious diseases. On the other hand, merely increasing the number of professional and technical personnel is not sufficient to control the spread of infectious diseases; comprehensive use of various prevention and control measures is required for effective public infectious disease control. Public infectious disease prevention and control is a complex process that requires the consideration of multiple factors, rather than merely changing a single factor, particularly in controlling incidence rates and reasonably allocating funds. By refining the analysis of infectious disease control strategies and integrating diverse preventive and intervention measures, it is possible to better control the spread and mortality of infectious diseases, thereby protecting public health and safety.",Frontiers in public health,2024-,Zhang Z,1,2257,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39139663,The impact of population influx on infectious diseases - from the mediating effect of polluted air transmission.,"The global population influx during the COVID-19 pandemic poses significant challenges to public health, making the prevention and control of infectious diseases a pressing concern. This paper aims to examine the impact of population influx on the spread of infectious diseases, with a specific emphasis on the mediating role of air pollution in this process. A theoretical analysis is conducted to explore the relationship between population influx, air pollution, and infectious diseases. Additionally, we establish a series of econometric models and employ various empirical tests and analytical techniques, including mediation effect test, threshold effect test, and systematic GMM test, to evaluate our hypotheses. The results indicate that: (1) Population influx directly and indirectly impacts infectious diseases. Specifically, population influx not only directly elevates the risk of infectious diseases, but also indirectly increases the incidence rate of infectious diseases by intensifying air pollution. (2) The impact of population inflow on infectious diseases exhibits regional heterogeneity. Compared to central and western China, the eastern regions exhibit a significantly higher risk of infectious diseases, exceeding the national average. (3) External factors influence the relationship between population influx and infectious diseases differently. Personal income and medical resources both help mitigate the risk of infectious diseases due to population influx, with medical resources having a more substantial effect. Contrary to expectations, abundant educational resources have not reduced the risk, instead, they have exacerbated the risk associated with population influx. This paper provides a scientific basis for formulating effective strategies for the prevention and control of infectious diseases.",Frontiers in public health,2024-,"Fu H, Zhu C",2,1832,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of IVIG can be life-saving; however, recent administration may complicate evaluation for infection. To assess the impact of IVIG therapy on a variety of common viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic serologies we prospectively evaluated serologic changes pre- and post-IVIG infusion in 7 participants. The number of new antibody detections ranging from 2 to 5. New detections included positivity for Epstein-Barr virus early D antigen, herpes simplex virus, West Nile virus, cytomegalovirus, and the endemic mycoses Histoplasma and Coccidioides. The greatest number of newly positive serologies was observed in subjects receiving cumulative doses of IVIG in excess of 100 g. Our results illustrate the difficulty in serologic interpretation following IVIG therapy and suggest a dose-response to new positive results.

33653146,Mapping time use in clinical trials for vaccines against emerging infectious diseases.,"Vaccines are potent tools to prevent outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases from becoming epidemics and need to be developed at an accelerated pace to have any impact on the course of an ongoing epidemic. The aim of this study was to describe time use in the execution of vaccine trials, to identify steps that could be accelerated to improve preparedness and planning for future emerging infectious diseases vaccine trials. We used a mixed-methods approach to map time use and process steps that could be accelerated during vaccine trials. Trials for vaccines against infectious diseases registered in three global trial databases reported in the period 2011-2017 were eligible to join the survey. We invited sponsors to contribute data through a predefined structured questionnaire for clinical trial process metrics. Data were stratified by trial phase, disease type (i.e. emerging infectious diseases or not emerging infectious diseases), sponsor type, and continent. Qualitative interviews were conducted with purposively selected sponsors, and thematic analysis of the interview transcripts was performed. Based on data from 155 vaccine trials including 29,071 subjects, 52% were phase I, 23% phase II, and 25% phase III. We found that the regulatory approval, subject enrollment, study execution, and study close-out accounted for most of the cycle time of the vaccine trial process. Cycle times for the regulatory and ethical approvals, contract agreement, site initiation, and study execution were shorter in trials conducted during outbreaks. Qualitative interviews indicated that early engagement of the regulatory and independent ethical committee authorities in planning the vaccine trials was critical for saving time in trial approval. Furthermore, adapting the trial implementation to the reality of the study sites and active involvement of the local investigators during the planning of the trial and protocol writing were stated to be of paramount importance to successful completion of trials at an accelerated pace. The regulatory approval, subject recruitment, study execution, and close-out cycle times accounted for most of the vaccine trial time use and are activities that could be accelerated during a vaccine trial planning and implementation. We encourage tracking of key cycle time metrics and facilitating sharing of knowledge across industry and academia, as this may serve to reduce the time from index case detection to access of a vaccine during emerging infectious diseases epidemics.","Clinical trials (London, England)",2021-Jun,"Mandi H, Yimer SA, Norheim G",3,2523,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36348272,Can breeders prevent pathogen adaptation when selecting for increased resistance to infectious diseases?,"Recent research shows that genetic selection has high potential to reduce the prevalence of infectious diseases in livestock. However, like all interventions that target infectious diseases, genetic selection of livestock can exert selection pressure on pathogen populations. Such selection on the pathogen may lead to escape strategies and reduce the effect of selection of livestock for disease resistance. Thus, to successfully breed livestock for lower disease prevalence, it is essential to develop strategies that prevent the invasion of pathogen mutants that escape host resistance. Here we investigate the conditions under which such ""escape mutants"" can replace wild-type pathogens in a closed livestock population using a mathematical model of disease transmission. Assuming a single gene that confers sufficient resistance, results show that genetic selection for resistance in livestock typically leads to an ""invasion window"" within which an escape mutant of the pathogen can invade. The bounds of the invasion window are determined by the frequency of resistant hosts in the population. The lower bound occurs when the escape mutant has an advantage over the wild-type pathogen in the population. The upper bound occurs when local eradication of the pathogen is expected. The invasion window is smallest when host resistance is strong and when infection with the wild-type pathogen provides cross immunity to infection with the escape mutant. To minimise opportunities for pathogens to adapt, under the assumptions of our model, the aim of disease control through genetic selection should be to achieve herd-level eradication of the infection faster than the rate of emergence of escape mutants of the pathogen. Especially for microparasitic infections, this could be achieved by placing animals into herds according to their genetic resistance, such that these herds stay completely out of the invasion window. In contrast to classical breeding theory, our model suggests that multi-trait selection with gradual improvement of each trait of the breeding goal might not be the best strategy when resistance to infectious disease is part of the breeding goal. Temporally, combining genetic selection with other interventions helps to make the invasion window smaller, and thereby reduces the risk of invasion of escape mutants.","Genetics, selection, evolution : GSE",2022-Nov,"Hulst AD, Bijma P, De Jong MCM",3,2340,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

It shows how shortcomings in the areas of public health focus, vigilance and resilience will be addressed through specific strategies in the coming years and how these strategies will lead to stronger surveillance systems for early detection and monitoring of public health threats as well as informing their effective prevention and control. A sharper public health focus is expected from a more targeted list of notifiable diseases, strictly public-health-objective-driven surveillance standards, and consequently, leaner surveillance systems. Vigilance should improve through mandatory event reporting, more automated epidemic intelligence processing and increased use of genomic surveillance. Finally, EU/EEA surveillance systems should become more resilient by modernising the underlying information technology infrastructure, expanding the influenza sentinel surveillance system to other respiratory viruses for better pandemic preparedness, and increasingly exploiting potentially more robust alternative data sources, such as electronic health records and wastewater surveillance. Continued close collaboration across EU/EEA countries will be key to ensuring the full implementation of this surveillance framework and more effective disease prevention and control.",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,2024-Aug,"Zucs P, Beauté J, Palm D, Spiteri G",4,1463,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This paper proposes a complex network epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate and quadratic transmission. The Turing pattern, sensitivity analysis and parameter identification of the epidemic model under different network structures are studied; METHODS:: this paper discusses the Turing pattern of the model under different network structures, and identifies the key parameters of the model through sensitivity analysis. The influence of network dimension on the spread of infectious diseases on random networks is also explored, and the problems of minimum path and minimum cover set of random networks are further discussed. We also carry out parameter identification experiments, adopt gradient descent algorithm to realize heterogeneous spatial fitting pattern of red blood cell plasma and simulate the transmission path of COVID-19 through Markov chain Monte Carlo fitting experiment, verifying the effectiveness of the model; RESULTS:: the necessary conditions for Turing instability on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks are found. On the heterogeneous lattice network, we observe the special patterns of equal density population. Sensitivity analysis shows that the higher the infection rate, the more infected people. On random networks, the higher the dimension, the better the effect of suppressing the spread of infectious diseases. Through comparison experiment, it is found that gradient descent algorithm has the best performance in parameter identification experiments. Red blood cell plasma fitting experiment reveals the spatial density distribution of infection rate; CONCLUSIONS:: this study provides theoretical support for the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and the complex network model can simulate the transmission process of infectious diseases more accurately. Sensitivity analysis and parameter identification experiments reveal the key influencing factors of propagation and the role of network structure. The effectiveness of the model is supported by actual data, which is helpful for the government health departments to formulate scientific prevention and control strategies.",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,2025-Jan,"Zhu L, Chen S, Shen S",3,2260,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We first describe the long-term aging-profile of the population by describing the pattern and stability of equilibrium of the demographic model. We also investigate the disease transmission dynamics, using the epidemic model when the population reaches the positive equilibrium (limiting equation). We establish conditions for the existence, uniqueness and global stability of the disease endemic equilibrium. We then prove the global stability of the endemic equilibrium for the original epidemic model with varying population demographics. The global stability of the endemic equilibrium allows us to examine the effects of reproduction ageing and rate, under different family planning strategies, on the childhood infectious disease transmission dynamics. We also examine demographic distribution, diseases reproductive number, infant disease rate and age distribution of disease, and as such, the work can be potentially used to inform targeted age group for optimal vaccine booster programs.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2020-Nov,"Su Q, Wu J",2,1278,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

To assess how common assumptions relate to real-world interactions, we analysed 11 networks from five settings and developed metrics, capturing crucial epidemiological features of these networks. We developed a novel metric, the 'retention index', to characterize the distribution of retained contacts over consecutive time steps relative to fully static and dynamic networks. In workplaces and schools, contacts in the same department formed most of the retained contacts. In contrast, no clear contact type dominated the retained contacts in hospitals, thus reducing overall risk of disease introduction would be more effective than control targeted at departments. We estimated the contacts repetition over multiple days and showed that simple resource planning models overestimate the number of unique contacts by 20%-70%. We distinguished the difference between 'superspreader' and infectious individuals driving 'superspreading events' by measuring how often the individual represents the top 80% of contacts in the time steps over the study duration. We showed an inherent difficulty in identifying 'superspreaders' reliably: less than 20% of the individuals in most settings were highly connected for multiple time steps.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2024-Dec,"Pung R, Firth JA, Russell TW, Rogers T, Lee VJ, Kucharski AJ",6,1421,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

38857274,Infection patterns in simple and complex contagion processes on networks.,"Contagion processes, representing the spread of infectious diseases, information, or social behaviors, are often schematized as taking place on networks, which encode for instance the interactions between individuals. The impact of the network structure on spreading process has been widely investigated, but not the reverse question: do different processes unfolding on a given network lead to different infection patterns? How do the infection patterns depend on a model's parameters or on the nature of the contagion processes? Here we address this issue by investigating the infection patterns for a variety of models. In simple contagion processes, where contagion events involve one connection at a time, we find that the infection patterns are extremely robust across models and parameters. In complex contagion models instead, in which multiple interactions are needed for a contagion event, non-trivial dependencies on models parameters emerge, as the infection pattern depends on the interplay between pairwise and group contagions. In models involving threshold mechanisms moreover, slight parameter changes can significantly impact the spreading paths. Our results show that it is possible to study crucial features of a spread from schematized models, and inform us on the variations between spreading patterns in processes of different nature.",PLoS computational biology,2024-Jun,"Contreras DA, Cencetti G, Barrat A",3,1357,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We developed a simulator for epidemics with multiple infections on networks and analysed the resulting individual infection time series by introducing similarity metrics between hosts based on their multiple infection histories. We find that, depending on infection multiplicity and network sampling, multiple infection summary statistics can recover network properties such as degree distribution. Furthermore, we show that by mining simulation outputs for multiple infection patterns, one can detect immunological interference between pathogens (i.e. the fact that past infections in a host condition future probability of infection).

32956345,Fast estimation of time-varying infectious disease transmission rates.,"Compartmental epidemic models have been used extensively to study the historical spread of infectious diseases and to inform strategies for future control. A critical parameter of any such model is the transmission rate. Temporal variation in the transmission rate has a profound influence on disease spread. For this reason, estimation of time-varying transmission rates is an important step in identifying mechanisms that underlie patterns in observed disease incidence and mortality. Here, we present and test fast methods for reconstructing transmission rates from time series of reported incidence. Using simulated data, we quantify the sensitivity of these methods to parameters of the data-generating process and to mis-specification of input parameters by the user. We show that sensitivity to the user's estimate of the initial number of susceptible individuals-considered to be a major limitation of similar methods-can be eliminated by an efficient, ""peak-to-peak"" iterative technique, which we propose. The method of transmission rate estimation that we advocate is extremely fast, for even the longest infectious disease time series that exist. It can be used independently or as a fast way to obtain better starting conditions for computationally expensive methods, such as iterated filtering and generalized profiling.",PLoS computational biology,2020-Sep,"Jagan M, deJonge MS, Krylova O, Earn DJD",4,1333,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33313803,Evaluation of Infectious Disease Test Ordering and Positivity Rates in Illicit Fentanyl Users.,"The emergence of illicit fentanyl use has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality. Although illicit use of other opioids has been associated with transmission of viral and bacterial infections, limited data exist for the prevalence of infectious diseases among illicit fentanyl users. The purpose of this study was to assess the likelihood of infectious disease testing and infection prevalence among illicit fentanyl users. Results from urine drug screens (UDSs) performed from August 13, 2019, to October 16, 2019, were obtained from the laboratory information system with concurrent microbial testing. Patients were categorized based on UDS results, and illicit drug use was inferred from physician encounter notes in the electronic medical record. Suspected illicit drugs users with fentanyl detected by UDS were more likely to be screened [odds ratio (OR): 1.7; 95% CI, 1.26-2.4] and test positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) by immunoassay (OR: 5.89; 95% CI, 2.93-11.31) than patients without drugs detected. Patients with suspected illicit fentanyl use who were discharged from the emergency department (ED) were less likely to be tested for HCV than patients in outpatient settings (OR: 3.47; 95% CI, 1.05-10.4) and inpatient settings (OR: 17.43; 95% CI, 6.53-45.88). Patients with suspected illicit fentanyl use were more likely to have infected abscesses or wounds (OR: 5.12; 95% CI, 2.07-13.7) and Staphylococcus aureus infections (OR: 4.5; 95% CI, 1.59-12.28) than patients without drugs detected. Patients with a positive UDS for fentanyl and suspected illicit use were more likely to test positive for HCV, were rarely screened for HCV in the ED, and had an increased risk of invasive S. aureus wound or abscess infection. These findings may represent considerable barriers to care for patients who use fentanyl illicitly.",The journal of applied laboratory medicine,2021-Jan,"Lloyd M, Ransom EM, Anderson NW, Farnsworth CW",4,1845,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33963679,'Accidents waiting to happen'-Insights from a simple model on the emergence of infectious agents in new hosts.,"This study evaluates through modelling the possible individual and combined effect of three populational parameters of pathogens (reproduction rate; rate of novelty emergence; and propagule size) on the colonization of new host species-putatively the most fundamental process leading to the emergence of new infectious diseases. The results are analysed under the theoretical framework of the Stockholm Paradigm using IBM simulations to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of the pathogen population and the possible role of Ecological Fitting. The simulations suggest that all three parameters positively influence the success of colonization of new hosts by a novel parasite population, but contrary to the prevailing belief, the rate of novelty emergence (e.g. mutations) is the least important factor. Maximization of all parameters results in a synergetic facilitation of the colonization and emulates the expected scenario for pathogenic microorganisms. The simulations also provide theoretical support for the retention of the capacity of fast-evolving lineages to retro-colonize their previous host species/lineage by ecological fitting. Capacity is, thus, much larger than we can anticipate. Hence, the results support the empirical observations that opportunity of encounter (i.e. the breakdown in mechanisms for ecological isolation) is a fundamental determinant to the emergence of new associations-especially Emergent Infectious Diseases-and the dynamics of host exploration, as observed in SARS-CoV-2. Insights on the dynamics of Emergent Infectious Diseases derived from the simulations and from the Stockholm Paradigm are discussed.",Transboundary and emerging diseases,2022-Jul,"Feronato SG, Araujo S, Boeger WA",3,1656,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39501756,Model-informed optimal allocation of limited resources to mitigate infectious disease outbreaks in societies at war.,"Infectious diseases thrive in war-torn societies. The recent sharp increase in human conflict and war thus requires the development of disease mitigation tools that account for the specifics of war, such as the scarcity of important public health resources. We developed a compartmental, differential equation-based disease model that considers key social, war and disease mechanisms, such as gender homophily and the replacement of soldiers. This model enables the identification of optimal allocation strategies that, given limited resources required for treating infected individuals, minimize disease burden, assessed by total mortality and final epidemic size. A comprehensive model analysis reveals that the level of resource scarcity fundamentally affects the optimal allocation. Desynchronization of the epidemic peaks among several population subgroups emerges as a desirable principle since it reduces disease spread between different subgroups. Further, the level of preferential mixing among people of the same gender, gender homophily, proves to strongly affect disease dynamics and optimal treatment allocation strategies, highlighting the importance of accurately accounting for heterogeneous mixing patterns. Altogether, the findings help answer a timely question: how can infectious diseases be best controlled in societies at war? The developed model can be easily extended to specific diseases, countries and interventions.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2024-Nov,"Srivastava V, Sarkar D, Kadelka C",3,1442,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The aim of this study is to capture a situation snapshot revealing the proportion of individuals aged 65 years and over among inpatients in healthcare institutions in Turkey and the prevalence and type of infections in this patient group in order to draw a road map. Hospitalized patients over 65 years at any of the 62 hospitals in 29 cities across Turkey on February 9, 2017 were included in the study. Web-based SurveyMonkey was used for data recording and evaluation system. Of 17,351 patients 5871 (33.8%) were ≥65 years old. The mean age was 75.1±7.2 years; 3075 (52.4%) patients were male. Infection was reason for admission for 1556 (26.5%) patients. Pneumonia was the most common infection. The median length of hospital stay was 5 days (IQR: 2-11 days). The Antibiotic therapy was initiated for 2917 (49.7%) patients at the time of admission, and 23% of the antibiotics prescribed were inappropriate. Healthcare-associated infections developed in 1059 (18%) patients. Urinary catheters were placed in 2388 (40.7%) patients with 7.5% invalid indication. This study used real data to reveal the proportion of elderly patients in hospital admissions. The interventions done, infections developed during hospitalization, length of hospital stay, and excessive drug load emphasize the significant impact on health costs and illustrate the importance of preventive medicine in this group of patients.",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2020-Nov,"Kurtaran B, Kuscu F, Korkmaz P, Ozdemir B, Inan D, Oztoprak N, Ozatag DM, Daglı O, Birengel S, Ozdemir K",10,1458,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38717930,A risk-induced dispersal strategy of the infected population for a disease-free state in the SIS epidemic model.,"This article proposes a dispersal strategy for infected individuals in a spatial susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model. The presence of spatial heterogeneity and the movement of individuals play crucial roles in determining the persistence and eradication of infectious diseases. To capture these dynamics, we introduce a moving strategy called risk-induced dispersal (RID) for infected individuals in a continuous-time patch model of the SIS epidemic. First, we establish a continuous-time <i>n</i>-patch model and verify that the RID strategy is an effective approach for attaining a disease-free state. This is substantiated through simulations conducted on 7-patch models and analytical results derived from 2-patch models. Second, we extend our analysis by adapting the patch model into a diffusive epidemic model. This extension allows us to explore further the impact of the RID movement strategy on disease transmission and control. We validate our results through simulations, which provide the effects of the RID dispersal strategy.",Journal of biological dynamics,2024-Dec,"Choi W, Ahn I",2,1058,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

A classification model was established using naïve Bayesian classifier. Dataset from historical outbreaks was applied for model validation, while sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and M-index were presented.A total of 146 predictors were included in the classification model, for discriminating 25 common infectious diseases. The sensitivity ranged from 44.44% for hepatitis E to 96.67% for measles. The specificity varied from 96.36% for dengue fever to 100% for 5 diseases. The median of total accuracy was 97.41% (range: 93.85%-99.04%). The AUCs exceeded 0.98 in 11 of 12 diseases, except in dengue fever (0.613). The M-index was 0.960 (95%CI 0.941-0.978).A novel classification model was constructed based on Bayesian approach to discriminate common infectious diseases in Zhejiang province, China.

The aim of this descriptive, cross-sectional survey study was to investigate nursing intention among nurses caring for emerging infectious disease patients in Korea and to describe factors influencing nurses' intention to care by applying the theory of planned behavior. A total of 147 Korean nurses were included and data accrued using an online questionnaire. Among the independent variables, perceived behavioral control, attitudes toward the behavior, and sex significantly influenced nursing intention. These variables explained 55.1% of nursing intention to care for patients with emerging infectious diseases, and perceived behavioral control (confidence or self-efficacy in caring for patients) was the strongest predictor. These findings showed the usefulness of the theory of planned behavior in predicting nurses' intention to care for patients with emerging infectious diseases. Providing an educational program on caring for patients with pandemic diseases would also increase self-confidence and reduce concerns. In addition, institutional support, such as compensation payments and recognition from administrators, would also strengthen positive attitudes among nurses.",Nursing & health sciences,2020-Mar,"Lee J, Kang SJ",2,1306,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35716723,A direct comparison of methods for assessing the threat from emerging infectious diseases in seasonally varying environments.,"Seasonal variations in environmental conditions lead to changing infectious disease epidemic risks at different times of year. The probability that early cases initiate a major epidemic depends on the season in which the pathogen enters the population. The instantaneous epidemic risk (IER) can be tracked. This quantity is straightforward to calculate, and corresponds to the probability of a major epidemic starting from a single case introduced at time t=t<sub>0</sub>, assuming that environmental conditions remain identical from that time onwards (i.e. for all t≥t<sub>0</sub>). However, the threat when a pathogen enters the population in fact depends on changes in environmental conditions occurring within the timescale of the initial phase of the outbreak. For that reason, we compare the IER with a different metric: the case epidemic risk (CER). The CER corresponds to the probability of a major epidemic starting from a single case entering the population at time t=t<sub>0</sub>, accounting for changes in environmental conditions after that time. We show how the IER and CER can be calculated using different epidemiological models (the stochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Removed model and a stochastic host-vector model that is parameterised using temperature data for Miami) in which transmission parameter values vary temporally. While the IER is always easy to calculate numerically, the adaptable method we provide for calculating the CER for the host-vector model can also be applied easily and solved using widely available software tools. In line with previous research, we demonstrate that, if a pathogen is likely to either invade the population or fade out on a fast timescale compared to changes in environmental conditions, the IER closely matches the CER. However, if this is not the case, the IER and the CER can be significantly different, and so the CER should be used. This demonstrates the need to consider future changes in environmental conditions carefully when assessing the risk posed by emerging pathogens.",Journal of theoretical biology,2022-Sep,"Kaye AR, Hart WS, Bromiley J, Iwami S, Thompson RN",5,2044,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Despite improvements in patient outcomes, many clinical microbiology laboratories are facing challenges to in-sourcing these technologies. Depending on a multitude of factors, including size, location and patient population served, these barriers may affect some laboratories and hospital systems to greater or lesser extents than others. It will be up to each individual facility to ascertain its ability to overcome barriers.

The multiagent description leads to the study of the evolution over time of a system of kinetic equations for the wealth densities of susceptible, infectious, and recovered individuals, whose proportions are driven by a classical compartmental model in epidemiology. Explicit calculations show that the spread of the disease seriously affects the distribution of wealth, which, unlike the situation in the absence of epidemics, can converge toward a stationary state with a bimodal form. Furthermore, simulations confirm the ability of the model to describe different phenomenon characteristics of economic trends in situations compromised by the rapid spread of an epidemic, such as the unequal impact on the various wealth classes and the risk of a shrinking middle class.",Physical review.

He made many contributions to mathematical epidemiology, a field that is strongly connected to data, but he always chose to avoid data analysis. Nevertheless, he recognized that fitting models to data is usually necessary when attempting to apply infectious disease transmission models to real public health problems. He was curious to know how one goes about fitting dynamical models to data, and why it can be hard. Initially in response to Fred's questions, we developed a user-friendly R package, fitode, that facilitates fitting ordinary differential equations to observed time series. Here, we use this package to provide a brief tutorial introduction to fitting compartmental epidemic models to a single observed time series. We assume that, like Fred, the reader is familiar with dynamical systems from a mathematical perspective, but has limited experience with statistical methodology or optimization techniques.",Bulletin of mathematical biology,2024-Jul,"Earn DJD, Park SW, Bolker BM",3,1029,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Data on the optimal clinical scenarios in which to use this tool are limited. We assessed, via retrospective chart review, the rate of organism identification and impact on clinical management from BRPCR testing sent from our quaternary care children's hospital between February 2010 and June 2020. A total of 382 samples were sent from 269 individual patients. A total of 200 (74.3%) patients were immunocompromised. Median age at time of sample collection was 10.0 years (interquartile range, 4.2 to 15.8). A total of 254/377 (64.7%) samples were from patients known to be on ≥1 antimicrobial in the 24 h prior to sample collection. A total of 112/382 (29.3%) samples were from patients ultimately diagnosed with a bacterial or fungal infection by another testing modality. The most common sample types were bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (45), lung tissue (41), and bone (39). An organism was identified from 83 (21.7%) samples, but results from only 19 (5.0%) samples led to a change in management. Organisms were identified from 18 (40%) BAL samples; only 2 (4.4%) were judged to be clinically significant. A total of 4/12 (33.3%) samples from cardiac hardware changed clinical management. We found that only 5% of BRPCR results influenced antimicrobial management in a diverse pediatric cohort. Our findings suggest that the impact on clinical management varied widely by sample type.

Mpox diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR from oropharyngeal swabs, skin lesions, and other body fluids. Out of 154 patients confirmed with mpox in 2022, 99.3% were males, with a median age (years) of 35 (IQR 30-39), 90.2% MSM and 48.7% PLWH.

Stratifying etiologies based on initial clinical and laboratory data would facilitate etiology-based treatment rather than relying on empirical treatment. Here, we report the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of patients with CNS infections from a prospective surveillance study that took place between 2013 and 2016 in Singapore. Using multiple correspondence analysis and random forest, we analyzed the link between clinical presentation, laboratory results, outcome and etiology. Of 199 patients, etiology was identified as infectious in 110 (55.3%, 95%-CI 48.3-62.0), immune-mediated in 10 (5.0%, 95%-CI 2.8-9.0), and unknown in 79 patients (39.7%, 95%-CI 33.2-46.6). The initial presenting clinical features were associated with the prognosis at 2 weeks, while laboratory-related parameters were related to the etiology of CNS disease. The parameters measured were helpful to stratify etiologies in broad categories, but were not able to discriminate completely between all the etiologies. Our results suggest that while prognosis of CNS is clearly related to the initial clinical presentation, pinpointing etiology remains challenging.

The model is developed based on the six compartments: susceptible, latent, infected, asymptomatic, treated, and recovered individuals. We determine the effective reproduction number for this nonautonomous system, and analytic discussion shows that at least one positive periodic solution exists for R<sub>0</sub>>1. The model is simulated using the RK-45 numerical method, and the parameter values for the model are taken from the available literature. From the numerical results, we observe that the degree of seasonality and vaccine efficacy significantly impact the amplitude of the epidemic curve. The latent-infected phase plane shows that periodic solutions exhibit a period-doubling bifurcation as the amplitude of seasonality increases.

Here, we have assessed the impact of sharing haulage vehicles from livestock transport service providers on the connectivity between farms as well as on the spread of swine infectious diseases in Great Britain (GB). Using all pig movement records between April 2012 and March 2014 in GB, we built a series of directed and weighted static multiplex networks consisting of two layers of identical nodes, where nodes (farms) are linked either by (a) the direct movement of pigs and (b) the shared use of haulage vehicles.

Each provider participated in one of three on-site focus groups. Participants answered questions about how they gained their knowledge, felt about caring for EVD patients, made decisions about caring for EVD patients, and suggestions for improvement of ID preparedness. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and coded using inductive content analysis. <b>Results:</b> Analysis revealed five prominent themes: reactions to scare, education/training, danger, decision making, and suggestions for future responses. Overall, first responders were excited to be a part of the response to EVD. They were more comfortable caring for EVD patients if they received adequate education and transparency from the administration. This resulted in a decreased perceived danger of the disease and decreased hesitancy when caring for EVD patients. However, those that expressed the most hesitancy also expressed the most emotional distress. Suggestions for improvement of ID preparedness included continuing education, tiered training models, peer training models, collaboration between emergency medical services (EMS) systems, better communication between departments, and the development of an infectious disease response team. <b>Conclusions:</b> Although first responders were excited to be a part of the response to EVD, this did not come without hesitation and emotional distress. Some of these concerns may be mitigated by first providing a clear definition of ""duty to care,"" followed by interventions such as the development of clear and consistent ID preparedness training and interventions that address the emotional distress experienced by these providers.",Prehospital emergency care,2020-,"Alexander AB, Masters MM, Warren K",3,2115,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

39325530,An Ontology to Bridge the Clinical Management of Patients and Public Health Responses for Strengthening Infectious Disease Surveillance: Design Science Study.,"Novel surveillance approaches using digital technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), have evolved, enhancing traditional infectious disease surveillance systems by enabling real-time detection of outbreaks and reaching a wider population. However, disparate, heterogenous infectious disease surveillance systems often operate in silos due to a lack of interoperability. As a life-changing clinical use case, the COVID-19 pandemic has manifested that a lack of interoperability can severely inhibit public health responses to emerging infectious diseases. Interoperability is thus critical for building a robust ecosystem of infectious disease surveillance and enhancing preparedness for future outbreaks. The primary enabler for semantic interoperability is ontology. This study aims to design the IoT-based management of infectious disease ontology (IoT-MIDO) to enhance data sharing and integration of data collected from IoT-driven patient health monitoring, clinical management of individual patients, and disparate heterogeneous infectious disease surveillance. The ontology modeling approach was chosen for its semantic richness in knowledge representation, flexibility, ease of extensibility, and capability for knowledge inference and reasoning. The IoT-MIDO was developed using the basic formal ontology (BFO) as the top-level ontology. We reused the classes from existing BFO-based ontologies as much as possible to maximize the interoperability with other BFO-based ontologies and databases that rely on them. We formulated the competency questions as requirements for the ontology to achieve the intended goals. We designed an ontology to integrate data from heterogeneous sources, including IoT-driven patient monitoring, clinical management of individual patients, and infectious disease surveillance systems. This integration aims to facilitate the collaboration between clinical care and public health domains. We also demonstrate five use cases using the simplified ontological models to show the potential applications of IoT-MIDO: (1) IoT-driven patient monitoring, risk assessment, early warning, and risk management; (2) clinical management of patients with infectious diseases; (3) epidemic risk analysis for timely response at the public health level; (4) infectious disease surveillance; and (5) transforming patient information into surveillance information. The development of the IoT-MIDO was driven by competency questions. Being able to answer all the formulated competency questions, we successfully demonstrated that our ontology has the potential to facilitate data sharing and integration for orchestrating IoT-driven patient health monitoring in the context of an infectious disease epidemic, clinical patient management, infectious disease surveillance, and epidemic risk analysis. The novelty and uniqueness of the ontology lie in building a bridge to link IoT-based individual patient monitoring and early warning based on patient risk assessment to infectious disease epidemic surveillance at the public health level. The ontology can also serve as a starting point to enable potential decision support systems, providing actionable insights to support public health organizations and practitioners in making informed decisions in a timely manner.",JMIR formative research,2024-Sep,"Lim S, Johannesson P",2,3298,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39587221,Causal inference concepts can guide research into the effects of climate on infectious diseases.,"A pressing question resulting from global warming is how climate change will affect infectious diseases. Answering this question requires research into the effects of weather on the population dynamics of transmission and infection; elucidating these effects, however, has proved difficult due to the challenges of assessing causality from the predominantly observational data available in epidemiological research. Here we show how concepts from causal inference-the sub-field of statistics aiming at inferring causality from data-can guide that research. Through a series of case studies, we illustrate how such concepts can help assess study design and strategically choose a study's location, evaluate and reduce the risk of bias, and interpret the multifaceted effects of meteorological variables on transmission. More broadly, we argue that interdisciplinary approaches based on explicit causal frameworks are crucial for reliably estimating the effect of weather and accurately predicting the consequences of climate change.",Nature ecology & evolution,2025-Feb,"Barrero Guevara LA, Kramer SC, Kurth T, Domenech de Cellès M",4,1031,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36671132,Social structure description of epidemic propagation with a mean-field game paradigm.,"As emphasized by the recent pandemic crisis, the design of coherent policies against epidemic propagation is of major importance and required to model both epidemic quantities and individuals behavior because the latter has a strong influence on the former. To address this issue, we consider the spread of infectious diseases through a mean field game version of a SIR compartmental model with social structure, in which individuals are grouped by their age class and interact together in different settings. In our game theoretical approach, individuals can choose to limit their contacts if the epidemic is too virulent, but this effort comes with a social cost. We further compare the Nash equilibrium obtained in this way with the societal optimum that would be obtained if a benevolent central planner could decide on the strategy of each individual, as well as to the more realistic situation where an approximation of this optimum is reached through social policies such as lockdown.",Physical review.

Positron emission tomography/computed tomography with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (PET/CT) has been shown to have a high diagnostic accuracy in the detection of VGEI. In this single-center prospective cohort study, we assessed the rate and the impact on patient management of relevant unknown incidental findings in PET/CT of patients with proven or suspected VGEI, and clinical follow-up of all patients was performed. Our study results show a comparably high rate of relevant unknown incidental findings (181 in 502 examinations), with documented direct impact on patient management in 80 of 181 (44%) of all findings. PET/CT scan- and patient-based evaluation revealed impact on patient management in 76 of 502 (17%) of all PET/CT scans, and in 59 of 162 (36%) of all patients, respectively. Furthermore, PET/CT correctly identified the final diagnosis in 20 of 36 (56%) patients without VGEI.

34749309,Detection of Pathogens of Acute Febrile Illness Using Polymerase Chain Reaction from Dried Blood Spots.,"Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of dried blood spots (DBS) for pathogen detection is a potentially convenient method for infectious disease diagnosis. This study tested 115 DBS samples paired with whole blood specimens of children and adolescent from Burkina Faso, Sudan, and Madagascar by qPCR for a wide range of pathogens, including protozoans, helminths, fungi, bacteria, and viruses. Plasmodium spp. was consistently detected from DBS but yielded a mean cycle threshold (Ct) 5.7 ± 1.6 higher than that from whole blood samples. A DBS qPCR Ct cutoff of 27 yielded 94.1% sensitivity and 95.1% specificity against the whole blood qPCR cutoff of 21 that has been previously suggested for malaria diagnosis. For other pathogens investigated, DBS testing yielded a sensitivity of only 8.5% but a specificity of 98.6% compared with whole blood qPCR. In sum, direct PCR of DBS had reasonable performance for Plasmodium but requires further investigation for the other pathogens assessed in this study.",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,2021-Nov,"Grundy B, Panzner U, Liu J, Jeon HJ, Im J, von Kalckreuth V, Konings F, Pak GD, Cruz Espinoza LM, Bassiahi AS, Gasmelseed N, Rakotozandrindrainy R, Stroup S, Houpt ER, Marks F",15,1012,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33290524,Clinicopathologic Features of Tissue Granulomas in Transplant Recipients: A Single Center Study in a Nontuberculosis Endemic Region.,"There is a paucity of literature about tissue granulomas in transplant patients. To characterize the clinicopathologic features of granulomas in this population and develop a clinically judicious approach to their evaluation. We performed chart reviews of solid organ and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients at Yale New Haven Hospital to identify patients with granulomas on biopsy obtained pathologic specimens. Pretransplant and posttransplant specimens were included. Data points included demographics, clinical presentation, epidemiologic risk factors, biopsy indication, location and timing, immunosuppression, histopathology, microbiology, and associated clinical diagnosis. Granuloma-related readmissions and mortality were recorded at 1, 3, and 12 months. Biopsy proven granulomas were identified in 56 of 2139 (2.6%) patients. Of 56, 16 (29%) were infectious. Common infectious etiologies were bartonellosis (n = 3) and cytomegalovirus hepatitis (n = 3). Tuberculosis was not identified. Clinical symptoms prompted tissue biopsy in 27 of 56 (48.2%) cases while biopsies were obtained for evaluation of incidental findings or routine disease surveillance in 29 of 56 (51.8%). Presence of symptoms was significantly associated with infectious etiologies; 11 of 27 (40.7%) symptomatic patients compared with 5 of 29 (17.2%) asymptomatic patients had infectious causes. One death from granulomatous cryptogenic organizing pneumonia occurred. In pretransplant asymptomatic patients, no episodes of symptomatic disease occurred posttransplantation. Granulomas were uncommon in a large transplant population; most were noninfectious but presence of symptoms was associated with infectious etiologies. Granulomas discovered pretransplant without clear infectious etiology likely do not require prolonged surveillance after transplantation.

38777941,Metagenomic next-generation sequencing as a diagnostic tool in the clinical routine of an infectious diseases department: a retrospective cohort study.,"Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of circulating cell-free DNA from plasma is a hypothesis-independent broadband diagnostic method for identification of potential pathogens. So far, it has only been investigated in special risk populations (e.g. patients with neutropenic fever). To investigate the extent to which mNGS (DISQVER® platform) can be used in routine clinical practice. We collected whole blood specimens for mNGS testing, blood cultures (BC), and pathogen-specific PCR diagnostics. Clinical data and pathogen diagnostics were retrospectively reviewed by an infectious disease expert panel regarding the adjustment of anti-infective therapy. In 55 selected patients (median age 53 years, 67% male) with heterogeneous diagnoses, a total of 66 different microorganisms and viruses were detected using mNGS (51% viruses, 38% bacteria, 8% fungi, 3% parasites). The overall positivity rate of mNGS was 53% (29/55). Fifty-two out of 66 (79%) potential pathogens detected by mNGS were found in patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency. The concordance rates of BC and pathogen-specific PCR diagnostics with mNGS testing were 14% (4/28) and 36% (10/28), respectively (p < 0.001). An additional bacterial pathogen (Streptococcus agalactiae) could only be detected by BC. Therapeutic consequences regarding anti-infective therapy were drawn from 23 pathogens (35% of detections), with 18 of these detections occurring in patients with immunodeficiency. We conclude that mNGS is a useful diagnostic tool, but should only be performed selectively in addition to routine diagnostics of infectious diseases.

32060265,Systematic selection between age and household structure for models aimed at emerging epidemic predictions.,"Numerous epidemic models have been developed to capture aspects of human contact patterns, making model selection challenging when they fit (often-scarce) early epidemic data equally well but differ in predictions. Here we consider the invasion of a novel directly transmissible infection and perform an extensive, systematic and transparent comparison of models with explicit age and/or household structure, to determine the accuracy loss in predictions in the absence of interventions when ignoring either or both social components. We conclude that, with heterogeneous and assortative contact patterns relevant to respiratory infections, the model's age stratification is crucial for accurate predictions. Conversely, the household structure is only needed if transmission is highly concentrated in households, as suggested by an empirical but robust rule of thumb based on household secondary attack rate. This work serves as a template to guide the simplicity/accuracy trade-off in designing models aimed at initial, rapid assessment of potential epidemic severity.",Nature communications,2020-Feb,"Pellis L, Cauchemez S, Ferguson NM, Fraser C",4,1070,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32892785,Development of a systematic mapping review protocol for the most recent evidence on ruminant infectious disease frequency and disease-associated mortality: Ethiopia as a case study.,"Almost 19% of the GDP of Ethiopia results from livestock production. Ruminants, in particular, form the majority of the national herd and are a critical source of income for smallholder farmers. Infectious diseases have been identified as a major cause of reduced livestock productivity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); therefore, a sound and comprehensive understanding of the relevant evidence would be beneficial in order to enable decision making on disease control policies. However, livestock disease data from sub-Saharan Africa is variable and disparate, which poses a challenge for evidence synthesis. This paper describes a protocol for a systematic mapping review of the recent available evidence on ruminant disease prevalence and associated mortality in Ethiopia. Literature sources will be identified using database search strategies. The titles, abstracts and, subsequently, full texts will be screened for inclusion based on predefined eligibility criteria. Specific data will be extracted and a preliminary qualitative assessment of the evidence will be performed using predefined indicators. The planned systematic map will be the first to provide a large-scale overview of the available ruminant disease evidence in Ethiopia; the final output will be an interactive dashboard tool to inform critical stakeholders in policy and research.",Animal health research reviews,2020-Jun,"Tsouloufi TK, Donnison LM, Smyth KL, Peters AR",4,1367,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32777587,"Blood culture reports by infectious disease physicians can improve prognosis of bacteremia, including weekend-onset cases.","Cases of positive blood cultures were previously reported by a microbiological technologist (MT) to an attending physician (AP), and the Antimicrobial Stewardship team provided medical assistance by grasping the situation at the morning meeting the next day. Since April 2018, MTs have reported positive blood cultures to an infectious disease physician (IDP), who proposes the management approach to the AP and provides weekend support. This study assessed the effectiveness of blood culture reports provided by IDPs to APs on outcomes of bacteremia, including weekend-onset cases. Patient characteristics and prognoses before (October 2017 to March 2018) and after intervention (April to September 2018) were compared. The pre-intervention and post-intervention groups comprised 134 and 161 patients, respectively. Patients were more likely to be older (>65 years) in the post-intervention group (p < 0.05). There were no significant between-group differences in infection severity. The rate of de-escalation significantly increased from 38.1%-57.8% (p = 0.001). The rates of 28-day and in-hospital mortality reduced following the intervention (21.3% vs. 8.2% and 32.8% vs. 10.6%; p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively). In-hospital mortality for weekend-onset cases also reduced following the intervention (33.3% vs. 12.9%, p = 0.01). Sepsis was a poor prognostic factor (OR 8.070, 95% CI 3.320-19.600, p < 0.001) and intervention was a good prognostic factor (OR 0.311, 95% CI 0.142-0.680, p = 0.003) affecting 28-day mortality in multivariate analysis.

We assessed their influence on improving the diagnostic accuracy of blood culture-positive inpatients at a Japanese cancer center. Our single-center, retrospective observational study was conducted from April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2022 to evaluate two phases: pre-intervention (notification of antimicrobials by the infection control team) and post-intervention (ASP implementation and ID consultation service establishment). There were 42,514 inpatients: 22,096 during the pre-intervention and 20,418 during the intervention periods. A total of 939 blood culture-positive episodes (pre-intervention, n = 434; post-intervention, n = 505) were analyzed. During the pre-intervention period, 28.1% of the patients had an unknown diagnosis, which decreased significantly to 1.2% post-intervention. Furthermore, hepatobiliary tract and other infections increased significantly post-intervention, and the mortality rate due to Staphylococcus aureus infection decreased from 28.6% pre-intervention to 10.4% post-intervention. The trend and level of the total number of culture specimens submitted per 1000 patient days for all culture specimens increased significantly post-intervention. Notably, the two-set rate of monthly blood cultures increased significantly.

The SEIR model curves have nearly the same shapes as the SIR ones, but with a stretch factor applied to them across time that is related to the ratio of the incubation to infectious periods. This finding implies an approximate characteristic timescale, scaled by this stretch factor, that is universal to all SEIR models, which only depends on the basic reproduction number and initial fraction of the population that is infectious.",Scientific reports,2020-Nov,"Heng K, Althaus CL",2,862,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

All positive blood cultures suitable for RAST from January to December 2019 were included and RAST results at 4 and 6 h compared with standard disc diffusion. The real-life impact of RAST on clinical decisions was assessed during same-day ID bedside consultation. The proportion of readable RAST results was significantly higher after 6 h of incubation compared with after 4 h (881/930 versus 642/847; P < 0.0001). Major and very major errors were rare (17/642 after 4 h and 12/881 after 6 h; P = 0.087). ID consultation was performed in 134 patients after the RAST result. Antimicrobial treatment was changed in 73 patients and 84 additional measures (i.e. imaging studies, surgery, additional resistance testing) were ordered in 62 patients. RAST according to EUCAST methods was easy to implement with a low number of major and very major errors after 6 h of incubation.

In this paper, a novel multi-group SEIR epidemic model with both age structure and spatial diffusion is constructed for the first time ever to study the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. We first analytically study the positivity, boundedness, existence and uniqueness of solution and the existence of compact global attractor of the associated solution semiflow. Based on some assumptions for parameters, we then show that the disease-free steady state is globally asymptotically stable by utilizing appropriate Lyapunov functionals and the LaSalle's invariance principle. By means of Perron-Frobenius theorem and graph-theoretical results, the existence and global stability of endemic steady state are ensured under appropriate conditions. Finally, feasibility of main theoretical results is showed with the aid of numerical examples for model with two groups which is important from the viewpoint of applications.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2020-Oct,"Liu P, Li HX",2,1109,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This is generally attributed to both a failure of the immune system and the lack of an effective anti-microbial pharmaceutical. Infections can be regarded as a competitive process between the microbe and the host for cellular energy-generated resources. Cells obtain energy not only from the metabolism of food but also from the alternative cellular energy (ACE) pathway. This pathway utilizes an environmental force termed as KELEA (kinetic energy limiting electrostatic attraction), which provides an added kinetic/chemical energy to the body's fluids. The ACE pathway can be enhanced through the use of KELEA activated water, which is currently available under different names from several sources. Enhancing the body's ACE pathway, including the use of a wearable waterceutical ™, provides a novel means of potentially increasing the body's resistance against all infectious diseases.",Infectious disorders drug targets,2021-,Martin WJ,1,958,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Migrants' unmet health needs represent a barrier to integration and should be promptly addressed, without stigma, in order to favour resettlement. All-cause of admissions in the migrant population at the Infectious Disease Clinic of Policlinico San Martino Hospital in Genoa between 2015 and 2017 were analysed. Patients were classified by duration of residence in Italy according to the Recommendation on Statistics of International Migration, cause of hospitalization, and region of origin. All data were evaluated with SPSS Statistics. Two hundred thirty-five people were admitted, 86 (36.5%) of them residing in Italy for less than 1 year. Except for a significant increase in migrants from Africa, there was no change considering the area of origin, hospitalization reason or by comparing residency in Italy for more or less than 1 year. A considerable number of hospitalizations were related to non-communicable pathologies and latent tuberculosis infection. Residents in Italy for less than 1 year or with active tuberculosis had prolonged hospitalizations, while HIV-infected had shorter hospital stays. No difference in terms of diagnosis were found between migrants with longer or shorter period of residence in Italy.

32962383,Mathematical modeling and cellular automata simulation of infectious disease dynamics: Applications to the understanding of herd immunity.,"The complexity associated with an epidemic defies any quantitatively reliable predictive theoretical scheme. Here, we pursue a generalized mathematical model and cellular automata simulations to study the dynamics of infectious diseases and apply it in the context of the COVID-19 spread. Our model is inspired by the theory of coupled chemical reactions to treat multiple parallel reaction pathways. We essentially ask the question: how hard could the time evolution toward the desired herd immunity (HI) be on the lives of people? We demonstrate that the answer to this question requires the study of two implicit functions, which are determined by several rate constants, which are time-dependent themselves. Implementation of different strategies to counter the spread of the disease requires a certain degree of a quantitative understanding of the time-dependence of the outcome. Here, we compartmentalize the susceptible population into two categories, (i) vulnerables and (ii) resilients (including asymptomatic carriers), and study the dynamical evolution of the disease progression. We obtain the relative fatality of these two sub-categories as a function of the percentages of the vulnerable and resilient population and the complex dependence on the rate of attainment of herd immunity. We attempt to study and quantify possible adverse effects of the progression rate of the epidemic on the recovery rates of vulnerables, in the course of attaining HI. We find the important result that slower attainment of the HI is relatively less fatal. However, slower progress toward HI could be complicated by many intervening factors.",The Journal of chemical physics,2020-Sep,"Mondal S, Mukherjee S, Bagchi B",3,1638,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We demonstrate that even for simple compartmental network processes, our approach leads to complex spatial patterns of infection in the endemic state dependent on individual behavior. Specifically, we characterize the resulting phenomena in terms of phase separation, highlighting phase transitions between distinct spatial states and determining the systems' phase diagram.

However, any errors contained within Knowledge Panels could result in the widespread distribution of inaccurate health information. We explored the potential for inaccuracies to exist within Google's health-based Knowledge Panels by focusing on a single well-studied pathogen, Ebola virus (EBOV). We then evaluated the accuracy of those transmission modes listed within the Google Ebola Knowledge Panel and investigated the pervasiveness of any misconceptions associated with inaccurate transmission modes among persons living in Africa. We found that the Google Ebola Knowledge Panel inaccurately listed insect bites or stings as modes of EBOV transmission. Our scoping review found 27 articles and reports that revealed that 9 of 11 countries where misconceptions regarding insect transmission of EBOV have been reported are locations of current (i.e., Democratic Republic of Congo and Guinea) or previous EBOV outbreaks. We found reports that up to 26.6% (155/582) of study respondents in Democratic Republic of Congo believed mosquito bite avoidance would prevent EBOV; in other locations of previous large-scale EBOV outbreaks (e.g., Guinea), up to 61.0% (304/498) of respondents believed insects were involved in EBOV transmission. Our findings highlight the potential for errors to exist within the health information contained in Google's health-based Knowledge Panels.

Infection-related neonatal mortality rate in 2013-2015 (0.32/1000; n=669) was 20% lower compared with 2003-2015 (0.40/1000; n=768), respectively. Infections were responsible for 13.1% (669/5095) of neonatal deaths during 2013-2015 and 11.5% (768/6700) during 2003-2005. Of the infection-related deaths, 44.2% (296/669) were in term, 19.9% (133/669) preterm and 35.9% (240/669) extremely preterm neonates. Compared with term infants (0.15/1000 live births), infection-related mortality rate was 5.9-fold (95% CI 4.7 to 7.2) higher in preterm (0.90/1000) and 188-fold (95% CI 157 to 223) higher in extremely preterm infants (28.7/1000) during 2013-2015. A pathogen was recorded in 448 (67%) registrations: 400 (89.3%) were bacterial, 37 (8.3%) viral and 11 (2.4%) fungal.

There have been several important advances in understanding the role of climate and climate change on wildlife and human infectious disease dynamics over the past several years. This essay examines 3 major areas of advancement, which include improvements to mechanistic disease models, investigations into the importance of climate variability to disease dynamics, and understanding the consequences of thermal mismatches between host and parasites. Applying the new information derived from these advances to climate-disease models and addressing the pressing knowledge gaps that we identify should improve the capacity to predict how climate change will affect disease risk for both wildlife and humans.",PLoS biology,2020-Nov,"Rohr JR, Cohen JM",2,865,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

38357446,Beyond the acute phase: a comprehensive literature review of long-term sequelae resulting from infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases have consistently served as pivotal influences on numerous civilizations, inducing morbidity, mortality, and consequently redirecting the course of history. Their impact extends far beyond the acute phase, characterized by the majority of symptom presentations, to a multitude of adverse events and sequelae that follow viral, parasitic, fungal, or bacterial infections. In this context, myriad sequelae related to various infectious diseases have been identified, spanning short to long-term durations. Although these sequelae are known to affect thousands of individuals individually, a comprehensive evaluation of all potential long-term effects of infectious diseases has yet to be undertaken. We present a comprehensive literature review delineating the primary sequelae attributable to major infectious diseases, categorized by systems, symptoms, and duration. This compilation serves as a crucial resource, illuminating the long-term ramifications of infectious diseases for healthcare professionals worldwide. Moreover, this review highlights the substantial burden that these sequelae impose on global health and economies, a facet often overshadowed by the predominant focus on the acute phase. Patients are frequently discharged following the resolution of the acute phase, with minimal long-term follow-up to comprehend and address potential sequelae.

Our aim was to assess the role of parental socioeconomic position for diagnoses of infectious disease among children of immigrants. Data from the Norwegian Patient Registry (on diagnoses from secondary/tertiary care), Medical Birth Registry of Norway, and Statistics Norway were linked by the national personal identification number. Seven diagnostic infection categories were included from 2008 onwards. The study population included children born in Norway aged 0-10 years between 2008 and 2018 (<i>N</i> = 988,647). Hazards of infection diagnoses by parental region of origin (adjusted for sex, birth year, parental education, household income and mother's parity) and by parental education and household income were assessed by Cox regression. High parental education was associated with lower hazard of infection diagnoses among children of Norwegian-born parents, but associations were less consistent among children with immigrant parents. Lower household income was related to hazard of most infectious diagnoses among children with both Norwegian-born and immigrant parents. Assessed by region diagnoses of viral and bacterial infections and infections of the musculoskeletal system and soft tissue were not associated with household income. Parental education and household income did not explain differences in hazard of infection diagnoses between children born to immigrant versus Norwegian-born parents. <b>Socioeconomic disadvantage did not explain differences in hazard of being diagnosed with infectious disease in secondary/tertiary care between children with immigrant versus Norwegian-born parents.</b>",Scandinavian journal of public health,2023-May,"M K R K, A S L, A R, S Q, P S",5,1713,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We demonstrate clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, kidney pathology, and laboratory diagnostic methods for (1) renal cryptococcosis, which represents involvement of a pure direct pathway; (2) schistosomiasis and dengue fever as examples of dual direct and indirect pathways; and (3) congenital syphilis, visceral leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease, which represent indirect pathways. Infective agents affect the kidneys of children mainly through indirect mechanisms, such as through immunological mechanisms as part of an antigenic response. A direct mechanism of kidney injury, however, is less known within the medical community simply because the direct mechanism is rarely encountered in nontropical countries.

38052576,Can infectious diseases eradicate host species? The effect of infection-age structure.,"It is a fundamental question in mathematical epidemiology whether deadly infectious diseases only lead to a mere decline of their host populations or whether they can cause their complete disappearance. Upper density-dependent incidences do not lead to host extinction in simple, deterministic SI or SIS (susceptible-infectious) epidemic models. Infection-age structure is introduced into SIS models because of the biological accuracy offered by considering arbitrarily distributed infectious periods. In an SIS model with infection-age structure, survival of the susceptible host population is established for incidences that depend on the infection-age density in a general way. This confirms previous host persistence results without infection-age for incidence functions that are not generalizations of frequency-dependent transmission. For certain power incidences, hosts persist if some infected individuals leave the infected class and become susceptible again and the return rate dominates the infection-age dependent infectivity in a sufficient way. The hosts may be driven into extinction by the infectious disease if there is no return into the susceptible class at all.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2023-Oct,"Ponce J, Thieme HR",2,1181,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

37419128,The challenges in the monitoring of infectious diseases after the earthquake in Türkiye in 2023.,"After the devastating earthquake in Türkiye and Syria in February, 2023, the long-term failure to meet the need for shelter, unfavourable living conditions in tent settlements, poor access to clean drinking water, water suitable for personal hygiene, and sanitary facilities, as well as interruptions in provision of primary health-care services, have emerged as the most important risk factors contributing to the spread of infectious diseases. 3 months after the earthquake, most of these problems persist in Türkiye. Data on the control of infectious diseases are scarce according to the reports prepared by medical specialist associations based on observations of health-care providers working in the region and statements made by the local health authorities. According to these unsystematised data, and considering the conditions in the region, faecal-oral transmissible gastrointestinal infections, as well as respiratory and vector-borne infections, are the main challenges. Vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, varicella, meningitis, and polio can be spread in temporary shelters due to interrupted vaccine services and crowded living conditions.

38767202,"Climate change, its impact on emerging infectious diseases and new technologies to combat the challenge.","<b>ABSTRACT</b>Improved sanitation, increased access to health care, and advances in preventive and clinical medicine have reduced the mortality and morbidity rates of several infectious diseases. However, recent outbreaks of several emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have caused substantial mortality and morbidity, and the frequency of these outbreaks is likely to increase due to pathogen, environmental, and population effects driven by climate change. Extreme or persistent changes in temperature, precipitation, humidity, and air pollution associated with climate change can, for example, expand the size of EID reservoirs, increase host-pathogen and cross-species host contacts to promote transmission or spillover events, and degrade the overall health of susceptible host populations leading to new EID outbreaks. It is therefore vital to establish global strategies to track and model potential responses of candidate EIDs to project their future behaviour and guide research efforts on early detection and diagnosis technologies and vaccine development efforts for these targets. Multi-disciplinary collaborations are demanding to develop effective inter-continental surveillance and modelling platforms that employ artificial intelligence to mitigate climate change effects on EID outbreaks. In this review, we discuss how climate change has increased the risk of EIDs and describe novel approaches to improve surveillance of emerging pathogens that pose the risk for EID outbreaks, new and existing measures that could be used to contain or reduce the risk of future EID outbreaks, and new methods to improve EID tracking during further outbreaks to limit disease transmission.",Emerging microbes & infections,2024-Dec,"Liao H, Lyon CJ, Ying B, Hu T",4,1692,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
31002338,A Retrospective Cohort Study to Assess the Impact of an Inpatient Infectious Disease Telemedicine Consultation Service on Hospital and Patient Outcomes.,"Here, we review our experience of providing inpatient infectious disease (ID) consultations using real-time interactive telemedicine assessments. We sought to obtain a baseline and document trends regarding the use of telemedicine ID (teleID) consults as an adjunct to the standard of care through the time period in which teleID consultations were introduced. Data were pulled via manual, retrospective chart reviews of the electronic medical record. Primary outcomes included lengths of stay (LOS), antibiotic usage, and relapse incidences. There were a total of 244 patients at 1 remote hospital site who were provided with ID consultations, either in person, via teleID, or both. Before the availability of teleID (pre-teleID), there were 73 patients transferred for ID consults, while 171 patients were seen via teleID once available. While all 73 patients in the pre-teleID group were transferred from the remote hospital to the hub hospital, only 14 (8.2%) of all remote hospital patients assessed by teleID were transferred. Patient LOS across both facilities decreased when patients were seen via teleID, compared to pre-teleID (P = .0001). The median number of days that patients received antibiotics decreased in the teleID group (median 15, interquartile range [IQR] 9-25), compared to the pre-teleID group (median 19, IQR 11-28), but this decrease was not statistically significant (P = .0770). There was no statistically significant difference in relapse rates, although data were lacking because of patients being lost to follow-up.

The Stockholm Paradigm suggests that their toll will grow tragically in the face of climate change, in particular. The best research protocol for predicting and preventing infectious disease emergence states that an urgent search must commence to identify unknown human and animal pathogens. This short communication proposes that the ethnobiological knowledge of indigenous and impoverished communities can be a source of information about some of those unknown pathogens. I present the ecological and anthropological theory behind this proposal, followed by a few case studies that serve as a limited proof of concept. This paper also serves as a call to action for the medical anthropology community. It gives a brief primer on the EID crisis and how anthropology research may be vital to limiting its havoc on global health.

33357052,The use of molecular xenomonitoring for surveillance of mosquito-borne diseases.,"The scientific community recognizes that molecular xenomonitoring (MX) can allow infected mosquitoes to serve as a proxy for human infection in vector-borne disease surveillance, but developing reliable MX systems for programmatic use has been challenging. The primary aim of this article is to examine the available evidence to recommend how MX can best be used for various purposes. Although much of the literature published within the last 20 years focuses on using MX for lymphatic filariasis elimination, a growing body of evidence supports its use in early warning systems for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). An MX system design must consider the goal and target (e.g. diseases targeted for elimination versus EIDs), mosquito and pathogen characteristics, and context (e.g. setting and health system). MX is currently used as a 'supplement' to human surveillance and will not be considered as a 'replacement' until the correlation between pathogen-infection rates in human and mosquito populations is better understood. Establishing such relationships may not be feasible in elimination scenarios, due to increasingly dwindling human infection prevalence after successful control, but may still be possible for EIDs and in integrated disease surveillance systems.

39619659,Application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of infectious diseases.,"Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a transformative approach in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, utilizing unbiased high-throughput sequencing to directly detect and characterize microbial genomes from clinical samples. This review comprehensively outlines the fundamental principles, sequencing workflow, and platforms utilized in mNGS technology. The methodological backbone involves shotgun sequencing of total nucleic acids extracted from diverse sample types, enabling simultaneous detection of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites without prior knowledge of the infectious agent. Key advantages of mNGS include its capability to identify rare, novel, or unculturable pathogens, providing a more comprehensive view of microbial communities compared to traditional culture-based methods. Despite these strengths, challenges such as data analysis complexity, high cost, and the need for optimized sample preparation protocols remain significant hurdles. The application of mNGS across various systemic infections highlights its clinical utility. Case studies discussed in this review illustrate its efficacy in diagnosing respiratory tract infections, bloodstream infections, central nervous system infections, gastrointestinal infections, and others. By rapidly identifying pathogens and their genomic characteristics, mNGS facilitates timely and targeted therapeutic interventions, thereby improving patient outcomes and infection control measures. Looking ahead, the future of mNGS in infectious disease diagnostics appears promising. Advances in bioinformatics tools and sequencing technologies are anticipated to streamline data analysis, enhance sensitivity and specificity, and reduce turnaround times. Integration with clinical decision support systems promises to further optimize mNGS utilization in routine clinical practice. In conclusion, mNGS represents a paradigm shift in the field of infectious disease diagnostics, offering unparalleled insights into microbial diversity and pathogenesis. While challenges persist, ongoing technological advancements hold immense potential to consolidate mNGS as a pivotal tool in the armamentarium of modern medicine, empowering clinicians with precise, rapid, and comprehensive pathogen detection capabilities.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2024-,"Zhao Y, Zhang W, Zhang X",3,2288,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

39407144,Association of modifiable risk factors and infectious diseases among individuals with hypertension: a prospective cohort study.,"A comprehensive assessment of combined modifiable risk factors in relation to infectious diseases among individuals with hypertension is lacking, and the potential mechanisms of these associations remain unclear. To investigate the prospective associations of a combination of lifestyle behaviors and cardiometabolic factors with the risk of infectious diseases among individuals with hypertension and to estimate whether and to what extent blood biomarkers mediate these associations. This cohort study included 147,188 participants with hypertension and complete data on modifiable risk factors from the UK Biobank. Health score was constructed from eight modifiable risk factors, including four lifestyle behaviors (diet, physical activity, smoking, and sleep duration) and four cardiometabolic factors (body mass index, blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the health score and infectious diseases. The mediation analysis was performed to assess the potential intermediation effects of blood biomarkers. Over a median follow-up of 12.5 years, 27,398 participants with infectious diseases were documented, with 960 respiratory infectious diseases and 7940 digestive infectious diseases. After adjusting for potential confounders, the HR (95% CI) for the highest versus the lowest quartile of health score was 0.64 (0.62, 0.66) for infectious diseases, 0.72 (0.60, 0.86) for respiratory infectious diseases, and 0.66 (0.62, 0.71) for digestive infectious diseases. Stratified factors including duration of hypertension did not modify the associations between the health score and infectious diseases. In addition, biomarkers including inflammation and renal function collectively explained 46.60% of the associations between the combined lifestyle factors and infectious disease risk among individuals with hypertension. Ideal management of combined modifiable risk factors was associated with lower risks of infectious diseases and might produce profound changes in blood biomarkers among individuals with hypertension. Additionally, specific biomarkers appeared to serve as an intermediate between combined lifestyle factors and infectious diseases. These insights highlighted the important role of a combination of healthy lifestyle and favorable cardiometabolic status in reducing disease burden and facilitated the understanding of biological mechanisms underlying modifiable risk factors with infectious diseases.",BMC infectious diseases,2024-Oct,"Hu N, Ai B, Wang Y, Ren Y, Chen H, Chen Z, Li W",7,2559,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Recently, the role of natural ecosystems in reducing disease emergence risk has gained prominence in decision-making processes, as scientific evidence indicates that human-driven pressure, such as habitat destruction and deforestation, can trigger the emergence of zoonotic infectious diseases. However, the intricate relationship between biodiversity and emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) remains only partially understood. Here, we updated the most comprehensive zoonotic EID event database with the latest reported events to analyse the relationship between EIDs of wildlife origin (zoonoses) and various facets of ecological integrity. We found EID risk was strongly predicted by structural integrity metrics such as human footprint and ecoregion intactness, in addition to environmental variables such as tropical rainforest density and mammal species richness. EID events were more likely to occur in areas with intermediate levels of compositional and structural integrity, underscoring the risk posed by human encroachment into pristine, undisturbed lands. Our study highlights the need to identify novel indicators and targets that can effectively address EID risk alongside other pressing global challenges in sustainable development, ultimately informing strategies for preserving both human and environmental health.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2024-Jun,"Marcolin L, Tonelli A, Di Marco M",3,1505,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33839288,CRISPR-Cas systems for diagnosing infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases are a global health problem affecting billions of people. Developing rapid and sensitive diagnostic tools is key for successful patient management and curbing disease spread. Currently available diagnostics are very specific and sensitive but time-consuming and require expensive laboratory settings and well-trained personnel; thus, they are not available in resource-limited areas, for the purposes of large-scale screenings and in case of outbreaks and epidemics. Developing new, rapid, and affordable point-of-care diagnostic assays is urgently needed. This review focuses on CRISPR-based technologies and their perspectives to become platforms for point-of-care nucleic acid detection methods and as deployable diagnostic platforms that could help to identify and curb outbreaks and emerging epidemics. We describe the mechanisms and function of different classes and types of CRISPR-Cas systems, including pros and cons for developing molecular diagnostic tests and applications of each type to detect a wide range of infectious agents. Many Cas proteins (Cas3, Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, Cas14 etc.) have been leveraged to create highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic tools combined with technologies of signal amplification and fluorescent, potentiometric, colorimetric, lateral flow assay detection and other. In particular, the most advanced platforms -- SHERLOCK/v2, DETECTR, CARMEN or CRISPR-Chip -- enable detection of attomolar amounts of pathogenic nucleic acids with specificity comparable to that of PCR but with minimal technical settings. Further developing CRISPR-based diagnostic tools promises to dramatically transform molecular diagnostics, making them easily affordable and accessible virtually anywhere in the world. The burden of socially significant diseases, frequent outbreaks, recent epidemics (MERS, SARS and the ongoing COVID-19) and outbreaks of zoonotic viruses (African Swine Fever Virus etc.) urgently need the developing and distribution of express-diagnostic tools.

The aim of the study is to describe the epidemiological, clinical and parasitological characteristics of patients with schistosomiasis acquired during an international travel. Observational retrospective study including all travel-related schistosomiasis cases seen at the International Health Unit Vall d'Hebron-Drassanes (Barcelona, Spain) from 2009 to 2022. Diagnosis of schistosomiasis was defined by the presence of Schistosoma eggs in stools or urine or the positivity of a serological test. We collected demographic, epidemiological, clinical, parasitological, and therapeutic information. 917 cases of schistosomiasis were diagnosed, from whom 96 (10.5 %) were travel-related. Mean age of the patients was 34.9 years, and 53.1 % were women. Median duration of the travel was 72 days, and geographical areas where travelers had contact with fresh water were Africa (82.3 %), Asia (12.5 %), and South America (5.2 %). Twenty (20.8 %) patients reported having had some clinical symptom, being gastrointestinal symptoms the most frequent. Two patients developed the classical Katayama syndrome. In eleven (11.5 %) cases eggs were observed in urine or feces samples, and 85 (88.5 %) cases were diagnosed by a positive serology. Ninety-one (94.8 %) patients received treatment with praziquantel with different therapeutic schemes. The two patients with Katayama syndrome received concomitant treatment with corticosteroids. Schistosomiasis in travelers represented 10 % of the overall schistosomiasis cases in our center.

33330127,Mini Review: Clinical Routine Microbiology in the Era of Automation and Digital Health.,"Clinical microbiology laboratories are the first line to combat and handle infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance, including newly emerging ones. Although most clinical laboratories still rely on conventional methods, a cascade of technological changes, driven by digital imaging and high-throughput sequencing, will revolutionize the management of clinical diagnostics for direct detection of bacteria and swift antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Importantly, such technological advancements occur in the golden age of machine learning where computers are no longer acting passively in data mining, but once trained, can also help physicians in making decisions for diagnostics and optimal treatment administration. The further potential of physically integrating new technologies in an automation chain, combined to machine-learning-based software for data analyses, is seducing and would indeed lead to a faster management in infectious diseases. However, if, from one side, technological advancement would achieve a better performance than conventional methods, on the other side, this evolution challenges clinicians in terms of data interpretation and impacts the entire hospital personnel organization and management. In this mini review, we discuss such technological achievements offering practical examples of their operability but also their limitations and potential issues that their implementation could rise in clinical microbiology laboratories.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2020-,"Leo S, Cherkaoui A, Renzi G, Schrenzel J",4,1471,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

In this work, we evaluate the time shift produced in the number of people infected from one disease when interacting with another disease. Using a compartmental model, we produce different forms of relationship as competition, cooperation, and independence, assessing the effect of each one in the final result. We focus on the case of the unidirectional coupling between diseases, which enables us to study the impact of a perturbation to a driving disease on the driven one. We found that the prevalence of the driven disease is strongly affected if its time scale, defined by the time where the infection reaches the peak, is comparable to that of the driving disease. The secondary peak of the infection was observed under cooperative coupling if the time scale of the driving disease is much longer than that of the driven one.","Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2020-Sep,"Olivares P, Creixell W, Fujiwara N",3,1086,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The conventional pathogen detection approach based on culture is considered the gold standard method, but needs several days to corroborate its results. Using nucleic acids from pathogens as detection targets has a considerable advantage in overcoming these time-consuming issues. The development of several molecular techniques has started to change the landscape of infectious disease diagnosis. However, these require expensive reagents, equipment, and sophisticated infrastructure, as well as highly trained workers. In this context, it is necessary to identify new diagnostic strategies to overcome these issues. Recently, CRISPR/Cas based diagnosis has revolutionized the area of molecular diagnostics of pathogenic diseases. In this review, we have discussed the different classes of CRISPR-Cas systems and their functions, and then focused on recent advances in CRISPR-based diagnosis technologies and the perspective of using this as a potential biosensing platform to detect infectious disease.",Microbiological research,2022-Oct,"Padmanaban V, Ranganathan UDK",2,1140,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34815507,Socioeconomic variation of multimorbidity in Colombian older adults.,"Multimorbidity (MM) prevalence among older adults is increasing worldwide. Variations regarding the socioeconomic characteristics of the individuals and their context have been described, mostly in high-income settings. However, further research is needed to understand the effect of the coexistence of infectious diseases along with socioeconomic factors regarding MM. This study aims to examine the variation of MM regarding infectious diseases mortality after adjusting for socioeconomic factors. A cross-sectional multilevel study with a nationally representative sample of 17,571 Colombian adults of 60 years of age or older was conducted. Individual socioeconomic, demographic, childhood and health related characteristics, as well as group level variables (multidimensional poverty index and infectious diseases mortality rate) were analyzed. A two-level stepwise structural equation model was used to simultaneously adjust for the individual and contextual effects. Multimorbidity prevalence was 62.3% (95% CI 61.7-62.9). In the multilevel adjusted models, age, female sex, having functional limitations, non-white ethnicity, high body mass index, higher income, physical inactivity and living in urban areas were associated with multimorbidity among the sample for this study. The median odds ratio for multidimensional poverty was 1.18 (1.16-1.19; p = 0.008) and for infectious diseases was 1.25 (1.22-1.28; p = 0.014). This paper demonstrates that MM varies regarding the mortality of infectious diseases and shows a strong association between MM and poverty in a low-middle income country. Differences in the factors involved in the etiology of multimorbidity are expected among wealthy and poor countries regarding availability and prioritization of health services.",Scientific reports,2021-Nov,"Ballesteros SM, Moreno-Montoya J, Grooten WJA, Barrera-López P, De la Hoz-Valle JA",5,1779,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33262758,Inflammaging in Endemic Areas for Infectious Diseases.,"Immunosenescence is marked by a systemic process named inflammaging along with a series of defects in the immunological activity that results in poor responses to infectious agents and to vaccination. Inflammaging, a state of low-grade chronic inflammation, usually leads to chronic inflammatory diseases and frailty in the elderly. However, some elderly escape from frailty and reach advanced age free of the consequences of inflammaging. This process has been called immunological remodeling, and it is the hallmark of healthy aging as described in the studies of centenarians in Italy. The biological markers of healthy aging are still a matter of debate, and the studies on the topic have focused on inflammatory <i>versus</i> remodeling processes and molecules. The sub-clinical inflammatory status associated with aging might be a deleterious event for populations living in countries where chronic infectious diseases are not prevalent. Nevertheless, in other parts of the world where they are, two possibilities may occur. Inflammatory responses may have a protective effect against these infectious agents. At the same time, the long-term consequences of protective immune responses during chronic infections may result in accelerated immunosenescence in these individuals. Therefore, the biological markers of healthy aging can vary according to environmental, cultural, and geographical settings that reflect worldwide, and in a non-biased, non-westernized perspective, the changes that we experience regarding our contacts with microorganisms and the outcomes of such contacts.",Frontiers in immunology,2020-,"Batista MA, Calvo-Fortes F, Silveira-Nunes G, Camatta GC, Speziali E, Turroni S, Teixeira-Carvalho A, Martins-Filho OA, Neretti N, Maioli TU, Santos RR, Brigidi P, Franceschi C, Faria AMC",14,1589,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

37218364,Causes of thrombocytopenia in dogs in the United Kingdom: A retrospective study of 762 cases.,"Thrombocytopenia is a common laboratory abnormality in dogs, and numerous diseases have been associated with its development. Estimates for the sensitivity and specificity of the degree of reduction of platelet concentration for the diagnosis of primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (pITP) have not been reported. To report the prevalence of different causes of thrombocytopenia in dogs in the United Kingdom and to investigate the utility of platelet concentration to differentiate causes of thrombocytopenia. Medical records of 762 dogs with thrombocytopenia presented to seven referral hospitals from January 2017 to December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Cases were assigned into the following categories: pITP, infectious diseases, neoplasia, inflammatory/other immune-mediated disorders and miscellaneous causes. The prevalence of the different categories was estimated, and platelet concentrations were compared. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to investigate the utility of platelet concentration to differentiate between causes of thrombocytopenia. The most common disease category associated with thrombocytopenia was neoplasia (27.3%), followed by miscellaneous causes (26.9%), pITP (18.8%), inflammatory/immune-mediated disorders (14.4%) and infectious diseases (12.6%). Dogs with pITP had significantly lower platelet concentrations (median 8 × 10<sup>9</sup> /L, range: 0-70 × 10<sup>9</sup> /L) than dogs in the other four categories. Platelet concentration was useful for distinguishing pITP from other causes of thrombocytopenia (area under ROC curve = 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.87, 0.92), with a platelet concentration ≤12 × 10<sup>9</sup> /L being 60% sensitive and 90% specific. Severe thrombocytopenia was highly specific for a diagnosis of pITP, which was more prevalent in this UK population of thrombocytopenic dogs compared with previous epidemiological studies.

Studies of mNGSpi in immunocompromised hosts have demonstrated that these diagnostics are capable of identifying causative organisms in a subset of patients for whom conventional testing has been negative. While these studies provide proof of concept for mNGSpi utility, they have a number of limitations, which make it difficult to confidently assess test performance and clinical impact based on current data. Future studies will likely feature larger cohort sizes and controlled interventional study designs that assess the impact of mNGSpi on clinical endpoints.

The generalized cure rate model is based on bounded cumulative hazard function, which is a non-mixture model, and is developed using a two-parameter Weibull distribution as the baseline distribution, to estimate the cure rate using maximum likelihood method and real data with R and STATA software. The results showed that the cure rate of tuberculosis (TB) patients was 26.3%, which was higher than that of TB patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; 23.1%). The non-parametric median survival time of TB patients was 51 months, while that of TB patients co-infected with HIV was 33 months. Moreover, no risk factors were associated with TB patients co-infected with HIV, while age was a significant risk factor for TB patients among the suspected risk factors considered. Furthermore, the bounded cumulative hazard function was extended to accommodate infectious diseases with co-infections by deriving an appropriate probability density function, determining the distribution, and using real data.

34018336,Spillover of zoonotic pathogens: A review of reviews.,"Zoonotic spillover and subsequent disease emergence cause significant, long-lasting impacts on our social, economic, environmental and political systems. Identifying and averting spillover transmission is crucial for preventing outbreaks and mitigating infectious disease burdens. Investigating the processes that lead to spillover fundamentally involves interactions between animals, humans, pathogens and the environments they inhabit. Accordingly, it is recognized that transdisciplinary approaches provide a more holistic understanding of spillover phenomena. To characterize the discourse about spillover within and between disciplines, we conducted a review of review papers about spillover from multiple disciplines. We systematically searched and screened literature from several databases to identify a corpus of review papers from ten academic disciplines. We performed qualitative content analysis on text where authors described either a spillover pathway, or a conceptual gap in spillover theory. Cluster analysis of pathway data identified nine major spillover processes discussed in the review literature. We summarized the main features of each process, how different disciplines contributed to them, and identified specialist and generalist disciplines based on the breadth of processes they studied. Network analyses showed strong similarities between concepts reviewed by 'One Health' disciplines (e.g. Veterinary Science & Animal Health, Public Health & Medicine, Ecology & Evolution, Environmental Science), which had broad conceptual scope and were well-connected to other disciplines. By contrast, awas focused on processes that are relatively overlooked by other disciplines, especially those involving food behaviour and livestock husbandry practices. Virology and Cellular & Molecular Biology were narrower in scope, primarily focusing on concepts related to adaption and evolution of zoonotic viruses. Finally, we identified priority areas for future research into zoonotic spillover by studying the gap data.",Zoonoses and public health,2021-Sep,"Sánchez CA, Venkatachalam-Vaz J, Drake JM",3,2036,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

For this reason, apprehending which disease will newly emerge, and preparing countermeasures for that disease, are required. Many different types of infectious diseases are emerging and threatening global human health conditions. For this reason, the detection of emerging infectious disease pattern is critical. However, as the epidemic spread of infectious disease occurs sporadically and rapidly, it is not easy to predict whether an infectious disease will emerge or not. Furthermore, accumulating data related to a specific infectious disease is not easy. For these reasons, finding useful data and building a prediction model with these data is required. The Internet press releases numerous articles every day that rapidly reflect currently pending issues. Thus, in this research, we accumulated Internet articles from Medisys that were related to infectious disease, to see if news data could be used to predict infectious disease outbreak. Articles related to infectious disease from January to December 2019 were collected. In this study, we evaluated if newly emerging infectious diseases could be detected using the news article data.

Data from previous research have suggested that veterinarians may face challenges in investigation of disease events due to time and money constraints. As part of an Australia-wide survey project, veterinarians were asked to answer an open-ended question regarding potential constraints in investigation of atypical disease events where there may be concern about a zoonosis or emerging infectious disease. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic content analysis with the consideration of the respondent's area of practice and level of experience. Five main themes were identified which encapsulated constraints to disease investigation described by participants, namely: (a) financing of disease investigations, including client willingness/ability to pay in absence of alternative government schemes; (b) client-related factors, including willingness to consent to investigation and comply with instructions; (c) professional preparedness to act, related to practitioner knowledge and technical competency; (d) workplace environment, impacted by physical, logistical and managerial aspects of workplaces; and (e) access to external technical support, primarily from government veterinary services. Successful investigation and management of atypical diseases, including potential zoonoses, requires preparedness of all veterinarians. Continuing professional education for veterinarians in infection prevention and control and biosecurity, alongside adequate government funding and support will help facilitate optimal health and biosecurity outcomes.

This study investigated trends in mortality and the economic burden of infectious diseases. Healthcare data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (2009-2019) and the Korean Statistics Information Service (1997-2019) were used. We selected 10 infectious disease groups (intestinal infections, tuberculosis, vaccine- preventable diseases, sepsis, viral hepatitis, HIV-related diseases, central nervous system infections, rheumatic heart diseases, respiratory tract infections, and arthropod-borne viral diseases). The age-standardized mortality rate for infectious diseases increased from 27.2 per 100,000 population in 1997 to 37.1 per 100,000 population in 2019 and has had an upward trend since 2004. During this same period, significant increases were seen in respiratory tract infections and among elderly persons, especially those aged ≥85 years. The costs for infectious diseases increased from 4.126 billion US dollar (USD) in 2009 to 6.612 billion USD in 2019, with respiratory tract infections accounting for 3.699 billion USD (69%). The annual cost per patient for visits for medical care due to infectious diseases increased from 131 USD in 2009 to 204 USD in 2019. Mortality among elderly persons and those with respiratory tract infections increased during the study period. The economic burden of infectious diseases has consistently increased, especially for respiratory tract infections.

Buprenorphine is safe and effective for OUD but remains underutilized. The prevalence and geographic distribution of ID physicians who are waivered to prescribe buprenorphine are unknown. This cross-sectional study merged data from several publicly available datasets from 1 November 2021 to 15 January 2022. Our primary outcome was the proportion of ID physicians possessing buprenorphine waivers in the United States. We identified individual- and county-level characteristics associated with buprenorphine waiver possession. We then used geospatial analysis to determine the geographic distribution of waivered ID physicians. We identified 6372 ID physicians in the United States, among whom 170 (2.7%) possessed waivers. Most ID physicians (97.3%) practiced in metropolitan counties. In our multivariable analysis, ID physicians had lower odds of having a waiver for every 10-year increase since graduating medical school (OR: .79; 95% CI: .68-.91). ID physicians practicing in counties with a higher proportion of uninsured residents had lower odds of having a waiver (OR: .75; 95% CI: .62-.90). Among counties with ≥1 ID physician (n = 729), only 11.2% had ≥1 waivered ID physician. We found an extremely low prevalence and skewed geographic distribution of ID physicians with buprenorphine waivers.

39231189,Prediction of infectious diseases using sentiment analysis on social media data.,"As the influence and risk of infectious diseases increase, efforts are being made to predict the number of confirmed infectious disease patients, but research involving the qualitative opinions of social media users is scarce. However, social data can change the psychology and behaviors of crowds through information dissemination, which can affect the spread of infectious diseases. Existing studies have used the number of confirmed cases and spatial data to predict the number of confirmed cases of infectious diseases. However, studies using opinions from social data that affect changes in human behavior in relation to the spread of infectious diseases are inadequate. Therefore, herein, we propose a new approach for sentiment analysis of social data by using opinion mining and to predict the number of confirmed cases of infectious diseases by using machine learning techniques. To build a sentiment dictionary specialized for predicting infectious diseases, we used Word2Vec to expand the existing sentiment dictionary and calculate the daily sentiment polarity by dividing it into positive and negative polarities from collected social data. Thereafter, we developed an algorithm to predict the number of confirmed infectious patients by using both positive and negative polarities with DNN, LSTM and GRU. The method proposed herein showed that the prediction results of the number of confirmed cases obtained using opinion mining were 1.12% and 3% better than those obtained without using opinion mining in LSTM and GRU model, and it is expected that social data will be used from a qualitative perspective for predicting the number of confirmed cases of infectious diseases.",PloS one,2024-,"Song Y, Yoon B",2,1688,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Comparisons were made between the pre-pandemic period (14 months from January 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020); and the pandemic period (19 months from March 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021). Of the 15,124 visits to the network during the 33-month observation period, 10,941 (72%) were during the pre-pandemic period, and 4183 (28%) during the pandemic period. Average monthly visits declined from 782/month (pre-COVID-19 era) to 220/month (COVID-19 pandemic era). Among non-migrants, the top-10 countries of exposure changed after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; destinations such as Italy and Austria, where COVID-19 exposure peaked in the first months, replaced typical travel destinations in Asia (Thailand, Indonesia, India). There was a small decline in migrant patients reported, with little change in the top countries of exposure (Bolivia, Mali).

37245760,Advances in paper based isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests for water-related infectious diseases.,"Water-associated or water-related infectious disease outbreaks are caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, which can be transmitted through contaminated water sources, poor sanitation practices, or insect vectors. Low- and middle-income countries bear the major burden of these infections due to inadequate hygiene and subpar laboratory facilities, making it challenging to monitor and detect infections in a timely manner. However, even developed countries are not immune to these diseases, as inadequate wastewater management and contaminated drinking water supplies can also contribute to disease outbreaks. Nucleic acid amplification tests have proven to be effective for early disease intervention and surveillance of both new and existing diseases. In recent years, paper-based diagnostic devices have made significant progress and become an essential tool in detecting and managing water-associated infectious diseases. In this review, we have highlighted the importance of paper and its variants as a diagnostic tool and discussed the properties, designs, modifications, and various paper-based device formats developed and used for detecting water-associated pathogens.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2023-Jul,"Jena S, Gaur D, Dubey NC, Tripathi BP",4,1199,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This bias arises from a combination of environmental factors, hormones and genetics. In this study, we review the contribution of the X chromosome to the genetic factor associated with infectious diseases. First, we give an overview of the X-linked genes that have been described in the context of infectious diseases and group them in four main pathways that seem to be dysregulated in infectious diseases: nuclear factor kappa-B, interleukin 2 and interferon γ cascade, toll-like receptors and programmed death ligand 1. Then, we review the infectious disease associations in existing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from the GWAS Catalog and the Pan-UK Biobank, describing the main associations and their possible implications for the disease. Finally, we highlight the importance of including the X chromosome in GWAS analysis and the importance of sex-specific analysis.",Briefings in functional genomics,2022-May,"Hay M, Kumar V, Ricaño-Ponce I",3,942,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

It complements physical examination and facilitates clinical decision-making. In infectious diseases, POCUS is particularly valuable, offering an initial assessment in cases of suspected infection. It often leads to an early tentative diagnosis enabling the prompt initiation of antimicrobial treatment without the delay associated with traditional radiology. POCUS provides direct visualization of affected organs, assists in evaluating fluid balance, and facilitates various interventions, all while reducing patient discomfort.

In past years, several mRNA vaccines have entered clinical trials and have shown promise for offering solutions to combat emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases such as rabies, Zika, and influenza. Recently, the successful application of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 has further validated the platform and opened the floodgates to mRNA vaccine's potential in infectious disease prevention, especially in the veterinary field. In this review, we describe our current understanding of the mRNA vaccines and the technologies used for mRNA vaccine development.

34214237,Mammal assemblage composition predicts global patterns in emerging infectious disease risk.,"As a source of emerging infectious diseases, wildlife assemblages (and related spatial patterns) must be quantitatively assessed to help identify high-risk locations. Previous assessments have largely focussed on the distributions of individual species; however, transmission dynamics are expected to depend on assemblage composition. Moreover, disease-diversity relationships have mainly been studied in the context of species loss, but assemblage composition and disease risk (e.g. infection prevalence in wildlife assemblages) can change without extinction. Based on the predicted distributions and abundances of 4466 mammal species, we estimated global patterns of disease risk through the calculation of the community-level basic reproductive ratio R0, an index of invasion potential, persistence, and maximum prevalence of a pathogen in a wildlife assemblage. For density-dependent diseases, we found that, in addition to tropical areas which are commonly viewed as infectious disease hotspots, northern temperate latitudes included high-risk areas. We also forecasted the effects of climate change and habitat loss from 2015 to 2035. Over this period, many local assemblages showed no net loss of species richness, but the assemblage composition (i.e. the mix of species and their abundances) changed considerably. Simultaneously, most areas experienced a decreased risk of density-dependent diseases but an increased risk of frequency-dependent diseases. We further explored the factors driving these changes in disease risk. Our results suggest that biodiversity and changes therein jointly influence disease risk. Understanding these changes and their drivers and ultimately identifying emerging infectious disease hotspots can help health officials prioritize resource distribution.",Global change biology,2021-Oct,"Wang YXG, Matson KD, Santini L, Visconti P, Hilbers JP, Huijbregts MAJ, Xu Y, Prins HHT, Allen T, Huang ZYX, de Boer WF",11,1793,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35389523,Great ape health watch: Enhancing surveillance for emerging infectious diseases in great apes.,"Infectious diseases have the potential to extirpate populations of great apes. As the interface between humans and great apes expands, zoonoses pose an increasingly severe threat to already endangered great ape populations. Despite recognition of the threat posed by human pathogens to great apes, health monitoring is only conducted for a small fraction of the world's wild great apes (and mostly those that are habituated) meaning that outbreaks of disease often go unrecognized and therefore unmitigated. This lack of surveillance (even in sites where capacity to conduct surveillance is present) is the most significant limiting factor in our ability to quickly detect and respond to emerging infectious diseases in great apes when they first appear. Accordingly, we must create a surveillance system that links disease outbreaks in humans and great apes in time and space, and enables veterinarians, clinicians, conservation managers, national decision makers, and the global health community to respond quickly to these events. Here, we review existing great ape health surveillance programs in African range habitats to identify successes, gaps, and challenges. We use these findings to argue that standardization of surveillance across sites and geographic scales, that monitors primate health in real-time and generates early warnings of disease outbreaks, is an efficient, low-cost step to conserve great ape populations. Such a surveillance program, which we call ""Great Ape Health Watch"" would lead to long-term improvements in outbreak preparedness, prevention, detection, and response, while generating valuable data for epidemiological research and sustainable conservation planning. Standardized monitoring of great apes would also make it easier to integrate with human surveillance activities. This approach would empower local stakeholders to link wildlife and human health, allowing for near real-time, bidirectional surveillance at the great ape-human interface.",American journal of primatology,2022-May,"Zimmerman DM, Mitchell SL, Wolf TM, Deere JR, Noheri JB, Takahashi E, Cranfield MR, Travis DA, Hassell JM",9,1983,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32933375,Transient indicators of tipping points in infectious diseases.,"The majority of known early warning indicators of critical transitions rely on asymptotic resilience and critical slowing down. In continuous systems, critical slowing down is mathematically described by a decrease in magnitude of the dominant eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix on the approach to a critical transition. Here, we show that measures of transient dynamics, specifically, reactivity and the maximum of the amplification envelope, also change systematically as a bifurcation is approached in an important class of models for epidemics of infectious diseases. Furthermore, we introduce indicators designed to detect trends in these measures and find that they reliably classify time series of case notifications simulated from stochastic models according to levels of vaccine uptake. Greater attention should be focused on the potential for systems to exhibit transient amplification of perturbations as a critical threshold is approached, and should be considered when searching for generic leading indicators of tipping points. Awareness of this phenomenon will enrich understanding of the dynamics of complex systems on the verge of a critical transition.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2020-Sep,"O'Regan SM, O'Dea EB, Rohani P, Drake JM",4,1169,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36430676,ILCs-Crucial Players in Enteric Infectious Diseases.,"Research of the last decade has remarkably increased our understanding of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). ILCs, in analogy to T helper (Th) cells and their cytokine and transcription factor profile, are categorized into three distinct populations: ILC1s express the transcription factor T-bet and secrete IFNγ, ILC2s depend on the expression of GATA-3 and release IL-5 and IL-13, and ILC3s express RORγt and secrete IL-17 and IL-22. Noteworthy, ILCs maintain a level of plasticity, depending on exposed cytokines and environmental stimuli. Furthermore, ILCs are tissue resident cells primarily localized at common entry points for pathogens such as the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They have the unique capacity to initiate rapid responses against pathogens, provoked by changes of the cytokine profile of the respective tissue. Moreover, they regulate tissue inflammation and homeostasis. In case of intracellular pathogens entering the mucosal tissue, ILC1s respond by secreting cytokines (e.g., IFNγ) to limit the pathogen spread. Upon infection with helminths, intestinal epithelial cells produce alarmins (e.g., IL-25) and activate ILC2s to secrete IL-13, which induces differentiation of intestinal stem cells into tuft and goblet cells, important for parasite expulsion. Additionally, during bacterial infection ILC3-derived IL-22 is required for bacterial clearance by regulating antimicrobial gene expression in epithelial cells. Thus, ILCs can limit infectious diseases via secretion of inflammatory mediators and interaction with other cell types. In this review, we will address the role of ILCs during enteric infectious diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022-Nov,"Leupold T, Wirtz S",2,1651,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39191837,Exploring the determinants of under-five mortality and morbidity from infectious diseases in Cambodia-a traditional and machine learning approach.,"Cambodia has made progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and burden of infectious diseases among children over the last decades. However the determinants of child mortality and morbidity in Cambodia is not well understood, and no recent analysis has been conducted to investigate possible determinants. We applied a multivariable logistical regression model and a conditional random forest to explore possible determinants of under-five mortality and under-five child morbidity from infectious diseases using the most recent Demographic Health Survey in 2021-2022. Our findings show that the majority (58%) of under-five deaths occurred during the neonatal period. Contraceptive use of the mother led to lower odds of under-five mortality (0.51 [95% CI 0.32-0.80], p-value 0.003), while being born fourth or later was associated with increased odds (3.25 [95% CI 1.09-9.66], p-value 0.034). Improved household water source and higher household wealth quintile was associated with lower odds of infectious disease while living in the Great Lake or Coastal region led to increased odds respectively. The odds ratios were consistent with the results from the conditional random forest. The study showcases how closely related child mortality and morbidity due to infectious disease are to broader social development in Cambodia and the importance of accelerating progress in many sectors to end preventable child mortality and morbidity.",Scientific reports,2024-Aug,"Helldén D, Sok S, Nordenstam A, Orsini N, Nordenstedt H, Alfvén T",6,1446,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

While there is an extensive body of literature surrounding cardiac infections including endocarditis, this is less so the case for other endovascular infections. The objective of this narrative review is to summarize the epidemiology, clinical features, and selected management of severe vascular infections exclusive of those involving the heart. Endovascular infections may involve either the arterial or venous vasculature and may arise in native vessels or secondary to implanted devices. Management is complex and requires multi-disciplinary involvement from the outset. Infective arteritis or device-related arterial infection involves removal of the infected tissue or device. In cases where complete excision is not possible, prolonged courses of antimicrobials are required. Serious infections associated with the venous system include septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular and other deep veins, and intracranial/venous sinuses. Source control is of paramount importance in these cases with adjunctive antimicrobial therapy. The role of anticoagulation is controversial although recommended in the absence of contraindications.

As a critical element, the receptor determines the selectivity, stability, and accuracy of the electrochemical biosensors. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and surface imprinted polymers (SIPs) have great potential to be robust artificial receptors. Therefore, extensive studies have been reported to develop MIPs/SIPs for the detection of infectious diseases with high selectivity and reliability. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of recognition events between imprinted polymers with different biomarkers, such as signaling molecules, microbial toxins, viruses, and bacterial and fungal cells. Then, various preparation methods of MIPs/SIPs for electrochemical biosensors are summarized. Especially, the methods of electropolymerization and micro-contact imprinting are emphasized.

39024833,Multiple antimicrobial and immune-modulating activities of cysteamine in infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases are a major threat to global health and cause millions of deaths every year, particularly in developing countries. The emergence of multidrug resistance challenges current antimicrobial treatments, inducing uncertainty in therapeutic protocols. New compounds are therefore necessary. A drug repurposing approach could play a critical role in developing new treatments used either alone or in combination with standard therapy regimens. Herein, we focused on cysteamine, an aminothiol endogenously synthesized by human cells during the degradation of coenzyme-A, which is a drug approved for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis. Cysteamine influences many biological processes due to the presence of the highly reactive thiol group. This review provides an overview of cysteamine-mediated effects on different viruses, bacteria and parasites, with a particular focus on infections caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Overcrowded refugee camps with poor sanitation and limited resources have fueled outbreaks, exacerbated by disrupted immunization programs and seasonal rains. Malaria is spreading rapidly due to inadequate mosquito control, while cholera outbreaks, linked to unsafe water and poor sanitation, have overwhelmed health facilities. Measles outbreaks are escalating due to low vaccination coverage, leaving vulnerable populations unprotected. The regional and global impacts are significant, as displaced populations crossing borders risk spreading diseases. Addressing this crisis requires urgent international collaboration to restore healthcare services, improve living conditions in camps, resume vaccination programs, and strengthen regional disease surveillance.

37291522,Constructing an emergency preparedness evaluation index system for public use during major emerging infectious disease outbreaks: a Delphi study.,"The major emerging infectious diseases (MEIDs) have occurred frequently and become increasingly serious in the world. Sufficient personal emergency preparedness is critical for the general people in efficiently responding to and recovering from MEIDs. Nevertheless, few specific indicators are available for assessing the individual emergency preparedness of the general public during these periods. Therefore, the aim of this study was to construct an index system for comprehensively evaluating the personal emergency preparedness of the public regarding MEIDs. Based on the global national-level emergency preparedness index framework and a literature review, a preliminary index system was constructed. From June 2022 to September 2022, a panel of 20 experts from nine provinces and municipalities across multiple research areas participated in this Delphi study. They rated the importance of pre-defined indicators using a five-point Likert scale and provided their qualitative comments. According to the feedback of each round of experts, the indicators of the evaluation index system were revised. After two rounds of expert consultation the evaluation index system reached a consensus, containing five first-level indicators, cooperating with prevention and control work, improving emergency response capacity, securing supplies and equipment, preparing economic resources, maintaining physical and mental health with affiliated 20 s-level indicators and 53 third-level indicators. The expert authority coefficient of consultation was 0.88 and 0.90. The Kendall's coefficient of concordance of expert consultations was 0.294 and 0.322, respectively. The differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). A valid, reliable and scientific evaluation index system was established. This personal emergency preparedness index system, as a precursor form, will further lay the foundation for the formation of an assessment instrument.

Reconstruction of transmission networks is invaluable in applying and developing effective control strategies for infectious diseases. We introduce transmission network individual level models (TN-ILMs), a competing-risk, continuous time extension to individual level model framework for infectious diseases of Deardon et al. (2010). Through simulation study using a Julia language software package, Pathogen.jl, we explore the models with respect to their ability to jointly infer latent event times, latent disease transmission networks, and the TN-ILM parameters. We find good parameter, event time, and transmission network inference, with enhanced performance for inference of transmission networks in epidemic simulations that have higher spatial signals in their infectivity kernel.

32628658,Winter is coming: Pathogen emergence in seasonal environments.,"Many infectious diseases exhibit seasonal dynamics driven by periodic fluctuations of the environment. Predicting the risk of pathogen emergence at different points in time is key for the development of effective public health strategies. Here we study the impact of seasonality on the probability of emergence of directly transmitted pathogens under different epidemiological scenarios. We show that when the period of the fluctuation is large relative to the duration of the infection, the probability of emergence varies dramatically with the time at which the pathogen is introduced in the host population. In particular, we identify a new effect of seasonality (the winter is coming effect) where the probability of emergence is vanishingly small even though pathogen transmission is high. We use this theoretical framework to compare the impact of different preventive control strategies on the average probability of emergence. We show that, when pathogen eradication is not attainable, the optimal strategy is to act intensively in a narrow time interval. Interestingly, the optimal control strategy is not always the strategy minimizing R0, the basic reproduction ratio of the pathogen. This theoretical framework is extended to study the probability of emergence of vector borne diseases in seasonal environments and we show how it can be used to improve risk maps of Zika virus emergence.",PLoS computational biology,2020-Jul,"Carmona P, Gandon S",2,1399,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This work presents a hybrid machine-learning model that could predict the validity of the infectious disease's news spread on the media. The proposed hybrid machine learning (ML) model uses the Dynamic Classifier Selection (DCS) process to validate news. Several machine learning models, such as K-Neighbors-Neighbor (KNN), AdaBoost (AB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), SVC, Gaussian Naïve Base (GNB), and Logistic Regression (LR) are tested in the simulation process on benchmark dataset. The simulation employs three DCS process methods: overall Local Accuracy (OLA), Meta Dynamic ensemble selection (META-DES), and Bagging. From seven ML classifiers, the AdaBoost with Bagging DCS method got a 97.45% high accuracy rate for training samples and a 97.56% high accuracy rate for testing samples. The second high accuracy was obtained at 96.12% for training and 96.45% for testing samples from AdaBoost with the Meta-DES method.

34734569,Emerging infectious diseases of amphibians in Poland: distribution and environmental drivers.,"Emerging infectious diseases are a threat to biodiversity and have taken a large toll on amphibian populations worldwide. The chytrid fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and B. salamandrivorans (Bsal), and the iridovirus Ranavirus (Rv), are of concern as all have contributed to amphibian declines. In central and eastern Europe, their geographical and host distributions and main environmental drivers determining prevalence are poorly known. We screened over 1000 amphibians from natural and captive populations in Poland for the presence of Bd, Bsal and Rv. In wild amphibian populations, we found that Bd is widespread, present in 46 out of 115 sampled localities as well as 2 captive colonies, and relatively common with overall prevalence at 14.4% in 9 species. We found lower prevalence of Rv at 2.4%, present in 11 out of 92 sampling sites, with a taxonomic breadth of 8 different amphibian species. Bsal infection was not detected in any individuals. In natural populations, Pelophylax esculentus and Bombina variegata accounted for 75% of all Bd infections, suggesting a major role for these 2 species as pathogen reservoirs in Central European freshwater habitats. General linear models showed that climatic as well as landscape features are associated with Bd infection in Poland. We found that higher average annual temperature constrains Bd infection, while landscapes with numerous water bodies or artificial elements (a surrogate for urbanization) increase the chances of infection. Our results show that a combination of climatic and landscape variables may drive regional and local pathogen emergence.",Diseases of aquatic organisms,2021-Nov,"Palomar G, Jakóbik J, Bosch J, Kolenda K, Kaczmarski M, Jośko P, Roces-Díaz JV, Stachyra P, Thumsová B, Zieliński P, Pabijan M",11,1625,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34717937,A spatio-stochastic model for the spread of infectious diseases.,"The spread of infectious diseases is a world-wide problem that has a greater impact on low-income countries. Mathematical modelling is a useful tool to better understand these diseases and to plan prevention and interventions. In this article, discrete-time binomial chain models, which are used for modelling the transmission of infectious diseases, have been extended by the addition of a spatial component. The spatial component is included in the function which represents the number of contacts that an individual makes. The spatio-stochastic model is derived to form three cases to match different modelling scenarios, namely: a model with only local transmission, a model with interaction between spatial units but no migration, and a model with interaction and migration between spatial units. Simulations are then used to compare the different models. The spatio-stochastic model is also demonstrated with an application to measles data. From this study, it can be seen that the type of model and inclusion of a spatial component plays an important role in the transmission of infectious diseases. The importance of choosing a model which best represents the dynamics and circumstances of an infectious disease is highlighted. The models presented in this paper allows flexibility which accommodate for a wide range of modelling cases.",Journal of theoretical biology,2022-Jan,Manjoo-Docrat R,1,1344,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

These include user applicability, utility of IT features but also stable financial support. Funding closely intertwines with implementations in terms of geographical reach, disease focus, and sustainability. However, the practice of evidence sharing on geographical and disease coverage, costs, and funding sources for improving the implementation of these systems on the continent is unclear. To analyse the key characteristics and availability of evidence for implementing digital infectious disease surveillance systems in Africa namely their disease focus, geographical reach, cost reporting, and external funding support. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature for the period 2003 to 2022 (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022300849). We searched five databases (PubMed, MEDLINE over Ovid, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) and websites of WHO, Africa CDC, and public health institutes of African countries. We mapped the distribution of projects by country; identified reported implementation cost components; categorised the availability of data on cost components; and identified supporting funding institutions outside Africa. A total of 29 reports from 2,033 search results were eligible for analysis. We identified 27 projects implemented in 13 countries, across 32 sites. Of these, 24 (75%) were pilot projects with a median duration of 16 months, (IQR: 5-40). Of the 27 projects, 5 (19%) were implemented for HIV/AIDs and tuberculosis, 4 (15%) for malaria, 4 (15%) for all notifiable diseases, and 4 (15%) for One Health.

Timely access to health facilities can prevent disease progression and enables disease notification through surveillance systems. The importance of accounting for physical accessibility in response to infectious diseases is increasingly recognized. Yet, there is no comprehensive review of the literature available on infectious diseases in relation to geographical accessibility to care. Therefore, we aimed at evaluating the current state of knowledge on the effect of geographical accessibility to health care on infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries.

Data was charted into a tabular format and descriptive data analyses were carried out to identify geographical regions, infectious diseases, and measures of physical accessibility among other factors. Search queries in PubMed and Web of Science yielded 560 unique publications. After title and abstract screening 99 articles were read in full detail, from which 64 articles were selected, including 10 manually. Results of the included publications could be broadly categorized into three groups: (1) decreased spatial accessibility to health care was associated with a higher infectious disease burden, (2) decreased accessibility was associated to lower disease reporting, minimizing true understanding of disease distribution, and (3) the occurrence of an infectious disease outbreak negatively impacted health care accessibility in affected regions. In the majority of studies, poor geographical accessibility to health care was associated with higher disease incidence, more severe health outcomes, higher mortality, and lower disease reporting. No difference was seen between countries or infectious diseases. Currently, policy-makers and scientists rely on data collected through passive surveillance systems, introducing uncertainty on disease estimates for remote communities. Our results highlight the need for increasing integration of geographical accessibility measures in disease risk modelling, allowing more realistic disease estimates and enhancing our understanding of true disease burden. Additionally, disease risk estimates could be used in turn to optimize the allocation of health services in the prevention and detection of infectious diseases.",PloS one,2021-,"Hierink F, Okiro EA, Flahault A, Ray N",4,2519,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36257685,Can Infectious Disease Control Be Achieved without Antibiotics by Exploiting Mechanisms of Disease Tolerance?,"Antimicrobial use in animal agriculture may be contributing to the emerging public health crisis of antimicrobial resistance. The sustained prevalence of infectious diseases driving antimicrobial use industry-wide suggests that traditional methods of bolstering disease resistance are, for some diseases, ineffective. A paradigm shift in our approach to infectious disease control is needed to reduce antimicrobial use and sustain animal and human health and the global economy. Targeting the defensive mechanisms that promote the health of an infected host without impacting pathogen fitness, termed ""disease tolerance,"" is a novel disease control approach ripe for discovery. This article presents examples of disease tolerance dictating clinical outcomes for several infectious diseases in humans, reveals evidence suggesting a similarly critical role of disease tolerance in the progression of infectious diseases plaguing animal agriculture, and thus substantiates the assertion that exploiting disease tolerance mechanisms can positively impact animal and human health.",ImmunoHorizons,2022-Oct,Lopez BS,1,1075,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

It foregrounds a series of patterns in fighting contagious animal diseases-lockdowns, quarantines, disinfection, mass animal vaccination, mass education, and prioritizing the treatment of infected animals over mass culling-which were together called the Comprehensive Prevention and Treatment (CPT). Shedding light on this understudied topic in the fields of the history of medicine and of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the author argues that it was not the central or provincial governments but rather local communes that led the effort to protect livestock from animal infectious diseases.

34637486,A retrospective observational study of the impact of 16s and 18s ribosomal RNA PCR on antimicrobial treatment over seven years: A tertiary hospital experience.,"Although culture-based methods remain a staple element of microbiology analysis, advanced molecular methods increasingly supplement the testing repertoire. Since the advent of 16s and 18s ribosomal RNA PCR in the 2000s, there has been interest in its utility for pathogen detection. Nonetheless, studies assessing the impact on antimicrobial prescribing are limited. We report a single-centre experience of the influence of 16s and 18s PCR testing on antimicrobial treatment, including a cost-analysis. Data were collected retrospectively for all samples sent for 16s and 18s PCR testing between January 2014 and December 2020. Results were compared to any culture-based result. Assessment focused on any change of antimicrobial treatment based on PCR result, or use of the result as supportive evidence for microbiological diagnosis. 310 samples relevant to 268 patients were referred for 16s/18s rRNA PCR testing during the period. Culture was performed for 234 samples. Enrichment culture was performed for 83 samples. 82 of 300 samples sent for 16s PCR had positive results (20.8%). When culture was performed, enrichment reduced the outcome of 16s PCR only positive results (4/36 [11.1%] versus 14/35 [40.0%], p = 0.030 where a pathogen found). 18s PCR yielded 9 positive results from 67 samples. The 16s PCR result influenced antimicrobial change for 6 patients (2.2%). We estimated the cost for 16s PCR testing to result in one significant change in antimicrobial therapy to be €3,340. 18s PCR did not alter antimicrobial treatment. There was limited impact of 16s PCR results on antimicrobial treatments. Relevance to practice was affected by relatively long turn-around-time for results. Utility may be increased in specialised surgical centres, or by reducing turn-around-time. Enrichment culture should be considered on samples where 16s PCR is requested. There remains limited evidence for use of 18s PCR in clinical management, and further studies in this area are likely warranted.",PloS one,2021-,"Teoh T, McNamara R, Powell J, O'Connell NH, Dunne CP",5,1995,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
31376823,Therapeutic Potentials of Scavenger Receptor CD36 Mediated Innate Immune Responses Against Infectious and Non-Infectious Diseases.,"CD36 is a multifunctional glycoprotein, expressed in different types of cells and known to play a significant role in the pathophysiology of the host. The structural studies revealed that the scavenger receptor consists of short cytosolic domains, two transmembrane domains, and a large ectodomain. The ectodomain serves as a receptor for a diverse number of endogenous and exogenous ligands. The CD36-specific ligands are involved in regulating the immune response during infectious and non-infectious diseases in the host. The role of CD36 in regulating the innate immune response during Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, Malaria, Leishmaniasis, HIV, and Sepsis in a ligand- mediated fashion. Apart from infectious diseases, it is also considered to be involved in metabolic disorders such as Atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's, cancer, and Diabetes. The ligand binding to scavenger receptor modulates the CD36 down-stream innate immune response, and it can be exploited to design suitable immuno-modulators. Hence, the current review focused on the role of the CD36 in innate immune response and therapeutic potentials of novel heterocyclic compounds as CD36 ligands during infectious and non-infectious diseases.",Current drug discovery technologies,2020-,"Banesh S, Trivedi V",2,1201,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Retrospective data from all cases of infectious disease pneumonectomy over the past 10 years were collected from two reference centers. The authors analyzed: patient demographics, etiology, laterality, bronchial stump treatment, presence of previous pulmonary resection, postoperative complications in the first 30 days, the treatment used in pleural complications, and one-year survival rate. 56 procedures were performed. The average age was 44 years, with female predominance (55%). 29 cases were operated on the left side (51%) and the most frequent etiology was post-tuberculosis (51.8%). The overall incidence of complications was 28.6% and the most common was empyema (19.2%). Among empyema cases, 36.3% required pleurostomy, 27.3% required pleuroscopy and 36.3% underwent thoracoplasty for treatment. Bronchial stump fistula was observed in 10.7% of cases. From all cases, 16.1% were completion pneumonectomies and 62.5% of these had some complication, a significantly higher incidence than patients without previous surgery (p = 0.0187). 30-day in-hospital mortality was (7.1%) with 52 cases (92.9%) and 1-year survival. The causes of death were massive postoperative bleeding (1 case) and sepsis (3 cases). Pneumonectomy for benign disease is a high-risk procedure performed for a variety of indications. While morbidity is often significant, once the perioperative risk has passed, the one-year survival rate can be very satisfying in selected patients with benign disease.","Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",2023-,"D'Ambrosio PD, Mariani AW, Júnior ER, de Medeiros IL, Oliveira LCS, Neto AG, Terra RM, Pêgo-Fernandes PM",8,1607,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39680617,Climate change and Vibrio vulnificus dynamics: A blueprint for infectious diseases.,"Climate change is having increasingly profound effects on human health, notably those associated with the occurrence, distribution, and transmission of infectious diseases. The number of disparate ecological parameters and pathogens affected by climate change are vast and expansive. Disentangling the complex relationship between these variables is critical for the development of effective countermeasures against its effects. The pathogen Vibrio vulnificus, a naturally occurring aquatic bacterium that causes fulminant septicemia, represents a quintessential climate-sensitive organism. In this review, we use V. vulnificus as a model organism to elucidate the intricate network of interactions between climatic factors and pathogens, with the objective of identifying common patterns by which climate change is affecting their disease burden. Recent findings indicate that in regions native to V. vulnificus or related pathogens, climate-driven natural disasters are the chief contributors to their disease outbreaks. Concurrently, climate change is increasing the environmental suitability of areas non-endemic to their diseases, promoting a surge in their natural populations and transmission dynamics, thus elevating the risk of new outbreaks. We highlight potential risk factors and climatic drivers aggravating the threat of V. vulnificus transmission under both scenarios and propose potential measures for mitigating its impact. By defining the mechanisms by which climate change influences V. vulnificus disease burden, we aim to shed light on the transmission dynamics of related disease-causing agents, thereby laying the groundwork for early warning systems and broadly applicable control measures.",PLoS pathogens,2024-Dec,"Jayakumar JM, Martinez-Urtaza J, Brumfield KD, Jutla AS, Colwell RR, Cordero OX, Almagro-Moreno S",7,1714,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

These diseases are considered potentially epidemic, due to the nature of tropical climate and high humidity of Indonesia's area. Several factors contribute to the emergence of these diseases: in conjunction with human behavior. Most of these diseases are zoonotic, specifically spread by viruses. The latest emerging infectious disease in Indonesia is monkeypox. Controlling the management of EID-REIDs presents a major obstacle for international health initiatives, particularly in Indonesia because of its extensive population, varied geographical landscape, and constrained resources. Overcoming these obstacles demands tactics like prioritizing Indonesian policies, bolstering disease monitoring systems, upgrading diagnostic capacities, fortifying public health facilities, fostering community involvement and education, and executing efficient prevention and management protocols. These strategies should be implemented in collaboration with international partners and organizations to effectively control and prevent the spread of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in Indonesia.",Acta medica Indonesiana,2024-Jul,"Triyono EA, Arini M, Asmarawati TP, Wirantara H, Tan F",5,1295,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

These biosensors allow for the detection of target analytes at ultra-low concentrations, which is mandatory for early disease diagnosis. Nanostructure-decorated platforms have been demonstrated to enhance the analytical performance of electrochemical biosensors. In addition, glycans anchored to electrode platforms as bioreceptors exhibit high specificity toward biomarker detection. Both attributes offer a synergy that allows ultrasensitive detection of molecular targets of clinical interest. In this context, we review recent advances in electrochemical glycobiosensors for detecting infectious diseases and cancer biomarkers focused on colorectal cancer. We also describe general aspects of structural glycobiology, definitions, and classification of electrochemical biosensors and discuss relevant works on electrochemical glycobiosensors in the last ten years. Finally, we summarize the advances in electrochemical glycobiosensors and comment on some challenges and limitations needed to advance toward real clinical applications of these devices.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2022-Dec,"Echeverri D, Orozco J",2,1247,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Derived from an ancient microbial defence system, these so-called ""molecular scissors"" enable precise gene editing with a low error rate. However, CRISPR systems can also be targeted against pathogenic DNA or RNA sequences. This potential is being combined with innovative delivery systems to develop new therapeutic approaches to infectious diseases. We searched Pubmed and Google Scholar for CRISPR-based strategies in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. Reference lists were reviewed and synthesized for narrative review. CRISPR-based strategies represent a novel approach to many challenging infectious diseases. CRISPR technologies can be harnessed to create rapid, low-cost diagnostic systems, as well as to identify drug-resistance genes. Therapeutic strategies, such as CRISPR systems that cleave integrated viral genomes or that target resistant bacteria, are in development. CRISPR-based therapies for emerging viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, have also been proposed. Finally, CRISPR systems can be used to reprogram human B cells to produce neutralizing antibodies. The risks of CRISPR-based therapies include off-target and on-target modifications.

36345644,Time to address quality control processes applied to antibody testing for infectious diseases.,"As testing for infectious diseases moves from manual, biological testing such as complement fixation to high throughput automated autoanalyzer, the methods for controlling these assays have also changed to reflect those used in clinical chemistry. However, there are many differences between infectious disease serology and clinical chemistry testing, and these differences have not been considered when applying traditional quality control methods to serology. Infectious disease serology, which is highly regulated, detects antibodies of varying classes and to multiple and different antigens that change according to the organisms' genotype/serotype and stage of disease. Although the tests report a numerical value (usually signal to cut-off), they are not measuring an amount of antibodies, but the intensity of binding within the test system. All serology assays experience lot-to-lot variation, making the use of quality control methods used in clinical chemistry inappropriate. In many jurisdictions, the use of the manufacturer-provided kit controls is mandatory to validate the test run. Use of third-party controls, which are highly recommended by ISO 15189 and the World Health Organization, must be manufactured in a manner whereby they have minimal lot-to-lot variation and at a level where they detect exceptional variation.

Findings from a population-based nested case-control study.,"Findings from molecular studies suggesting that several infectious agents cause sarcoidosis are intriguing yet conflicting and likely biased due to their cross-sectional design. As done in other inflammatory diseases to overcome this issue, prospectively-collected register data could be used, but reverse causation is a threat when the onset of disease is difficult to establish. We investigated the association between infectious diseases and sarcoidosis to understand if they are etiologically related. We conducted a nested case-control study (2009-2013) using incident sarcoidosis cases from the Swedish National Patient Register (n = 4075) and matched general population controls (n = 40,688). Infectious disease was defined using inpatient/outpatient visits and/or antimicrobial dispensations starting 3 years before diagnosis/matching. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of sarcoidosis were estimated using conditional logistic regression and tested for robustness assuming the presence of reverse causation bias. The aOR of sarcoidosis associated with history of infectious disease was 1.19 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09, 1.29; 21% vs. 16% exposed cases and controls, respectively). Upper respiratory and ocular infections conferred the highest OR. Findings were similar when we altered the infection definition or varied the infection-sarcoidosis latency period (1-7 years). In bias analyses assuming one in 10 infections occurred because of preclinical sarcoidosis, the observed association was completely attenuated (aOR 1.02; 95% CI 0.90, 1.15). Our findings, likely induced by reverse causation due to preclinical sarcoidosis, do not support the hypothesis that common symptomatic infectious diseases are etiologically linked to sarcoidosis.

However, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the comparative treatment that persons who are homeless receive. This study seeks to describe this potential difference in treatment, including diagnostic services tested, procedures performed and medications prescribed. This study used a retrospective, cohort study design to analyse data from the 2007-2010 United States National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey database, specifically looking at the emergency department subset. Complex sample logistic regression analysis was used to compare variables, including diagnostic services, procedures and medication classes prescribed between homeless and private residence individuals seeking emergency department treatment for infectious diseases. Findings were then adjusted for potential confounding variables. Compared with private residence individuals, persons who are homeless and presenting with an infectious disease were more likely (adjusted OR: 10.99, CI 1.08 to 111.40, p<0.05) to receive sutures or staples and less likely (adjusted OR: 0.29, CI 0.10 to 0.87, p<0.05) to be provided medications when presenting with an infectious disease in US emergency departments. Significant differences were also detected in prescribing habits of multiple anti-infective medication classes. This study detected a significant difference in suturing/stapling and medication prescribing patterns for persons who are homeless with an infectious disease in US emergency departments.

38273726,The Prevalence of and Responses to Infectious Diseases in No Sangchu Ilgi.,"This paper examines the patterns of infectious diseases during the Joseon dynasty in the 18th and 19th centuries, as described in No Sangchu Ilgi (the diaries of No Sangchu) and the responses of No Sangchu and his family. During this period, infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles were prevalent. No Sangchu's diaries detailed accounts related to his family and hometown. For example, the diaries show that the infection rate was high among young children, such as No's younger siblings and nephews. The process of nursing them is meticulously documented. To address infectious diseases, No sought medical assistance by meeting with doctors or visiting pharmacies for prescribed remedies. Additionally, he and his family would relocate to temples or relatives' homes to avoid areas with severe outbreaks. When engaged in official duties, updates about his family and hometown were received through letters, and the diary primarily focused on the circumstances at his workplace. In 1799, while working in the central government, No encountered a large-scale outbreak of infectious diseases. He extensively documented the resulting damage, including the loss of his own family members. An examination of his diaries not only reveals No Sangchu's individual responses but also sheds light on the state's efforts to maintain a relief system. In summary, No Sangchu Ilgi provides detailed records of infectious diseases directly related to household well-being and the state's to infectious diseases, making it a valuable source for understanding the experience of infectious diseases in the late Joseon period.",Ui sahak,2023-Dec,Im H,1,1616,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39394577,Infectious disease events in people with HIV receiving kidney transplantation: Analysis of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study.,"Since the implementation of universal antiretroviral therapy, kidney transplantation (K-Tx) has become a valuable option for treatment of end-stage kidney disease for people with HIV (PWH) with similar patient and graft survival as compared to HIV-uninfected patients. Little is known about the hazards and manifestations of infectious disease (ID) events occurring in kidney transplant recipients with HIV. Using linked information collected in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS), we described in-depth demographical and clinical characteristics of PWH who received a K-Tx since 2008. Further, we performed recurrent time to event analyses to understand whether HIV was an independent risk factor for ID events. Overall, 24 PWH with 57 ID events were included in this study (100% match of SHCS to STCS). Of these, 17 (70.8%) patients had at least one ID event: 22 (38.6%) viral (HIV not counted), 18 (31.6%) bacterial, one (1.8%) fungal and 16 (28.1%) probable infections. Most ID events affected the respiratory tract (25, 37.3%) or the urinary tract (13, 19.4%). Pathogen types and infection sites were similar in PWH and a matched control group of HIV-uninfected patients.

37697715,Diurnal temperature variation and the implications for diagnosis and infectious disease screening: a population-based study.,"Fevers have been used as a marker of disease for hundreds of years and are frequently used for disease screening. However, body temperature varies over the course of a day and across individual characteristics; such variation may limit the detection of febrile episodes complicating the diagnostic process. Our objective was to describe individual variation in diurnal temperature patterns during episodes of febrile activity using millions of recorded temperatures and evaluate the probability of recording a fever by sex and for different age groups. We use timestamped deidentified temperature readings from thermometers across the US to construct illness episodes where continuous periods of activity in a single user included a febrile reading. We model the mean temperature recorded and probability of registering a fever across the course of a day using sinusoidal regression models while accounting for user age and sex. We then estimate the probability of recording a fever by time of day for children, working-age adults, and older adults. We find wide variation in body temperatures over the course of a day and across individual characteristics. The diurnal temperature pattern differed between men and women, and average temperatures declined for older age groups. The likelihood of detecting a fever varied widely by the time of day and by an individual's age or sex. Time of day and demographics should be considered when using body temperatures for diagnostic or screening purposes. Our results demonstrate the importance of follow-up thermometry readings if infectious diseases are suspected.","Diagnosis (Berlin, Germany)",2024-Feb,"Miller AC, Koeneman SH, Suneja M, Cavanaugh JE, Polgreen PM",5,1609,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34280513,Prophylactic vaccine delivery systems against epidemic infectious diseases.,"Prophylactic vaccines have evolved from traditional whole-cell vaccines to safer subunit vaccines. However, subunit vaccines still face problems, such as poor immunogenicity and low efficiency, while traditional adjuvants are usually unable to meet specific response needs. Advanced delivery vectors are important to overcome these barriers; they have favorable safety and effectiveness, tunable properties, precise location, and immunomodulatory capabilities. Nevertheless, there has been no systematic summary of the delivery systems to cover a wide range of infectious pathogens. We herein summarized and compared the delivery systems for major or epidemic infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. We also included the newly licensed vaccines (e.g., COVID-19 vaccines) and those close to licensure. Furthermore, we highlighted advanced delivery systems with high efficiency, cross-protection, or long-term protection against epidemic pathogens, and we put forward prospects and thoughts on the development of future prophylactic vaccines.",Advanced drug delivery reviews,2021-Sep,"Pan C, Yue H, Zhu L, Ma GH, Wang HL",5,1071,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36642212,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology of other communicable diseases in Japan.,"To elucidate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the epidemiology of other infectious diseases. We investigated the epidemiology of 36 communicable diseases during 2015-2021 in Japan and compared the number of cases in each disease between the prepandemic (2015-2019) and intrapandemic (2020-2021) periods. Relationships between the incidence of the infectious diseases and the COVID-19 pandemic were also investigated. Of 36 communicable diseases, the number of cases in the 27 diseases (75%) mainly caused by pathogens transmitted by droplet or contact was lower intrapandemic than prepandemic, and the cases of 21 diseases (58%) continued to decrease intrapandemic. The number of cases of six diseases (17%) was higher intrapandemic than prepandemic, and the cases of two diseases (5.6%), Japanese spotted fever and syphilis, continued to increase intrapandemic. Time trend analyses revealed a positive correlation between case numbers of communicable diseases and the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the case numbers of hand-foot-and-mouth disease and respiratory syncytial virus infection rebounded in 2021 after decreasing in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted the epidemiology of communicable diseases, suggesting that countermeasures against COVID-19 and lifestyle changes might be involved in these epidemiological changes.",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2023-Mar,"Hirae K, Hoshina T, Koga H",3,1344,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Within-host models represent the spread of pathogens inside an individual, whilst between-host models track transmission between individuals. However, pathogen dynamics at one scale affect those at another. This has led to the development of multiscale models that connect within-host and between-host dynamics.

39216102,Sacred journeys and pilgrimages: health risks associated with travels for religious purposes.,"Pilgrimages and travel to religious mass gatherings (MGs) are part of all major religions. This narrative review aims to describe some characteristics, including health risks, of the more well-known and frequently undertaken ones. A literature search was conducted using keywords related to the characteristics (frequency of occurrence, duration, calendar period, reasons behind their undertaking and the common health risks) of Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and Jewish religious MGs. About 600 million trips are undertaken to religious sites annually. The characteristics vary between religions and between pilgrimages. However, religious MGs share common health risks, but these are reported in a heterogenous manner. European Christian pilgrimages reported both communicable diseases, such as norovirus outbreaks linked to the Marian Shrine of Lourdes in France, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs predominated at the Catholic pilgrimage to the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico, which documented 11 million attendees in 1 week. The Zion Christian Church Easter gathering in South Africa, attended by ~10 million pilgrims, reported mostly motor vehicle accidents. Muslim pilgrimages such as the Arbaeen (20 million pilgrims) and Hajj documented a high incidence of respiratory tract infections, up to 80% during Hajj. Heat injuries and stampedes have been associated with Hajj. The Hindu Kumbh Mela pilgrimage, which attracted 100 million pilgrims in 2013, documented respiratory conditions in 70% of consultations. A deadly stampede occurred at the 2021 Jewish Lag BaOmer MG. Communicable and NCD differ among the different religious MGs. Gaps exists in the surveillance, reporting and data accessibility of health risks associated with religious MGs. A need exists for the uniform implementation of a system of real-time monitoring of diseases and morbidity patterns, utilizing standardized modern information-sharing platforms. The health needs of pilgrims can then be prioritized by developing specific and appropriate guidelines.",Journal of travel medicine,2024-Dec,"Parker S, Steffen R, Rashid H, Cabada MM, Memish ZA, Gautret P, Sokhna C, Sharma A, Shlim DR, Leshem E, Dwyer DE, Lami F, Chatterjee S, Shafi S, Zumla A, Mahomed O",16,2060,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
31996099,Game theoretic modelling of infectious disease dynamics and intervention methods: a review.,"We review research studies which use game theory to model the decision-making of individuals during an epidemic, attempting to classify the literature and identify the emerging trends in this field. The literature is classified based on (i) type of population modelling (classical or network-based), (ii) frequency of the game (non-repeated or repeated), and (iii) type of strategy adoption (self-learning or imitation). The choice of model is shown to depend on many factors such as the immunity to the disease, the strength of immunity conferred by the vaccine, the size of population and the level of mixing therein. We highlight that while early studies used classical compartmental modelling with self-learning games, in recent years, there is a substantial growth of network-based modelling with imitation games. The review indicates that game theory continues to be an effective tool to model decision-making by individuals with respect to intervention (vaccination or social distancing).",Journal of biological dynamics,2020-Dec,"Chang SL, Piraveenan M, Pattison P, Prokopenko M",4,995,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

34476957,Pathological findings in African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) in South Africa.,"The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is an iconic species of South African megafauna. As the farmed buffalo population expands, the potential impacts on population health and disease transmission warrant investigation. A retrospective study of skin biopsy and necropsy samples from 429 animals was performed to assess the spectrum of conditions seen in buffaloes in South Africa. Determination of the cause of death (or euthanasia) could not be made in 33.1% (136/411) of the necropsy cases submitted due to autolysis or the absence of significant lesions in the samples submitted. Infectious and parasitic diseases accounted for 53.5% (147/275) of adult fatal cases and non-infectious conditions accounted for 34.9% (96/275). Abortions and neonatal deaths made up 11.6% (32/275) of necropsy cases. Rift Valley fever, bovine viral diarrhoea, malignant catarrhal fever, tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia, anaesthetic deaths, cachexia and hepatotoxic lesions were the most common causes of death. The range of infectious, parasitic and non-infectious diseases to which African buffaloes were susceptible was largely similar to diseases in domestic cattle which supports concerns regarding disease transmission between the two species. The similarity between diseases experienced in both species will assist wildlife veterinarians in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in captive African buffaloes. The present study likely does not represent accurate disease prevalence data within the source population of buffaloes, and diseases such as anthrax, brucellosis and foot and mouth disease are under-represented in this study.

In the course of historical development, they persistently threaten human health and safety. Even today, despite the developments in medical science, we cannot escape the fear and suffering caused by infectious diseases. Whether in ancient or modern times, the source of infection, route of transmission, and a susceptible population are the three key conditions for the prevalence and spread of infectious diseases. All factors closely related to these three conditions can affect the prevalence of infectious diseases. China is one of the cradles of world civilization. The ancient people accumulated a great deal of experience and lessons in the long struggle against infectious diseases. In the face of the current threat posed by widespread infectious disease, it is imperative to review and summarize ancient Chinese ideas and health policies on epidemic prevention and control to inspire contemporary efforts in the prevention and control of infectious disease.

33296387,How to better communicate the exponential growth of infectious diseases.,"Exponential growth bias is the phenomenon whereby humans underestimate exponential growth. In the context of infectious diseases, this bias may lead to a failure to understand the magnitude of the benefit of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Communicating the same scenario in different ways (framing) has been found to have a large impact on people's evaluations and behavior in the contexts of social behavior, risk taking and health care. We find that framing matters for people's assessment of the benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions. In two commonly used frames, most subjects in our experiment drastically underestimate the number of cases avoided by adopting non-pharmaceutical interventions. Framing growth in terms of doubling times rather than growth rates reduces the bias. When the scenario is framed in terms of time gained rather than cases avoided, the median subject assesses the benefit of non-pharmaceutical interventions correctly. These findings suggest changes that could be adopted to better communicate the exponential spread of infectious diseases.",PloS one,2020-,"Schonger M, Sele D",2,1081,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Cell membrane-based nanoplatforms endow nanoparticles with versatile characteristics, such as half-life extension, targeting ability, and immune-system regulation. However, monotypic cell membrane usually fails to provoke strong immune response for immunotherapy while maintaining good biosafety.

An Empirical Study of 31 Provinces.,"Respiratory infectious diseases (RID) are the major form of infectious diseases in China, and are highly susceptible to climatic conditions. Current research mainly focuses on the impact of weather on RID, but there is a lack of research on the effect of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on RID. Therefore, this paper uses the system generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) and the data of 31 provinces in China from 2007 to 2018 to construct a dynamic panel model to empirically test the causality between ENSO and RID morbidity. Moreover, this paper considers the moderating effects of per capita disposable income and average years of education on this causality. The results show that ENSO can positively and significantly impact RID morbidity, which is 5.842% higher during El Niño years than normal years. In addition, per capita disposable income and average years of education can effectively weaken the relationship between ENSO and RID morbidity. Thus, this paper is of great significance for improving the RID early climate warning system in China and effectively controlling the spread of RID.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022-Mar,"Tang Q, Gong K, Xiong L, Dong Y, Xu W",5,1108,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37945127,Microbial cell-free DNA detection: Minimally invasive diagnosis of infectious diseases.,"Detection of infectious diseases, especially among immunocompromised and patients on prolonged anti-microbial treatment, remains challenging, limited by conventional techniques with low sensitivity and long-turnaround time. Molecular detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) also has limited utility as it requires a targeted approach with prior suspicion of the infecting organism. Advancements in sequencing methodologies, specifically next-generation sequencing (NGS), have presented a promising opportunity to identify pathogens in cases where conventional techniques may be inadequate. However, the direct application of these techniques for diagnosing invasive infections is still limited by the need for invasive sampling, highlighting the pressing need to develop and implement non-invasive or minimally invasive approaches to improve the diagnosis of invasive infections. The objectives of this article are to explore the notable features, clinical utility, and constraints associated with the detection of microbial circulating cell-free DNA (mcfDNA) as a minimally invasive diagnostic tool for infectious diseases. The mcfDNA detection provides an opportunity to identify micro-organisms in the blood of a patient. It is especially beneficial in immunocompromised patients where invasive sampling is not possible or where repeated cultures are negative.

32650013,Infectious disease antibodies for biomedical applications: A mini review of immune antibody phage library repertoire.,"Antibody phage display is regarded as a critical tool for the development of monoclonal antibodies for infectious diseases. The different classes of antibody libraries are classified based on the source of repertoire used to generate the libraries. Immune antibody libraries are generated from disease infected host or immunization against an infectious agent. Antibodies derived from immune libraries are distinct from those derived from naïve libraries as the host's in vivo immune mechanisms shape the antibody repertoire to yield high affinity antibodies. As the immune system is constantly evolving in accordance to the health state of an individual, immune libraries can offer more than just infection-specific antibodies but also antibodies derived from the memory B-cells much like naïve libraries. The combinatorial nature of the gene cloning process would give rise to a combination of natural and un-natural antibody gene pairings in the immune library. These factors have a profound impact on the coverage of immune antibody libraries to target both disease-specific and non-disease specific antigens. This review looks at the diverse nature of antibody responses for immune library generation and discusses the extended potential of a disease-specified immune library in the context of phage display.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2020-Nov,"Lai JY, Lim TS",2,1313,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Therefore, early detection of infectious diseases is a significant need, and many researchers have developed models to diagnose them in the early stages. This paper reviewed research articles for recent machine-learning (ML) algorithms applied to infectious disease diagnosis. We searched the Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Springer, and IEEE databases from 2015 to 2022, identified the pros and cons of the reviewed ML models, and discussed the possible recommendations to advance the studies in this field. We found that most of the articles used small datasets, and few of them used real-time data. Our results demonstrated that a suitable ML technique depends on the nature of the dataset and the desired goal. Moreover, heterogeneous data could ensure the model's generalization, while big data, many features, and a hybrid model will increase the resulting performance. Furthermore, using other techniques such as deep learning and NLP to extract vast features from unstructured data is a powerful approach to enhancing the performance of ML diagnostic models.",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2022-,"Alqaissi EY, Alotaibi FS, Ramzan MS",3,1219,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37192524,Estimating the prevalence of two or more diseases using outcomes from multiplex group testing.,"When screening a population for infectious diseases, pooling individual specimens (e.g., blood, swabs, urine, etc.) can provide enormous cost savings when compared to testing specimens individually. In the biostatistics literature, testing pools of specimens is commonly known as group testing or pooled testing. Although estimating a population-level prevalence with group testing data has received a large amount of attention, most of this work has focused on applications involving a single disease, such as human immunodeficiency virus. Modern methods of screening now involve testing pools and individuals for multiple diseases simultaneously through the use of multiplex assays. Hou et al. (2017, Biometrics, 73, 656-665) and Hou et al. (2020, Biostatistics, 21, 417-431) recently proposed group testing protocols for multiplex assays and derived relevant case identification characteristics, including the expected number of tests and those which quantify classification accuracy. In this article, we describe Bayesian methods to estimate population-level disease probabilities from implementing these protocols or any other multiplex group testing protocol which might be carried out in practice. Our estimation methods can be used with multiplex assays for two or more diseases while incorporating the possibility of test misclassification for each disease. We use chlamydia and gonorrhea testing data collected at the State Hygienic Laboratory at the University of Iowa to illustrate our work.

34819025,Funding patterns for biomedical research and infectious diseases burden in Gabon.,"Biomedical research plays an important role in improving health. There seems to exist a negative correlation between the amount of biomedical research funding and disease burden from all Sub-Saharan African countries. In this study, we describe funding patterns for biomedical research, explore the correlation between funding and burden of diseases, and quantify inequalities in funds distribution across diseases in Gabon over the period 2005-2015. Data on medical research funds from 2005 to 2015 were retrieved through a structured questionnaire distributed to Gabonese biomedical research institutions and by consulting online databases. Data on the burden of diseases were gathered from the World Health Organization and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We used Kendall rank correlation coefficient to explore the correlation between cumulative funds over time and the burden of disease. The inequality distribution of funding across diseases was assessed through Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve. Biomedical research funding was characterized by a remarkable growth from 2005 to 2010 and a decline from 2010 to 2014. Funds were mostly from external sources and from partnerships. There was inequality in research funds allocation across diseases and malaria was far the most funded disease. There was a significant negative correlation between cumulative funding and the burden of HIV, tuberculosis, and of Helminthiasis (from 2006 to 2010) suggesting that research may be contributing to the management of such diseases. A positive, although not significant, correlation was found between cumulative funds and malaria burden. The negative correlation between HIV and tuberculosis cumulative funding and burden suggests that research may be contributing to the management of such diseases but further research is needed to assess the causal direction of such as relationship. As the burden of non-communicable diseases is increasing, more research funds should be focused on those. While research partnerships have been and will remain fundamental, Gabon should increase the amount of national funds to overcome periods of reduced research funding flows from abroad.",BMC public health,2021-Nov,"Adegnika OS, Honkpehedji YJ, Mougeni Lotola F, Agnandji ST, Adegnika AA, Lell B, Sicuri E",7,2190,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

These treatments provide passive transfer of high-titer antibodies that either reduces the risk or the severity of the infection and offer immediate but short-term protection against specific diseases. Antibody preparations derived from immunized human donors are commonly used for the prophylaxis and treatment of rabies, hepatitis A and B viruses, varicella-zoster virus, and pneumonia caused by respiratory syncytial virus, <i>Clostridium tetani</i>, <i>Clostridium botulinum</i>. The use of hyperimmune globulin therapy is a promising challenge, especially for the treatment of emerging viral infections for which there are no specific therapies or licensed vaccines.",Viruses,2023-Jul,"Pati I, Cruciani M, Candura F, Massari MS, Piccinini V, Masiello F, Profili S, De Fulvio L, Pupella S, De Angelis V",10,938,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37203518,Digital Disease Surveillance for Emerging Infectious Diseases: An Early Warning System Using the Internet and Social Media Data for COVID-19 Forecasting in Canada.,"Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) are a significant threat to population health globally. We aimed to examine the relationship between internet search engine queries and social media data on COVID-19 and determine if they can predict COVID-19 cases in Canada. We analyzed Google Trends (GT) and Twitter data from 1/1/2020 to 3/31/2020 in Canada and used various signal-processing techniques to remove noise from the data. Data on COVID-19 cases was obtained from the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group. We conducted time-lagged cross-correlation analyses and developed the long short-term memory model for forecasting daily COVID-19 cases. Among symptom keywords, ""cough,"" ""runny nose,"" and ""anosmia"" were strong signals with high cross-correlation coefficients >0.8 ( rCough = 0.825, t - 9; rRunnyNose = 0.816, t - 11; rAnosmia = 0.812, t - 3 ), showing that searching for ""cough,"" ""runny nose,"" and ""anosmia"" on GT correlated with the incidence of COVID-19 and peaked 9, 11, and 3 days earlier than the incidence peak, respectively. For symptoms- and COVID-related Tweet counts, the cross-correlations of Tweet signals and daily cases were rTweetSymptoms = 0.868, t - 11 and tTweetCOVID = 0.840, t - 10, respectively. The LSTM forecasting model achieved the best performance (MSE = 124.78, R2 = 0.88, adjusted R2 = 0.87) using GT signals with cross-correlation coefficients >0.75. Combining GT and Tweet signals did not improve the model performance. Internet search engine queries and social media data can be used as early warning signals for creating a real-time surveillance system for COVID-19 forecasting, but challenges remain in modelling.",Studies in health technology and informatics,2023-May,"Yang Y, Tsao SF, Basri MA, Chen HH, Butt ZA",5,1655,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32889395,Quartz crystal microbalance-based biosensors as rapid diagnostic devices for infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases are the ever-present threats to public health and the global economy. Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial to impede the progression of a disease and break the chain of transmission. Conventional diagnostic techniques are typically time-consuming and costly, making them inefficient for early diagnosis of infections and inconvenient for use at the point of care. Developments of sensitive, rapid, and affordable diagnostic methods are necessary to improve the clinical management of infectious diseases. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) systems have emerged as a robust biosensing platform due to their label-free mechanism, which allows the detection and quantification of a wide range of biomolecules. The high sensitivity and short detection time offered by QCM-based biosensors are attractive for the early detection of infections and the routine monitoring of disease progression. Herein, the strategies employed in QCM-based biosensors for the detection of infectious diseases are extensively reviewed, with a focus on prevalent diseases for which improved diagnostic techniques are in high demand. The challenges to the clinical application of QCM-based biosensors are highlighted, along with an outline of the future scope of research in QCM-based diagnostics.",Biosensors & bioelectronics,2020-Nov,"Lim HJ, Saha T, Tey BT, Tan WS, Ooi CW",5,1294,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has underscored the importance of targeted preparedness research to enable rapid countermeasure development during a crisis. In December 2021 the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), building upon the successful strategies developed during the SARS-CoV-2 response and to prepare for future pandemics, published a pandemic preparedness plan that outlined a research strategy focused on priority pathogens, technology platforms, and prototype pathogens. To accelerate the discovery, development, and evaluation of medical countermeasures against new or previously unknown pathogens of pandemic potential, we present here a strategy of research directed at select prototype pathogens. In this manner, leveraging a prototype pathogen approach may serve as a powerful cornerstone in biomedical research preparedness to protect public health from newly emerging and reemerging infectious diseases.",The Journal of infectious diseases,2023-Jun,"Cassetti MC, Pierson TC, Patterson LJ, Bok K, DeRocco AJ, Deschamps AM, Graham BS, Erbelding EJ, Fauci AS",9,1123,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38145656,Modeling the impact of hospital beds and vaccination on the dynamics of an infectious disease.,"The unprecedented scale and rapidity of dissemination of re-emerging and emerging infectious diseases impose new challenges for regulators and health authorities. To curb the dispersal of such diseases, proper management of healthcare facilities and vaccines are core drivers. In the present work, we assess the unified impact of healthcare facilities and vaccination on the control of an infectious disease by formulating a mathematical model. To formulate the model for any region, we consider four classes of human population; namely, susceptible, infected, hospitalized, and vaccinated. It is assumed that the increment in number of beds in hospitals is continuously made in proportion to the number of infected individuals. To ensure the occurrence of transcritical, saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations, the conditions are derived. The normal form is obtained to show the existence of Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. To validate the analytically obtained results, we have conducted some numerical simulations. These results will be useful to public health authorities for planning appropriate health care resources and vaccination programs to diminish prevalence of infectious diseases.",Mathematical biosciences,2024-Feb,"Maurya J, Blyuss KB, Misra AK",3,1186,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33382076,The Swiss STAR trial - an evaluation of target groups for sexually transmitted infection screening in the sub-sample of women.,"In Switzerland, universal health insurance does not cover any routine testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), not even in individuals at high risk, and extra-genital swabbing is not standard of care. We compared STI prevalence in a multicentre prospective observational cohort of multi-partner women with/without sex work and evaluated associated risk factors. Between January 2016 and June 2017, we offered free STI testing to women with multiple&nbsp; sexual partners (three or more in the previous 12 months), with follow-up examinations every 6 months. We used multiplex polymerase chain-reaction testing (for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium) for pooled swabs (pharynx, urethra/vagina, anus), and antibody tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Treponema pallidum at every visit, and for hepatitis B and C at baseline. We screened 490 female sex workers (FSWs), including 17 trans women, and 92 other multi-partner women. More than half reported a steady partner. Previously undiagnosed HIV was found in 0.2% vs 0.0%, respectively, and T. pallidum antibodies in 5.9% vs 0.0%. STIs requiring antibiotic treatment comprised: active syphilis 1.2% vs 0.0%; N. gonorrhoeae 4.9% vs 0.0%; C. trachomatis 6.3% vs 5.4%, T. vaginalis 10.4% vs 0.0%; M. genitalium 6.7% vs 6.5%. One in four FSWs vs one in nine other women had one or more of these STIs at baseline. 15.8% vs 3.8% had a history of hepatitis B, 45.5% vs 22.8% had no immunity (HBs-AB &lt;10 IU/l). Two FSWs had hepatitis C virus antibodies (0.4%) without concurrent HIV infection. Non-condom-use (last three months) for anal/vaginal sex was not associated with STIs. Independent risk factors were group sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1&ndash;4.0), age less than 25 (aOR 3.7, 95% CI 1.6&ndash;8.9), and being active in sex work for less than 1 year (aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.3&ndash;5.3). HIV and HCV do not appear to pose a major public health problem among FSWs in Switzerland, whereas vaccination against HBV should be promoted. FSWs showed high rates of STIs requiring treatment to reduce transmission to clients and/or steady partners. FSWs should be offered low-cost or free STI screening as a public health priority.",Swiss medical weekly,2020-Dec,"Vernazza PL, Rasi M, Ritzler M, Dost F, Stoffel M, Aebi-Popp K, Hauser CV, Esson C, Lange K, Risch L, Schmidt AJ",11,2289,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing for infectious diseases promises an unbiased approach to detection of microbes that does not depend on growth in culture or the targeting of specific pathogens. However, the issues of contamination, interpretation of results, selection of databases used for analysis, and prediction of antimicrobial susceptibilities from sequencing data remain challenges.

This review aims to explore the role of ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of infectious diseases involving the gastrointestinal tract. We discuss the imaging features of various infectious etiologies, such as bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections, highlighting characteristic findings on ultrasound scans. Additionally, we provide insights into the utility of ultrasound for the assessment of treatment response.

38789528,Bridging the gap with multispecific immune cell engagers in cancer and infectious diseases.,"By binding to multiple antigens simultaneously, multispecific antibodies are expected to substantially improve both the activity and long-term efficacy of antibody-based immunotherapy. Immune cell engagers, a subclass of antibody-based constructs, consist of engineered structures designed to bridge immune effector cells to their target, thereby redirecting the immune response toward the tumor cells or infected cells. The increasing number of recent clinical trials evaluating immune cell engagers reflects the important role of these molecules in new therapeutic approaches for cancer and infections. In this review, we discuss how different immune cell types (T and natural killer lymphocytes, as well as myeloid cells) can be bound by immune cell engagers in immunotherapy for cancer and infectious diseases. Furthermore, we explore the preclinical and clinical advancements of these constructs, and we discuss the challenges in translating the current knowledge from cancer to the virology field. Finally, we speculate on the promising future directions that immune cell engagers may take in cancer treatment and antiviral therapy.",Cellular & molecular immunology,2024-Jul,"Rolin C, Zimmer J, Seguin-Devaux C",3,1138,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38006200,Infectious disease in the Pleistocene: Old friends or old foes?,"The impact of endemic and epidemic disease on humans has traditionally been seen as a comparatively recent historical phenomenon associated with the Neolithisation of human groups, an increase in population size led by sedentarism, and increasing contact with domesticated animals as well as species occupying opportunistic symbiotic and ectosymbiotic relationships with humans. The orthodox approach is that Neolithisation created the conditions for increasing population size able to support a reservoir of infectious disease sufficient to act as selective pressure. This orthodoxy is the result of an overly simplistic reliance on skeletal data assuming that no skeletal lesions equated to a healthy individual, underpinned by the assumption that hunter-gatherer groups were inherently healthy while agricultural groups acted as infectious disease reservoirs. The work of van Blerkom, Am. J. Phys. Anthropol., vol. suppl 37 (2003), Wolfe et al., Nature, vol. 447 (2007) and Houldcroft and Underdown, Am. J. Phys. Anthropol., vol. 160, (2016) has changed this landscape by arguing that humans and pathogens have long been fellow travelers. The package of infectious diseases experienced by our ancient ancestors may not be as dissimilar to modern infectious diseases as was once believed. The importance of DNA, from ancient and modern sources, to the study of the antiquity of infectious disease, and its role as a selective pressure cannot be overstated. Here we consider evidence of ancient epidemic and endemic infectious diseases with inferences from modern and ancient human and hominin DNA, and from circulating and extinct pathogen genomes.

The ongoing spread of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the increased use of immunosuppressive therapy and the persistence of overcrowding and suboptimal sanitation in underdeveloped areas facilitate both disease transmission from environmental and foodborne sources and person-to-person transmission. Clinicians increasingly rely on endoscopic biopsy sample interpretation to diagnose gastrointestinal infections. Thus, pathologists must be aware of diagnostic features of a variety of microbial pathogens. Detection with molecular techniques also allows for correlation between infectious agents and their histopathological features, which has expanded our knowledge of the inflammatory changes produced by infectious agents.

Existing technologies for detecting infectious and non-infectious diseases are mostly tedious, expensive, and do not meet the World Health Organization's (WHO) ASSURED (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable to end user) criteria. Hence, more accurate, sensitive, and faster diagnostic technologies that meet the ASSURED criteria are highly required for timely and evidenced-based treatment. Presently, the diagnostics industry is finding interest in microfluidics-based biosensors, as this integration comprises all qualities, such as reduction in the size of the equipment, rapid turnaround time, possibility of parallel multiple analysis or multiplexing, etc. Microfluidics deal with the manipulation/analysis of fluid within micrometer-sized channels. Biosensors comprise biomolecules immobilized on a physicochemical transducer for the detection of a specific analyte. In this review article, we provide an outline of the history of microfluidics, current practices in the selection of materials in microfluidics, and how and where microfluidics-based biosensors have been used for the diagnosis of infectious and non-infectious diseases. Our inclination in this review article is toward the employment of microfluidics-based biosensors for the improvement of already existing/traditional methods in order to reduce efforts without compromising the accuracy of the diagnostic test.

34112116,Clinical application of cell-free next-generation sequencing for infectious diseases at a tertiary children's hospital.,"Children affected by infectious diseases may not always have a detectable infectious etiology. Diagnostic uncertainty can lead to prolonged hospitalizations, inappropriately broad or extended courses of antibiotics, invasive diagnostic procedures, and difficulty predicting the clinical course and outcome. Cell-free plasma next-generation sequencing (cfNGS) can identify viral, bacterial, and fungal infections by detecting pathogen DNA in peripheral blood. This testing modality offers the ability to test for many organisms at once in a shotgun metagenomic approach with a rapid turnaround time. We sought to compare the results of cfNGS to conventional diagnostic test results and describe the impact of cfNGS on clinical care in a diverse pediatric population at a large academic children's hospital. We performed a retrospective chart review of hospitalized subjects at a tertiary pediatric hospital to determine the diagnostic yield of cfNGS and its impact on clinical care. We describe the clinical application of results from 142 cfNGS tests in the management of 110 subjects over an 8-month study period. In comparison to conventional testing as a reference standard, cfNGS was found to have a positive percent agreement of 89.6% and negative percent agreement of 52.3%. Furthermore, 32.4% of cfNGS results were directly applied to make a clinical change in management. We demonstrate the clinically utility of cfNGS in the management of acutely ill children.

It is unclear if this could potentially guide diagnostic evaluations. We examined the association between symptom duration and diagnostic and prognostic outcomes in FUO/IUO. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of adult patients meeting criteria for FUO/IUO from a tertiary care center in Belgium between 2000 and 2019. The association between symptom duration and outcomes of interest were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. Among 602 patients who met criteria for FUO/IUO (mean age 54 years, 43% female), 132 (22%) and 68 (11%) had symptoms for 3-12 months and >12 months, respectively. There were no significant differences in diagnosis or all-cause mortality between a symptom duration of <3 months and 3-12 months. In contrast, those who had a symptom duration of >12 months were less likely to receive a final diagnosis (aHR 0.42, 95% CI 0.30-0.60), in particular a diagnosis of infectious disorders (aHR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12-0.74), malignancies (aHR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03-0.46), and miscellaneous conditions (aHR 0.22, 95% CI 0.07-0.71), but no significant differences were seen in noninfectious inflammatory disorders (aHR 0.74, 95% CI 0.48-1.15) or all-cause mortality (aHR 0.55, 95% CI 0.19-1.54).

34194045,Thinking clearly about social aspects of infectious disease transmission.,"Social and cultural forces shape almost every aspect of infectious disease transmission in human populations, as well as our ability to measure, understand, and respond to epidemics. For directly transmitted infections, pathogen transmission relies on human-to-human contact, with kinship, household, and societal structures shaping contact patterns that in turn determine epidemic dynamics. Social, economic, and cultural forces also shape patterns of exposure, health-seeking behaviour, infection outcomes, the likelihood of diagnosis and reporting of cases, and the uptake of interventions. Although these social aspects of epidemiology are hard to quantify and have limited the generalizability of modelling frameworks in a policy context, new sources of data on relevant aspects of human behaviour are increasingly available. Researchers have begun to embrace data from mobile devices and other technologies as useful proxies for behavioural drivers of disease transmission, but there is much work to be done to measure and validate these approaches, particularly for policy-making. Here we discuss how integrating local knowledge in the design of model frameworks and the interpretation of new data streams offers the possibility of policy-relevant models for public health decision-making as well as the development of robust, generalizable theories about human behaviour in relation to infectious diseases.",Nature,2021-Jul,"Buckee C, Noor A, Sattenspiel L",3,1414,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Among challenges to application of clinical xenotransplantation are unknown risks of transmission of animal microbes to immunosuppressed recipients or the community. Experience in allotransplantation and in preclinical models suggests that viral infections are the greatest concern. Worldwide, the distribution of swine pathogens is heterogeneous and cannot be fully controlled by international agricultural regulations. It is possible to screen source animals for potential human pathogens before procuring organs in a manner not possible within the time available for surveillance testing in allotransplantation. Infection control measures require microbiological assays for surveillance of source animals and xenograft recipients and research into zoonotic potential of porcine organisms.

The propagation of variants of viruses is an interesting problem. We perform numerical simulations of the microscopic epidemic model based on network theory for the spread of variants. Assume that a small number of individuals infected with the variant are added to widespread infection with the original virus. When a highly infectious variant that is more transmissible than the original lineage is added, the variant spreads quickly to the wide space. On the other hand, if the infectivity is about the same as that of the original virus, the infection will not spread. The rate of spread is not linear as a function of the infection strength but increases non-linearly. This cannot be explained by the compartmental model of epidemiology but can be understood in terms of the dynamic absorbing state known from the contact process.",Scientific reports,2022-Jan,"Okabe Y, Shudo A",2,894,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

These rodents are purchased from pet shops, breeders, and online. Consequently, some of these rodents may subtly transmit diseases as they may be asymptomatic to certain pathogens. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We systematically searched four academic databases viz. Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus to determine zoonotic pathogens associated with pet and feeder rodents globally. Our searches were performed in R statistical software using the packages ""metagear"" and ""revtool"". <b><i>Results:</i></b> We found 62 studies reporting on zoonotic pathogens between 1973 and 2022 from 16 countries representing 4 continents, namely Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America. The review identified 30 zoonotic pathogens isolated from pet and feeder rodents, including the African pygmy mouse (<i>Mus minutoides</i>), brown rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>), and the house mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>). The greatest number of pathogens was reported from the United States, followed by Togo and the United Kingdom. Bacterial pathogens were the most prevalent. However, the Seoul virus and rat bite fever (<i>Streptobacillus moniliformis</i>) were the most studied pathogens, found in more than one country, with reported outbreak cases. Most of the zoonotic pathogens were isolated from rodents acquired from pet shops. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> We recommend that pet and feeder rodents purchased from pet shops should be regularly screened for potential zoonotic pathogens as some of these animals may not show clinical signs of the illness. There is also a critical need to develop strict regulations and policies, especially in underdeveloped and developing regions for an effective surveillance process, which will include early detection, rapid response, and control of zoonotic diseases globally.","Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)",2023-Nov,"Shivambu N, Shivambu TC, Chimimba CT",3,1926,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39116182,Interacting particle models on the impact of spatially heterogeneous human behavioral factors on dynamics of infectious diseases.,"Human behaviors have non-negligible impacts on spread of contagious disease. For instance, large-scale gathering and high mobility of population could lead to accelerated disease transmission, while public behavioral changes in response to pandemics may effectively reduce contacts and suppress the peak of the outbreak. In order to understand how spatial characteristics like population mobility and clustering interplay with epidemic outbreaks, we formulate a stochastic-statistical environment-epidemic dynamic system (SEEDS) via an agent-based biased random walk model on a two-dimensional lattice. The ""popularity"" and ""awareness"" variables are taken into consideration to capture human natural and preventive behavioral factors, which are assumed to guide and bias agent movement in a combined way. It is found that the presence of the spatial heterogeneity, like social influence locality and spatial clustering induced by self-aggregation, potentially suppresses the contacts between agents and consequently flats the epidemic curve. Surprisedly, disease responses might not necessarily reduce the susceptibility of informed individuals and even aggravate disease outbreak if each individual responds independently upon their awareness. The disease control is achieved effectively only if there are coordinated public-health interventions and public compliance to these measures. Therefore, our model may be useful for quantitative evaluations of a variety of public-health policies.",PLoS computational biology,2024-Aug,"Xiong Y, Wang C, Zhang Y",3,1491,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32384901,Bibliometric analysis of peer-reviewed literature on climate change and human health with an emphasis on infectious diseases.,"Assessing research activity is important for planning future protective and adaptive policies. The objective of the current study was to assess research activity on climate change and health with an emphasis on infectious diseases. A bibliometric method was applied using SciVerse Scopus. Documents on climate change and human health were called ""health-related literature"" while documents on climate change and infectious diseases were called ""infection-related literature"". The study period was from 1980 to 2019. The search query found 4247 documents in the health-related literature and 1207 in the infection-related literature. The growth of publications showed a steep increase after 2007. There were four research themes in the health-related literature: (1) climate change and infectious diseases; (2) climate change, public health and food security; (3) heat waves, mortality, and non-communicable diseases; and (4) climate change, air pollution, allergy, and respiratory health. The most frequently encountered pathogens/infectious diseases in the infection-related literature were malaria and dengue. Documents in infection-related literature had a higher h-index than documents in the health-related literature. The top-cited documents in the health-related literature focused on food security, public health, and infectious diseases while those in infection-related literature focused on water-, vector-, and mosquito-borne diseases. The European region had the highest contribution in health-related literature (n = 1626; 38.3%) and infection-related literature (n = 497; 41.2%). The USA led with 1235 (29.1%) documents in health-related literature and 365 (30.2%) documents in infection-related literature. The Australian National University ranked first in the health-related literature while the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ranked first in the infection-related literature. International research collaboration was inadequate. Documents published in the Environmental Health Perspectives journal received the highest citations per document. A total of 1416 (33.3%) documents in the health-related literature were funded while 419 (34.7%) documents in the infection-related literature were funded. Research on climate change and human health is on the rise with research on infection-related issues making a good share. International research collaboration should be funded and supported.

33308934,Pyroptotic cell-derived microparticle: An atherogenic factor in infectious diseases.,"Chronic infection is considered a risk factor for atherosclerosis. The link between infectious agents and atherosclerosis is manifested by the presence of infection-induced pyroptotic cells in atherosclerotic lesions. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death that occurs most frequently upon infection. However, inflammation is not the only cause by which pyroptosis involved in atherosclerosis. During pyroptosis, a large amount of microparticles are released from pyroptotic cells, which not only transfer inflammatory mediators to arterial vessel, but also mediate the interaction between a variety of cells, leading to endothelial injury, macrophage infiltration, vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation, thereby accelerating atherosclerosis. Thus, we proposed hypothesis that pyroptotic cell-derived microparticle is an atherogenic factor in infectious diseases.",Medical hypotheses,2021-Jan,"Sun SW, Tong WJ, Zheng GQ, Tuo QH, Lei XY, Liao DF",6,902,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Therefore, it is essential for dental professionals to identify the related oral manifestations, who are working for domestic medical service, international medical assistance, peace-keeping medical service or medical support of international joint military exercises. This study aims to investigate the attitude and knowledge of Chinese dental professionals on tropical infectious diseases and oral health, and to explore the difference between different genders, education backgrounds, professional identities, professional titles and tropics working experience. Network questionnaire was used to evaluate the knowledge and attitude of 236 Chinese dental professionals towards tropical infectious diseases and oral health. The scores of the participants on tropical infectious diseases and oral health were quite low. Although working experience in the tropics partially affected the understanding, there was no difference between different genders, education backgrounds, professional identities and professional titles. The understanding of dental professionals on tropical infectious diseases and oral health was insufficient.

39427054,Development of a wastewater based infectious disease surveillance research system in South Korea.,"Wastewater-based epidemiology has been used in pathogen surveillance for microorganisms at the community level. This study was conducted to determine the occurrence and trends of infectious pathogens in sewage from Yongin city and the relationships between these pathogens and the incidence of infectious diseases in the community. From December 2022 to November 2023, we collected inflow water from six wastewater treatment plants in Yongin city twice a month. The analyzed microorganisms included 15 respiratory viruses, 7 pneumonia-causing bacteria, 19 acute diarrhea-causing pathogens, SARS-CoV-2, Zika virus, hepatitis A virus, poliovirus, Mpox, and measles. They were detected through real-time PCR and conventional PCR. The concentrations of 9 pathogens among them were additionally analyzed using quantitative real time PCR. The correlation was confirmed through statistical analysis with the rate of detection for pathogens reported by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. Influenza A virus, human adenovirus, and human rhinovirus were moderately correlated (rho values of 0.45 to 0.58). Campylobacter spp. and sapovirus were strong correlated (rho values of 0.62, 0.63). Enteropathogenic E. coli, human coronavirus, and norovirus GII were very strong correlated (rho values of 0.86 to 0.92). We were able to identify the prevalence of respiratory viral infections, pneumonia, and acute diarrhea-causing pathogens in the community through wastewater-based epidemiology data.

37179006,"Unlocking the DOOR-how to design, apply, analyse, and interpret desirability of outcome ranking endpoints in infectious diseases clinical trials.","Desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) outcomes, with or without response adjusted for antibiotic risk (RADAR), are increasingly used in infectious diseases randomized clinical trials (RCTs), with the advantage of being able to combine multiple clinical outcomes and antibiotic duration in a single metric. However, it remains poorly understood, and there is considerable heterogeneity in its use. In this scoping review, we explain how to design, use and analyse a DOOR endpoint, and highlight several pitfalls and potential improvements that can be made to DOOR/RADAR. The Ovid MEDLINE database was searched for terms related to DOOR in English-language articles published up to 31 December 2022. Articles discussing DOOR methodology and/or reporting clinical trial analyses (as either primary, secondary, or post-hoc analysis) using a DOOR outcome were included.

38417659,Towards development of functional climate-driven early warning systems for climate-sensitive infectious diseases: Statistical models and recommendations.,"Climate, weather and environmental change have significantly influenced patterns of infectious disease transmission, necessitating the development of early warning systems to anticipate potential impacts and respond in a timely and effective way. Statistical modelling plays a pivotal role in understanding the intricate relationships between climatic factors and infectious disease transmission. For example, time series regression modelling and spatial cluster analysis have been employed to identify risk factors and predict spatial and temporal patterns of infectious diseases. Recently advanced spatio-temporal models and machine learning offer an increasingly robust framework for modelling uncertainty, which is essential in climate-driven disease surveillance due to the dynamic and multifaceted nature of the data. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including deep learning and neural networks, excel in capturing intricate patterns and hidden relationships within climate and environmental data sets. Web-based data has emerged as a powerful complement to other datasets encompassing climate variables and disease occurrences. However, given the complexity and non-linearity of climate-disease interactions, advanced techniques are required to integrate and analyse these diverse data to obtain more accurate predictions of impending outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics. This article presents an overview of an approach to creating climate-driven early warning systems with a focus on statistical model suitability and selection, along with recommendations for utilizing spatio-temporal and machine learning techniques. By addressing the limitations and embracing the recommendations for future research, we could enhance preparedness and response strategies, ultimately contributing to the safeguarding of public health in the face of evolving climate challenges.",Environmental research,2024-May,"Haque S, Mengersen K, Barr I, Wang L, Yang W, Vardoulakis S, Bambrick H, Hu W",8,1888,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35878824,Deep similarity analysis and forecasting of actual outbreak of major infectious diseases using Internet-Sourced data.,"Perhaps no other generation in the span of recorded human history has endured the risks of infectious diseases as has the current generation. The prevalence of infectious diseases is caused mainly by unlimited contact between people in a highly globalized world. Disease control and prevention (CDC) promptly collect and produce disease outbreak statistics, but CDCs rely on a curated, centralized collection system, and requires up to two weeks of lead time. Consequently, the quick release of disease outbreak information has become a great challenge. Infectious disease outbreak information is recorded and spread somewhere on the Internet much faster than CDC announcements, and Internet-sourced data have shown non-substitutable potential to watch and predict infectious disease outbreaks in advance. In this study, we performed a thorough analysis to show the similarity between the Korean Center of Disease Control (KCDC) infectious disease datasets and three Internet-sourced data for nine major infectious diseases in terms of time-series volume. The results show that many of infectious disease outbreak have strongly related to Internet-sourced data. We analyzed several factors that affect the similarity. Our analysis shows that the increase in the number of Internet-sourced data correlates with the increase in the number of infected people and thus, show the positive similarity. We also found that the greater the number of infectious disease outbreaks corresponds to having a wider spread of outbreak regions, in which it also proves to have higher similarity. We presented the prediction result of infectious disease outbreak using various Internet-sourced data and an effective deep learning algorithm. It showed that there are positive correlations between the number of infected people or the number of related web data and the prediction accuracy. We developed and currently operate a web-based system to show the similarity between KCDC and related Internet-sourced data for infectious diseases. This paper helps people to identify what kind of Internet-sourced data they need to use to predict and track a specific infectious disease outbreak. We considered as much as nine major diseases and three kinds of Internet-sourced data together, and we can say that our finding did not depend on specific infectious disease nor specific Internet-sourced data.",Journal of biomedical informatics,2022-Sep,"Jang B, Kim Y, Il Kim G, Wook Kim J",4,2378,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

One major challenge in combatting such diseases is a lack of effective drugs or specific treatments. In addition, drug resistance to currently available therapeutics and adverse effects caused by long-term overuse are both serious public health issues. A promising treatment strategy is to employ cell-membrane mimics as decoys to trap and to detain the pathogens. In this Perspective, we briefly review the infection mechanisms adopted by different pathogens at the cellular membrane interface and highlight the applications of cell-membrane-mimicking nanodecoys for systemic protection against infectious diseases. We also discuss the implication of nanodecoy-pathogen complexes in the development of vaccines.

Public health stakeholders and decision-makers are called upon to set up or strengthen surveillance systems in areas hosting Olympic or Paralympic Games (OPGs) or large-scale international competitions, the objective being to detect and manage outbreaks should they occur during that period. We undertook a narrative review of the literature so as to identify major reported infectious disease outbreaks linked with or during OPGs / international sporting events during warm seasons. Our review found that since 1992, Summer Olympic and Paralympic games and international football competitions have been associated with sporadic cases of infectious diseases, principally respiratory, gastrointestinal/foodborne, but not with any major communicable or other infectious disease outbreak. Communicable disease risks should be assessed for the population taken as a whole, an integrated ecosystem with several population compartments potentially exchanging pathogens among one another. Although the Games afford an opportunity to federate or invent new surveillance systems to fill a gap, surveillance should be based on existing medical and laboratory systems, proven tools reinforced with the necessary human and financial resources.

35596137,A compelling demonstration of why traditional statistical regression models cannot be used to identify risk factors from case data on infectious diseases: a simulation study.,"Regression models are often used to explain the relative risk of infectious diseases among groups. For example, overrepresentation of immigrants among COVID-19 cases has been found in multiple countries. Several studies apply regression models to investigate whether different risk factors can explain this overrepresentation among immigrants without considering dependence between the cases. We study the appropriateness of traditional statistical regression methods for identifying risk factors for infectious diseases, by a simulation study. We model infectious disease spread by a simple, population-structured version of an SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered)-model, which is one of the most famous and well-established models for infectious disease spread. The population is thus divided into different sub-groups. We vary the contact structure between the sub-groups of the population. We analyse the relation between individual-level risk of infection and group-level relative risk. We analyse whether Poisson regression estimators can capture the true, underlying parameters of transmission. We assess both the quantitative and qualitative accuracy of the estimated regression coefficients. We illustrate that there is no clear relationship between differences in individual characteristics and group-level overrepresentation -small differences on the individual level can result in arbitrarily high overrepresentation. We demonstrate that individual risk of infection cannot be properly defined without simultaneous specification of the infection level of the population. We argue that the estimated regression coefficients are not interpretable and show that it is not possible to adjust for other variables by standard regression methods. Finally, we illustrate that regression models can result in the significance of variables unrelated to infection risk in the constructed simulation example (e.g. ethnicity), particularly when a large proportion of contacts is within the same group. Traditional regression models which are valid for modelling risk between groups for non-communicable diseases are not valid for infectious diseases. By applying such methods to identify risk factors of infectious diseases, one risks ending up with wrong conclusions. Output from such analyses should therefore be treated with great caution.",BMC medical research methodology,2022-May,"Engebretsen S, Rø G, de Blasio BF",3,2341,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34272205,The evolution of rapid antigen detection systems and their application for COVID-19 and other serious respiratory infectious diseases.,"Making the correct diagnosis of a patient seeking medical attention is the ultimate goal of a practicing physician, irrespective of whether the cause of the patient's condition is infectious or non-infectious. Antigen detection tests can be used to aid in the diagnosis of various infectious-related disorders including COVID-19 where it has become especially important due to the serious nature of this disease and its worldwide prevalence. These tests closely mimic one of the earliest prototypes - the urine pregnancy test - and as a result they have gained wide acceptance based on their overall simplicity, low cost and relative accuracy. In some situations, especially as a screening test, they can be used instead of the more technically demanding and complex molecular and serologic assays that are still useful and helpful under many different circumstances. Antigen detection systems are based on finding a particular immunogenic component, typically a protein or polysaccharide molecule, that is both unique and an integral part of the pathogen or other biological entity. Because these tests generally provide only qualitative results, they often need to be supplemented with other and sometimes more sophisticated laboratory-based diagnostic procedures to corroborate the initial test result. In this review, we first describe general background information on antigen-detection methods, including any unique aspects of their overall design, and then follow with an extensive description on the merits and limitations of these tests for detecting COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, for other serious respiratory diseases caused by three common bacterial pathogens - Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila.","Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi",2021-Oct,"S Pavia C, M Plummer M",2,1754,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33112102,Evolution of epidemiological thought in medicine taking into account the evolution of Polish epidemiology in the 20th century.,"Communicable diseases have accompanied humanity since the beginning of its existence. The first descriptions of diseases appeared in the 8th century B.C. in the Iliad, Homer. Epidemics of communicable diseases were often described in social context by poets, historians, and chroniclers. Medicine as a science until the 19th century could not provide answers concerning the aetiology of epidemic diseases or propose therapies with measurable benefits. For centuries the fight against epidemics was the duty of administrative services. Quarantine, isolation (including forced isolation), sanitary cordons, and disinfection procedures involving the moxibustion, burning of objects, clothing and bodies, etc. were introduced very early on. The knowledge of practical measures taken during repeated epidemics of various communicable diseases in Europe laid the foundations for the development of social medicine in the 18th century. In the 19th century, methods such as statistics, comparison of patient groups, mathematics and others were introduced to assess the effectiveness of prophylactic and therapeutic measures. In the 19th century it became possible to distinguish a new science - epidemiology. The missing element was the so-called ""bacteriological breakthrough"". After the discovery and description of bacteria, there was a tumultuous development of bacteriology, vaccines were created and huge financial resources were allocated to bacteriological institutes. After extensive use of chemotherapeutics and antibiotics, it turned out in the mid-20th century that the mortality from communicable diseasesis statistically lower in some countries than in others.In the 1940s, population-based cardiological studies using epidemiological patterns were introduced in the United States, and in the 1950s epidemiological congresses worldwide accepted that it was reasonable for epidemiology to investigate the occurrence and causes of communicable and non-communicable diseases. In Poland, in 1964, at the 4th Congress of the Polish Society of Epidemiologists and Doctors of Infectious Diseases in Cracow, a decision was made to extend epidemiological studies to non-communicable diseases.",Przeglad epidemiologiczny,2020-,Paliga RE,1,2189,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The time when infectious individuals are first introduced into a population is crucial in predicting whether a major disease outbreak occurs. In this investigation, we apply a time-nonhomogeneous stochastic process for a cholera epidemic with seasonal periodicity and a multitype branching process approximation to obtain an analytical estimate for the probability of an outbreak. In particular, an analytic estimate of the probability of disease extinction is shown to satisfy a system of ordinary differential equations which follows from the backward Kolmogorov differential equation. An explicit expression for the mean (resp. variance) of the first extinction time given an extinction occurs is derived based on the analytic estimate for the extinction probability. Our results indicate that the probability of a disease outbreak, and mean and standard derivation of the first time to disease extinction are periodic in time and depend on the time when the infectious individuals or free-living pathogens are introduced. Numerical simulations are then carried out to validate the analytical predictions using two examples of the general cholera model. At the end, the developed theoretical results are extended to more general models of infectious diseases.",Journal of mathematical biology,2021-Apr,"Allen LJS, Wang X",2,1372,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

31790029,Advances in vaccinating immunocompromised children.,"Immunocompromised children are a largely under-vaccinated population and are vulnerable to acquiring vaccine-preventable infections (VPIs). A variety of factors contribute to poor vaccine coverage including: severity of underlying illness, sporadic contact with primary care physicians, and lack of awareness among specialty providers regarding vaccination status. In this review, we report recent data regarding incidence of VPIs, new approaches to vaccine use, rates of vaccine coverage, and strategies to optimize vaccine administration in immunocompromised populations. Pediatric transplant recipients and patients with autoimmune disorders receiving novel biological therapies, represent growing immunocompromised patient populations. VPIs continue to be a concern for such patients. Underlying disease severity may limit efforts to immunize pediatric patients early in their disease process, prior to immunosuppression. Inactive vaccines are safe and immunogenic after the introduction of immunosuppression, but live vaccines are typically contraindicated. Emerging data support the safety and effectiveness of live vaccines in certain immunocompromised individuals. Care providers must remain vigilant in maintaining patients' vaccination status based on current vaccination guidelines, and create a multidisciplinary approach to optimizing vaccination. Immunocompromised children remain under-vaccinated and vulnerable to VPIs.

39671879,Aging and infectious diseases in myasthenia gravis.,"Over the past 120 years, mortality associated with myasthenia gravis (MG) has steadily decreased while the incidence of MG has increased. While mortality due to MG has been ≤5 % for at least the past 25 years, the prevalence of MG has increased. This increase in prevalence of MG may be due, in part, to improvements in diagnostics but also to an aging global population and immunosenescence as the largest increases in MG prevalence have been in patients ≥65 years old. In fact, a ""very late-onset"" subtype of MG has been proposed for patients diagnosed at or after age 65 years. These patients are predominantly anti-AChR antibody positive and thymoma negative. Preferred therapeutic options differ based on age at MG onset. Immunosenescence may play a role not only in MG etiology but also in the increased susceptibility of MG patients to infection. Immunosuppressive effects of MG therapies can also increase vulnerability to infection. Despite the improvements in MG treatment, mortality in MG patients remains higher than in the non-MG population. This is partly due to increased vulnerability to infection but also due to infection acting as a precipitating factor for MG exacerbation or crisis. The increased infection risk inherent with MG and the increased risk resulting from some therapies calls for increased diligence in monitoring and treating infections in MG patients.",Journal of the neurological sciences,2025-Jan,"Bril V, Gilhus NE",2,1386,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

32411619,Current and Future Point-of-Care Tests for Emerging and New Respiratory Viruses and Future Perspectives.,"The availability of pathogen-specific treatment options for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) increased the need for rapid diagnostic tests. Besides, retrospective studies, improved lab-based detection methods and the intensified search for new viruses since the beginning of the twenty-first century led to the discovery of several novel respiratory viruses. Among them are human bocavirus (HBoV), human coronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1, -NL63), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus type C (RV-C), and human polyomaviruses (KIPyV, WUPyV). Additionally, new viruses like SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), novel strains of influenza virus A and B, and (most recently) SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged. Although clinical presentation may be similar among different viruses, associated symptoms may range from a mild cold to a severe respiratory illness, and thus require a fast and reliable diagnosis. The increasing number of commercially available rapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) for respiratory viruses illustrates both the need for this kind of tests but also the problem, i.e., that the majority of such assays has significant limitations. In this review, we summarize recently published characteristics of POCTs and discuss their implications for the treatment of RTIs. The second key aspect of this work is a description of new and innovative diagnostic techniques, ranging from biosensors to novel portable and current lab-based nucleic acid amplification methods with the potential future use in point-of-care settings. While prototypes for some methods already exist, other ideas are still experimental, but all of them give an outlook of what can be expected as the next generation of POCTs.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2020-,"Nelson PP, Rath BA, Fragkou PC, Antalis E, Tsiodras S, Skevaki C",6,1736,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32622313,How mechanistic modelling supports decision making for the control of enzootic infectious diseases.,"Controlling enzootic diseases, which generate a large cumulative burden and are often unregulated, is needed for sustainable farming, competitive agri-food chains, and veterinary public health. We discuss the benefits and challenges of mechanistic epidemiological modelling for livestock enzootics, with particular emphasis on the need for interdisciplinary approaches. We focus on issues arising when modelling pathogen spread at various scales (from farm to the region) to better assess disease control and propose targeted options. We discuss in particular the inclusion of farmers' strategic decision-making, the integration of within-host scale to refine intervention targeting, and the need to ground models on data.",Epidemics,2020-Sep,"Ezanno P, Andraud M, Beaunée G, Hoch T, Krebs S, Rault A, Touzeau S, Vergu E, Widgren S",9,722,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32283358,Future perspectives of wastewater-based epidemiology: Monitoring infectious disease spread and resistance to the community level.,"Infectious diseases are acknowledged as one of the most critical threats to global public health today. Climate change, unprecedented population growth with accelerated rates of antimicrobial resistance, have resulted in both the emergence of novel pathogenic organisms and the re-emergence of infections that were once controlled. The consequences have led to an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases globally. The ability to rapidly monitor the spread of diseases is key for prevention, intervention and control, however several limitations exist for current surveillance systems and the capacity to cope with the rapid population growth and environmental changes. Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) is a new epidemiology tool that has potential to act as a complementary approach for current infectious disease surveillance systems and an early warning system for disease outbreaks. WBE postulates that through the analysis of population pooled wastewater, infectious disease and resistance spread, the emergence of new disease outbreak to the community level can be monitored comprehensively and in real-time. This manuscript provides critical overview of current infectious disease surveillance status, as well as it introduces WBE and its recent advancements. It also provides recommendations for further development required for WBE application as an effective tool for infectious disease surveillance.",Environment international,2020-Jun,"Sims N, Kasprzyk-Hordern B",2,1419,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We hypothesised that intrapartum antibiotic exposure is associated with the occurrence of childhood infectious diseases because it influences the development of the gut microbiome. The cohort for this population-based study comprised vaginally delivered children born in Northern Finland in 2007-2018. We used structured electronic medical records linked to comprehensive national registers. Primary outcome was the number of infectious disease episodes leading to an emergency room visit, outpatient hospital visit, or hospitalisation from birth until five years of age. Analyses were performed on 9733 children (48.8% girls) exposed to intrapartum antibiotics and on 35,842 unexposed children (49.9% girls). Exposure to intrapartum antibiotics was associated with increased risk of any infectious disease episode at the ages 7-28 days (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 1.30, 95% CI 1.10-1.54) and 1-2 years (aIRR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18). The occurrence of urinary tract infections was associated with the exposure to intrapartum antibiotics whereas the occurrence of severe infections caused by pathogens susceptible to penicillin was reversely associated with the exposure to intrapartum antibiotics. Maternal intrapartum antibiotics were associated with the occurrence of infectious diseases in the offspring. The observed associations appeared to depend on bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility to penicillin. Pediatric Research Foundation, Alma och K.A.

We applied the prioritisation method recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to rank infectious diseases, according to their relative importance for surveillance and public health, to inform future public health action in Belgium. We applied the multi-criteria-decision-analysis approach. A working group of epidemiologists and statisticians from Belgium (n = 6) designed a balanced set of prioritisation criteria. A panel of Belgian experts (n = 80) allocated in an online survey each criteria a weight, according to perceived relative importance. Next, experts (n = 37) scored each disease against each criteria in an online survey, guided by disease-specific factsheets referring the period 2010-2016 in Belgium. The weighted sum of the criteria's scores composed the final weighted score per disease, on which the ranking was based. Sensitivity analyses quantified the impact of eight alternative analysis scenarios on the top-20 ranked diseases. We identified criteria and diseases associated with data-gaps as those with the highest number of blank answers in the scoring survey. Principle components of the final weighted score were identified. Working groups selected 98 diseases and 18 criteria, structured in five criteria groups. The diseases ranked highest were (in order) pertussis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis C and hepatitis B. Among the five criteria groups, overall the highest weights were assigned to 'impact on the patient', followed by 'impact on public health', while different perceptions were identified between clinicians, microbiologists and epidemiologists. Among the 18 individual criteria, 'spreading potential' and 'events requiring public health action' were assigned the highest weights. Principle components clustered with thematic disease groups. Notable data gaps were found among hospital-related diseases. We ranked infectious diseases using a standardised reproducible approach. The diseases ranked highest are included in current public health programs, but additional reflection for example about needs among risk groups is recommended. Cross-reference of the obtained ranking with current programs is needed to verify whether resources and activities map priority areas. We recommend to implement this method in a recurrent evaluation cycle of national public health priorities.",BMC public health,2021-Jan,"Klamer S, Van Goethem N, Thomas D, Duysburgh E, Braeye T, Quoilin S",6,2478,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

After recognizing the endogenous and exogenous danger signals, NLRP3 can cause inflammation by pyroptosis and secretion of mature, bioactive forms of IL-1β and IL-18. The NLRP3 inflammasome is essential in the genesis and progression of infectious illnesses. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of the NLRP3 inflammasome in infectious diseases, focusing on its two-sided effects. As an essential part of host defense with a protective impact, abnormal NLRP3 inflammasome activation, however, result in a systemic high inflammatory response, leading to subsequent damage. In addition, scientific evidence of small molecules, biologics, and phytochemicals acting on the NLRP3 inflammasome has been reviewed. We believe that the NLRP3 inflammasome helps us understand the pathological mechanism of different stages of infectious diseases and that inhibitors targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome will become a new and valuable research direction for the treatment of infectious diseases.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2024-Aug,"Li Y, Qiang R, Cao Z, Wu Q, Wang J, Lyu W",6,1116,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

38049022,Migration in French Guiana: Implications in health and infectious diseases.,"In French Guiana, more than a third of the population, and nearly half of the adults, are of foreign origin. This immigration is explained by the French standard of living, which is attractive to nationals of surrounding countries. Infectious diseases remain in the top 10 causes of premature death, often in the most precarious populations. In this context we aimed to synthesize the state of the knowledge regarding immigration and infectious diseases in French Guiana and the general implications that follow this diagnosis. For HIV, although the majority of patients are of foreign origin, estimates of the presumed date of infection based on CD4 erosion modelling and from molecular analyses suggest that the majority of transmissions in foreign-born individuals occur in French Guiana and that the Guiana shield has been a crossroad between Latin America and the Caribbean. Among key populations bridging these regions illegal gold miners are very mobile and have the greatest proportion B Caribbean HIV viruses. Gold miners have been a key vulnerable population for falciparum malaria and other tropical diseases such as leishmaniasis, leprosy, or leptospirosis. The complex history of migrations in French Guiana and on the Guiana Shield is also reflected in the fingerprinting of mycobacterium tuberculosis and the high incidence of tuberculosis in French Guiana, notably in immigrants, reflects the incidences in the countries of origin of patients. The high burden of infectious diseases in immigrants in French Guiana is first and foremost a reflection of the precarious living conditions within French Guiana and suggests that community-based proactive interventions are crucial to reduce transmission, morbidity, and mortality from infectious diseases.",Travel medicine and infectious disease,2024-,"Nacher M, Epelboin L, Bonifay T, Djossou F, Blaizot R, Couppié P, Adenis A, Lucarelli A, Lambert Y, Schaub R, Douine M",11,1766,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38523847,Evidence-based Decision Making: Infectious Disease Modeling Training for Policymakers in East Africa.,"Mathematical modeling of infectious diseases is an important decision-making tool for outbreak control. However, in Africa, limited expertise reduces the use and impact of these tools on policy. Therefore, there is a need to build capacity in Africa for the use of mathematical modeling to inform policy. Here we describe our experience implementing a mathematical modeling training program for public health professionals in East Africa. We used a deliverable-driven and learning-by-doing model to introduce trainees to the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. The training comprised two two-week in-person sessions and a practicum where trainees received intensive mentorship. Trainees evaluated the content and structure of the course at the end of each week, and this feedback informed the strategy for subsequent weeks. Out of 875 applications from 38 countries, we selected ten trainees from three countries - Rwanda (6), Kenya (2), and Uganda (2) - with guidance from an advisory committee. Nine trainees were based at government institutions and one at an academic organization. Participants gained skills in developing models to answer questions of interest and critically appraising modeling studies. At the end of the training, trainees prepared policy briefs summarizing their modeling study findings. These were presented at a dissemination event to policymakers, researchers, and program managers. All trainees indicated they would recommend the course to colleagues and rated the quality of the training with a median score of 9/10. Mathematical modeling training programs for public health professionals in Africa can be an effective tool for research capacity building and policy support to mitigate infectious disease burden and forecast resources. Overall, the course was successful, owing to a combination of factors, including institutional support, trainees' commitment, intensive mentorship, a diverse trainee pool, and regular evaluations.",Annals of global health,2024-,"Ofori SK, Dankwa EA, Ngwakongnwi E, Amberbir A, Bekele A, Murray MB, Grad YH, Buckee CO, Hedt-Gauthier BL",9,1972,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38135583,Enduring echoes: Post-infectious long-term changes in innate immunity.,"Upon encountering pathogens, the immune system typically responds by initiating an acute and self-limiting reaction, with symptoms subsiding after the pathogen has been cleared. However, long-term post-infectious clinical symptoms can manifest months or even years after the initial infection. 'Trained immunity', the functional reprogramming of innate immune cells through epigenetic and metabolic rewiring, has been proposed as a key concept for understanding these long-term effects. Although trained immunity can result in enhanced protection against reinfection with heterologous pathogens, it can also contribute to detrimental outcomes. Persisting and excessive inflammation can cause tissue damage and aggravate immune-mediated conditions and cardiovascular complications. On the other hand, suppression of immune cell effector functions by long-lasting epigenetic changes can result in post-infectious immune paralysis. Distinct stimuli can evoke different trained immunity programs, potentially resulting in different consequences for the host. In this review, we provide an overview of both the adaptive and maladaptive consequences of infectious diseases. We discuss how long-term immune dysregulation in patients can be addressed by tailoring host-directed interventions and identify areas of scientific and therapeutic potential to advance further.",European journal of internal medicine,2024-May,"Dulfer EA, Joosten LAB, Netea MG",3,1362,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

It allows clinicians to offer the most appropriate treatment more quickly. As POCT devices have increased in accuracy and become more cost-effective, their use has grown, but a systematic assessment of their use for clinical and public health management of infectious diseases in EU/EEA countries has not been previously undertaken. <b>Methods:</b> A scoping review of the literature on POCT in EU/ EEA countries as at November 2019, and a survey of key stakeholders. <b>Results:</b> 350 relevant articles were identified and 54 survey responses from 26 EU/EEA countries were analysed. POCT is available for a range of infectious diseases and in all countries responding to the survey (for at least one disease). POCT is commonly available for influenza, HIV/AIDS, Legionnaires' disease and malaria, where it is used in at least half of EU/EEA countries. While POCT has the potential to support many improvements to clinical care of infectious diseases (e.g., faster diagnosis, more appropriate use of antimicrobials), the results suggest POCT is infrequently used to support public health functions (e.g., disease surveillance and reporting). <b>Conclusion:</b> Although POCT is in use to some extent in all EU/EEA countries, the full benefits of POCT in wider public health functions have yet to be realised.

The aim of the present study was to consider epidemiology and dynamics of FUO in countries with different economic development. The data of FUO patients hospitalized/followed between 1st July 2016 and 1st July 2021 were collected retrospectively and submitted from referral centers in 21 countries through ID-IRI clinical research platform. The countries were categorized into developing (low-income (LI) and lower middle-income (LMI) economies) and developed countries (upper middle-income (UMI) and high-income (HI) economies). This research included 788 patients. FUO diagnoses were as follows: infections (51.6%; n = 407), neoplasms (11.4%, n = 90), collagen vascular disorders (9.3%, n = 73), undiagnosed (20.1%, n = 158), miscellaneous diseases (7.7%, n = 60). The most common infections were tuberculosis (n = 45, 5.7%), brucellosis (n = 39, 4.9%), rickettsiosis (n = 23, 2.9%), HIV infection (n = 20, 2.5%), and typhoid fever (n = 13, 1.6%). Cardiovascular infections (n = 56, 7.1%) were the most common infectious syndromes. Only collagen vascular disorders were reported significantly more from developed countries (RR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.19-3.38). FUO had similar characteristics in LI/LMI and UMI/HI countries including the portion of undiagnosed cases (OR, 95% CI; 0.87 (0.65-1.15)), death attributed to FUO (RR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.65-1.15, p-value = 0.3355), and the mean duration until diagnosis (p = 0.9663).

32942143,Advances in point-of-care nucleic acid extraction technologies for rapid diagnosis of human and plant diseases.,"Global health and food security constantly face the challenge of emerging human and plant diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other pathogens. Disease outbreaks such as SARS, MERS, Swine Flu, Ebola, and COVID-19 (on-going) have caused suffering, death, and economic losses worldwide. To prevent the spread of disease and protect human populations, rapid point-of-care (POC) molecular diagnosis of human and plant diseases play an increasingly crucial role. Nucleic acid-based molecular diagnosis reveals valuable information at the genomic level about the identity of the disease-causing pathogens and their pathogenesis, which help researchers, healthcare professionals, and patients to detect the presence of pathogens, track the spread of disease, and guide treatment more efficiently. A typical nucleic acid-based diagnostic test consists of three major steps: nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and amplicon detection. Among these steps, nucleic acid extraction is the first step of sample preparation, which remains one of the main challenges when converting laboratory molecular assays into POC tests. Sample preparation from human and plant specimens is a time-consuming and multi-step process, which requires well-equipped laboratories and skilled lab personnel. To perform rapid molecular diagnosis in resource-limited settings, simpler and instrument-free nucleic acid extraction techniques are required to improve the speed of field detection with minimal human intervention. This review summarizes the recent advances in POC nucleic acid extraction technologies. In particular, this review focuses on novel devices or methods that have demonstrated applicability and robustness for the isolation of high-quality nucleic acid from complex raw samples, such as human blood, saliva, sputum, nasal swabs, urine, and plant tissues. The integration of these rapid nucleic acid preparation methods with miniaturized assay and sensor technologies would pave the road for the ""sample-in-result-out"" diagnosis of human and plant diseases, especially in remote or resource-limited settings.",Biosensors & bioelectronics,2020-Dec,"Paul R, Ostermann E, Wei Q",3,2110,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Long-term data on seven NNIDs from 2018 to 2021 were analyzed to identify trends and change points using a change point detection technique. The timings of the NPI implementations were compared to the identified change points to determine their association. Varicella, mumps, and scarlet fever showed a significant decrease in incidence following the implementation of NPIs during the COVID-19 pandemic. These diseases, which are primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, demonstrated a clear response to NPIs. However, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) showed an increasing trend unrelated to the timing of NPI implementation, suggesting the complex nature of controlling healthcare-associated infections. Hepatitis A, hepatitis C, and scrub typhus did not show significant changes associated with NPIs, likely due to their non-respiratory route of transmission. NPIs effectively controlled NNIDs, particularly those transmitted through respiratory infections. However, the impact varied depending on the disease. Understanding the effectiveness and limitations of NPIs is crucial for developing comprehensive public health strategies during infectious disease outbreaks.",The Korean journal of internal medicine,2024-Sep,"Lee HJ, Hwang BS, Im SH, Mun SK, Chang M",5,1383,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Few studies and no definite clinical guidelines for these conditions are available. The present study aimed to elucidate the causes and factors associated with prolongation of liver enzyme elevation. We also investigated actual real-world practices in Korea. A retrospective study was performed on all patients younger than 18 years, who visited six tertiary teaching hospitals around Korea in 2018 for acute infectious diseases and showed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels above 60 IU/L without other specific conditions that could cause ALT elevation. We categorized the infections that cause LFT elevation into six groups: respiratory infection, gastrointestinal infection, urinary tract infection, other febrile disease, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and cytomegalovirus infection. We collected data on the medical specialty of the attending physician who followed up the subject, follow-up duration, percentage of follow-up loss, and their investigation. A total of 613 patients were enrolled in this study, half of whom (50.7%) were younger than 12 months. The mean initial aspartate aminotransferase and ALT values were 171.2 ± 274.1 and 194.9 ± 316.1 IU/L (range 23-2,881, 60-2,949 IU/L), respectively; however, other LFTs were within the normal range. Respiratory infection was the most common diagnosis (45.0%), and rhinovirus was the most commonly identified pathogen (9.8%). The follow-up rate was higher with pediatric gastroenterologists (90.5%) and non-gastroenterology pediatricians (76.4%) than with pediatric residents and emergency doctors. Older age was related to better ALT recovery (odds ratio [OR] of age for month = 1.003; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.001-1.004; <i>P</i> = 0.004), while the number of infection episodes (OR = 0.626; 95% CI, 0.505-0.777; <i>P</i> < 0.001) was associated with poor ALT recovery. Abdominal sonography was the most commonly used diagnostic tool (36.9%), followed by the hepatotropic virus workup. The modalities of hepatitis workup were significantly differently applied by physicians based on their specialties and institutions. Abnormal liver function test after a systemic infection was common in respiratory infection and under the age of 1 year. Age, number of infections, and initial results of LFTs were related to ALT recovery time. Inter-physician, inter-institution, and inter-specialty variances were observed in real-world practice.",Journal of Korean medical science,2021-Dec,"Lee Y, Yi DY, Lee YM, Choi SY, Choi YJ, Lee KJ",6,2516,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36869834,Ophthalmic and immunopathological characterization of systemic infectious diseases in cats.,"Ocular involvement in systemic diseases is frequent in cats; however, without concurrent clinical and ophthalmic examinations with gross and/or histologic analysis of the eye, these findings can be underdiagnosed. This article aims to provide gross, histologic, and immunohistochemical characteristics of ocular lesions from cats submitted to necropsy, focusing on those caused by systemic infectious agents. Cats that died due to a systemic infectious disease were selected based on necropsy diagnosis and presence of ocular lesions. Gross, histologic, and immunohistochemical findings were recorded. From April 2018 to September 2019, 849 eyes of 428 cats were evaluated. Histologic abnormalities were seen in 29% of cases, which were classified as inflammatory (41%), neoplastic (32%), degenerative (19%), and metabolic/vascular (8%). Macroscopic changes were present in one-third of eyes with histologic lesions. Of these, 40% were attributed to inflammatory or neoplastic diseases associated with infectious agents. The most important infectious agents causing ocular disease in this study were feline leukemia virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and <i>Cryptococcus</i> sp. The most common ocular abnormalities associated with infectious agents were uveitis (anterior, posterior, or panuveitis), optic neuritis, and meningitis of the optic nerve. Ocular lesions secondary to systemic infections in cats are frequent; however, these are not always diagnosed because gross lesions are less common than histologic lesions. Therefore, both gross and histologic evaluation of the eyes of cats is recommended, mainly for cases in which the clinical suspicion or necropsy diagnosis suggests that an infectious agent might be related to the cause of death.",Veterinary pathology,2023-May,"Wronski JG, de Cecco BS, Raiter J, Henker LC, de Lorenzo C, Bandinelli MB, Driemeier D, Pavarini SP, Sonne L",9,1762,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34892274,Design of Novel End-effectors for Robot-assisted Swab Sampling to Combat Respiratory Infectious Diseases.,"The COVID-19 outbreak has caused the mortality worldwide and the use of swab sampling is a common way of screening and diagnosis. To combat respiratory infectious diseases and assist sampling, robots have been utilized and shown promising potentials. Nonetheless, a safe, patient-friendly, and low-cost swabbing system would be crucial for the practical implementation of robots in hospitals or inspection stations. In this study, we proposed two recyclable and cost-efficient end-effector designs that can be equipped at the distal end of a robot to passively regulate or actively sense the force exerted onto patients. One way is to introduce passive compliant mechanisms with soft material to increase the flexibility of the swabbing system, while the other way is utilizing a force-sensing gripper with embedded optoelectronic sensors to actively sense the force or torque. The proposed designs were modelled computationally and tested experimentally. It is identified that the passive compliant mechanisms can increase the flexibility of the swabbing system when subjected to the lateral force and mitigate the vertical force resulted from buckling. The lateral force range that the force-sensing gripper can detect is 0-0.35 N and the vertical force range causing buckling effect that can be sensed by gripper is 1.5-2.5 N.",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

38447267,The clinical applications of immunosequencing.,"Technological advances in high-throughput sequencing have opened the door for the interrogation of adaptive immune responses at unprecedented scale. It is now possible to determine the sequences of antibodies or T-cell receptors produced by individual B and T cells in a sample. This capability, termed immunosequencing, has transformed the study of both infectious and non-infectious diseases by allowing the tracking of dynamic changes in B and T cell clonal populations over time. This has improved our understanding of the pathology of cancers, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases. However, to date there has been only limited clinical adoption of the technology. Advances over the last decade and on the horizon that reduce costs and improve interpretability could enable widespread clinical use. Many clinical applications have been proposed and, while most are still undergoing research and development, some methods relying on immunosequencing data have been implemented, the most widespread of which is the detection of measurable residual disease. Here, we review the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic applications of immunosequencing for both infectious and non-infectious diseases.",Current research in translational medicine,2024-Sep,"Bardwell B, Bay J, Colburn Z",3,1208,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37015800,Health inequalities in infectious diseases: a systematic overview of reviews.,"The aim of this systematic overview of reviews was to synthesise available evidence on inequalities in infectious disease based on three dimensions of inequalities; inclusion health groups, protected characteristics and socioeconomic inequalities. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and OpenGrey databases in November 2021. We included reviews published from the year 2000 which examined inequalities in the incidence, prevalence or consequences of infectious diseases based on the dimensions of interest. Our search focused on tuberculosis, HIV, sexually transmitted infections, hepatitis C, vaccination and antimicrobial resistance. However, we also included eligible reviews of any other infectious diseases. We appraised the quality of reviews using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews V.2 (AMSTAR2) checklist. We conducted a narrative data synthesis. We included 108 reviews in our synthesis covering all the dimensions of inequalities for most of the infectious disease topics of interest, however the quality and volume of review evidence and consistency of their findings varied. The existing literature reviews provide strong evidence that people in inclusion health groups and lower socioeconomic status are consistently at higher risk of infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance and incomplete/delayed vaccination. In the protected characteristics dimension, ethnicity, and sexual orientation are important factors contributing to inequalities across the various infectious disease topics included in this overview of reviews. We identified many reviews that provide evidence of various types of health inequalities in different infectious diseases, vaccination, and antimicrobial resistance. We also highlight areas where reviews may be lacking. The commonalities in the associations and their directions suggest it might be worth targeting interventions for some high risk-groups that may have benefits across multiple infectious disease outcomes rather than operating purely in infectious disease siloes.",BMJ open,2023-Apr,"Ayorinde A, Ghosh I, Ali I, Zahair I, Olarewaju O, Singh M, Meehan E, Anjorin SS, Rotheram S, Barr B, McCarthy N, Oyebode O",12,2042,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38904125,Mapping the evidence on integrated service delivery for non-communicable and infectious disease comorbidity in sub-Saharan Africa: protocol for a scoping review.,"The concurrent occurrence of infectious diseases (IDs) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) presents complex healthcare challenges in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where healthcare systems often grapple with limited resources. While an integrated care approach has been advocated to address these complex challenges, there is a recognised gap in comprehensive evidence regarding the various models of integrated care, their components and the feasibility of their implementation. This scoping review aims to bridge this gap by examining the breadth and nature of evidence on integrated care models for NCDs and IDs within SSA, thereby updating the current evidence base in the domain. Based on the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) framework for scoping reviews, this study will include peer-reviewed and grey literature reporting on integrated care models for NCD-ID comorbidities in SSA. A comprehensive search of published sources in electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Health System Evidence and Research4Life) and grey literature (Google Scholar, EBSCO Open Dissertations and relevant organisational websites) will be conducted to identify sources of information reported in English from 2018 onwards. The review will consider sources of evidence reporting on integrated care model for NCDs such as diabetes; chronic cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney diseases; cancers; epilepsy; and mental illness, and comorbid IDs such as HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. All sources of evidence will be considered irrespective of the study designs or methods used. The review will exclude sources that solely focus on the differentiated or patient-centred care delivery approach, and that focus on other conditions, populations or settings. The reviewers will independently screen the sources for eligibility and extract data using a JBI-adapted data tool on the Parsifal review platform. Data will be analysed using descriptive and thematic analyses and results will be presented in tables, figures, diagrams and a narrative summary. Ethical approval is not required for this review as it will synthesise published data and does not involve human participants. The final report will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The findings will be used to inform future research.

Acute respiratory viral diseases claim over 4 million deaths and cause millions of hospitalizations in developing countries every year. Emerging viruses, especially the RNA viruses, are more pathogenic since most people have no herd immunity. The RNA viruses can adapt to the rapidly changing global and local environment due to the high error rate of their polymerases that replicate their genomes. Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is determined as an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan.

33917745,Mitigating Future Respiratory Virus Pandemics: New Threats and Approaches to Consider.,"Despite many recent efforts to predict and control emerging infectious disease threats to humans, we failed to anticipate the zoonotic viruses which led to pandemics in 2009 and 2020. The morbidity, mortality, and economic costs of these pandemics have been staggering. We desperately need a more targeted, cost-efficient, and sustainable strategy to detect and mitigate future zoonotic respiratory virus threats. Evidence suggests that the transition from an animal virus to a human pathogen is incremental and requires a considerable number of spillover events and considerable time before a pandemic variant emerges. This evolutionary view argues for the refocusing of public health resources on novel respiratory virus surveillance at human-animal interfaces in geographical hotspots for emerging infectious diseases. Where human-animal interface surveillance is not possible, a secondary high-yield, cost-efficient strategy is to conduct novel respiratory virus surveillance among pneumonia patients in these same hotspots. When novel pathogens are discovered, they must be quickly assessed for their human risk and, if indicated, mitigation strategies initiated. In this review, we discuss the most common respiratory virus threats, current efforts at early emerging pathogen detection, and propose and defend new molecular pathogen discovery strategies with the goal of preempting future pandemics.",Viruses,2021-Apr,"Gray GC, Robie ER, Studstill CJ, Nunn CL",4,1405,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

36925106,Over-interpretation of findings in diagnostic accuracy studies of infectious diseases.,"To assess the prevalence of overly positive interpretation, also called 'spin',-of results in diagnostic accuracy studies of infectious diseases and to identify suggestions for improvement. A PubMed search was performed to identify diagnostic accuracy studies of infectious diseases published between January and March 2019. Each article was assessed by two authors independently to identify study characteristics and forms of actual and potential over-interpretation. 'Actual over-interpretation' was defined as conclusions that were not on the basis of study aims or conclusions that were more favourable than justified by the study findings. There are other practices that may result in the over-interpretation of study findings and these have been described as 'potential over-interpretation'. The final analysis included 120 studies. Favourable or promising recommendations were made in the main text of 101 (84%) of the included studies. Evidence of actual over-interpretation (spin) was found in 30 (25%) articles, with 22 (18%) studies reporting a conclusion that did not match the study aims and 56 (47%) studies with a more positive conclusion in the abstract than the main text. All analysed studies exhibited at least one form of potential over-interpretation, with was most commonly a lack of sample size calculation (n = 109, 91%) and not reporting a null hypothesis (n = 115, 96%). Evidence of over-interpretation of results was found in one-third of the included studies.

Specialist isolation facilities to provide safe and effective care have been present since that time. Following the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and the avian influenza A (H7N9) outbreak in 2013, and the 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa, clinical and public health preparedness and response pathways in England have been strengthened for these types of diseases, now called high-consequence infectious diseases (HCIDs). The HCID program, led by NHS England and Public Health England between 2016 and 2018, helped to deliver these enhancements, which have since been used on multiple occasions for new UK cases and outbreaks of MERS, mpox, avian influenza, and Lassa fever. Additionally, HCID pathways were activated for COVID-19 during the first 3 months of 2020, before the pandemic had been declared and little was known about COVID-19 but HCID status had been assigned temporarily to COVID-19 as a precaution. The HCID program also led to the commissioning of a network of new airborne HCID treatment centers in England, to supplement the existing network of contact HCID treatment centers, which includes the United Kingdom's only 2 high-level isolation units. In this case study, the authors describe the airborne and contact HCID treatment center networks in England, including their formation and structures, their approach to safe and effective clinical management of patients with HCIDs in the United Kingdom, and challenges they may face going forward.",Health security,2024-Sep,"Alonso A, Cohen J, Cole J, Emonts M, Karunaharan N, Meadows C, O'Hara G, Owens S, Payne B, Porter D, Ratcliffe L, Riordan A, Schmid ML, Sinha R, Tunbridge A, Whittaker E, Beadsworth M, Dunning J",18,1721,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35246236,"Epidemiological characteristics of imported respiratory infectious diseases in China, 2014‒2018.","With the progress of globalization, international mobility increases, greatly facilitating cross-border transmission of respiratory infectious diseases (RIDs). This study aimed to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and factors influencing imported RIDs, with the goal of providing evidence to support adoption of high-tech, intelligent methods to early find imported RIDs and prevent their spread in China. We obtained data of imported RIDs cases from 2014 to 2018 from the Inbound Sentinel Network of Customs and the National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System in China. We analyzed spatial, temporal, and population distribution characteristics of the imported RIDs. We developed an index to describe seasonality. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine associations between independent variables and imported cases. Data analyses and visualizations were conducted with R software. From a total of 1 409 265 253 inbound travelers, 31 732 (2.25/100 000) imported RIDs cases were reported. RIDs cases were imported from 142 countries and five continents. The incidence of imported RIDs was nearly 5 times higher in 2018 (2.81/100 000) than in 2014 (0.58/100 000). Among foreigners, incidence rates were higher among males (5.32/100 000), 0-14-year-olds (15.15/100 000), and cases originating in Oceania (11.10/100 000). The vast majority (90.3%) of imported RIDs were influenza, with seasonality consistent with annual seasonality of influenza. The spatial distribution of imported RIDs was different between Chinese citizens and foreigners. Increases in inbound travel volume and the number of influenza cases in source countries were associated with the number of imported RIDs. Our study documented importation of RIDs into China from 142 countries. Inbound travel poses a significant risks bringing important RIDs to China. It is urgent to strengthen surveillance at customs of inbound travelers and establish an intelligent surveillance and early warning system to prevent importation of RIDs to China for preventing further spread within China.",Infectious diseases of poverty,2022-Mar,"Wang JL, Chen T, Deng LL, Han YJ, Wang DY, Wang LP, He GX",7,2075,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Predicting which pathogen species are most likely to emerge in the future is an important challenge for infectious disease surveillance and intelligence. We used a machine learning approach to conduct a data-driven horizon scan of bacterial associations at the wildlife-livestock interface for cows, sheep, and pigs. Our model identified and ranked from 76 to 189 potential novel bacterial species that might associate with each livestock species. Wildlife reservoirs of known and novel bacteria were shared among all three species, suggesting that targeting surveillance and/or control efforts towards these reservoirs could contribute disproportionately to reducing spillover risk to livestock.

Emerging findings suggest that non-communicable diseases are linked to early and chronic environmental exposures. However, the rapid globalisation in developing countries, environmental change and the emergence, spread, persistence and severity of infectious diseases are not yet well understood. The aim of this study is to understand which environmental toxicants are commonly associated with infectious diseases in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). A total of four electronic databases, MEDLINE through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) be searched to identify relevant studies and will be screened by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool for randomised control trials (RCTs) and ROB assessment tool for non-randomised studies for non-RCTs will be used to assess the ROB. A meta-analysis will be used to determine the pooled effect if we find out the included articles have similar environmental exposure, participant groups, study design and outcome measures. A narrative synthesis of the findings will be provided, along with summaries of the intervention effect. Heterogeneity between the studies will be assessed, and sensitivity analysis will be conducted based on study quality. Findings will be summarised in a single manuscript. This review attempts to explore the pivotal role of environmental toxicants in predisposing, developing, persistent and severity of infectious diseases in LMICs. Findings from this study will highlight the effects of individual environmental toxicants' role on infectious disease outcomes for the early prevention and limit toxic exposure to guide individual, community, and occupational health policy for future strategies.

33283238,"Epidemiology of imported infectious diseases, China, 2014-18.","The frequent movement of population between countries brings an increasing number of travel-related infections. This study aims to define the spectrum and dynamics of imported infections observed from international travel in the Chinese mainland. Sick travellers were screened by inbound sentinel surveillance and post-travel clinic visits from 2014 to 18. The infections were classified as respiratory, gastrointestinal, vector-borne, blood/sexually transmitted and mucocutaneous. The analysed variables included the place of origin of the travellers (Chinese or foreign) and the time when travel-related infection was present (at the time of return, during travel and post-travel visits to the clinic). In total, 58 677 cases were identified amongst 1 409 265 253 travellers, with an incidence of 41.64/million, comprising during-travel incidence of 27.44/million and a post-travel incidence of 14.20/million. Respiratory infections constituted the highest proportion of illnesses during travel (81.19%, 31 393 of 38 667), which mainly came from Asian countries and tourists; with influenza virus and rhinovirus infections being mainly diagnosed. Vector-borne diseases constituted the highest proportion of post-travel illnesses (98.14%, 19 638 of 20 010), which were mainly diagnosed from African countries and labourers; with malaria and dengue fever being mainly diagnosed. The differential infection spectrum varied in terms of the traveller's demography, travel destination and travel purpose. As such, a higher proportion of foreign travellers had blood/sexually transmitted diseases (89.85%, 2832 of 3152), while Chinese citizens had a higher prevalence of vector-borne diseases (85.98%, 19 247 of 22 387) and gastrointestinal diseases (79.36%, 1115 of 1405). The highest incidence rate was observed amongst travellers arriving from Africa, while the lowest was observed amongst travellers arriving from Europe.

Additionally, to describe an accompanying opt-out antimicrobial stewardship approach that addresses provider nonresponsiveness. Prospective audit and feedback is recommended by antimicrobial stewardship guidelines; however, execution can be difficult due to labor requirements, delays in communication, and provider nonparticipation. The Norton E-ASP was developed to address these issues by reliably identifying target patients, documenting assessments, streamlining recommendation delivery, promoting handoff, and providing automated tracking of recommendation responses. Opt-out stewardship allows recommendations to be implemented if not rejected after 24 hours. A 25% reduction in target antimicrobial use has been achieved and sustained with the program. Use of the Norton E-ASP, including opt-out antimicrobial stewardship, broadened the reach and furthered the impact of infectious diseases pharmacists. Successes of this program justified addition of 3 full-time infectious diseases pharmacist positions at a large community health system.

Infection screening programmes across Europe work in disease silos with a focus on individual diseases at the time of arrival. We argue that European health-care practitioners and policy makers would benefit from developing a framework of universal health care for migrants, which proactively offers early testing and vaccinations by delivering multi-disease testing and catch-up vaccination programmes integrated within existing health systems. Such interventions should be codeveloped with migrant populations to overcome barriers faced in accessing services.

Here, we report the epidemiological features and changes in notifiable infectious diseases in China from 1986 to 2016 to explore the factors contributing to the successful control of infectious diseases and the challenges faced in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. The data of notifiable infectious diseases in China from 1986 to 2016 were collected from the monthly analysis report of the National Infectious Disease Surveillance System. Joinpoint regression models were used to examine incidence and mortality trends from 1986 to 2016. IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0, Excel 2010 and R x64 3.5.2 were used for data analysis. A total of 132 858 005 cases of notifiable infectious diseases were reported over these 31 years, with an average yearly incidence of 342.14/100 000. There were 284 694 deaths with an average yearly mortality rate of 0.73/100 000. The overall incidence and overall mortality of notifiable infectious diseases both showed a ""U"" distribution (ie, a decrease, stable, an increase, stable again).

We used household survey cross-sectional data on children 2-4 years old and logistic regression models estimating ORs between functional difficulties and symptoms of infectious diseases including diarrhoea, fever and acute respiratory infection (ARI), adjusted for sex, age and stunting. We also examined whether caregivers sought advice or treatment for the illness from any source and if the child was given any treatment for the illness. There was an increased risk of fever among children with functional difficulty (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8) and children with severe functional difficulty (AOR=1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.7). Children with severe functional difficulty were also at increased risk of diarrhoea (AOR=1.8, 95% CI=1.1 to 3.3). There were no significant differences in seeking advice or treatment for diarrhoea, fever or ARI symptoms between the groups. In Sierra Leone, children with functional difficulties, especially severe functional difficulties, more often have symptoms of major childhood diseases that are known to increase under-5 mortality.",BMJ paediatrics open,2024-Jun,"Ekman AT, Cherry E, Sengeh P, Webber N, Jalloh MB, Orsini N, Alfvén T, Frielingsdorf Lundqvist H",8,1435,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

In this review, we provided the updated studies on BMVs including their production, their types, and therapeutic regimens for treating infectious diseases and cancers. We described several platforms of BMVs, such as outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), inner membrane vesicles (IMVs) and double membrane vesicles (DMVs), and those structures were produced from Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria. We also discussed how to engineer and formulate new and novel BMVs using chemical, physical, and genetic methods. For therapies, we analyzed current methods for loading drugs in BMVs and discussed their limitations. Finally, we reviewed several therapeutic platforms of BMVs that have been exploited in improving the treatments of infectious diseases and cancers. Although BMVs offer the promising biomedical applications, it is needed to develop rigorous approaches and methods to generate reproducible and scalable drug delivery systems for translation.",Advanced drug delivery reviews,2022-Jul,"Gao J, Su Y, Wang Z",3,1121,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38825457,"Re-Emerging, Under-Recognized Zoonotic, and Neglected Tropical Diseases in Hawai'i.","Hawai'i, the United States' most western geographic state in the Pacific, lies between the North and South American continents and the Indo-Pacific regions, including Japan. The tropical environmental conditions of the Hawaiian Islands provide favorable ecosystems for various infectious pathogens, their vectors, and reservoirs. This creates an environment conducive to the transmission of zoonotic diseases affecting both humans and animals. Hawai'i has experienced an increase in dengue, leptospirosis, and murine typhus outbreaks. Furthermore, toxoplasmosis and neuroangiostrongyliasis cases remain prevalent throughout the state, and the putative presence of autochthonous Zika cases identified in a retrospective study may be of national public health concern. Understanding the factors that affect the transmission and distribution of zoonoses is necessary to identify at-risk locations and populations. The One Health approach seeks to understand, report, and interpret these factors and requires collaboration between private and governmental institutions. One Health should focus on neglected tropical diseases (NTD) and prioritize development of interventions to control and prevent the transmission of diseases that spread between animals and humans. This review focuses on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of under-recognized zoonotic and NTD affecting Hawai'i, including leptospirosis, murine typhus, neuroangiostrongyliasis, toxoplasmosis, dengue, and Zika.",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,2024-Jul,"Zorilla R, Ching LL, Elisara T, Kramer K, Nerurkar VR",5,1488,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Increased travel and trade, growing population density, changes in urbanization, and climate have a critical impact on infectious disease spread. Currently, the world is confronted with the emergence of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, responsible for yet more than 800 000 deaths globally. Outbreaks caused by viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, HIV, Ebola, influenza, and Zika, have increased over the past decade, underlining the need for a rapid development of diagnostics and vaccines. Hence, the rational identification of biomarkers for diagnostic measures on the one hand, and antigenic targets for vaccine development on the other, are of utmost importance. Peptide microarrays can display large numbers of putative target proteins translated into overlapping linear (and cyclic) peptides for a multiplexed, high-throughput antibody analysis. This enabled for example the identification of discriminant/diagnostic epitopes in Zika or influenza and mapping epitope evolution in natural infections versus vaccinations. In this review, we highlight synthesis platforms that facilitate fast and flexible generation of high-density peptide microarrays. We further outline the multifaceted applications of these peptide array platforms for the development of serological tests and vaccines to quickly encounter pandemic threats.",Journal of proteome research,2020-Nov,"Heiss K, Heidepriem J, Fischer N, Weber LK, Dahlke C, Jaenisch T, Loeffler FF",7,1427,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

However, based on current knowledge about drivers of disease emergence, we show that High Asia is rapidly developing conditions that favor increased emergence of infectious diseases and zoonoses. This is because of the existing prevalence of potentially serious pathogens in the system; intensifying environmental degradation; rapid changes in local ecological, socio-ecological, and socio-economic factors; and global risk intensifiers such as climate change and globalization. To better understand and manage the risks posed by diseases to humans, livestock, and wildlife, there is an urgent need for establishing a disease surveillance system and improving human and animal health care.

34799142,"Meeting report: CEPI consultation on accelerating access to novel vaccines against emerging infectious diseases for pregnant and lactating women, London, 12-13 February 2020.","Infectious diseases may cause serious morbidity and mortality in pregnant women, their foetuses, and infants; the risk associated with any newly emerging infectious disease (EID) is likely unknown at the time of its emergence. While the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic shows that the development of vaccines against new pathogens can be considerably accelerated, the immunization of pregnant women generally lags behind the general population. Guided by the priority pathogen list for WHO's R&D Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics, this workshop sought to define the evidence needed for use of vaccines against EIDs in pregnant and lactating women, using Lassa fever as a model. Close to 60 maternal immunization (MI) and vaccine safety experts, regulators, vaccine developers, Lassa fever experts, and investigators from Lassa-affected countries examined the critical steps for vaccine development and immunization decisions for pregnant and lactating women. This paper reports on key themes and recommendations from the workshop. Current practice still assumes the exclusion of pregnant women from early vaccine trials. A shift in paradigm is needed to progress towards initial inclusion of pregnant women in Phase 2 and 3 trials. Several practical avenues were delineated. Participants agreed that vaccine platforms should be assessed early for their suitability for maternal immunization. It was noted that, in some cases, nonclinical data derived from assessing a given platform using other antigens may be adequate evidence to proceed to a first clinical evaluation and that concurrence from regulators may be sought with supporting rationale. For clinical trials, essential prerequisites such as documenting the disease burden in pregnant women, study site infrastructure, capabilities, and staff experience were noted. Early and sustained communication with the local community was considered paramount in any program for the conduct of MI trials and planned vaccine introduction.",Vaccine,2021-Dec,"Voss G, Jacquet JM, Tornieporth N, Kampmann B, Karron R, Meulen AS, Chen R, Gruber M, Lurie N, Weller C, Cramer JP, Saville M, Darko M",13,1990,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This study assessed the diagnostic value of mNGS in infections and explored the effect of various factors on the accuracy of mNGS. An electronic article search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase was performed. A total of 85 papers were eligible for inclusion and analysis. Stata 12.0 was used for statistical calculation to evaluate the efficacy of mNGS for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. The AUC of 85 studies was 0.88 (95%CI, 0.85-0.90). The AUC of the clinical comprehensive diagnosis and conventional test groups was 0.92 (95%CI, 0.89-0.94) and 0.82 (95%CI, 0.78-0.85), respectively.

Numerical simulations are deployed to account for the many factors influencing the spreading dynamics. Yet, the results from numerical simulations are often as complicated as the reality, leaving us with a sense of confusion about how the different factors account for the simulation results. Here, using a multitype branching together with a graph tensor product approach, I derive a single equation for the effective reproductive number of an infectious disease outbreak. Using this equation I deconvolute the impact of crowd management, targeted testing, contact heterogeneity, stratified vaccination, mask use, and smartphone tracing app use.

A narrative review was conducted, overviewing items of the Infectious Disease Committee and the Tuberculosis Committee of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare between 2010 and 2019. The mean value of items discussed in each meeting were 9.7 items. Among these items, these committees have discussed about countermeasures in terms of reduced burden of indigenous infectious diseases such as measles, rubella and pertussis, and increased risk of imported infectious diseases such as Ebola virus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, plague, avian influenza, pandemic influenza and tuberculosis. These changes regarding infectious diseases lead to loss of target population, difficulty of early detection, and market failure in old and new antibiotics and others, which requires challenge to scattered at-risk targets, effort to training and awareness, and creation of novel public health policy for research and development as well as production and supply. Over the past decade, public health policy regarding global infectious diseases have been one of the key targets under the triangle of global infectious disease, and recent experience of Coronavirus disease 2019 will further prioritize it in Japan. However, the principles of public health policy are globally vulnerable in the Post-Corona era, which can lead to the collapse of democratic way.

38047835,Key Contributions by the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute Towards New and Better Drugs for Tropical Diseases.,"Thanks to its expertise in clinical research, epidemiology, infectious diseases, microbiology, parasitology, public health, translational research and tropical medicine, coupled with deeply rooted partnerships with institutions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) has been a key contributor in many drug research and development consortia involving academia, pharma and product development partnerships. Our know-how of the maintenance of parasites and their life-cycles in the laboratory, plus our strong ties to research centres and disease control programme managers in LMICs with access to field sites and laboratories, have enabled systems for drug efficacy testing in vitro and in vivo, clinical research, and modelling to support the experimental approaches. Thus, Swiss TPH has made fundamental contributions towards the development of new drugs - and the better use of old drugs - for neglected tropical diseases and infectious diseases of poverty, such as Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, food-borne trematodiasis (e.g. clonorchiasis, fascioliasis and opisthorchiasis), human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, malaria, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiasis and tuberculosis.

39127773,Assessing vaccine efficacy for infectious diseases with variable immunity using a mathematical model.,"This study introduces an SIRS compartmental mathematical model encompassing vaccination and variable immunity periods for infectious diseases. I derive a basic reproduction number formula and assess the local and global stability of disease-free and the local stability of the endemic equilibria. I demonstrate that the basic reproduction number in the presence of a vaccine is highly sensitive to the rate of immunity loss, and even a slight reduction in this rate can significantly contribute to disease control. Additionally, I have derived a formula to calculate the critical efficacy period required for a vaccine to effectively manage and control the disease.The analysis conducted for the model suggests that increasing the vaccine's immunity duration (efficacy) decelerates disease dynamics, leading to reduced rates of reinfection and less severe disease outcomes. Furthermore, this delay contributes to a decrease in the basic reproduction number ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><msub><mi>R</mi> <mn>0</mn></msub> </math> ), thus facilitating more rapid disease control efforts.",Scientific reports,2024-Aug,Al-Arydah M,1,1107,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Some studies have shown that the incidence of respiratory and intestinal infectious diseases in 2020 decreased significantly compared with previous years. Interrupted time series (ITS) is a time series analysis method that evaluates the impact of intervention measures on outcomes and can control the original regression trend of outcomes before and after the intervention. This study aimed to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on the incidence rate of notifiable communicable diseases using ITS in China. National data on the incidence rate of communicable diseases in 2009-2021 were obtained from the National Health Commission website. Interrupted time series analysis using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models was used to analyse the changes in the incidence rate of infectious diseases before and after the COVID-19 epidemic. There was a significant short-term decline in the incidence rates of respiratory infectious diseases and enteric infectious diseases (step values of -29.828 and - 8.237, respectively), which remained at a low level for a long time after the decline. There was a short-term decline in the incidence rates of blood-borne and sexually transmitted infectious diseases (step = -3.638), which tended to recover to previous levels in the long term (ramp = 0.172). There was no significant change in the incidence rate of natural focus diseases or arboviral diseases before and after the epidemic. The COVID-19 epidemic had strong short-term and long-term effects on respiratory and intestinal infectious diseases and short-term control effects on blood-borne and sexually transmitted infectious diseases.

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has become popular as a new tool for pathogen diagnosis with numerous advantages compared to conventional methods. Recently, research on mNGS increases yearly. However, no bibliometric analysis has systematically presented the full spectrum of this research field. Therefore, we reviewed all the publications associated with this topic and performed this study to analyze the comprehensive status and future hotspots of mNGS for infectious disease diagnosis. The literature was searched in the Web of Science Core Collection and screened without year or language restrictions, and the characteristics of the studies were also identified. The outcomes included publication years, study types, journals, countries, authorship, institutions, frontiers, and hotspots with trends.

33095583,Utility of Proteomics in Emerging and Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases Caused by RNA Viruses.,"Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to RNA viruses cause major negative consequences for the quality of life, public health, and overall economic development. Most of the RNA viruses causing illnesses in humans are of zoonotic origin. Zoonotic viruses can directly be transferred from animals to humans through adaptation, followed by human-to-human transmission, such as in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, more recently, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or they can be transferred through insects or vectors, as in the case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and dengue virus (DENV). At the present, there are no vaccines or antiviral compounds against most of these viruses. Because proteins possess a vast array of functions in all known biological systems, proteomics-based strategies can provide important insights into the investigation of disease pathogenesis and the identification of promising antiviral drug targets during an epidemic or pandemic. Mass spectrometry technology has provided the capacity required for the precise identification and the sensitive and high-throughput analysis of proteins on a large scale and has contributed greatly to unravelling key protein-protein interactions, discovering signaling networks, and understanding disease mechanisms. In this Review, we present an account of quantitative proteomics and its application in some prominent recent examples of emerging and re-emerging RNA virus diseases like HIV-1, CCHFV, ZIKV, and DENV, with more detail with respect to coronaviruses (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) as well as the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",Journal of proteome research,2020-Nov,"Sperk M, van Domselaar R, Rodriguez JE, Mikaeloff F, Sá Vinhas B, Saccon E, Sönnerborg A, Singh K, Gupta S, Végvári Á, Neogi U",11,1761,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

33382077,The Swiss STAR trial - an evaluation of target groups for sexually transmitted infection screening in the sub-sample of men.,"In Switzerland, universal health insurance does not cover any routine testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), not even in individuals at high risk, and extra-genital swabbing is not standard of care. We determined the prevalence and incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), viral hepatitis and non-viral STIs in a multicentre prospective observational cohort of multi-partner men who have sex with men (MSM) and other men. Between January 2016 and June 2017, we offered free STI testing to all men with multiple&nbsp; sexual partners (three or more in the previous 12 months), with follow-up examinations every 6 months. We used multiplex polymerase chain-reaction testing (for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium) on pooled swabs (pharynx, urethra/vagina, anus), and antibody tests for HIV and Treponema pallidum at every visit, and for hepatitis B/C at baseline. We screened 779 multi-partner MSM and 92 other men. Previously undiagnosed HIV was found in 0.5% vs 0.0%, respectively and T. pallidum antibodies in 15.3% vs 1.1%. STIs requiring antibiotic treatment comprised: active syphilis 1.7% vs 0.0%; N. gonorrhoeae 10.3% vs 0.0%; C. trachomatis 8.7% vs 1.1%. One in four MSM versus 1 in 100 other multi-partner men had any of these three STIs at baseline. 10.4% vs 1.3% had a history of hepatitis B, 31.9% vs 47.3% had no immunity (HBs-AB &lt;10 IU/l). Ten MSM had HCV antibodies (1.4%), with 8 out of the 10 being MSM with HIV; HCV seroprevalence was 0.3% among HIV-negative MSM. In MSM, incidence of the three bacterial STIs was 25.5 per year over 333 person years of follow-up, HIV incidence was 0.3%.

35346126,Determinants of multimorbidity of infectious diseases among under-five children in Bangladesh: role of community context.,"The presence of more than one morbid condition among children has become a global public health concern. Studies carried out in Bangladesh have primarily focused on diarrhoea and acute respiratory tract infections independently without considering their co-occurrence effect. The present study examines the multimorbid conditions of infectious diseases in under-five Bangladeshi children. It explores multimorbidity determinants and the role of community context, which are often overlooked in previous literature. Utilizing the most recent Demographic and Health Survey of Bangladesh (2017-18), we used mixed-effects random-intercept Poisson regression models to understand the determinants of multimorbidity of infectious diseases in under-five Bangladeshi children considering the community-level characteristics. The present study found that 28% of the children experienced multimorbidity two weeks prior to the survey. Community-level variability across all the statistical models was statistically significant at the 5% level. On average, the incidence rate of multimorbidity was 1.34 times higher among children from high-risk communities than children from low-risk communities. Moreover, children residing in rural areas and other urban areas involved 1.29 [CI: 1.11, 1.51] and 1.28 [CI: 1.11, 1.47] times greater risk of multimorbidity respectively compared to children from city corporations. Additionally, the multimorbidity incidence was 1.16 times [CI: 1.03, 1.30] higher among children from high-altitude communities than children living in low-altitude communities. The significant effect of public handwashing places suggests community-based interventions among individuals to learn hygiene habits among themselves, thus, the severity of coexistence nature of infectious diseases. A higher incidence of coexistence of such infectious diseases in the poor and semi-urban populace further recommends a targeted awareness of a clean environment and primary healthcare programmes.",BMC pediatrics,2022-Mar,"Rashmi R, Paul R",2,1993,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

While there are still many obstacles to their implementation, there are also multiple examples of their major advantages compared with previous methods. Their main advantage is that a single determination allows epidemiological information on the causative microorganism to be obtained simultaneously, as well as its resistance profile, although these advantages vary according to the pathogen under study.

In some disease areas multiple screens of corporate and other libraries have been carried out, giving rise to some valuable starting points and leading to preclinical candidates. Whilst in other disease areas, little screening has been carried out. Much screening against pathogens has been conducted phenotypically as there are few robustly validated protein targets. However, many of the active compound series identified share the same molecular targets. To address the need for new chemical material, in this article we describe the design of a new library, designed for screening in drug discovery programmes for neglected infectious diseases. The compounds have been selected from the Enamine REAL (REadily AccessibLe) library, a virtual library which contains approximately 4.5 billion molecules. The molecules theoretically can be synthesized quickly using commercially available intermediates and building blocks. The vast majority of these have not been prepared before, so this is a source of novel compounds. In this paper we describe the design of a diverse library of 30,000 compounds from this collection (graphical abstract). The new library will be made available to laboratories working in neglected infectious diseases, subject to a review process.

38378653,Nanotechnology's frontier in combatting infectious and inflammatory diseases: prevention and treatment.,"Inflammation-associated diseases encompass a range of infectious diseases and non-infectious inflammatory diseases, which continuously pose one of the most serious threats to human health, attributed to factors such as the emergence of new pathogens, increasing drug resistance, changes in living environments and lifestyles, and the aging population. Despite rapid advancements in mechanistic research and drug development for these diseases, current treatments often have limited efficacy and notable side effects, necessitating the development of more effective and targeted anti-inflammatory therapies. In recent years, the rapid development of nanotechnology has provided crucial technological support for the prevention, treatment, and detection of inflammation-associated diseases. Various types of nanoparticles (NPs) play significant roles, serving as vaccine vehicles to enhance immunogenicity and as drug carriers to improve targeting and bioavailability. NPs can also directly combat pathogens and inflammation. In addition, nanotechnology has facilitated the development of biosensors for pathogen detection and imaging techniques for inflammatory diseases. This review categorizes and characterizes different types of NPs, summarizes their applications in the prevention, treatment, and detection of infectious and inflammatory diseases. It also discusses the challenges associated with clinical translation in this field and explores the latest developments and prospects.

37828249,Malaria & mRNA Vaccines: A Possible Salvation from One of the Most Relevant Infectious Diseases of the Global South.,"Malaria is one of the most dangerous infectious diseases in the world. It occurs in tropical and subtropical regions and affects about 40% of the world´s population. In endemic regions, an estimated 200 million people contract malaria each year. Three-quarters of all global deaths (about 600 per year) are children under 5 years of age. Thus, malaria is one of the most relevant tropical and also childhood diseases in the world. Thanks to various public health measures such as vector control through mosquito nets or the targeted use of insecticides as well as the use of antimalarial prophylaxis drugs, the incidence has already been successfully reduced in recent years. However, to reduce the risk of malaria and to protect children effectively, further measures are necessary. An important part of these measures is an effective vaccination against malaria. However, the history of research shows that the development of an effective malaria vaccine is not an easy undertaking and is associated with some complications. Research into possible vaccines began as early as the 1960s. However, the results achieved were rather sobering and the various vaccines fell short of their expectations. It was not until 2015 that the vaccine RTS,S/AS01 received a positive evaluation from the European Medicines Agency. Since then, the vaccine has been tested in Africa. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, there are new developments in vaccine research that could also benefit malaria research. These include, among others, the so-called mRNA vaccines. Already in the early 1990s, an immune response triggered by an mRNA vaccine was described for the first time. Since then, mRNA vaccines have been researched and discussed for possible prophylaxis. However, it was not until the COVID-19 pandemic that these vaccines experienced a veritable progress. mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were rapidly developed and achieved high efficacy in studies. Based on this success, it is not surprising that companies are also focusing on other diseases and pathogens. Besides viral diseases, such as influenza or AIDS, malaria is high on this list. Many pharmaceutical companies (including the German companies BioNTech and CureVac) have already confirmed that they are researching mRNA vaccines against malaria. However, this is not an easy task. The aim of this article is to describe and discuss possible antigens that could be considered for mRNA vaccination. However, this topic is currently still very speculative.",Acta parasitologica,2023-Dec,Borkens Y,1,2506,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33057040,Systematic analysis of infectious disease outcomes by age shows lowest severity in school-age children.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has ignited interest in age-specific manifestations of infection but surprisingly little is known about relative severity of infectious disease between the extremes of age. In a systematic analysis we identified 142 datasets with information on severity of disease by age for 32 different infectious diseases, 19 viral and 13 bacterial. For almost all infections, school-age children have the least severe disease, and severity starts to rise long before old age. Indeed, for many infections even young adults have more severe disease than children, and dengue was the only infection that was most severe in school-age children. Together with data on vaccine response in children and young adults, the findings suggest peak immune function is reached around 5-14 years of age. Relative immune senescence may begin much earlier than assumed, before accelerating in older age groups. This has major implications for understanding resilience to infection, optimal vaccine scheduling, and appropriate health protection policies across the life course.",Scientific data,2020-Oct,"Glynn JR, Moss PAH",2,1069,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

It is a high-priority region for many public health concerns. Rising population, increase in number of urban poverty, low government spending (in terms of % of GDP) on health, dwindling health indicators are some of the immediate concerns. Apart from this, the region is facing a dual burden of diseases, where the communicable diseases are still responsible for substantial portion of deaths, burden of non-communicable diseases is steadily increasing. These changes are explained by four main stages of epidemiological transition. Movement through these stages has resulted in a dramatic shift in the cause of death from infectious diseases and malnutrition in the first stage to cardio-vascular diseases (CVDs) and cancers in most high-income countries over the last two centuries.

39050854,The causal relationship between gut microbiota and nine infectious diseases: a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Evidence from observational studies and clinical trials has associated gut microbiota with infectious diseases. However, the causal relationship between gut microbiota and infectious diseases remains unclear. We identified gut microbiota based on phylum, class, order, family, and genus classifications, and obtained infectious disease datasets from the IEU OpenGWAS database. The two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis was then performed to determine whether the gut microbiota were causally associated with different infectious diseases. In addition, we performed reverse MR analysis to test for causality. Herein, we characterized causal relationships between genetic predispositions in the gut microbiota and nine infectious diseases. Eight strong associations were found between genetic predisposition in the gut microbiota and infectious diseases. Specifically, the abundance of class <i>Coriobacteriia</i>, order <i>Coriobacteriales</i>, and family <i>Coriobacteriaceae</i> was found to be positively associated with the risk of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). On the other hand, family <i>Acidaminococcaceae</i>, genus <i>Clostridiumsensustricto1</i>, and class <i>Bacilli</i> were positively associated with the risk of endocarditis, cellulitis, and osteomyelitis, respectively. We also discovered that the abundance of class <i>Lentisphaeria</i> and order <i>Victivallales</i> lowered the risk of sepsis. Through MR analysis, we found that gut microbiota were causally associated with infectious diseases. This finding offers new insights into the microbe-mediated infection mechanisms for further clinical research.",Frontiers in immunology,2024-,"Wang S, Yin F, Sun W, Li R, Guo Z, Wang Y, Zhang Y, Sun C, Sun D",9,1648,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

33525082,Asymptomatic transmission shifts epidemic dynamics.,"Asymptomatic transmission of infectious diseases has been recognized recently in several epidemics or pandemics. There is a great need to incorporate asymptomatic transmissions into traditional modeling of infectious diseases and to study how asymptomatic transmissions shift epidemic dynamics. In this work, we propose a compartmental model with asymptomatic transmissions for waterborne infectious diseases. We conduct a detailed analysis and numerical study with shigellosis data. Two parameters, the proportion $p$ of asymptomatic infected individuals and the proportion $k$ of asymptomatic infectious individuals who can asymptomatically transmit diseases, play major rules in the epidemic dynamics. The basic reproduction number $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ is a decreasing function of parameter $p$ when parameter $k$ is smaller than a critical value while $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ is an increasing function of $p$ when $k$ is greater than the critical value. $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ is an increasing function of $k$ for any value of $p$. When $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ passes through 1 as $p$ or $k$ varies, the dynamics of epidemics is shifted. If asymptomatic transmissions are not counted, $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ will be underestimated while the final size may be overestimated or underestimated. Our study provides a theoretical example for investigating other asymptomatic transmissions and useful information for public health measurements in waterborne infectious diseases.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2020-Nov,"Lv J, Guo S, Cui JA, Tian JP",4,1451,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The number of travellers alone does not explain risk; passenger origin and destination will also influence risk of disease introduction and spread. We described trends in international air passenger numbers and connectivity between countries with different capacities to detect and respond to infectious disease threats. We used the Fragile States Index (FSI) as an annual measure of country-level resilience and capacity to respond to infectious disease events. Countries are categorized as: Sustainable, Stable, Warning or Alert, in order of increasing fragility. We included data for 177 sovereign states for the years 2010 to 2019. Annual inbound and outbound international air passengers for each country were obtained for the same time period. We examined trends in FSI score, trends in worldwide air travel and the association between a state's FSI score and air travel. Among countries included in the FSI rankings, the total number of outbound passengers increased from 0.865 billion to 1.58 billion between 2010 and 2019. Increasing fragility was associated with a decrease in travel volumes, with a 2.5% (95% CI: 2.0-3.1%) reduction in passengers per 1-unit increase in FSI score. Overall, travel between countries of different FSI categories either increased or remained stable. The world's connectivity via air travel has increased dramatically over the past decade. There has been notable growth in travel from Warning and Stable countries, which comprise more than three-quarters of international air travel passengers. These countries may have suboptimal capacity to detect and respond to infectious disease threats that emerge within their borders.",Journal of travel medicine,2020-Jul,"Tuite AR, Bhatia D, Moineddin R, Bogoch II, Watts AG, Khan K",6,1764,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

No research has ever been conducted investigating the use of expert opinion in international infectious disease guidelines. This study aimed to create an analytical map by describing the prevalence and utilization of expert opinion in infectious disease guidelines and analyzing the methodological aspects of these guidelines. In this meta-epidemiological study, systematic searches in PubMed and Trip Medical Database were performed to identify clinical guidelines on infectious diseases, published between January 2018 and May 2023 in English, by international organizations. Data extracted included guideline characteristics, expert opinion utilization, and methodological details. Prevalence and rationale of expert opinion use were analyzed descriptively. Methodological differences between groups were analyzed with Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U Test. The analysis covered 66 guidelines with 2296 recommendations, published/endorsed by 136 organizations. Most guidelines (79%) used systematic literature searches, 42% provided search strategies, and 38% presented screening flow diagrams and conducted risk of bias assessments. 48.5% of the guidelines allowed expert opinion, most of which included expert opinion as part of the evidence hierarchy within the grading system. Guidelines allowing expert opinion, compared to those which do not, issued more recommendations per guideline (48.82 vs.19.13, p<0.001), and reported fewer screening flow diagrams (25% vs. 65%, p = 0.002), and less risk of bias assessments (19% vs.78%, p<0.001). Expert opinion is utilized in half of assessed guidelines, often integrated into the evidence hierarchy within the grading system. Its utilization varies considerably in methodology, form, and terminology between guidelines. These findings highlight a pressing need for additional research and guidance, to improve and advance the standardization of infectious disease guidelines.",PloS one,2024-,"Nagavci B, Schwingshackl L, Martin-Loeches I, Lakatos B",4,1978,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

36864415,Public health emergency preparedness for infectious disease emergencies: a scoping review of recent evidence.,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to demonstrate the risks and profound health impacts that result from infectious disease emergencies. Emergency preparedness has been defined as the knowledge, capacity and organizational systems that governments, response and recovery organizations, communities and individuals develop to anticipate, respond to, or recover from emergencies. This scoping review explored recent literature on priority areas and indicators for public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) with a focus on infectious disease emergencies. Using scoping review methodology, a comprehensive search was conducted for indexed and grey literature with a focus on records published from 2017 to 2020 onward, respectively. Records were included if they: (a) described PHEP, (b) focused on an infectious emergency, and (c) were published in an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development country. An evidence-based all-hazards Resilience Framework for PHEP consisting of 11 elements was used as a reference point to identify additional areas of preparedness that have emerged in recent publications. The findings were analyzed deductively and summarized thematically. The included publications largely aligned with the 11 elements of the all-hazards Resilience Framework for PHEP. In particular, the elements related to collaborative networks, community engagement, risk analysis and communication were frequently observed across the publications included in this review. Ten emergent themes were identified that expand on the Resilience Framework for PHEP specific to infectious diseases. Planning to mitigate inequities was a key finding of this review, it was the most frequently identified emergent theme. Additional emergent themes were: research and evidence-informed decision making, building vaccination capacity, building laboratory and diagnostic system capacity, building infection prevention and control capacity, financial investment in infrastructure, health system capacity, climate and environmental health, public health legislation and phases of preparedness. The themes from this review contribute to the evolving understanding of critical public health emergency preparedness actions. The themes expand on the 11 elements outlined in the Resilience Framework for PHEP, specifically relevant to pandemics and infectious disease emergencies. Further research will be important to validate these findings, and expand understanding of how refinements to PHEP frameworks and indicators can support public health practice.",BMC public health,2023-Mar,"Lee JM, Jansen R, Sanderson KE, Guerra F, Keller-Olaman S, Murti M, O'Sullivan TL, Law MP, Schwartz B, Bourns LE, Khan Y",11,2551,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36285663,Incorporating infectious duration-dependent transmission into Bayesian epidemic models.,"Compartmental models are commonly used to describe the spread of infectious diseases by estimating the probabilities of transitions between important disease states. A significant challenge in fitting Bayesian compartmental models lies in the need to estimate the duration of the infectious period, based on limited data providing only symptom onset date or another proxy for the start of infectiousness. Commonly, the exponential distribution is used to describe the infectious duration, an overly simplistic approach, which is not biologically plausible. More flexible distributions can be used, but parameter identifiability and computational cost can worsen for moderately sized or large epidemics. In this article, we present a novel approach, which considers a curve of transmissibility over a fixed infectious duration. The incorporation of infectious duration-dependent (IDD) transmissibility, which decays to zero during the infectious period, is biologically reasonable for many viral infections and fixing the length of the infectious period eases computational complexity in model fitting. Through simulation, we evaluate different functional forms of IDD transmissibility curves and show that the proposed approach offers improved estimation of the time-varying reproductive number. We illustrate the benefit of our approach through a new analysis of the 1995 outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",Biometrical journal.

But it is seldom recognised that Flügge was also influential in a number of other fields comprising the practice of hygiene. One-hundred years following his death in 1923, we review literature related to the studies of Flügge and his colleagues and students and illustrate the particular emphasis he laid upon the environment within which disease and its transmission might be fostered or prevented, embracing and studying aspects essential to the health of any community ranging from fundamental microbiology in the laboratory to subjects as disparate as housing, clean water supply, nutrition, sanitation, socio-economic circumstances and climate. Very early in his career he promoted breast feeding for the prevention of seasonal gastro-enteritis and later the sheltering of cough as a means of preventing the transmission of infected respiratory droplets, not only as regards tuberculosis, but also concerning all manner of other respiratory infections. By the time of Flügge's death the complexification of available scientific methodologies comprising hygiene made it difficult for any individual to comprehend and study the wide range of hygiene-related subjects such as Flügge did. Carl Flügge was one of the last holistic hygienists and an originator of the study of environmental health as a pillar of hygiene.",Medical microbiology and immunology,2024-Aug,"Donald PR, Kaufmann SHE, Schaub D, Thee S, Lange C",5,1487,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39227499,"From HIV to Mpox: Socio-discursive Analysis of Communicable Diseases, Stigma, and Pathologization in Sexual Minorities in Brazil.","Discrimination and stigma are significant barriers to healthcare for the LGBTQIAPN+ community, necessitating a deeper analysis of their sociocultural causes. There is a notable gap in the literature regarding the understanding of socio-discursive representations and their impact on the stigmatization and pathologization of sexual minorities in the context of communicable diseases. This study aims to discuss the understanding of the sociodiscursive aspects of the health-disease process, particularly in stigmatized infectious diseases affecting the LGBTQIAPN+ community. The focus is on examining how news articles, or the set of analyzed texts (corpus), shape these perceptions. We conducted documentary research with a qualitative and discursive approach using news articles retrieved from Google News<sup>Ⓡ</sup> about diseases affecting the LGBTQIAPN+ population from 2011 to 2022. The analysis was based on critical discourse analysis, processed using MAXQDA and IRAMUTEQ software. The identified representations predominantly align with biomedical ideology, manifesting in a discourse that normalizes and medicalizes (normative-curative discourse), and notable for its pathologizing and stigmatizing nature. Six classes were found: Ethical professional dilemmas facing stigma, infection and contamination of the LGBT+ population, prejudice and discrimination in the form of information, stigma related to sexual behavior/orientation, Vulnerability and stigma related to infectious diseases, and strategies for minimizing health risk/stigma for the LGBT+ public. The most relevant analytical categories were related to infectious diseases and sexual identity. These themes were identified, indicating that media representations reinforce stigma and maintain unequal health practices (verticalization) for the LGBT+ community. Understanding these patterns within a broader historical context is crucial for promoting health education and strategies that challenge internalized prejudice. The need to reformulate cultural norms and develop health information and education policies is urgent. These policies should be led by professionals with a comprehensive and humanized vision, addressing the diverse needs of the LGBT+ population.",Archives of sexual behavior,2024-Nov,"Cruz Neto J, Maia AC, de Siqueira Holanda VM, de Sousa AR, de Lima Carvalho CM, Brasil EGM, da Silva KA, Mendes IAC, de Sousa ÁFL",9,2242,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Limited research has examined the role of built environments in relation to Indigenous health in remote Australia. This study engaged stakeholders to understand their perceptions of the influence of built environmental factors on chronic and infectious diseases in remote Northern Territory (NT) communities. A preliminary set of 1120 built environmental indicators were systematically identified and classified using an Indigenous Indicator Classification System. The public and environmental health workforce was engaged to consolidate the classified indicators (<i>n</i> = 84), and then sort and rate the consolidated indicators based on their experience with living and working in remote NT communities. Sorting of the indicators resulted in a concept map with nine built environmental domains. Essential services and Facilities for health/safety were the highest ranked domains for both chronic and infectious diseases. Within these domains, adequate housing infrastructure, water supply, drainage system, reliable sewerage and power infrastructure, and access to health services were identified as the most important contributors to the development of these diseases. The findings highlight the features of community environments amenable to public health and social policy actions that could be targeted to help reduce prevalence of chronic and infectious diseases.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021-May,"Chakraborty A, Howard NJ, Daniel M, Chong A, Slavin N, Brown A, Cargo M",7,1522,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32867133,The Prediction of Infectious Diseases: A Bibliometric Analysis.,"The outbreak of infectious diseases has a negative influence on public health and the economy. The prediction of infectious diseases can effectively control large-scale outbreaks and reduce transmission of epidemics in rapid response to serious public health events. Therefore, experts and scholars are increasingly concerned with the prediction of infectious diseases. However, a knowledge mapping analysis of literature regarding the prediction of infectious diseases using rigorous bibliometric tools, which are supposed to offer further knowledge structure and distribution, has been conducted infrequently. Therefore, we implement a bibliometric analysis about the prediction of infectious diseases to objectively analyze the current status and research hotspots, in order to provide a reference for related researchers. We viewed ""infectious disease*"" and ""prediction"" or ""forecasting"" as search theme in the core collection of Web of Science from inception to 1 May 2020. We used two effective bibliometric tools, i.e., CiteSpace (Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and VOSviewer (Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands) to objectively analyze the data of the prediction of infectious disease domain based on related publications, which can be downloaded from the core collection of Web of Science. Then, the leading publications of the prediction of infectious diseases were identified to detect the historical progress based on collaboration analysis, co-citation analysis, and co-occurrence analysis. 1880 documents that met the inclusion criteria were extracted from Web of Science in this study. The number of documents exhibited a growing trend, which can be expressed an increasing number of experts and scholars paying attention to the field year by year. These publications were published in 427 different journals with 11 different document types, and the most frequently studied types were articles 1618 (83%). In addition, as the most productive country, the United States has provided a lot of scientific research achievements in the field of infectious diseases. Our study provides a systematic and objective view of the field, which can be useful for readers to evaluate the characteristics of publications involving the prediction of infectious diseases and for policymakers to take timely scientific responses.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020-Aug,"Yang W, Zhang J, Ma R",3,2345,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39563417,Role of social innovations in health in the prevention and control of infectious diseases: a scoping review.,"The implementation of social innovations for addressing societal challenges, particularly in health, leverages community participation and technology to optimally meet social needs compared to traditional approaches. A key feature of these innovations is their ability to utilize existing capacities for contributing to resolving infectious disease outbreaks, which has attracted significant attention from health organizations. Given the potential of these innovations, this study has investigated social innovations in the prevention and control of infectious diseases as one of the major global challenges in the form of a comprehensive literature review. This review study examined the relevant literature from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2022. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 50 documents were retained and fully examined. The documents were analyzed by applying a thematic analysis, and important content related to the application of social innovations for the prevention and control of pandemic infectious diseases was extracted using a data collection form. Five major themes concerning social innovation in the prevention and control of epidemic diseases were discerned as follows: new products, novel processes and policies, empowerment, innovative practices and behaviors, and community engagement. New products include technological products for control and management of epidemics, preventive products, diagnostic and therapeutic products. Novel processes and policies are related to reorienting and reorganizing care methods, control and monitoring policies, participatory and creative strategies. Empowerment is focused on enhancing the capabilities of health workers, community leaders, and communities. Innovative practices and behaviors involve technology-based participation and support mechanisms. Community engagement is related to awareness, consultation, community mobilization, and participation in production and support. During the outbreak of infectious diseases, governments are faced with many challenges, including health, economic and social challenges. To answer these challenges, tools should be used that have the ability to answer the problem from several aspects. Social innovation as an appropriate process in response to health crises has led to new forms of relationships and empowered the communities. And to promote public health, it provides the opportunity for all members of the society to participate in crisis resolution and optimal use of resources.",Infectious diseases of poverty,2024-Nov,"Khazaee-Pool M, Pashaei T, Zarghani M, Ponnet K",4,2512,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This work uses the theory of customer relationship management (CRM) to analyze the outpatients in the hospital for infectious diseases in Shanghai, China. A total of 2,271,020 data elements of outpatients in the research unit between August 2009 and December 2019 were extracted, analyzed and cleaned to obtain 171,107 valid data elements (1 element per person). The main diseases were viral hepatitis B (VHB) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and the average percentage of drug expenditure was 80.39 %. We innovatively expanded the classic RFM (R: recency, F: frequency, M: monetary) model in CRM to the dRFM (d: percentage of drug expenditure) model. We selected the best clustering algorithm from the K-means, Kohonen and two-step clustering methods to find the optimal model to distinguish the types of patients with different economic values and the best decision-making algorithm from the C5.0, CART classification regression tree, CHAID and QUEST algorithms to verify the model. After performing two rounds of K-means clustering analysis on three models: RFM, RFM + dRFM and dRFM, and 97,855 data elements were retained. The RFM + dRFM model was the optimal model, clustering the patients into 3 types: potential patients (24.2 %) to be retained, with a high drug expenditure and the last visit in more than 19.06 months, high-value patients (24.5 %) to be attracted, with the last visit in about 6.66 months; basal patients (51.3 %) to be kept, with the last visit in about 3.7 months. The model was then verified using the C5.0 decision tree algorithm with an accuracy rate of 99.97 %. This objective CRM analysis of the patients in the hospital for infectious diseases using the dRFM model accurately identified different types of patients, providing an objective and effective basis for hospital management.",International journal of medical informatics,2021-Mar,"Li M, Wang Q, Shen Y, Zhu T",4,1932,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38924448,Current status of diagnostic assays for emerging zoonotic viruses: Nipah and Hendra.,"Nipah and Hendra viruses belong to the Paramyxoviridae family, which pose a significant threat to human health, with sporadic outbreaks causing severe morbidity and mortality. Early symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and headache, which offer little in terms of differential diagnosis. There are no specific therapeutics and vaccines for these viruses. This review comprehensively covers a spectrum of diagnostic techniques for Nipah and Hendra virus infections, discussed in conjunction with appropriate type of samples during the progression of infection. Serological assays, reverse transcriptase Real-Time PCR assays, and isothermal amplification assays are discussed in detail, along with a listing of few commercially available detection kits. Patents protecting inventions in Nipah and Hendra virus detection are also covered. Despite several outbreaks of Nipah and Hendra infections in the past decade, in-depth research into their pathogenesis, Point-of-Care diagnostics, specific therapies, and human vaccines is lacking. A prompt and accurate diagnosis is pivotal for efficient outbreak management, patient treatment, and the adoption of preventative measures. The emergence of rapid point-of-care tests holds promise in enhancing diagnostic capabilities in real-world settings.

Classifiers were used to recognize patterns in the spatial domain process of the collected data. Doctors reported their diagnoses when any disease presented. A flexible microservice architecture provided access and functionality to the system. combining two different domains, health and technology, is not easy, but the results are encouraging. The classifiers reported good results; the system has been well accepted by medical personnel and is proving to be cost-effective and a good solution to service disadvantaged areas. In this context, this research found the importance of certain clinical variables in the identification of infectious diseases. this work explores how to apply mobile communications, cloud services, and machine learning technology, in order to provide efficient tools for medical staff in nursing homes.

33865347,"Assessment of the core and support functions of the integrated disease surveillance and response system in Zanzibar, Tanzania.","Disease surveillance is a cornerstone of outbreak detection and control. Evaluation of a disease surveillance system is important to ensure its performance over time. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of the core and support functions of the Zanzibar integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) system to determine its capacity for early detection of and response to infectious disease outbreaks. This cross-sectional descriptive study involved 10 districts of Zanzibar and 45 public and private health facilities. A mixed-methods approach was used to collect data. This included document review, observations and interviews with surveillance personnel using a modified World Health Organization generic questionnaire for assessing national disease surveillance systems. The performance of the IDSR system in Zanzibar was suboptimal particularly with respect to early detection of epidemics. Weak laboratory capacity at all levels greatly hampered detection and confirmation of cases and outbreaks. None of the health facilities or laboratories could confirm all priority infectious diseases outlined in the Zanzibar IDSR guidelines. Data reporting was weakest at facility level, while data analysis was inadequate at all levels (facility, district and national). The performance of epidemic preparedness and response was generally unsatisfactory despite availability of rapid response teams and budget lines for epidemics in each district. The support functions (supervision, training, laboratory, communication and coordination, human resources, logistic support) were inadequate particularly at the facility level. The IDSR system in Zanzibar is weak and inadequate for early detection and response to infectious disease epidemics. The performance of both core and support functions are hampered by several factors including inadequate human and material resources as well as lack of motivation for IDSR implementation within the healthcare delivery system. In the face of emerging epidemics, strengthening of the IDSR system, including allocation of adequate resources, should be a priority in order to safeguard human health and economic stability across the archipelago of Zanzibar.",BMC public health,2021-Apr,"Saleh F, Kitau J, Konradsen F, Mboera LEG, Schiøler KL",5,2214,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

A total of 5,818 participants were face-to-face interviewed and 35,542 contacts were recorded. The average number of contacts per person each day was 16.7 considering supplementary professional contacts (SPCs). Contacts that occurred on a daily basis, lasted more than 4 hours, and took place in households were more likely to involve physical contact. The seasonal characteristics of social contact were heterogeneous, such that contact in the winter was more likely to involve physical contact compared to summer months. The spatial characteristics of the contacts were similar. Social mixing patterns differed according to age, but all ages maintained regular contact with their peers. Taken together, these findings describe the spatiotemporal distribution of social contact patterns relevant to infections in the Guangdong Province of China.

36434611,The imported infections among foreign travelers in China: an observational study.,"In the past few decades, globalization has rendered more frequent and intensive population movement between countries, which has changed the original disease spectrum and brought a huge health impact on the global population including China. This study aims to describe the spectrum and epidemiological characteristics of imported infections among foreign travelers travelling to China. The data on imported infections among foreign travelers were obtained from Custom Inbound Screening System (CISS) and the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting System (NNIDRS). All the infections were classified into respiratory, gastrointestinal, vector-borne, blood/sex-transmitted and mucocutaneous diseases, of which case numbers and incidences were calculated and the proportions were compared among subgroups. In total, 17,189 travelers diagnosed with 58 imported infectious diseases were reported from 2014 to 2018, with an overall incidence of 122.59 per million. Respiratory infection (7,351 cases, mainly influenza) and blood/sex-transmitted diseases (6,114 cases mainly Hepatitis B and HIV infection) were the most frequently diagnosed diseases, followed by vector-borne infections (3,128 cases, mainly dengue fever and malaria). The highest case number was from Asia and Europe, while the highest incidence rate was from Africa (296.00 per million). When specific diagnosis was compared, both the highest absolute case number and incidence were observed for influenza.

31930962,Climate change and infectious disease research in Nepal: Are the available prerequisites supportive enough to researchers?,"Although Nepal has been identified as a country highly vulnerable to adverse health and socioeconomic impacts arising from climate change, extant research on climate sensitive infectious diseases has yet to develop the evidence base to adequately address these threats. In this opinion paper we identify and characterise basic requirements that are hindering the progress of climate change and infectious disease research in Nepal. Our opinion is that immediate attention should be given to strengthening Nepal's public health surveillance system, promoting inter-sectoral collaboration, improving public health capacity, and enhancing community engagement in disease surveillance. Moreover, we advocate for greater technical support of public health researchers, and data sharing among data custodians and epidemiologists/researchers, to generate salient evidence to guide relevant public health policy formulation aimed at addressing the impacts of climate change on human health in Nepal. International studies on climate variability and infectious diseases have clearly demonstrated that climate sensitive diseases, namely vector-borne and food/water-borne diseases, are sensitive to climate variation and climate change. This research has driven the development and implementation of climate-based early warning systems for preventing potential outbreaks of climate-sensitive infectious diseases across many European and African countries. Similarly, we postulate that Nepal would greatly benefit from a climate-based early warning system, which would assist in identification or prediction of conditions suitable for disease emergence and facilitate a timely response to reduce mortality and morbidity during epidemics.",Acta tropica,2020-Apr,"Bhandari D, Bi P, Sherchand JB, Dhimal M, Hanson-Easey S",5,1725,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32673307,Data-driven contact structures: From homogeneous mixing to multilayer networks.,"The modeling of the spreading of communicable diseases has experienced significant advances in the last two decades or so. This has been possible due to the proliferation of data and the development of new methods to gather, mine and analyze it. A key role has also been played by the latest advances in new disciplines like network science. Nonetheless, current models still lack a faithful representation of all possible heterogeneities and features that can be extracted from data. Here, we bridge a current gap in the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases and develop a framework that allows to account simultaneously for both the connectivity of individuals and the age-structure of the population. We compare different scenarios, namely, i) the homogeneous mixing setting, ii) one in which only the social mixing is taken into account, iii) a setting that considers the connectivity of individuals alone, and finally, iv) a multilayer representation in which both the social mixing and the number of contacts are included in the model. We analytically show that the thresholds obtained for these four scenarios are different. In addition, we conduct extensive numerical simulations and conclude that heterogeneities in the contact network are important for a proper determination of the epidemic threshold, whereas the age-structure plays a bigger role beyond the onset of the outbreak. Altogether, when it comes to evaluate interventions such as vaccination, both sources of individual heterogeneity are important and should be concurrently considered. Our results also provide an indication of the errors incurred in situations in which one cannot access all needed information in terms of connectivity and age of the population.",PLoS computational biology,2020-Jul,"Aleta A, Ferraz de Arruda G, Moreno Y",3,1744,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

In addition to the enduring burdens of ailments like malaria and HIV, the emergence of nosocomial outbreaks driven by antibiotic-resistant pathogens underscores the ongoing threats. Furthermore, recent infectious disease crises, exemplified by the Ebola and SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, have intensified the pursuit of more effective and efficient diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. Among the promising options, antibodies have garnered significant attention due to their favorable structural characteristics and versatile applications. Notably, nanobodies (Nbs), the smallest functional single-domain antibodies of heavy-chain only antibodies produced by camelids, exhibit remarkable capabilities in stable antigen binding. They offer unique advantages such as ease of expression and modification and enhanced stability, as well as improved hydrophilicity compared to conventional antibody fragments (antigen-binding fragments (Fab) or single-chain variable fragments (scFv)) that can aggregate due to their low solubility. Nanobodies directly target antigen epitopes or can be engineered into multivalent Nbs and Nb-fusion proteins, expanding their therapeutic potential. This review is dedicated to charting the progress in Nb research, particularly those derived from camelids, and highlighting their diverse applications in treating infectious diseases, spanning both human and animal contexts.",Frontiers in immunology,2024-,"De Greve H, Fioravanti A",2,1470,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

In this article, we take a model for the spread of an infectious disease in a single town and scale it up to simulate a region containing multiple towns. The model is validated by looking at how adding additional towns and commuters influences the outbreak in a single town. We then look at how the centrality of a town within a network influences the outbreak. Our main finding is that the commuters coming into a town have a greater effect on whether an outbreak will spread to a town than the commuters going out. The findings on centrality of a town and how it influences an outbreak could potentially be used to help influence future policy and intervention strategies such as school closure policies.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2020-Apr,"Hunter E, Namee BM, Kelleher JD",3,932,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39684660,Stress Granules in Infectious Disease: Cellular Principles and Dynamic Roles in Immunity and Organelles.,"Stress granules (SGs) are membrane-less aggregates that form in response to various cellular stimuli through a process called liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Stimuli such as heat shock, osmotic stress, oxidative stress, and infections can induce the formation of SGs, which play crucial roles in regulating gene expression to help cells adapt to stress conditions. Various mRNAs and proteins are aggregated into SGs, particularly those associated with the protein translation machinery, which are frequently found in SGs. When induced by infections, SGs modulate immune cell activity, supporting the cellular response against infection. The roles of SGs differ in viral versus microbial infections, and depending on the type of immune cell involved, SGs function differently in response to infection. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the implication of SGs in immunity and cellular organelles in the context of infectious diseases. Importantly, we explore insights into the regulatory functions of SGs in the context of host cells under infection.",International journal of molecular sciences,2024-Dec,"Kim J, Song CH",2,1079,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37931938,Mapping regional funding for COVID-19 research in the Asia-Pacific region.,"The Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R) is a network of funders supporting research on infectious diseases of epidemic/pandemic potential. GloPID-R is establishing regional hubs to strengthen stakeholder engagement particularly among low-income and middle-income countries. The first pilot hub, led from Republic of Korea (South Korea), has been launched in the Asia-Pacific region, a region highly prone to outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. We present findings of mapping research undertaken in support of the hub's development. We analysed five COVID-19 research databases in September 2022 to identify research funders and intermediary funding sources supporting research in infectious diseases in the Asia-Pacific region. This was complemented with an in-depth analysis of the UK Collaborative on Development Research (UKCDR) and GloPID-R COVID-19 Research Project Tracker to assess the alignment of funded projects in the region to the WHO COVID-19 research priorities. We identified 453 funders and funding sources supporting COVID-19 research in the Asia-Pacific Region including public, private and philanthropic organisations and universities. However, these organisations were clustered in few countries in the region. The in-depth analysis of the UKCDR and GloPID-R COVID-19 Research project Tracker found limited research involving Asia-Pacific countries with the 117 funders supporting these projects investing at least US$604m in COVID-19 research in the region. Social Sciences was the dominant theme on which funded projects focused whereas the priority areas with the least number of projects were research on 'animal and environmental health' and 'ethics considerations for research'.

32839329,The duration of travel impacts the spatial dynamics of infectious diseases.,"Humans can impact the spatial transmission dynamics of infectious diseases by introducing pathogens into susceptible environments. The rate at which this occurs depends in part on human-mobility patterns. Increasingly, mobile-phone usage data are used to quantify human mobility and investigate the impact on disease dynamics. Although the number of trips between locations and the duration of those trips could both affect infectious-disease dynamics, there has been limited work to quantify and model the duration of travel in the context of disease transmission. Using mobility data inferred from mobile-phone calling records in Namibia, we calculated both the number of trips between districts and the duration of these trips from 2010 to 2014. We fit hierarchical Bayesian models to these data to describe both the mean trip number and duration. Results indicate that trip duration is positively related to trip distance, but negatively related to the destination population density. The highest volume of trips and shortest trip durations were among high-density districts, whereas trips among low-density districts had lower volume with longer duration. We also analyzed the impact of including trip duration in spatial-transmission models for a range of pathogens and introduction locations. We found that inclusion of trip duration generally delays the rate of introduction, regardless of pathogen, and that the variance and uncertainty around spatial spread increases proportionally with pathogen-generation time. These results enhance our understanding of disease-dispersal dynamics driven by human mobility, which has potential to elucidate optimal spatial and temporal scales for epidemic interventions.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2020-Sep,"Giles JR, Zu Erbach-Schoenberg E, Tatem AJ, Gardner L, Bjørnstad ON, Metcalf CJE, Wesolowski A",7,1716,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36773317,Increasing serum iron levels and their role in the risk of infectious diseases: a Mendelian randomization approach.,"Increased iron stores have been associated with elevated risks of different infectious diseases, suggesting that iron supplementation may increase the risk of infections. However, these associations may be biased by confounding or reverse causation. This is important, since up to 19% of the population takes iron supplementation. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to bypass these biases and estimate the causal effect of iron on infections. As instrumental variables, we used genetic variants associated with iron biomarkers in two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of European ancestry participants. For outcomes, we used GWAS results from the UK Biobank, FinnGen, the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative or 23andMe, for seven infection phenotypes: 'any infections', combined, COVID-19 hospitalization, candidiasis, pneumonia, sepsis, skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) and urinary tract infection (UTI). Most of our analyses showed increasing iron (measured by its biomarkers) was associated with only modest changes in the odds of infectious outcomes, with all 95% odds ratios confidence intervals within the 0.88 to 1.26 range. However, for the three predominantly bacterial infections (sepsis, SSTI, UTI), at least one analysis showed a nominally elevated risk with increased iron stores (P <0.05). Using MR, we did not observe an increase in risk of most infectious diseases with increases in iron stores. However for bacterial infections, higher iron stores may increase odds of infections. Hence, using genetic variation in iron pathways as a proxy for iron supplementation, iron supplements are likely safe on a population level, but we should continue the current practice of conservative iron supplementation during bacterial infections or in those at high risk of developing them.",International journal of epidemiology,2023-Aug,"Butler-Laporte G, Farjoun Y, Chen Y, Hultström M, Liang KYH, Nakanishi T, Su CY, Yoshiji S, Forgetta V, Richards JB",10,1803,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36825480,Antimicrobial susceptibility testing: An updated primer for clinicians in the era of antimicrobial resistance: Insights from the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists.,"Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is a critical function of the clinical microbiology laboratory and is essential for optimizing care of patients with infectious diseases, monitoring antimicrobial resistance (AMR) trends, and informing public health initiatives. Several methods are available for performing AST including broth microdilution, agar dilution, and disk diffusion. Technological advances such as the development of commercial automated susceptibility testing platforms and the advent of rapid diagnostic tests have improved the rapidity, robustness, and clinical application of AST. Numerous accrediting and regulatory agencies are involved in the process of AST and setting and revising breakpoints, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Challenges to optimizing AST include the emergence of new resistance mechanisms, the development of new antimicrobial agents, and generation of new data requiring updates and revisions to established methods and breakpoints. Together, the challenges in AST methods and their interpretation create important opportunities for well-informed clinicians to improve patient outcomes and provide value to antimicrobial stewardship programs, especially in the setting of rapidly changing and increasing AMR. Addressing AST challenges will involve continued development of new technologies along with collaboration between clinicians and the laboratory to facilitate optimal antimicrobial use, combat the increasing burden of AMR, and inform the development of novel antimicrobials. This updated primer serves to reinforce important principles of AST, and to provide guidance on their implementation and optimization.",Pharmacotherapy,2023-Apr,"Wenzler E, Maximos M, Asempa TE, Biehle L, Schuetz AN, Hirsch EB",6,1733,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38257319,Review on the Applications of Selected Metal-Based Complexes on Infectious Diseases.,"Fatalities caused by infectious diseases (i.e., diseases caused by parasite, bacteria, and viruses) have become reinstated as a major public health threat globally. Factors such as antimicrobial resistance and viral complications are the key contributors to the death numbers. As a result, new compounds with structural diversity classes are critical for controlling the virulence of pathogens that are multi-drug resistant. Derivatization of bio-active organic molecules with organometallic synthons is a promising strategy for modifying the inherent and enhanced properties of biomolecules. Due to their redox chemistry, bioactivity, and structural diversity, organometallic moieties make excellent candidates for lead structures in drug development. Furthermore, organometallic compounds open an array of potential in therapy that existing organic molecules lack, i.e., their ability to fulfill drug availability and resolve the frequent succumbing of organic molecules to drug resistance. Additionally, metal complexes have the potential towards metal-specific modes of action, preventing bacteria from developing resistance mechanisms. This review's main contribution is to provide a thorough account of the biological efficacy (in vitro and in vitro) of metal-based complexes against infectious diseases. This resource can also be utilized in conjunction with corresponding journals on metal-based complexes investigated against infectious diseases.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2024-Jan,"Dube NP, Thatyana M, Mokgalaka-Fleischmann NS, Mansour AM, Tembu VJ, Manicum AE",6,1455,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32782357,Constitutive immune mechanisms: mediators of host defence and immune regulation.,"The immune system enables organisms to combat infections and to eliminate endogenous challenges. Immune responses can be evoked through diverse inducible pathways. However, various constitutive mechanisms are also required for immunocompetence. The inducible responses of pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system and antigen-specific receptors of the adaptive immune system are highly effective, but they also have the potential to cause extensive immunopathology and tissue damage, as seen in many infectious and autoinflammatory diseases. By contrast, constitutive innate immune mechanisms, including restriction factors, basal autophagy and proteasomal degradation, tend to limit immune responses, with loss-of-function mutations in these pathways leading to inflammation. Although they function through a broad and heterogeneous set of mechanisms, the constitutive immune responses all function as early barriers to infection and aim to minimize any disruption of homeostasis. Supported by recent human and mouse data, in this Review we compare and contrast the inducible and constitutive mechanisms of immunosurveillance.",Nature reviews.

34662353,Timely surveillance and temporal calibration of disease response against human infectious diseases.,"Disease surveillance and response are critical components of epidemic preparedness. The disease response, in most cases, is a set of reactive measures that follow the outcomes of the disease surveillance. Hence, timely surveillance is a prerequisite for an effective response. We apply epidemiological soundness criteria in combination with the Latent Influence Point Process and time-to-event models to construct a disease spread network. The network implicitly quantifies the fertility (whether a case leads to secondary cases) and reproduction (number of secondary cases per infectious case) of the cases as well as the size and generations (of the infection chain) of the outbreaks. We test our approach by applying it to historic dengue case data from Australia. Using the data, we empirically confirm that high morbidity relates positively with delay in disease response. Moreover, we identify what constitutes timely surveillance by applying various thresholds of disease response delay to the network and report their impact on case fertility, reproduction, number of generations and ultimately, outbreak size. We observe that enforcing a response delay threshold of 5 days leads to a large average reduction across all parameters (occurrence 87%, reproduction 83%, outbreak size 80% and outbreak generations 47%), whereas extending the threshold to 10 days, in comparison, significantly limits the effectiveness of the response actions. Lastly, we identify the components of the disease surveillance system that can be calibrated to achieve the identified thresholds. We identify practically achievable, timely surveillance thresholds (on temporal scale) that lead to an effective response and identify how they can be satisfied. Our approach can be utilized to provide guidelines on spatially and demographically targeted resource allocation for public awareness campaigns as well as to improve diagnostic abilities and turn-around times for the doctors and laboratories involved.",PloS one,2021-,"Najeebullah K, Liebig J, Darbro J, Jurdak R, Paini D",5,1990,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34134644,Vaccine completion and infectious diseases screening in a cohort of adult refugees following resettlement in the U.S.: 2013-2015.,"Refugees are frequently not immune to vaccine-preventable infections. Adherence to consensus guidelines on vaccination and infectious diseases screening among refugees resettling in the U.S. is unknown. We sought to determine rates of vaccine completion and infectious diseases screening in refugees following resettlement. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of refugees resettling in a region in the U.S. using medical data from June 2013-April 2015. We determined the proportion of vaccine-eligible refugees vaccinated with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), hepatitis A/B, tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap), and human papillomavirus (HPV) following resettlement. We also determined the proportion of refugees who completed HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) screening. One hundred and eleven subjects were included, primarily from Iraq (53%), Afghanistan (19%), and Eritrea (11%). Of the 84 subjects who were vaccine-eligible, 78 (93%) initiated and 42 (50%) completed vaccinations within one year of resettlement. Odds of completing vaccination were higher for men (OR: 2.38; 95%CI:1.02-5.71) and for subjects with English proficiency (OR: 3.70; 95%CI:1.04-17.49). Of the 78 subjects (70%) completing HIV screening, two (3%) were diagnosed with HIV. Nearly all subjects completed screening for HCV, and one had active infection. While most refugees initiate vaccinations, only 50% completed vaccinations and 70% completed HIV screening within 1 year of resettlement.

38937833,"Burden and trends of infectious disease mortality attributed to air pollution, unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene, and non-optimal temperature globally and in different socio-demographic index regions.","Environmental factors greatly impact infectious disease-related mortality, yet there's a lack of comprehensive global studies on the contemporary burden and trends. This study aims to evaluate the global burden and trends of infectious disease mortality caused by air pollution, unsafe water, poor sanitation, and non-optimal temperature across Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) regions from 1990 to 2019. This observational study utilized data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study to examine mortality rates from infectious diseases attributed to environmental risk factors between 1990 and 2019, including air pollution, unsafe water, sanitation, handwashing facilities (UWSH), and non-optimal temperatures. Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) were utilized to present infectious disease mortality, and its trajectory influenced by environmental risk factors over the years. Nonlinear regression was conducted to explore the association between the SDI and ASMRs across regions from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, global infectious disease deaths linked to air pollution, UWSH, and non-optimal temperature reached a startling 2,556,992. Disease mortality varied widely across SDI regions, with the highest number of deaths due to air pollution and UWSH in Low SDI regions, and deaths from non-optimal temperature primarily in High SDI regions. Age disparities emerged, with children under five and the elderly most affected. However, an increasing mortality trend was observed among seniors (65-69, 75-79, and over 80) in High SDI regions due to enteric infections linked to UWSH. Globally, a consistent decrease in ASMR was seen from 1990 to 2019 for all diseases connected to these factors, except for respiratory infections linked to non-optimal temperature. Our study underscores the significant impact of air pollution, UWSH, and non-optimal temperatures on global infectious disease mortality, particularly among vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly. It's important to tackle these challenges with targeted interventions aiming to enhance environmental quality, improve water and sanitation systems, and control extreme temperatures.

34656945,Characterization of Keterah orthonairovirus and evaluation of therapeutic candidates against Keterah orthonairovirus infectious disease.,"The species Keterah orthonairovirus is a member of the genus Orthonairovirus. Few studies have focused on this species, and there remains no treatment for Issyk-Kul fever, an infectious disease caused by a Keterah orthonairovirus. This study was performed to characterize this species using two viruses, Issyk-Kul virus (ISKV) and Soft tick bunyavirus (STBV), in cell culture and type I interferon receptor knockout (IFNAR-/-) mice and to evaluate the efficacy of serum transfusion using a mouse model of ISKV infection. The two viruses replicated in many kinds of mammal- and tick-derived cell lines but showed few different characteristics in tropism and antigenicity against anti-viral sera in cell culture. Neither virus caused clinical signs in wild-type mice, but both caused lethal infection in IFNAR-/- mice. ISKV caused more acute death than STBV in IFNAR-/- mice. In both viral infections in IFNAR-/- mice, macroscopic abnormalities were prominent in the liver. Similar levels of viral genome between ISKV- and STBV-infected IFNAR-/- mice were observed in blood, liver, lymphoid tissues and adrenal gland at moribund stages. Hematologic abnormalities in IFNAR-/- mice infected with these viruses, including leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, and biochemical abnormalities indicating liver damage were prominent. In addition, blood levels of many kinds of cytokines and chemokines such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were elevated. ISKV-immunized serum transfusion after infection delayed the time to death of IFNAR-/- mice. Thus, the present study showed that the species Keterah orthonairovirus could proliferate in most mammal-derived cell lines and cause severe liver lesions and death in IFNAR-/- mice and that serum transfusion might be effective in treatment against Issyk-Kul fever.",Ticks and tick-borne diseases,2022-Jan,"Sugimoto S, Suda Y, Nagata N, Fukushi S, Yoshikawa T, Kurosu T, Mizutani T, Saijo M, Shimojima M",9,1923,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

39148009,A novel method to select time-varying multivariate time series models for the surveillance of infectious diseases.,"Describing the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases across different regions is crucial for effective disease surveillance. The multivariate time series (MTS) model has been widely adopted for constructing cross-regional infectious disease transmission networks due to its strengths in interpretability and predictive performance. Nevertheless, the assumption of constant parameters frequently disregards the dynamic shifts in disease transmission rates, thereby compromising the accuracy of early warnings. This study investigated the applicability of time-varying MTS models in multi-regional infectious disease monitoring and explored strategies for model selection. This study focused on two prominent time-varying MTS models: the time-varying parameter-stochastic volatility-vector autoregression (TVP-SV-VAR) model and the time-varying VAR model using the generalized additive framework (tvvarGAM), and intended to explore and verify their applicable conditions for the surveillance of infectious diseases. For the first time, this study proposed the time delay coefficient and spatial sparsity indicators for model selection. These indicators quantify the temporal lags and spatial distribution of infectious disease data, respectively. Simulation study adopted from real-world infectious disease surveillance was carried out to compare model performances under various scenarios of spatio-temporal variation as well as random volatility. Meanwhile, we illustrated how the modelling process could help the surveillance of infectious diseases with an application to the influenza-like case in Sichuan Province, China. When the spatio-temporal variation was small (time delay coefficient: 0.1-0.2, spatial sparsity:0.1-0.3), the TVP-SV-VAR model was superior with smaller fitting residuals and standard errors of parameter estimation than those of the tvvarGAM model. In contrast, the tvvarGAM model was preferable when the spatio-temporal variation increased (time delay coefficient: 0.2-0.3, spatial sparsity: 0.6-0.9). This study emphasized the importance of considering spatio-temporal variations when selecting appropriate models for infectious disease surveillance. By incorporating our novel indicators-the time delay coefficient and spatial sparsity-into the model selection process, the study could enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of infectious disease monitoring efforts. This approach was not only valuable in the context of this study, but also has broader implications for improving time-varying MTS analyses in various applications.",BMC infectious diseases,2024-Aug,"Yu J, Wang H, Chen M, Han X, Deng Q, Yang C, Zhu W, Ma Y, Yin F, Weng Y, Yang C, Zhang T",12,2566,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

References for this review were identified through searches of MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, biorXiv, ACM Digital Library, arXiV and IEEE Xplore Digital Library up to July 2019. We found 60 unique ML-clinical decision support systems (ML-CDSS) aiming to assist ID clinicians. Overall, 37 (62%) focused on bacterial infections, 10 (17%) on viral infections, nine (15%) on tuberculosis and four (7%) on any kind of infection. Among them, 20 (33%) addressed the diagnosis of infection, 18 (30%) the prediction, early detection or stratification of sepsis, 13 (22%) the prediction of treatment response, four (7%) the prediction of antibiotic resistance, three (5%) the choice of antibiotic regimen and two (3%) the choice of a combination antiretroviral therapy. The ML-CDSS were developed for intensive care units (n = 24, 40%), ID consultation (n = 15, 25%), medical or surgical wards (n = 13, 20%), emergency department (n = 4, 7%), primary care (n = 3, 5%) and antimicrobial stewardship (n = 1, 2%).

This study aimed to evaluate healthcare-seeking behavior and out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure in a sample of the population in Erbil, Iraq. We conducted this cross-sectional study in Erbil, Kurdistan Region of Iraq, from October to December 2023. A convenience sample of 414 adults completed a self-administered online survey. The following data were collected: recent illness, sociodemographic characteristics, type of healthcare received, and cost of healthcare. The most common health conditions reported were communicable diseases (16.3%), musculoskeletal problems (13.1%), and noncommunicable diseases (12.7%). Approximately 85% of patients with health conditions requiring care sought healthcare; most visited private clinics (46.3%) and private hospitals (18.6%). The median total out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure in US dollars was 117.3 (interquartile range (IQR) = 45.6-410.0). The median total cost was much greater for participants who first visited a private health facility (USD 135.5, IQR = 57.3-405.6) than those who first visited a public facility (USD 76.8, IQR = 16.1-459.7). Participants ≥ 60 years spent significantly more than those < 14 years (USD 332, 95% CI = 211-453, p < 0.001). Evermarried participants spent significantly more than unmarried (USD 97, 95% CI = 1 to 192, p = 0.047). Health expenditures were significantly greater for noncommunicable diseases than infectious diseases (USD 232, 95% CI = 96-368, p = 0.001). After adjusting for covariates, age ≥ 60 years was independently associated with higher spending (USD 305, 95% CI = 153-457, p < 0.001). Most participants sought care from formal health services, preferring the private sector. Seeking care from private facilities incurred significantly higher costs than seeking care from public ones, which suggests potential barriers to accessing healthcare, particularly affordability.

32759252,Inferred duration of infectious period of SARS-CoV-2: rapid scoping review and analysis of available evidence for asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 cases.,"Our objective was to review the literature on the inferred duration of the infectious period of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, and provide an overview of the variation depending on the methodological approach. Rapid scoping review. Literature review with fixed search terms, up to 1 April 2020. Central tendency and variation of the parameter estimates for infectious period in (A) asymptomatic and (B) symptomatic cases from (1) virological studies (repeated testing), (2) tracing studies and (3) modelling studies were gathered. Narrative review of viral dynamics. Search strategies developed and the following searched: PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Additionally, the Health Information Quality Authority (Ireland) viral load synthesis was used, which screened literature from PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, NHS evidence, Cochrane, medRxiv and bioRxiv, and HRB open databases. There was substantial variation in the estimates, and how infectious period was inferred. One study provided approximate median infectious period for asymptomatic cases of 6.5-9.5 days. Median presymptomatic infectious period across studies varied over <1-4 days. Estimated mean time from symptom onset to two negative RT-PCR tests was 13.4 days (95% CI 10.9 to 15.8) but was shorter when studies included children or less severe cases. Estimated mean duration from symptom onset to hospital discharge or death (potential maximal infectious period) was 18.1 days (95% CI 15.1 to 21.0); time to discharge was on average 4 days shorter than time to death. Viral dynamic data and model infectious parameters were often shorter than repeated diagnostic data. There are limitations of inferring infectiousness from repeated diagnosis, viral loads and viral replication data alone and also potential patient recall bias relevant to estimating exposure and symptom onset times. Despite this, available data provide a preliminary evidence base to inform models of central tendency for key parameters and variation for exploring parameter space and sensitivity analysis.",BMJ open,2020-Aug,"Byrne AW, McEvoy D, Collins AB, Hunt K, Casey M, Barber A, Butler F, Griffin J, Lane EA, McAloon C, O'Brien K, Wall P, Walsh KA, More SJ",14,2113,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33640476,The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic on notifiable infectious diseases in Taiwan: A database analysis.,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of notifiable infectious diseases (NIDs) in Taiwan remains unclear. The number of cases of NID (n = 42) between January and September 2019 and 2020 were obtained from the open database from Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. The number of NID cases was 21,895 between January and September 2020, which was lower than the number of cases during the same period in 2019 (n = 24,469), with a decline in incidence from 102.9 to 91.7 per 100,000 people in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Fourteen airborne/droplet, 11 fecal-oral, seven vector-borne, and four direct-contact transmitted NID had an overall reduction of 2700 (-28.1%), 156 (-23.0%), 557 (-54.8%), and 73 (-45.9%) cases, respectively, from 2019 to 2020. Similar trends were observed for the changes in incidence, which were 11.5 (-28.4%), 6.7 (-23.4%), 2.4 (-55.0%), and 0.3 (-46.2%) per 100,000 people for airborne/droplet, fecal-oral, vector-borne, and direct-contact transmitted NID, respectively. In addition, all the 38 imported NID showed a reduction of 632 (-73.5%) cases from 2019 to 2020. In contrast, 4 sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) showed an increase of 903 (+7.2%) cases from 2019 to 2020, which was attributed to the increase in gonorrhea (from 3220 to 5028). The overall incidence of STDs increased from 52.5 to 56.0 per 100,000 people, with a percentage change of +6.7%. This study demonstrated a collateral benefit of COVID-19 prevention measures for various infectious diseases, except STDs, in Taiwan, during the COVID-19 epidemic.",Travel medicine and infectious disease,2021-,"Lai CC, Chen SY, Yen MY, Lee PI, Ko WC, Hsueh PR",6,1565,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

34265589,Monogenic autoimmunity and infectious diseases: the double-edged sword of immune dysregulation.,"The study of monogenic autoimmune diseases has provided key insights into molecular mechanisms involved in development of autoimmunity and immune tolerance. It has also become clear that such inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) frequently present clinically not only with autoimmune diseases, but also frequently have increased susceptibility to infection. The genes associated with monogenic autoimmunity influence diverse functional pathways, and the resulting immune dysregulation also impacts the complex and coordinated immune response to pathogens, for example type I interferon and cytokine signaling, the complement pathway and proper differentiation of the immune response. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted how monogenic autoimmunity can increase risk for serious infection with the discovery of severe disease in patients with pre-existing antibodies to Type I IFNs.

38734210,New technologies in therapeutic antibody development: The next frontier for treating infectious diseases.,"Adaptive immunity to viral infections requires time to neutralize and clear viruses to resolve infection. Fast growing and pathogenic viruses are quickly established, are highly transmissible and cause significant disease burden making it difficult to mount effective responses, thereby prolonging infection. Antibody-based passive immunotherapies can provide initial protection during acute infection, assist in mounting an adaptive immune response, or provide protection for those who are immune suppressed or immune deficient. Historically, plasma-derived antibodies have demonstrated some success in treating diseases caused by viral pathogens; nonetheless, limitations in access to product and antibody titer reduce success of this treatment modality. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have proven an effective alternative, as it is possible to manufacture highly potent and specific mAbs against viral targets on an industrial scale. As a result, innovative technologies to discover, engineer and manufacture specific and potent antibodies have become an essential part of the first line of treatment in pathogenic viral infections. However, a mAb targeting a specific epitope will allow escape variants to outgrow, causing new variant strains to become dominant and resistant to treatment with that mAb. Methods to mitigate escape have included combining mAbs into cocktails, creating bi-specific or antibody drug conjugates but these strategies have also been challenged by the potential development of escape mutations. New technologies in developing antibodies made as recombinant polyclonal drugs can integrate the strength of poly-specific antibody responses to prevent mutational escape, while also incorporating antibody engineering to prevent antibody dependent enhancement and direct adaptive immune responses.",Antiviral research,2024-Jul,"Keating SM, Higgins BW",2,1821,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

In this retrospective 6-year study, we examined the epidemiology of fever of unknown origin (FUO) in Greece over the past years. Forty-eight patients with classical FUO were included. The proportion of infectious causes of FUO (29.2%) was similar to previous studies in Greece and all infections were endemic to the area. Disease-related mortality was 12.5% and no deaths due to infection were recorded. In conclusion, none of the diagnosed infectious causes of FUO raised concerns about the possibility of imported diseases or pathogens.

35675285,Infectious diseases in free-range compared to conventional poultry production.,"Commercial chicken production for the supply of meat and eggs has expanded in the scale and variety of production systems in use to facilitate the supply of a range of cost-effective products in response to consumer demand. In the egg sector, traditional cage systems were required to be replaced in the EU by 2012, and most of this production capacity has been replaced by colony cage systems, which provide more space, perching, and environmental enrichment. In some countries there is significant production of ""cage-free"" or ""barn"" eggs in which the birds remain housed, but have access to litter. In the UK most egg production is now free-range. Meat poultry is produced in ""barn"" systems with various enrichments and some free-range. The rise in free-range production has seen the return of some diseases. Biosecurity is a critical tool for disease control in all production systems, particularly when disease challenge is high or farms are in a high poultry density area. An infectious dose of a pathogen is important in determining outcomes in terms of health and productivity, so biosecurity, hygiene, and good management are important across many diseases. Infections which are notifiable, of zoonotic importance and those which are sporadic or endemic in commercial poultry production are reviewed. General principles of preventative medicine applicable to the control of infectious diseases in different poultry production systems are proposed in areas such as biosecurity, system design and maintenance, range, and vaccination, though good management is always important.",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,2022-Oct,McMullin P,1,1584,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39488038,FGL2: A new target molecule for coagulation and immune regulation in infectious disease.,"Infectious diseases are complex inflammatory-immunologic host responses caused by various pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi. In the process of infectious disease development, immune cells are activated, and a substantial number of inflammatory factors are released within the endothelium, which results in coagulation activation and the formation of intravascular thrombi. Furthermore, infection-induced hypercoagulability amplifies the inflammatory response and immune dysregulation. Emerging evidence suggests that fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) has a crucial role in facilitating procoagulant, pro-inflammatory, and immune-regulatory responses in various infectious diseases. This review illustrates the complex procoagulation and immunoregulatory roles of FGL2, suggesting it could be a target for novel immune interventions in intractable infectious diseases.",International immunopharmacology,2024-Dec,"Wang C, Sun H, Wang R, Ma X, Sun Y",5,891,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38849257,Freshwater sports and infectious diseases: A narrative review.,"Freshwater sports involve a wide range of practices leading to contact with soil and water that can entail exposure to agents of potential infectious diseases. The pathogens can be multiple (bacteria, parasites, viruses, fungi), and be either well-known or more unfamiliar and exotic. We conducted a literature review to describe various infections contracted following exposure to water and mud during freshwater sport activities. Out of the 1011 articles identified, 50 were finally included. Our findings encompassed bacterial infections (leptospirosis and gastrointestinal infections); parasitic infections (schistosomiasis, cercarial dermatitis); viral infections (norovirus and other gastrointestinal viruses; seaweed contamination; and fungal infections. These infections were reported in various countries worldwide among diverse freshwater sport activities, including swimming, surfing, kayaking, as well as extreme sports such as adventure races and mud runs. Water sports in freshwater can expose participants to infectious risks according to geographical location and type of sport. Because regular sport practice is beneficial for health, freshwater sports should not be avoided due to potential exposure to pathogens; that much said, certain precautions should be taken. In addition to adoption of preventive measures, participants should be informed about infectious risks and seek medical advice if symptoms appear after exposure. Current guidelines for assessment of bathing water quality do not suffice to ensure comprehensive evaluation of freshwater quality. Event organizers are called upon to pay close attention to environmental factors and meteorological events, to conduct timely sensitization campaigns, and to enforce appropriate safety measures.",Infectious diseases now,2024-Jun,"Delamare H, Septfons A, Alfandari S, Mailles A",4,1773,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

As a new pathogen detection method, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has a wide detection range and can detect bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, rare pathogens, and even unknown pathogens. The technique of mNGS is unbiased and can rapidly, efficiently, and accurately obtain all nucleic acid information in test samples, analyze pathogens, and guide clinical diagnosis and treatment, thereby playing an important role in complicated infectious diseases.

38372324,Microfluidic systems for infectious disease diagnostics.,"Microorganisms, encompassing both uni- and multicellular entities, exhibit remarkable diversity as omnipresent life forms in nature. They play a pivotal role by supplying essential components for sustaining biological processes across diverse ecosystems, including higher host organisms. The complex interactions within the human gut microbiota are crucial for metabolic functions, immune responses, and biochemical signalling, particularly through the gut-brain axis. Viruses also play important roles in biological processes, for example by increasing genetic diversity through horizontal gene transfer when replicating inside living cells. On the other hand, infection of the human body by microbiological agents may lead to severe physiological disorders and diseases. Infectious diseases pose a significant burden on global healthcare systems, characterized by substantial variations in the epidemiological landscape. Fast spreading antibiotic resistance or uncontrolled outbreaks of communicable diseases are major challenges at present. Furthermore, delivering field-proven point-of-care diagnostic tools to the most severely affected populations in low-resource settings is particularly important and challenging. New paradigms and technological approaches enabling rapid and informed disease management need to be implemented. In this respect, infectious disease diagnostics taking advantage of microfluidic systems combined with integrated biosensor-based pathogen detection offers a host of innovative and promising solutions. In this review, we aim to outline recent activities and progress in the development of microfluidic diagnostic tools. Our literature research mainly covers the last 5 years. We will follow a classification scheme based on the human body systems primarily involved at the clinical level or on specific pathogen transmission modes.

This study more focused on the prevalence of communicable diseases, including COVID-19 that is an emerging pandemic, which affects the global economy. The objective of the study is to examine the impact of population density, lack of sanitation facilities, chemical concentration, fossil fuel combustions, poverty incidence, and healthcare expenditures on communicable diseases including COVID-19. The study covered a large panel of heterogenous countries to assess the relationships between the stated factors by using the robust least square regression, Granger causality test, and innovation accounting matrix. The study used a time series data from 2010 to 2019 for assessing the determinants of communicable diseases, while it is further extended with the current data of 2019-2020 for the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the study show that high population density, lack of primary handwashing facilities, chemicals used in manufacturing value-added fossil fuel combustion, and poverty headcount substantially increase communicable diseases. In contrast, population diffusion, low carbon concentration in air, renewable fuels, and healthcare expenditures decrease infectious diseases in a panel of 78 countries. The causal inferences found the bidirectional relationship between communicable diseases and primary handwashing facility, and carbon emissions and poverty headcount, whereas the unidirectional relationship is running from lack of sanitation to infectious diseases, economic growth to carbon emissions, and communicable diseases to fossil fuel combustion across countries.

31785089,Network analysis of pig movements in Argentina: Identification of key farms in the spread of infectious diseases and their biosecurity levels.,"This study uses network analysis to evaluate how swine movements in Argentina could contribute to disease spread. Movement data for the 2014-2017 period were obtained from Argentina's online livestock traceability registry and categorized as follows: animals of high genetic value sent to other farms, animals to or from markets, animals sent to finisher operations and slaughterhouse. A network analysis was carried out considering the first three movement types. First, descriptive, centrality and cohesion measures were calculated for each movement type and year. Next, to determine whether networks had a small-world topology, these were compared with the results from random Erdös-Rényi network simulations. Then, the basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub> ) of the genetic network, the group of farms with higher potential for disease spread standing at the top of the production chain, was calculated to identify farms acting as super-spreaders. Finally, their external biosecurity scores were evaluated. The genetic network in Argentina presented a scale-free and small-world topology. Thus, we estimate that disease spread would be fast, preferably to highly connected nodes and with little chances of being contained. Throughout the study, 31 farms were identified as super-spreaders in the genetic network for all years, while other 55 were super-spreaders at least once, from an average of 1,613 farms per year. Interestingly, removal of less than 5% of higher degree and betweenness farms resulted in a >90% reduction of R<sub>0</sub> indicating that few farms have a key role in disease spread. When biosecurity scores of the most relevant super-spreaders were examined, it was evident that many were at risk of introducing and disseminating new pathogens across the whole of Argentina's pig production network. These results highlight the usefulness of establishing targeted surveillance and intervention programmes, emphasizing the need for better biosecurity scores in Argentinean swine production units, especially in super-spreader farms.",Transboundary and emerging diseases,2020-May,"Alarcón LV, Cipriotti PA, Monterubbianessi M, Perfumo C, Mateu E, Allepuz A",6,2059,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39560601,Diagnostic electron microscopy in human infectious diseases - Methods and applications.,"Diagnostic electron microscopy (EM) is indispensable in all cases of infectious diseases which deserve or profit from the detection of the entire pathogen (i.e. the infectious unit). The focus of its application has shifted during the last decades from routine diagnostics to diagnostics of special cases, emergencies and the investigation of disease pathogenesis. While the focus of application has changed, the methods remain more or less the same. However, since the number of cases for diagnostic EM has declined as the number of laboratories that are able to perform such investigations, the preservation of the present knowledge is important. The aim of this article is to provide a review of the methods and strategies which are useful for diagnostic EM related to infectious diseases in our days. It also addresses weaknesses as well as useful variants or extensions of established methods. The main techniques, negative staining and thin section EM, are described in detail with links to suitable protocols and more recent improvements, such as thin section EM of small volume suspensions. Sample collection, transport and conservation/inactivation are discussed. Strategies of sample examination and requirements for a proper recognition of structures are outlined. Finally, some examples for the actual application of diagnostic EM related to infectious diseases are presented.

33918325,Recent Advances of Field-Effect Transistor Technology for Infectious Diseases.,"Field-effect transistor (FET) biosensors have been intensively researched toward label-free biomolecule sensing for different disease screening applications. High sensitivity, incredible miniaturization capability, promising extremely low minimum limit of detection (LoD) at the molecular level, integration with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology and last but not least label-free operation were amongst the predominant motives for highlighting these sensors in the biosensor community. Although there are various diseases targeted by FET sensors for detection, infectious diseases are still the most demanding sector that needs higher precision in detection and integration for the realization of the diagnosis at the point of care (PoC). The COVID-19 pandemic, nevertheless, was an example of the escalated situation in terms of worldwide desperate need for fast, specific and reliable home test PoC devices for the timely screening of huge numbers of people to restrict the disease from further spread. This need spawned a wave of innovative approaches for early detection of COVID-19 antibodies in human swab or blood amongst which the FET biosensing gained much more attention due to their extraordinary LoD down to femtomolar (fM) with the comparatively faster response time. As the FET sensors are promising novel PoC devices with application in early diagnosis of various diseases and especially infectious diseases, in this research, we have reviewed the recent progress on developing FET sensors for infectious diseases diagnosis accompanied with a thorough discussion on the structure of Chem/BioFET sensors and the readout circuitry for output signal processing.

It will strengthen the immunity and reduce the risks of infections. In this paper, a new delayed epidemic model with interim-immune and mixed vaccination strategy is studied. The diseasefree periodic solution is obtained by twice stroboscopic mapping and the corresponding dynamical behavior is analyzed. We determine a threshold parameter <i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, the disease-free periodic solution is proved to be global attractive if <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> < 1. We also establish a threshold parameter <i>R</i><sub>2</sub> for the permanence of the model, i.e., if <i>R</i><sub>2</sub> > 1, the infectious disease will exist persistently. Then, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results intuitively. In particular, a practical application for newtype TB vaccine under mixed vaccination strategy is presented, based on the proposed theory and the data reported by NBSC. The mixed vaccination strategy can achieve the End TB goal formulated by WHO in limited time. Our study will help public health agency to design mixed control strategy which can reduce the burden of infectious diseases.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2020-May,"Liu SY, Shen MW, Bi YJ",3,1224,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32920842,A marginal moment matching approach for fitting endemic-epidemic models to underreported disease surveillance counts.,"Count data are often subject to underreporting, especially in infectious disease surveillance. We propose an approximate maximum likelihood method to fit count time series models from the endemic-epidemic class to underreported data. The approach is based on marginal moment matching where underreported processes are approximated through completely observed processes from the same class. Moreover, the form of the bias when underreporting is ignored or taken into account via multiplication factors is analyzed. Notably, we show that this leads to a downward bias in model-based estimates of the effective reproductive number. A marginal moment matching approach can also be used to account for reporting intervals which are longer than the mean serial interval of a disease. The good performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated in simulation studies. An extension to time-varying parameters and reporting probabilities is discussed and applied in a case study on weekly rotavirus gastroenteritis counts in Berlin, Germany.",Biometrics,2021-Dec,"Bracher J, Held L",2,1037,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

In particular, the use of treatments against infectious diseases creates variation in quality among hosts, which can have both epidemiological and evolutionary consequences. We present a general theoretical model to highlight the consequences of different imperfect treatments on pathogen prevalence and evolution. These treatments differ in their action on host and pathogen traits. In contrast with previous studies, we assume that treatment coverage can vary in time, as in seasonal or pulsed treatment strategies. We show that periodic treatment strategies can limit both disease spread and virulence evolution, depending on the type of treatment. We also introduce a new method to analytically calculate the selection gradient in periodic environments, which allows our predictions to be interpreted using the concept of reproductive value, and can be applied more generally to analyse eco-evolutionary dynamics in class-structured populations and fluctuating environments.",Proceedings.

37910560,Donor call simulation: A novel medical education tool to evaluate trainees' clinical decision-making in transplant infectious disease.,"Evaluating organ suitability for transplantation based on infection risk is a core competency in transplant infectious disease (TID). It is unclear if trainees have opportunities to practice during training. We created a simulation curriculum to develop and evaluate this skill among infectious disease (ID) trainees. We created six simulation questions about organ suitability for transplant based on infection risk. During trainees' TID rotations, faculty texted or paged the simulation cases posing as the transplant coordinator. Trainees had 15 min to ask questions before deciding the suitability of the organ and explained their clinical reasoning in a survey. Trainees completed a post-simulation survey to evaluate its effectiveness. ID trainees, including residents and fellows on rotation, from seven centers participated. Eighty-seven percent (13/15) of trainees felt the simulation was effective in teaching them this concept, and 80% (12/15) felt prepared for clinical practice. The proportion of correct responses was generally high among the six different cases (43%-100%); correct responses increased for some cases in the post-activity survey. Of the 100 clinical reasoning decisions made during the activity, 19% were discordant, where the trainee correctly identified suitable organs for incorrect reasons. Our simulation was effective in teaching when to accept or reject an organ for transplant and was a valuable educational tool. By evaluating clinical reasoning for decisions our simulation provides educators with nuanced insight and allows for targeted coaching. This study demonstrates a critical need for further educational tools in TID.",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,2023-Dec,"Sigler R, Wooten D, Kumar RN, Hand J, Marschalk N, Go R, Prakash K, Stohs E, Schaenman J, Law N",10,1666,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35240551,iNKT cell agonists as vaccine adjuvants to combat infectious diseases.,"iNKT cells are a special type of T cell that acts as a link between the innate and adaptive immune systems, with the capacity to stimulate a wide range of cell types. The glycolipid α-galactosylceramide (αGC) is a robust agonist of iNKT cells and induces the secretion of Th1- and Th2-type cytokines. αGC and its analogs are widely used as adjuvants to enhance immune responses against viral, parasitic, and bacterial pathogens. This review first discusses the challenges of using free αGC as a vaccine adjuvant to treat infectious diseases. We next present strategies to realize the potential of the adjuvant effect of iNKT cell glycolipids, including (1) the use of Th1- or Th2-biasing αGC analogs, (2) covalent conjugation of glycolipid with antigen, (3) particulate vehicle-assisted delivery of glycolipid, (4) glycolipid-loaded cellular systems, (5) glycolipid combination with other immunostimulants, and (6) usage as mucosal adjuvants.

An online survey comprising 22 questions was sent via a secure electronic tool to the investigating physician of each of the 342 NEAT ID study centres across 15 European countries in November 2020. In total, 50 sites from 12 countries responded (15% response rate). Most sites were in Western Europe, two were in Poland, and one was in Hungary. Of the responding sites, 45 provided PrEP services for a total of 27 416 PrEP users, with 1361 new PrEP initiators each month. These centres supplied PrEP for men who have sex with men (100%), people who inject drugs (84%), sex workers (84%), women (62%), and transgender women (31%). PrEP persistence after 1 year was >90%, 75%-90%, and 40%-75% in 17, 24, and 4 centres, respectively. In total, 32/45 (71%) centres reported strong community-based organization commitment at their site, and 15/45 (33%) centres developed task-shifting processes to deliver PrEP through nurses (11/15), pharmacists (5/15), and key-population peers (2/15). The biggest barriers to implementation of PrEP were low awareness of and knowledge about PrEP (47%), unwillingness to disclose sexual identity or at-risk behaviour (36%), and lack of administrative support (29%).

38127642,"Causes of death among international travellers in Peru, 2017 to 2021.","The wellbeing and safety of international tourists is a paramount concern for governments and stakeholders. Mortality among travellers and the causes of death serve as a significant metric of destination safety. We describe the epidemiology and causes of death among international travellers in Peru. Data retrieved from the Peruvian government's deaths certificates registry included all non-residents who died between January 2017 and December 2021. We analysed the national incidence and causes of death among international travellers in Peru. Causes of death were classified into non-communicable diseases (NCD), communicable diseases and injuries. We classified fatalities according to the existence of preventive measures that could be provided during the travel medicine consultation to decrease the risk. We obtained records from 1514 deaths among international travellers (973 males, 64%). The incidence increased from 0.2 deaths per 10 000 travellers in 2017 to 9.9 in 2021. NCDs were the most common causes of death (n = 560, 37%), followed by communicable diseases (n = 487, 32%), and injuries (n = 321, 21%). Causes of death were unknown in 9.7% of the records. The leading causes of death in these categories were cancer, cardiovascular disease, COVID-19 and trauma. We found similar sex distribution of NCDs in travellers aged >50 years and higher rates of communicable diseases among males across all ages. Injury-associated deaths were significantly higher among males aged 18-29 years (P < 0.001) compared with other sex-age groups. We estimated that for 57.7% of deaths risk could have been decreased through pre-travel advice. Rates of deaths among travellers to Peru increased over time. Most deaths were due to NCDs, followed by communicable diseases and injuries. Pre-travel medical optimization and effective advice focused on age-sex and destination specific risks could reduce risk among travellers. Increased awareness among travel medicine practitioners and improvement of emergency medical response systems in Peru could decrease mortality.",Journal of travel medicine,2024-Jan,"Allel K, Cabada MM, Lau C, Mills D, Franklin RC, Zhu Y, Furuya-Kanamori L",7,2069,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The advancement of the digital age has led to a revision of the ASSURED criteria to REASSURED: Real-time connectivity, Ease of specimen collection, Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipment-free or simple, and Deliverable to end-users. Many diagnostic tests have been developed that aim to satisfy the REASSURED criteria; however, most of them only detect a single target. With the progression of syndromic infections, coinfections and the current antimicrobial resistance challenges, the need for multiplexed diagnostics is now more important than ever.

35593400,A Review of the Ring Trial Design for Evaluating Ring Interventions for Infectious Diseases.,"In trials of infectious disease interventions, rare outcomes and unpredictable spatiotemporal variation can introduce bias, reduce statistical power, and prevent conclusive inferences. Spillover effects can complicate inference if individual randomization is used to gain efficiency. Ring trials are a type of cluster-randomized trial that may increase efficiency and minimize bias, particularly in emergency and elimination settings with strong clustering of infection. They can be used to evaluate ring interventions, which are delivered to individuals in proximity to or contact with index cases. We conducted a systematic review of ring trials, compare them with other trial designs for evaluating ring interventions, and describe strengths and weaknesses of each design. Of 849 articles and 322 protocols screened, we identified 26 ring trials, 15 cluster-randomized trials, 5 trials that randomized households or individuals within rings, and 1 individually randomized trial. The most common interventions were postexposure prophylaxis (n = 23) and focal mass drug administration and screening and treatment (n = 7). Ring trials require robust surveillance systems and contact tracing for directly transmitted diseases. For rare diseases with strong spatiotemporal clustering, they may have higher efficiency and internal validity than cluster-randomized designs, in part because they ensure that no clusters are excluded from analysis due to zero cluster incidence. Though more research is needed to compare them with other types of trials, ring trials hold promise as a design that can increase trial speed and efficiency while reducing bias.",Epidemiologic reviews,2022-Dec,"Butzin-Dozier Z, Athni TS, Benjamin-Chung J",3,1650,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Rather than view these in isolation, there are important lessons pertaining to how best to contend with future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. Those lessons span definition (i.e., what constitutes a pandemic), through deficiencies in surveillance, data collection and reporting, the execution of research in a rapidly changing environment, the nuances of study design and hierarchy of clinical evidence, triage according to clinical need as supply chains become overwhelmed, and the challenges surrounding forecasting of outbreaks.

38472283,General protocol for predicting outbreaks of infectious diseases in social networks.,"Epidemic spreading on social networks with quenched connections is strongly influenced by dynamic correlations between connected nodes, posing theoretical challenges in predicting outbreaks of infectious diseases. The quenched connections introduce dynamic correlations, indicating that the infection of one node increases the likelihood of infection among its neighboring nodes. These dynamic correlations pose significant difficulties in developing comprehensive theories for threshold determination. Determining the precise epidemic threshold is pivotal for diseases control. In this study, we propose a general protocol for accurately determining epidemic thresholds by introducing a new set of fundamental conditions, where the number of connections between individuals of each type remains constant in the stationary state, and by devising a rescaling method for infection rates. Our general protocol is applicable to diverse epidemic models, regardless of the number of stages and transmission modes. To validate our protocol's effectiveness, we apply it to two widely recognized standard models, the susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible model and the contact process model, both of which have eluded precise threshold determination using existing sophisticated theories. Our results offer essential tools to enhance disease control strategies and preparedness in an ever-evolving landscape of infectious diseases.",Scientific reports,2024-Mar,"Kwon S, Park JM",2,1427,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The need to address this knowledge gap is especially urgent in South America, which has the fastest growing prison population in the world. In Brazil, insufficient data have precluded our understanding of all-cause and cause-specific mortality during and after incarceration. We linked incarceration and mortality databases for the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul to obtain a retrospective cohort of 114,751 individuals with recent incarceration. Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2018, we identified 3,127 deaths of individuals with recent incarceration (705 in detention and 2,422 following release). We analyzed age-standardized, all-cause, and cause-specific mortality rates among individuals detained in different facility types and following release, compared to non-incarcerated residents. We additionally modeled mortality rates over time during and after incarceration for all causes of death, violence, or suicide. Deaths in custody were 2.2 times the number reported by the national prison administration (n = 317). Incarcerated men and boys experienced elevated mortality, compared with the non-incarcerated population, due to increased risk of death from violence, suicide, and communicable diseases, with the highest standardized incidence rate ratio (IRR) in semi-open prisons (2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0 to 2.8), police stations (3.1; 95% CI: 2.5 to 3.9), and youth detention (8.1; 95% CI: 5.9 to 10.8). Incarcerated women experienced increased mortality from suicide (IRR = 6.0, 95% CI: 1.2 to 17.7) and communicable diseases (IRR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.1 to 5.0). Following release from prison, mortality was markedly elevated for men (IRR = 3.0; 95% CI: 2.8 to 3.1) and women (IRR = 2.4; 95% CI: 2.1 to 2.9). The risk of violent death and suicide was highest immediately post-release and declined over time; however, all-cause mortality remained elevated 8 years post-release. The limitations of this study include inability to establish causality, uncertain reliability of data during incarceration, and underestimation of mortality rates due to imperfect database linkage. Incarcerated individuals in Brazil experienced increased mortality from violence, suicide, and communicable diseases. Mortality was heightened following release for all leading causes of death, with particularly high risk of early violent death and elevated all-cause mortality up to 8 years post-release.

This study aimed to investigate the trends in infectious and parasitic disease (IPD) hospital admissions (HA) in England and Wales between 1999 and 2019. This is an ecological study using publicly available data taken from the Hospital Episode Statistics database in England and the Patient Episode Database for Wales. Hospital admission data were collected for the period between April 1999 to March 2019. IPDHA were identified using the tenth version of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases system, diagnostic codes (A00-B99). The trend in hospital admissions was assessed using a Poisson model. The overall annual number for IPD hospital admissions for various causes increased by 412.9%, from 151,336 in 1999 to 776,215 in 2019, representing an increase in hospital admission rate of 349.9% from 290.25 (95% CI 288.79-291.71) in 1999 to 1305.88 (95% CI 1303.00-1308.77) in 2019 per 100,000 persons: trend test, p < 0.01.

We determined the types and sites of infectious diseases and incident T2D using the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision codes (ICD-10). Time-varying Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the association. Infection burden was defined as the number of infection episodes over time and the number of co-occurring infections. Genetic risk score (GRS) for T2D consisted of 424 single nucleotide polymorphisms. During a median of 9.04 [IQR, 8.3-9.7] years of follow-up, hospital-treated infectious diseases were associated with a greater risk of T2D (adjusted HR [aHR] 1.54 [95 % CI 1.46-1.61]), with risk difference per 10,000 individuals equal to 154.1 [95 % CI 140.7-168.2]. The heightened risk persisted after 5 years following the index infection. Bacterial infection with sepsis had the strongest risk of T2D (aHR 2.95 [95 % CI 2.53-3.44]) among different infection types. For site-specific analysis, bloodstream infections posed the greatest risk (3.01 [95 % CI 2.60-3.48]). A dose-response association was observed between infection burden and T2D risk within each GRS tertile (p-trend <0.001). High genetic risk and infection synergistically increased the T2D risk. Infectious diseases were associated with an increased risk of subsequent T2D. The risk showed specificity according to types, sites, severity of infection and the period since infection occurred.

Diagnostic testing for infection can be challenging due to resource limitations, time constraints, or shortcomings in the accuracy of existing diagnostics. Rapid, simple diagnostics are highly desirable. There is increasing interest in the development of diagnostics that use exhaled breath analysis as a convenient and safe diagnostic method, as breath sampling is noninvasive, secure, and easy to perform. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in exhaled breath reflect the fingerprint of the underlying metabolic and biophysical processes during disease. In this review, we overview the major biomarkers present in exhaled breath in infectious diseases. We outline the promising recent advances in breath-based diagnosis of respiratory infections, including those caused by influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Aspergillus fumigatus. In addition, we review the current landscape of diagnosis of 2 other globally important infections: Helicobacter pylori gastrointestinal infection and malaria. Characteristic and reproducible breath VOCs are associated with several infectious diseases, suggesting breath analysis as a promising strategy for diagnostic development.

We aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on the other notifiable infectious diseases in China, including respiratory infectious diseases, diseases transmitted through the digestive tract and animal-borne diseases. Compared with 2019, the overall decline rate of respiratory infectious diseases in 2020 is the highest (60-90%), and the diseases transmitted by the digestive tract and animal-borne diseases are similar at 20-30%. Both hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases decreased significantly in February, and there were basically no significant changes in other months compared with previous years. The series of measures taken by China government to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 are also very effective in preventing the spread of respiratory infectious diseases.

38403268,Approach towards surveillance-based diagnosis of acute respiratory illness in India: Expert recommendations.,"Emerging infectious diseases, often zoonotic, demand a collaborative ""One-Health"" surveillance approach due to human activities. The need for standardized diagnostic and surveillance algorithms is emphasized to address the difficulty in clinical differentiation and curb antimicrobial resistance. The present recommendations are comprehensive diagnostic and surveillance algorithm for ARIs, developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which aims to enhance early detection and treatment with improved surveillance. This algorithm shall be serving as a blueprint for respiratory infections landscape in the country and early detection of surge of respiratory infections in the country. The ICMR has risen up to the threat of emerging and re-emerging infections. Here, we seek to recommend a structured approach for diagnosing respiratory illnesses. The recommendations emphasize the significance of prioritizing respiratory pathogens based on factors such as the frequency of occurrence (seasonal or geographical), disease severity, ease of diagnosis and public health importance. The proposed surveillance-based diagnostic algorithm for ARI relies on a combination of gold-standard conventional methods, innovative serological and molecular techniques, as well as radiological approaches, which collectively contribute to the detection of various causative agents. The diagnostic part of the integrated algorithm can be dealt at the local microbiology laboratory of the healthcare facility with the few positive and negative specimens shipped to linked viral disease research laboratories (VRDLs) and other ICMR designated laboratories for genome characterisation, cluster identification and identification of novel agents.",Indian journal of medical microbiology,2024-,"Manchanda V, Muralidharan J, Nischal N, Aggarwal K, Gupta S, Gupta N, Velayudhan A, Kaur H, Brijwal M, Chhabra M, Vishwanathan R, Dhodapkar R, Mahajan SK, Deol S, Sekhar JC, Mitra S, Saxena S, Kumar J, Garg A, Lodha R, Ravi V, Soneja M, Verghese VP, Rodrigues C",24,1739,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

These changes can only happen if our research work resonates in a meaningful way with the people who they are designed for, i.e. the healthcare professionals and the patients. This viewpoint stems from first-hand insights gained as a social scientist engaged in trials and primary care research amidst epidemics and pandemics. Some examples stemming from the EU Funded GRACE INTRO, RECOVER and Prudence trial illustrate these experiences. I outline how primary care can effectively address the pressing challenges it encounters, whether as researchers, members of the public, or healthcare professionals, and how to integrate successfully social sciences within clinical primary care research.

Here, we report nanoplasmonic on-chip PCR for rapid precision molecular diagnostics. The nanoplasmonic pillar arrays (NPA) comprise gold nanoislands on the top and sidewall of large-scale glass nanopillar arrays. The nanoplasmonic pillars enhance light absorption of a white light-emitting diode (LED) over the whole visible range due to strong electromagnetic hotspots between the nanoislands. As a result, they effectively induce photothermal heating for ultrafast PCR thermal cycling. The temperature profile of NPA exhibits 30 cycles between 98 and 60 °C for a total of 3 min and 30 s during the cyclic excitation of white LED light. The experimental results also demonstrate the rapid DNA amplification of both 0.1 ng μL<sup>-1</sup> of λ-DNA in 20 thermal cycles and 0.1 ng μL<sup>-1</sup> of complementary DNA of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 30 thermal cycles using a conventional PCR volume of 15 μL.

33863279,Online respondent-driven detection for enhanced contact tracing of close-contact infectious diseases: benefits and barriers for public health practice.,"Online respondent-driven detection (RDD) is a novel method of case finding that can enhance contact tracing (CT). However, the advantages and challenges of RDD for CT have not yet been investigated from the perspective of public health professionals (PHPs). Therefore, it remains unclear if, and under what circumstances, PHPs are willing to apply RDD for CT. Between March and April 2019, we conducted semi-structured interviews with Dutch PHPs responsible for CT in practice. Questions were derived from the 'diffusion of innovations' theory. Between May and June 2019, we distributed an online questionnaire among 260 Dutch PHPs to quantify the main qualitative findings. Using different hypothetical scenarios, we assessed anticipated advantages and challenges of RDD, and PHPs' intention to apply RDD for CT. Twelve interviews were held, and 70 PHPs completed the online questionnaire. A majority of questionnaire respondents (71%) had a positive intention towards using RDD for CT. Anticipated advantages of RDD were 'accommodating easy and autonomous participation in CT of index cases and contact persons', and 'reaching contact persons more efficiently'. Anticipated challenges were 'limited opportunities for PHPs to support, motivate, and coordinate the execution of CT', 'not being able to adequately convey measures to index cases and contact persons', and 'anticipated unrest among index cases and contact persons'. Circumstances under which PHPs anticipated RDD applicable for CT included index cases and contact persons being reluctant to share information directly with PHPs, digitally skilled and literate persons being involved, and large scale CT. Circumstances under which PHPs anticipated RDD less applicable for CT included severe consequences of missing information or contact persons for individual or public health, involvement of complex or impactful measures for index cases and contact persons, and a disease being perceived as severe or sensitive by index cases and their contact persons. PHPs generally perceived RDD as a potentially beneficial method for public health practice, that may help overcome challenges present in traditional CT, and could be used during outbreaks of infectious diseases that spread via close contact. The circumstances under which CT is performed, appear to strongly influence PHPs' intention to use RDD for CT.",BMC infectious diseases,2021-Apr,"Helms YB, Hamdiui N, Eilers R, Hoebe C, Dukers-Muijrers N, van den Kerkhof H, Timen A, Stein ML",8,2371,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33152622,Emergence of zoonoses such as COVID-19 reveals the need for health sciences to embrace an explicit eco-social conceptual framework of health and disease.,"An accurate understanding of why zoonoses such as SARS-CoV-2 are emerging at an increased rate, is vital to prevent future pandemics from the approximately 700,000 viruses with zoonotic potential. Certain authors have argued that the consumption of wildlife, or human contact with bats was responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Others argue that a range of anthropogenic environmental degradations have played a vital role in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and other zoonoses. In this opinion piece, I argue that these divergent viewpoints stem, in part, from different foundational conceptual frameworks - biomedical individualist and eco-social frameworks, respectively. Based on the fact that the eco-social framework provides a more complete account of the different types of causal factors underpinning the emergence of zoonoses, I propose that the COVID-19 pandemic provides an additional reason for the health sciences to ground its theory of health and disease in an eco-social conceptual framework.",Epidemics,2020-Dec,Kenyon C,1,1011,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38537494,Disease X epidemic control using a stochastic model and a deterministic approximation: Performance comparison with and without parameter uncertainties.,"The spread of infectious diseases can be modeled using deterministic or stochastic models. A deterministic approximation of a stochastic model can be appropriate under some conditions, but is unable to capture the discrete nature of populations. We look into the choice of a model from the perspective of decision making. We consider an emerging disease (Disease X) in a closed population modeled by a stochastic SIR model or its deterministic approximation. The objective of the decision maker is to minimize the cumulative number of symptomatic infected-days over the course of the epidemic by picking a vaccination policy. We consider four decision making scenarios: based on the stochastic model or the deterministic model, and with or without parameter uncertainty. We also consider different sample sizes for uncertain parameter draws and stochastic model runs. We estimate the average performance of decision making in each scenario and for each sample size. The model used for decision making has an influence on the picked policies. The best achievable performance is obtained with the stochastic model, knowing parameter values, and for a large sample size. For small sample sizes, the deterministic model can outperform the stochastic model due to stochastic effects. Resolving uncertainties may bring more benefit than switching to the stochastic model in our example. This article illustrates the interplay between the choice of a type of model, parameter uncertainties, and sample sizes. It points to issues to be considered when optimizing a stochastic model.",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,2024-Jun,"Flaig J, Houy N",2,1574,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32109112,Predicting the Speed of Epidemics Spreading in Networks.,"Global transport and communication networks enable information, ideas, and infectious diseases to now spread at speeds far beyond what has historically been possible. To effectively monitor, design, or intervene in such epidemic-like processes, there is a need to predict the speed of a particular contagion in a particular network, and to distinguish between nodes that are more likely to become infected sooner or later during an outbreak. Here, we study these quantities using a message-passing approach to derive simple and effective predictions that are validated against epidemic simulations on a variety of real-world networks with good agreement. In addition to individualized predictions for different nodes, we find an overall sudden transition from low density to almost full network saturation as the contagion progresses in time. Our theory is developed and explained in the setting of simple contagions on treelike networks, but we are also able to show how the method extends remarkably well to complex contagions and highly clustered networks.",Physical review letters,2020-Feb,"Moore S, Rogers T",2,1059,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37650399,Current status of infectious diseases among migrants and non-citizens in Malaysia.,"The mass movement of migrants to Malaysia for employment is one of the factors contributing to the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases in this country. Despite mandatory health screening for migrants seeking employment, prevalence records of infectious diseases amongst migrant populations in Malaysia are still within negligible proportions. Therefore, the present review highlights the incidence, mortality and overall status of infectious diseases amongst migrants' populations in Malaysia, which maybe be useful for impeding exacerbation of inequalities among them and improving our national health system thru robust and effective emergency responses in controlling the prevalent diseases found among these populations and maybe, Malaysian citizens too. Peer-reviewed articles from January 2016 to December 2020 were searched through online platform including SCOPUS, PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Non-peer-reviewed reports and publications from ministry and government websites including data from related agencies were also scoured from in order to ensure that there are no cases being overlooked, as most published articles did not have migrants as the research subjects. A total of 29 studies had been selected in the final analysis. Migrants in Malaysia were at higher risk for tuberculosis, malaria, lymphatic filariasis, cholera, leprosy and leptospirosis. Lymphatic filariasis was still endemic among this population while thousand cases of TB and cholera had been reported among them due to cramp living conditions and poor sanitation in their settlements respectively. While malaria had gradually decreased and become sporadic, the influx of migrant workers had led to the rising of imported malaria cases. Low cases of leprosy had been recorded in Malaysia but a significant proportion of it was contributed by migrant workers. As for leptospirosis, studies found that there are prominent cases among migrant workers, which particularly highest within workers with lower educational attainment. Infectious diseases are still prevalent among migrants in Malaysia due to various interplay factors including their working sectors, country of origin, immunization status, type of settlement, impoverished living conditions, and language and cultural barriers that impeding access to health facilities.",Tropical biomedicine,2023-Jun,"Mohd Putera NWS, Azman AS, Mohd Zain SN, Yahaya H, Lewis JW, Sahimin N",6,2341,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Arthropods infected while blood-feeding on rodents can also transmit rodent-borne pathogens indirectly to humans and animals. Environmental events, such as wet winters, cooler summers, heavy rains, and flooding, have precipitated regional rodent-borne infectious disease outbreaks; these outbreaks are now increasing with climate change. The objectives of this review are to inform wilderness medicine providers about the environmental conditions that can precipitate rodent-borne infectious disease outbreaks; to describe the regional geographic distributions of rodent-borne infectious diseases in North America; and to recommend prophylactic treatments and effective prevention and control strategies for rodent-borne infectious diseases. To meet these objectives, Internet search engines were queried with keywords to identify scientific articles on outbreaks of the most common regional rodent-borne infectious diseases in North America. Wilderness medicine providers should maintain high levels of suspicion for regional rodent-borne diseases in patients who develop febrile illnesses after exposure to contaminated freshwater after heavy rains or floods and after swimming, rafting, or paddling in endemic areas. Public health education strategies should encourage limiting human contact with rodents; avoiding contact with or safely disposing of rodent excreta; avoiding contact with contaminated floodwaters, especially contact with open wounds; securely containing outdoor food stores; and modifying wilderness cabins and campsites to deter rodent colonization.",Wilderness & environmental medicine,2021-Sep,Diaz JH,1,1717,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This research is a part of the Mediterranean Convention of Human Rights project, which is an organizational work on human rights issues that was established in cooperation with civil society and the national authorities of the Mediterranean Region. Previously published data were collected by retrieving published literature from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science using ""climate change"", ""the Mediterranean region"", ""infections in Mediterranean Region"", ""infectious diseases"", ""biodiversity"", and ""the Mediterranean Sea"" as keywords. The collected data were then evaluated and reviewed. The recommendations and guidelines were analysed by the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). The Mediterranean region presents a typical example witnessing a dramatic change in climate events and their adverse impact on biodiversity, ecosystems and public health are multiple. This negative impact is in part due to the geographical particularities, and sociocultural and geopolitical conflicts that are progressively worsening the burden of climate change. While most of these changes cannot be totally avoided, many of the health risks related to climate change could be monitored. This can be done by establishing health systems with policies to reduce and prevent the risks of infectious diseases and to recover and support the affected areas, which may identify priority and management of high-risk events.",Journal of infection in developing countries,2023-Nov,"Dal T, Ramli I, Garaizar J",3,1611,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

People who inject drugs (PWID) and develop serious infections also face disparities in antibiotic management, particularly with regards to use of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT). We highlight literature on OPAT in PWID challenging the notion that PWID cannot be managed with OPAT. Given that OPAT use amongst PWID and non-PWID yields similar outcomes, we argue that a bias against OPAT use in PWID is unwarranted and may reflect stigma rather than data. We further note the proven value of comprehensive OUD treatment on endocarditis treatment outcomes, which also addresses the potential safety concerns of OPAT in PWID, and propose a treatment model in which Addiction and Infectious Disease specialists collaborate to integrate opioid use disorder treatment into injection drug use-associated infective endocarditis care.",Journal of addiction medicine,,"Cortes-Penfield N, Cawcutt K, Alexander BT, Karre VMM, Balasanova AA",5,1020,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35879909,Is Alzheimer's disease an infectious neurological disease? A review of the literature.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia around the globe. Its pathogenesis is characterized primarily by the extracellular deposition of amyloid β peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Despite the significant investments in neurological research, the exact molecular mechanism of AD pathogenesis is still not fully elucidated. Several studies converge on a hypothesis that pathogenic microbes might play a role in AD progression. Although this hypothesis has been considered relatively weak for decades, it has recently received considerable attention due to increasing evidence on the association between microorganisms and AD. There is a lack of experimental and scientific arguments conveying that these microorganisms engender cognitive and neuropathological deficits and modifications specific to AD, challenging the theory that it could be an infectious neurological disease. This review focuses on recent advances in the infection hypothesis and provides an overview of new findings portraying the significance of pathogenic microbes in AD and the challenges confronting the validity of the hypothesis. Data were collected from medical journals published on PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, and Embase bibliographical databases with a predefined search strategy. All articles considering neurological disorders, especially AD associated with infectious diseases, were included. This work focused on providing an overview of new findings around the relationship between microorganisms and AD, challenges facing the validity of the theory, and recommendations on how the scientific community can best develop alternative approaches to address the pathophysiology of AD. While many studies reinforce the suspicion of an infectious etiology of AD, it is important to note that it is yet not validated how microorganisms' presence in the brain can develop AD due to the limited available evidence. Certainly, ground-breaking work is mandatory in this field of research, and these reports so far warrant a thorough investigation into how a chronic infection may remain silent while progressing its neuroinflammation. Amid this uncertainty arises the hope that many researchers will take on this challenge and join this endeavor to benefit AD patients worldwide.",Brain and behavior,2022-Aug,"Uwishema O, Mahmoud A, Sun J, Correia IFS, Bejjani N, Alwan M, Nicholas A, Oluyemisi A, Dost B",9,2296,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

To achieve its strategic goals, it is important that ECDC improves its knowledge of prevention strategies, actors and activities in EU/EEA countries. In this Perspective, we summarise three challenges to implementing the prevention framework proposed by ECDC: (i) defining, recognising and identifying with 'prevention', (ii) integrating new understandings into established ways of thinking, and (iii) the need for more attention to prevention in governance. These challenges are derived from the findings of a project which conducted a preliminary mapping of prevention actors, networks and activities in four EU countries to support the development of a community of practice within the new ECDC prevention framework.

As technology advanced, so did mapping techniques. In the late 20th century, geographic information systems (GIS) revolutionized disease mapping by enabling researchers to overlay diverse datasets to visualise and analyse complex spatial patterns (Bergquist & Manda 2019; Hashtarkhani et al., 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic showed that disease mapping is particularly valuable for optimising prevention and control strategies of infectious diseases by prioritising geographical targeting interventions and containment strategies (Mohammadi et al., 2021). Today, with the aid of highresolution satellite imagery, geo-referenced electronic data collection systems, real-time data feeds, and sophisticated modelling algorithms, disease mapping has become a feasible and accessible tool for public health officials in tracking, managing, and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases at global, regional and local scales (Hay et al., 2013).

33059357,Insights from ancient DNA analysis of Egyptian human mummies: clues to disease and kinship.,"The molecular Egyptology field started in the mid-eighties with the first publication on the ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis of an Egyptian mummy. Egypt has been a major interest for historians, archeologists, laymen as well as scientists. The aDNA research on Egyptian biological remains has been fueled by their abundance and relatively well-preserved states through artificial mummification and by the advanced analytical techniques. Early doubts of aDNA integrity within the Egyptian mummies and data authenticity were later abated with studies proving successfully authenticated aDNA retrieval. The current review tries to recapitulate the published studies presenting paleogenomic evidence of disease diagnosis and kinship establishment for the Egyptian human remains. Regarding disease diagnosis, the prevailing literature was on paleogenomic evidence of infectious diseases in the human remains. A series of reports presented evidence for the presence of tuberculosis and/or malaria. In addition, there were solitary reports of the presence of leprosy, diphtheria, bacteremia, toxoplasmosis, schistosomiasis and leishmaniasis. On the contrary, paleogenomic evidence of the presence of rare diseases was quite scarce and mentioned only in two articles. On the other hand, kinship analysis of Egyptian human remains, including that of Tutankhamen, was done using both mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear DNA markers, to establish family relationships in four studies. It is clear that the field of molecular Egyptology is still a largely unexplored territory. Nevertheless, the paleogenomic investigation of Egyptian remains could make significant contributions to biomedical sciences (e.g. elucidation of coevolution of human host-microbe interrelationship) as well as to evidence-based archeology.",Human molecular genetics,2021-Apr,"Gad YZ, Hassan NA, Mousa DM, Fouad FA, El-Sayed SG, Abdelazeem MA, Mahdy SM, Othman HY, Ibrahim DW, Khairat R, Ismail S",11,1805,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Using a holistic and multidisciplinary approach and novel analytical methods, VITAL will provide tools that allow the development of targeted immunisation programs for ageing adults in European countries. The project is based on four pillars focussing on the assessment of the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases in ageing adults, the dissection of the mechanisms underlying immuno-senescence, the analysis of the clinical and economic public health impact of vaccination strategies and the development of educational resources for healthcare professionals. By the end of the project, a clear, detailed, and integrated program should be available for implementing a consistent, affordable, and sustainable vaccination strategy for ageing adults with regular evaluations of its impact over time.",Vaccine,2020-Aug,"Van Baarle D, Bollaerts K, Del Giudice G, Lockhart S, Luxemburger C, Postma MJ, Timen A, Standaert B",8,1568,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35341254,Global stability mathematical analysis for virus transmission model with latent age structure.,"Mathematical model is a very important method for the control and prevention of disease transmissing. Based on the communication characteristics of diseases, it is necesssery to add fast and slow process into the model of infectious diseases, which more effectively shows the transmission mechanism of infectious diseases. This paper proposes an age structure epidemic model with fast and slow progression. We analyze the model's dynamic properties by using the stability theory of differential equation under the assumption of constant population size. The very important threshold R<sub>0</sub> was calculated. If R<sub>0</sub><1, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, whereas if R<sub>0</sub>>1, the Lyapunov function is used to show that endemic equilibrium is globally stable. Through more in-depth analysis for basic reproduction number, we obtain the greater the rate of slow progression of an infectious disease, the fewer the threshold results. In addition, we also provided some numerical simulations to prove our result. Vaccines do not provide lifelong immunity, but can reduce the mortality of those infected. By vaccinating, the rate of patients entering slow progression increases and the threshold is correspondingly reduced. Therefore, vaccination can effectively control the transmission of Coronavirus. The theoretical incidence predicted by mathematical model can provide evidence for prevention and controlling the spread of the epidemic.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2022-Jan,"Ren S, Li L",2,1485,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34610978,Protecting privacy in mandatory reporting of infectious diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives from a developing country.,"Mandatory reporting of infectious diseases (MRID) is an essential practice to prevent disease outbreaks. Disease notification is a mandatory procedure for most infectious diseases, even during non-pandemic periods in healthcare. The main rationale behind MRID is the protection of public health. The information and data provided by infectious disease reports are used for many purposes, such as preventing the spread and potential negative impact of infectious diseases, assessing the national and global situation regarding reported diseases, conducting scientific research and planning health policy. In this context, the relevant information benefits public health, health systems and scientific work. Additionally, the follow up and treatment of individuals with infectious diseases is a necessity in certain cases to protect those who cohabit with them. However, these benefits cannot be accepted as unrestricted justifications for MRID, since it is evident that reporting should be conducted within ethical and legal boundaries. MRID should only be devised and implemented with due regard to balancing potential benefits between all individuals, as well as between the individual and the rest of society. Disease notification systems that are not designed with a balancing and harm-reductionist approach may lead to stigmatisation and discrimination. This study aims to investigate the legal framework and ethical issues regarding the reporting of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in Turkey-which is a primary example of a developing country.",Journal of medical ethics,2022-Dec,"Sert G, Mega E, Karaca Dedeoğlu A",3,1552,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

31541564,"A survey of veterinarians' knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding an emerging disease: Coccidioidomycosis in Washington State.","Coccidioides immitis is an emerging fungal pathogen in Washington State (WA). While the geographical boundaries of C. immitis in WA have not been well characterized, human infections have resulted from exposure in the south-central region of the state. Since 2010, only one dog has been identified as a probable locally acquired animal case, despite pilot canine serological surveys from south-central WA revealing a 9.8% seroprevalence. On the suspicion that clinical animal cases may be underdiagnosed and/or underreported, we assessed WA veterinarians' knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding coccidioidomycosis. All veterinarians with active licenses in WA were invited to complete a self-administered, web-based survey from November 2018 to January 2019. Four hundred and twenty-five of 2,211 (19.2%) veterinarians returned the survey and were eligible for inclusion in the final analysis. Nearly, all respondents (98.8%) had heard of coccidioidomycosis, but only 31.5% and 25.6% knew that locally acquired animal and human cases, respectively, had been reported in WA. Only half (52.6%) of participants knew that the disease was reportable. Fewer than 20% of respondents reported confidence that their knowledge of coccidioidomycosis was up to date, and 76.9% ""never"" or ""rarely"" considered the risk of disease in their patients. A statistically significant predictor of a high knowledge score (≥70%), however, included practicing in endemic counties where the Washington State Department of Health had previously delivered outreach and education services. While the results suggest some success with these activities, it is clear that information on the emergence of coccidioidomycosis is not adequately reaching veterinary practitioners in WA. The data support that more frequent CE opportunities, and dissemination of public health communications through veterinary-specific modalities, would help fill the knowledge gap. In turn, improved diagnosis and reporting of animal cases would assist in our overall understanding the epidemiology of coccidioidomycosis in WA.",Zoonoses and public health,2020-Feb,"James AE, McCall JR, Petersen KR, Wohrle RD, Oltean HN",5,2081,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38861711,Prospective Spatiotemporal Cluster Detection Using SaTScan: Tutorial for Designing and Fine-Tuning a System to Detect Reportable Communicable Disease Outbreaks.,"Staff at public health departments have few training materials to learn how to design and fine-tune systems to quickly detect acute, localized, community-acquired outbreaks of infectious diseases. Since 2014, the Bureau of Communicable Disease at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has analyzed reportable communicable diseases daily using SaTScan. SaTScan is a free software that analyzes data using scan statistics, which can detect increasing disease activity without a priori specification of temporal period, geographic location, or size. The Bureau of Communicable Disease's systems have quickly detected outbreaks of salmonellosis, legionellosis, shigellosis, and COVID-19. This tutorial details system design considerations, including geographic and temporal data aggregation, study period length, inclusion criteria, whether to account for population size, network location file setup to account for natural boundaries, probability model (eg, space-time permutation), day-of-week effects, minimum and maximum spatial and temporal cluster sizes, secondary cluster reporting criteria, signaling criteria, and distinguishing new clusters versus ongoing clusters with additional events. We illustrate how to support health equity by minimizing analytic exclusions of patients with reportable diseases (eg, persons experiencing homelessness who are unsheltered) and accounting for purely spatial patterns, such as adjusting nonparametrically for areas with lower access to care and testing for reportable diseases. We describe how to fine-tune the system when the detected clusters are too large to be of interest or when signals of clusters are delayed, missed, too numerous, or false. We demonstrate low-code techniques for automating analyses and interpreting results through built-in features on the user interface (eg, patient line lists, temporal graphs, and dynamic maps), which became newly available with the July 2022 release of SaTScan version 10.1. This tutorial is the first comprehensive resource for health department staff to design and maintain a reportable communicable disease outbreak detection system using SaTScan to catalyze field investigations as well as develop intuition for interpreting results and fine-tuning the system. While our practical experience is limited to monitoring certain reportable diseases in a dense, urban area, we believe that most recommendations are generalizable to other jurisdictions in the United States and internationally. Additional analytic technical support for detecting outbreaks would benefit state, tribal, local, and territorial public health departments and the populations they serve.",JMIR public health and surveillance,2024-Jun,"Levin-Rector A, Kulldorff M, Peterson ER, Hostovich S, Greene SK",5,2677,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The use of host-directed immunotherapy to treat infectious disease in inborn errors of immunity is currently limited but growing. Different strategies include depleting the cellular reservoir for pathogens with restricted cell-tropism; augmenting the diminished effector response; and restoring molecular equipoise. The immunotherapies illustrated are existing drugs that have been re-purposed and rationally used, depending on the molecular or cellular impact of the mutation. As more biologic response modifiers and molecular targeted therapies are developed for other indications, they open the avenues for their use in inborn errors of immunity. Conversely, as more molecular pathways underlying defective immune responses and refractory infections are elucidated, they lend themselves to tractability with these emerging therapies. Infections that fail appropriate antimicrobial therapy are a harbinger of underlying inborn errors of immunity. Dissecting the mechanism by which the immune system fails provides opportunities to target the host response and make it succeed.",Current opinion in pediatrics,2022-Dec,"Langelier MJ, Vinh DC",2,1289,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) was developed to improve the rationale use of antibiotics. The Choosing Wisely campaign was initiated to ameliorate medical practice through avoidance of unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Our objective was to give an overview on the Choosing Wisely recommendations related to AMS practices from a selection of different countries in order to define future needs. We evaluated the seven countries already analyzed for Choosing Wisely recommendations related to topics of infectious medicine before. Finally, we included five of the former countries (Australia/New Zealand, Canada, Italy, Switzerland, and USA) and Germany with easily accessible recommendations and selected those related to six categories of AMS as following: diagnostics, indication, choice of antiinfective drugs, dosing, application and duration of therapy. In total, 213 recommendations could be extracted related to AMS for the six countries and were matched to the chosen categories. Interestingly, no recommendations were found for the category ""dosing."" Topics related to indication and diagnostics were most frequently found with 85 and 78 recommendations, respectively. Perioperative prophylaxis was a frequently addressed issue - both related to application, indication and duration. Avoiding antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and upper respiratory tract infections were central topics of all countries. AMS is an important strategy to fight increasing resistance and is frequently addressed by Choosing Wisely recommendations of different countries.

Retrospective review. A combination of literature review and personal recollections are used. Although the broad term molecular diagnostics may encompass techniques to identify pathogens via protein or metabolomic signatures, this review concentrates on detection of pathogen nucleic acid as an indicator of infection. The introduction of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 1985 opened a new era in analysis of nucleic acids. This technique was soon applied to the detection of potential pathogen DNA and RNA, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites in infectious eye disease. Advances in PCR have allowed class-specific diagnostics (ie, pan-bacterial and pan-fungal), quantitation of pathogen DNA, and multiplexed testing. The Human Genome Project in the early 2000s greatly accelerated development of DNA sequencers, ushering in the era of ""Next Generation Sequencing"" and permitting pathogen-agnostic methods for the detection of potential infectious agents. Most recently, new technologies such as nanopore sequencing have reduced both cost and equipment requirements for whole-genome sequencing; when coupled with real-time sequence analysis methods, these methods offer the promise of true, real-time, point-of-service ocular infectious disease diagnostics. Molecular methods for pathogen detection have greatly advanced the diagnosis of ocular infectious disease. Further methodologic advances will have a direct impact on the management of these conditions.",American journal of ophthalmology,2022-Mar,Van Gelder RN,1,1573,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34494873,Natural-Product-Based Solutions for Tropical Infectious Diseases.,"About half of the world's population and 80% of the world's biodiversity can be found in the tropics. Many diseases are specific to the tropics, with at least 41 diseases caused by endemic bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. Such diseases are of increasing concern, as the geographic range of tropical diseases is expanding due to climate change, urbanization, change in agricultural practices, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity. While traditional medicines have been used for centuries in the treatment of tropical diseases, the active natural compounds within these medicines remain largely unknown. In this review, we describe infectious diseases specific to the tropics, including their causative pathogens, modes of transmission, recent major outbreaks, and geographic locations. We further review current treatments for these tropical diseases, carefully consider the biodiscovery potential of the tropical biome, and discuss a range of technologies being used for drug development from natural resources. We provide a list of natural products with antimicrobial activity, detailing the source organisms and their effectiveness as treatment.

Smartphone-based tests offer opportunities for microbiological diagnostics in remote areas and both resource-limited and resource-rich settings. Wireless connectivity may facilitate epidemiological studies and creation of spatiotemporal disease prevalence maps. However, the current analytical performance of many smartphone-based POC tests must be improved and carefully validated in clinical settings by comparison with current diagnostic standards.

A pre-post study was performed during 2020-2023 to investigate the impact of the STREAM (Solid organ TRansplant stEwArdship and Multidisciplinary approach) intervention to improve IS in SOT. The intervention, performed in 2022, included the implementation of IS through educational meetings, local guidelines, and the availability of a digital screening tool. The objective of the study was the assessment of IS completion, including a list of 17 laboratory tests and the investigation of vaccination status. The reduction of unnecessary tests was also analyzed. The test of proportions and a multilevel multivariate Poisson regression model were used to compare IS completion before and after STREAM. infectious diseases (ID) consultation and urgent evaluation were investigated as predictors of IS completion. A total of 171 patients were enrolled, including liver (44%), heart (32%), and kidney (24%) transplant candidates. Mean age was 56 ± 11 years, and most patients (77%) were males. Ninety-five (56%) patients were included before the intervention and 76 (44%) after STREAM. IS completion increased after STREAM (IRR 1.41, p < 0.001) with significant improvement recorded for seven (39%) IS items. Unnecessary tests decreased by 43% after the intervention. ID consultation (IRR 1.13, p = 0.02) and urgent evaluation (p = 0.68, p < 0.001) were predictors of IS improvement. STREAM was successful in improving IS completion.

34969106,The Role of Metagenomics and Next-Generation Sequencing in Infectious Disease Diagnosis.,"Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for pathogen detection is becoming increasingly available as a method to identify pathogens in cases of suspected infection. mNGS analyzes the nucleic acid content of patient samples with high-throughput sequencing technologies to detect and characterize microorganism DNA and/or RNA. This unbiased approach to organism detection enables diagnosis of a broad spectrum of infection types and can identify more potential pathogens than any single conventional test. This can lead to improved ability to diagnose patients, although there remains concern regarding contamination and detection of nonclinically significant organisms. We describe the laboratory approach to mNGS testing and highlight multiple considerations that affect diagnostic performance. We also summarize recent literature investigating the diagnostic performance of mNGS assays for a variety of infection types and recommend further studies to evaluate the improvement in clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of mNGS testing. The majority of studies demonstrate that mNGS has sensitivity similar to specific PCR assays and will identify more potential pathogens than conventional methods. While many of these additional organism detections correlate with the expected pathogen spectrum based on patient presentations, there are relatively few formal studies demonstrating whether these are true-positive infections and benefits to clinical outcomes. Reduced specificity due to contamination and clinically nonsignificant organism detections remains a major concern, emphasizing the importance of careful interpretation of the organism pathogenicity and potential association with the clinical syndrome. Further research is needed to determine the possible improvement in clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of mNGS testing.",Clinical chemistry,2021-Dec,"Miller S, Chiu C",2,1847,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

However, by assigning the same weight to each agent rather than accounting for differences in spectrum of activity, DOT ignore key differences between agents that are fundamental to infectious diseases and critical to antimicrobial stewardship. Spectrum scoring assigns numeric values to individual antibiotic agents to quantify their spectrum of activity, allowing for the normalization of antibiotic utilization data. When used in conjunction with traditional metrics, spectrum scores may offer further clarity to antibiotic utilization; however, issues related to development, application, and standardization of spectrum scores remain. Despite these challenges, the potential applications of spectrum scores are vast. Here, we summarize existing data and explore the future of spectrum scoring, including application to both data analysis and routine patient care, use in inpatient and outpatient settings, integration within the electronic medical record, and opportunities for future research.",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2023-Jul,"Ilges D, Tande AJ, Stevens RW",3,1087,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

These weather extremes could contribute to changes in the pattern of health problems. The purpose of this review is to discuss the role of CC on remapping of hepatic diseases and the mechanisms of re-mapping. CC was found to have a major influence on the distribution and severity of hepatic diseases, such as outbreaks of vector-borne, water or food-borne, parasitic diseases, re-emerging of disappeared diseases, or emerging of new forms of infectious agents. Migration of infected people from endemic areas due to the CC disasters results in rapid dissemination of infectious diseases that leads to outbreaks or endemicity of diseases in new areas. CC could cause increasing chemical emissions, or change in its biodegradability, or restriction in its dispersion, such as PM, PAHs, heavy metals, mycotoxins, and aquatic toxins. Increase in the concentrations of these chemicals may have significant impacts in changing the health map of hepatic toxicity and liver cancer. The current review confirms the role of CC in changing the pattern of several liver health problems and remapping of these problems in several regions of the world. This review could be of high importance to the health decision-makers as an early alarm and prediction of hepatic health problems with the projected CC.",Current environmental health reports,2022-Jun,"Saad-Hussein A, Ramadan HK, Bareedy A, Elwakil R",4,1366,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We propose a Filippov epidemic model with nonlinear incidence to describe media's influence in the epidemic transmission process. Our proposed model extends existing models by introducing a threshold strategy to describe the effects of media coverage once the number of infected individuals exceeds a threshold. Meanwhile, we perform the stability of the equilibriua, boundary equilibrium bifurcation, and global dynamics. The system shows complex dynamical behaviors and eventually stabilizes at the equilibrium points of the subsystem or pseudo equilibrium. In addition, numerical simulation results show that choosing appropriate thresholds and control intensity can stop infectious disease outbreaks, and media coverage can reduce the burden of disease outbreaks and shorten the duration of disease eruptions.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2022-Jan,"Dong C, Xiang C, Qin W, Yang Y",4,1135,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

37349214,A mathematic equation derived from host-pathogen interactions elucidates the significance of integrating modern medicine with traditional Chinese medicine to treat infectious diseases.,"The prognosis of infectious diseases is determined by host-pathogen interactions. Control of pathogens has been the central dogma of treating infectious diseases in modern medicine, but the pathogen-directed medicine is facing significant challenges, including a lack of effective antimicrobials for newly emerging pathogens, pathogen drug resistance, and drug side effects. Here, a mathematic equation (termed equation of host-pathogen interactions, HPI-Equation) is developed to dissect the key variables of host-pathogen interactions. It shows that control of pathogens does not necessarily lead to host recovery. Instead, a combination of promoting a host's power of self-healing and balancing immune responses provides the best benefit for host. Moreover, the HPI-Equation elucidates the scientific basis of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a host-based medicine that treats infectious diseases by promoting self-healing power and balancing immune responses. The importance of self-healing power elucidated in the HPI-Equation is confirmed by recent studies that the tolerance mechanism, which is discovered in plants and animals and conceptually similar to self-healing power, improves host survival without directly attacking pathogens. In summary, the HPI-Equation describes host-pathogen interactions with mathematical logic and precision; it translates the ancient wisdoms of TCM into apprehensible modern sciences and opens a new venue for integrating TCM and modern medicine for a future medicine.

39231290,Epidemic spreading on mixing group with face-to-face interaction.,"The mixing groups gathered in the enclosed space form a complex contact network due to face-to-face interaction, which affects the status and role of different groups in social communication. The intricacies of epidemic spreading in mixing groups are intrinsically complicated. Multiple interactions and transmission add to the difficulties of understanding and forecasting the spread of infectious diseases in mixing groups. Despite the critical relevance of face-to-face interactions in real-world situations, there is a significant lack of comprehensive study addressing the unique issues of mixed groups, particularly those with complex face-to-face interactions. We introduce a novel model employing an agent-based approach to elucidate the nuances of face-to-face interactions within mixing groups. In this paper, we apply a susceptible-infected-susceptible process to mixing groups and integrate a temporal network within a specified time window to distinguish between individual movement patterns and epidemic spreading dynamics. Our findings highlight the significant impact of both the relative size of mixing groups and the groups' mixing patterns on the trajectory of disease spread within the mixing groups. When group sizes differ significantly, high inter-group contact preference limits disease spread. However, if the minority reduces their intra-group preferences while the majority maintains high inter-group contact, disease spread increases. In balanced group sizes, high intra-group contact preferences can limit transmission, but asymmetrically reducing any group's intra-group preference can lead to increased spread.","Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2024-Sep,"Gu W, Li W, Gao F, Su S, Zhang Z, Liu X, Wang W",7,1641,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

39360262,Diagnostics for detection and surveillance of priority epidemic-prone diseases in Africa: an assessment of testing capacity and laboratory strengthening needs.,"In 2023, Africa experienced 180 public health emergencies, of which 90% were infectious diseases and 75% were related to zoonotic diseases. Testing capacity for epidemic-prone diseases is essential to enable rapid and accurate identification of causative agents, and for action to prevent disease spread. Moreover, testing is pivotal in monitoring disease transmission, evaluating public health interventions and informing targeted resource allocation during outbreaks. An online, self-assessment survey was conducted in African Union Member States to identify major challenges in testing for epidemic-prone diseases. The survey assessed current capacity for diagnosing priority epidemic-prone diseases at different laboratory levels. It explored challenges in establishing and maintaining testing capacity to improve outbreak response and mitigate public health impact. Survey data analysed diagnostic capacity for priority infectious diseases, diagnostic technologies in use, existing surveillance programmes and challenges limiting diagnostic capacity, by country. The survey result from 15 Member States who responded to the survey, showed high variability in testing capacity and technologies across countries and diverse factors limiting testing capacity for certain priority diseases like dengue and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. At the same time diagnostic capacity is better for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), polio, and measles due to previous investments. Unfortunately, many countries are not utilizing multiplex testing, despite its potential to improve diagnostic access. The challenges of limited laboratory capacity for testing future outbreaks are indeed significant. Recent disease outbreaks in Africa have underscored the urgent need to strengthen diagnostic capacity and introduce cost-effective technologies. Small sample sizes and differing disease prioritisation within each country limited the analysis. These findings suggest the benefits of evaluating laboratory testing capacity for epidemic-prone diseases and highlight the importance of effectively addressing challenges to detect diseases and prevent future pandemics.",Frontiers in public health,2024-,"Ashenafi A, Sule O, Peter T, Mashate S, Otieno O, Kebede A, Oio J, Kao K, Carter J, Whistler T, Ndlovu N, Kebede Y",12,2158,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36480159,An analysis of the policy participation of field response nurses in South Korea: COVID-19 response guidelines and the infectious disease act revision.,"The Republic of Korea's response to Coronavirus disease 2019 was divided before and after global vaccine development at the end of 2020. It also varied according to the size of confirmed patients in the non-pharmaceutical intervention. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the contribution of frontline nurses to the policy and law revision on infectious diseases and suggest health and nursing policies for emerging infectious diseases in the future. This case evaluation study analyzed the significant policy decisions that nurses' roles brought on changes in the infectious disease response system in the Republic of Korea and applying the health system model and those capacities on resilience under emerging infectious diseases. Objective data that contributed directly to the revision of infectious disease-related Acts and policies in 2020 were collected and analyzed through literature search and information disclosure claims from the first to third waves of Coronavirus disease 2019 in one city. With the rapid outbreak of COVID-19 confirmed cases at the end of February 2020, a pan-government support group was formed and dispatched to D City. In addition, central quarantine officials worked with local quarantine officials to share real-time situations and find out on-site difficulties and support requests. As a result, inquiry of opinions to working staff before changing the ""response guidelines to Coronavirus disease 2019"" was reflected in major contents on the revision of ""policy on infectious disease response"" and ""Infectious Disease Prevention and Management Act."" With the establishment of an epidemiological investigation team in September 2020, the number of new nurses in 17 cities and provinces increased by 19.1% compared to the previous year, the most significant increase compared to doctors (-2.3), dentists (-1.6), and health workers (3.7). The experience of responding to Coronavirus was a reminder that the curriculum needed to be improved so that nurses will be recognized to have leadership competencies and as field experts regarding social determinants of health for population groups in the decision-making process. In the initial COVID-19 response process, nurses showed excellence in analyzing patient interviews and various information as field epidemiological investigation response personnel, making comprehensive judgments, and solving problems in cooperation with related agencies and severe patients' bedside nursing care. Continuous primary care and management of infectious diseases for the vulnerable should be prepared on an ongoing basis to assure the quality of care. Action strategies for developing leadership to enable nurses to have participated in the social determinants of health and the nursing policy formation for health equity should be applied in nursing education and practice, and global monitoring efforts were accelerated.",Journal of nursing scholarship : an official publication of Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing,2023-Jan,"Kang S, Kim Y, Kim J",3,2895,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33514902,Ocular manifestations of emerging viral diseases.,"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are an increasing threat to public health on a global scale. In recent times, the most prominent outbreaks have constituted RNA viruses, spreading via droplets (COVID-19 and Influenza A H1N1), directly between humans (Ebola and Marburg), via arthropod vectors (Dengue, Zika, West Nile, Chikungunya, Crimean Congo) and zoonotically (Lassa fever, Nipah, Rift Valley fever, Hantaviruses). However, specific approved antiviral therapies and vaccine availability are scarce, and public health measures remain critical. Patients can present with a spectrum of ocular manifestations. Emerging infectious diseases should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of ocular inflammatory conditions in patients inhabiting or returning from endemic territories, and more general vigilance is advisable in the context of a global pandemic. Eye specialists are in a position to facilitate swift diagnosis, improve clinical outcomes, and contribute to wider public health efforts during outbreaks. This article reviews those emerging viral diseases associated with reports of ocular manifestations and summarizes details pertinent to practicing eye specialists.","Eye (London, England)",2021-Apr,"Venkatesh A, Patel R, Goyal S, Rajaratnam T, Sharma A, Hossain P",6,1195,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

36319306,Network spreading among areas: A dynamical complex network modeling approach.,"With the outbreak of COVID-19, great loss and damage were brought to human society, making the study of epidemic spreading become a significant topic nowadays. To analyze the spread of infectious diseases among different areas, e.g., communities, cities, or countries, we construct a network, based on the epidemic model and the network coupling, whose nodes denote areas, and edges represent population migrations between two areas. Each node follows its dynamic, which describes an epidemic spreading among individuals in an area, and the node also interacts with other nodes, which indicates the spreading among different areas. By giving mathematical proof, we deduce that our model has a stable solution despite the network structure. We propose the peak infected ratio (PIR) as a property of infectious diseases in a certain area, which is not independent of the network structure. We find that increasing the population mobility or the disease infectiousness both cause higher peak infected population all over different by simulation. Furthermore, we apply our model to real-world data on COVID-19 and after properly adjusting the parameters of our model, the distribution of the peak infection ratio in different areas can be well fitted.","Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2022-Oct,"Li Q, Chen H, Li Y, Feng M, Kurths J",5,1247,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33991293,Agent-based evolving network modeling: a new simulation method for modeling low prevalence infectious diseases.,"Agent-based network modeling (ABNM) simulates each person at the individual-level as agents of the simulation, and uses network generation algorithms to generate the network of contacts between individuals. ABNM are suitable for simulating individual-level dynamics of infectious diseases, especially for diseases such as HIV that spread through close contacts within intricate contact networks. However, as ABNM simulates a scaled-version of the full population, consisting of all infected and susceptible persons, they are computationally infeasible for studying certain questions in low prevalence diseases such as HIV. We present a new simulation technique, agent-based evolving network modeling (ABENM), which includes a new network generation algorithm, Evolving Contact Network Algorithm (ECNA), for generating scale-free networks. ABENM simulates only infected persons and their immediate contacts at the individual-level as agents of the simulation, and uses the ECNA for generating the contact structures between these individuals. All other susceptible persons are modeled using a compartmental modeling structure. Thus, ABENM has a hybrid agent-based and compartmental modeling structure. The ECNA uses concepts from graph theory for generating scale-free networks. Multiple social networks, including sexual partnership networks and needle sharing networks among injecting drug-users, are known to follow a scale-free network structure. Numerical results comparing ABENM with ABNM estimations for disease trajectories of hypothetical diseases transmitted on scale-free contact networks are promising for application to low prevalence diseases.",Health care management science,2021-Sep,"Eden M, Castonguay R, Munkhbat B, Balasubramanian H, Gopalappa C",5,1656,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of mNGS in patients with infections. In this study, 641 patients with infectious diseases were enrolled. These patients simultaneously underwent pathogen detection by both mNGS and microbial culture. Through statistical analysis, we judged the diagnostic performance of mNGS and microbial culture on different pathogens. Among 641 patients, 276 cases of bacteria and 95 cases of fungi were detected by mNGS, whereas 108 cases of bacteria and 41 cases of fungi were detected by traditional cultures. Among all mixed infections, combined bacterial and viral infections were the highest (51%, 87/169), followed by combined bacterial with fungal infections (16.57%, 28/169) and mixed bacterial, fungal, and viral infections (13.61%, 23/169). Among all sample types, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples had the highest positive rate (87.8%, 144/164), followed by sputum (85.4%, 76/89) and blood samples (61.2%, 158/258). For the culture method, sputum samples had the highest positive rate (47.2%, 42/89), followed by BALF (37.2%, 61/164). The positive rate of mNGS was 69.89% (448/641), which was significantly higher than that of traditional cultures (22.31% [143/641]) (P < .05). Our results show that mNGS is an effective tool for the rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases.

36649706,Pathogen exposure misclassification can bias association signals in GWAS of infectious diseases when using population-based common control subjects.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been performed to identify host genetic factors for a range of phenotypes, including for infectious diseases. The use of population-based common control subjects from biobanks and extensive consortia is a valuable resource to increase sample sizes in the identification of associated loci with minimal additional expense. Non-differential misclassification of the outcome has been reported when the control subjects are not well characterized, which often attenuates the true effect size. However, for infectious diseases the comparison of affected subjects to population-based common control subjects regardless of pathogen exposure can also result in selection bias. Through simulated comparisons of pathogen-exposed cases and population-based common control subjects, we demonstrate that not accounting for pathogen exposure can result in biased effect estimates and spurious genome-wide significant signals. Further, the observed association can be distorted depending upon strength of the association between a locus and pathogen exposure and the prevalence of pathogen exposure. We also used a real data example from the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genetic consortium comparing HCV spontaneous clearance to persistent infection with both well-characterized control subjects and population-based common control subjects from the UK Biobank. We find biased effect estimates for known HCV clearance-associated loci and potentially spurious HCV clearance associations. These findings suggest that the choice of control subjects is especially important for infectious diseases or outcomes that are conditional upon environmental exposures.",American journal of human genetics,2023-Feb,"Duchen D, Vergara C, Thio CL, Kundu P, Chatterjee N, Thomas DL, Wojcik GL, Duggal P",8,1681,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

It is usually difficult to achieve both high accuracy and short error distance when we try to solve the problem. This study attempts to introduce the graph convolutional network for the problem of source identification in a given network with different infection rates. First, we put forward a label propagation framework, which can locate the infection source based on both infected and uninfected nodes. Then, a novel Source Identification Graph Convolutional Network (SIGN) framework is proposed inspired by label propagation. Third, we modify the classical cross-entropy loss function and presented neighborhood loss to optimize the average error distance. Finally, extensive experiments are performed on eight datasets with different topologies and varying infection sizes to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. We compare the proposed method with four mainstream approaches, and our method shows strong performances especially under the large infection size.",Journal of biomedical informatics,2021-Apr,"Li L, Zhou J, Jiang Y, Huang B",4,1124,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

39363687,Innate lymphoid cells and infectious diseases.,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are the main resident lymphocytes that mostly reside in tissues owing to the lack of adaptive antigen receptors. These cells are involved in early anti-infective immunity, antitumour immunity, regulation of tissue inflammation, and maintenance of homeostasis in the internal environment of tissues and have been referred to as the ""first armies stationed in the human body"". ILCs are widely distributed in the lungs, colon, lymph nodes, oral mucosa and even embryonic tissues. Due to the advantage of their distribution location, they are often among the first cells to come into contact with pathogens.Relevant studies have demonstrated that ILCs play an early role in the defence against a variety of pathogenic microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and helminths, before they intervene in the adaptive immune system. ILCs can initiate a rapid, nonspecific response against pathogens prior to the initiation of an adaptive immune response and can generate a protective immune response against specific pathogens, secreting different effectors to play a role.There is growing evidence that ILCs play an important role in host control of infectious diseases. In this paper, we summarize and discuss the current known infectious diseases in which ILCs are involved and ILC contribution to the defence against infectious diseases. Further insights into the mechanisms of ILCs action in different infectious diseases will be useful in facilitating the development of therapeutic strategies for early control of infections.",Innate immunity,2024-Aug,"Yuan T, Zhou Q, Tian Y, Ou Y, Long Y, Tan Y",6,1561,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32341374,Algorithmic discovery of dynamic models from infectious disease data.,"Theoretical models are typically developed through a deductive process where a researcher formulates a system of dynamic equations from hypothesized mechanisms. Recent advances in algorithmic methods can discover dynamic models inductively-directly from data. Most previous research has tested these methods by rediscovering models from synthetic data generated by the already known model. Here we apply Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to discover mechanistic equations for disease dynamics from case notification data for measles, chickenpox, and rubella. The discovered models provide a good qualitative fit to the observed dynamics for all three diseases, However, the SINDy chickenpox model appears to overfit the empirical data, and recovering qualitatively correct rubella dynamics requires using power spectral density in the goodness-of-fit criterion. When SINDy uses a library of second-order functions, the discovered models tend to include mass action incidence and a seasonally varying transmission rate-a common feature of existing epidemiological models for childhood infectious diseases. We also find that the SINDy measles model is capable of out-of-sample prediction of a dynamical regime shift in measles case notification data. These results demonstrate the potential for algorithmic model discovery to enrich scientific understanding by providing a complementary approach to developing theoretical models.",Scientific reports,2020-Apr,"Horrocks J, Bauch CT",2,1445,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Moreover, we discuss the asymptotic properties of the principal eigenvalue and nontrivial steady state with respect to the nonlocal diffusion rate.

Although the method has been used for several decades to track other infectious diseases, there has not been a comprehensive review outlining all of the pathogens that have been surveilled through wastewater. Herein we identify the infectious diseases that have been previously studied via wastewater surveillance prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Infectious diseases and pathogens were identified in 100 studies of wastewater surveillance across 38 countries, as were themes of how wastewater surveillance and other measures of disease transmission were linked. Twenty-five separate pathogen families were identified in the included studies, with the majority of studies examining pathogens from the family Picornaviridae, including polio and nonpolio enteroviruses. Most studies of wastewater surveillance did not link what was found in the wastewater to other measures of disease transmission. Among those studies that did, the value reported varied by study. Wastewater surveillance should be considered as a potential public health tool for many infectious diseases.

36979622,Multiplex Detection of Infectious Diseases on Microfluidic Platforms.,"Infectious diseases contribute significantly to the global disease burden. Sensitive and accurate screening methods are some of the most effective means of identifying sources of infection and controlling infectivity. Conventional detecting strategies such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), DNA sequencing, and mass spectrometry typically require bulky equipment and well-trained personnel. Therefore, mass screening of a large population using conventional strategies during pandemic periods often requires additional manpower, resources, and time, which cannot be guaranteed in resource-limited settings. Recently, emerging microfluidic technologies have shown the potential to replace conventional methods in performing point-of-care detection because they are automated, miniaturized, and integrated. By exploiting the spatial separation of detection sites, microfluidic platforms can enable the multiplex detection of infectious diseases to reduce the possibility of misdiagnosis and incomplete diagnosis of infectious diseases with similar symptoms. This review presents the recent advances in microfluidic platforms used for multiplex detection of infectious diseases, including microfluidic immunosensors and microfluidic nucleic acid sensors. As representative microfluidic platforms, lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) platforms, polymer-based chips, paper-based devices, and droplet-based devices will be discussed in detail.

35162917,Predicting Infectious Diseases: A Bibliometric Review on Africa.,"Africa has a long history of novel and re-emerging infectious disease outbreaks. This reality has attracted the attention of researchers interested in the general research theme of predicting infectious diseases. However, a knowledge mapping analysis of literature to reveal the research trends, gaps, and hotspots in predicting Africa's infectious diseases using bibliometric tools has not been conducted. A bibliometric analysis of 247 published papers on predicting infectious diseases in Africa, published in the Web of Science core collection databases, is presented in this study. The results indicate that the severe outbreaks of infectious diseases in Africa have increased scientific publications during the past decade. The results also reveal that African researchers are highly underrepresented in these publications and that the United States of America (USA) is the most productive and collaborative country. The relevant hotspots in this research field include malaria, models, classification, associations, COVID-19, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, weather-based prediction using meteorological factors is an emerging theme, and very few studies have used the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) technologies. Therefore, there is a need to explore 4IR predicting tools such as machine learning and consider integrated approaches that are pivotal to developing robust prediction systems for infectious diseases, especially in Africa.

As with IDs, cancer requires rapid intervention and its effective medical management and prevention encompasses the other major NCDs. Furthermore, the technology and clinical capability for cancer care enables management of NCDs and IDs. Global health initiatives that call for action to address IDs and cancer often focus on each problem separately, or consider cancer care only a downstream investment to primary care, missing opportunities to leverage investments that could support broader capacity-building. From our experience in health disparities, disaster preparedness, government policy and healthcare systems we have initiated an approach we call <i>flex-competence</i> which emphasises a systems approach from the outset of program building that integrates investment among IDs, cancer, NCDs and disaster preparedness to improve overall healthcare for the local community. This approach builds on trusted partnerships, multi-level strategies and a healthcare infrastructure providing surge capacities to more rapidly respond to and manage a wide range of changing public health threats.",BMJ global health,2020-Dec,"Coleman CN, Mansoura MK, Marinissen MJ, Grover S, Dosanjh M, Brereton HD, Roth L, Wendling E, Pistenmaa DA, O'Brien DM",10,1661,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33956324,Self-luminescent photodynamic therapy and pathogen detection for infectious diseases.,"The importance of detection and treatments of infectious diseases has been stressed to the world by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As a substitution of an external light source, self-luminescent therapeutics featuring in situ light emission aims to address the lack of tissue penetration in conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT). Luminol-based self-luminescent systems are successfully incorporated in PDT and detection of pathogens in infectious diseases. In these systems, luminol/hydrogen peroxide is served as luminescence source which can be activated by horseradish peroxidase (HRP). As a supplement strategy to the HRP-based bioluminescence, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) provided an electric-driven therapeutic solution and demonstrated potential capabilities of wearable healthcare devices with properly constructed transparent flexible hydrogels. Besides the diagnosis of infection and detection of bacteria, fungi and virus in solution or powder samples have been achieved by ATP-derived self-luminescence as the light source. In this inspirational note, we provide an overview on latest progress in the PDT and microbial detection by self-luminescent systems with an emphasis on the bioluminescence and ECL.",Drug delivery and translational research,2021-Aug,"Zhang E, Huang Y, Wang S",3,1222,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39176406,Possible counter-intuitive impact of local vaccine mandates for vaccine-preventable infectious diseases.,"We modeled the impact of local vaccine mandates on the spread of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, which in the absence of vaccines will mainly affect children. Examples of such diseases are measles, rubella, mumps, and pertussis. To model the spread of the pathogen, we used a stochastic SIR (susceptible, infectious, recovered) model with two levels of mixing in a closed population, often referred to as the household model. In this model, individuals make local contacts within a specific small subgroup of the population (e.g., within a household or a school class), while they also make global contacts with random people in the population at a much lower rate than the rate of local contacts. We considered what would happen if schools were given freedom to impose vaccine mandates on all of their pupils, except for the pupils that were exempt from vaccination because of medical reasons. We investigated first how such a mandate affected the probability of an outbreak of a disease. Furthermore, we focused on the probability that a pupil that was medically exempt from vaccination, would get infected during an outbreak. We showed that if the population vaccine coverage was close to the herd-immunity level, then both probabilities may increase if local vaccine mandates were implemented. This was caused by unvaccinated pupils possibly being moved to schools without mandates.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2024-Jul,"Donà M, Trapman P",2,1395,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

37392149,Estimating contact network properties by integrating multiple data sources associated with infectious diseases.,"To effectively mitigate the spread of communicable diseases, it is necessary to understand the interactions that enable disease transmission among individuals in a population; we refer to the set of these interactions as a contact network. The structure of the contact network can have profound effects on both the spread of infectious diseases and the effectiveness of control programs. Therefore, understanding the contact network permits more efficient use of resources. Measuring the structure of the network, however, is a challenging problem. We present a Bayesian approach to integrate multiple data sources associated with the transmission of infectious diseases to more precisely and accurately estimate important properties of the contact network. An important aspect of the approach is the use of the congruence class models for networks. We conduct simulation studies modeling pathogens resembling SARS-CoV-2 and HIV to assess the method; subsequently, we apply our approach to HIV data from the University of California San Diego Primary Infection Resource Consortium. Based on simulation studies, we demonstrate that the integration of epidemiological and viral genetic data with risk behavior survey data can lead to large decreases in mean squared error (MSE) in contact network estimates compared to estimates based strictly on risk behavior information. This decrease in MSE is present even in settings where the risk behavior surveys contain measurement error. Through these simulations, we also highlight certain settings where the approach does not improve MSE.",Statistics in medicine,2023-Sep,"Goyal R, Carnegie N, Slipher S, Turk P, Little SJ, De Gruttola V",6,1582,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

32594132,Presence of Antibodies Against Haemophilus influenzae Serotype a in Alaska Before and After the Emergence of Invasive Infections.,"Haemophilus influenzae bacteria can cause asymptomatic carriage and invasive disease. Haemophilus influenzae serotype a (Hia) is an emerging cause of invasive disease in Alaska, with greatest burden occurring among rural Alaska Native (AN) children. The first case of invasive Hia (iHia) in Alaska was reported in 2002; however, it is unclear how long the pathogen has been in Alaska. We quantified immunoglobulin G antibodies against Hia (anti-Hia) in 839 banked serum samples from Alaska residents, comparing antibody concentrations in samples drawn in the decades before (1980s and 1990s) and after (2000s) the emergence of iHia. We also assessed serum antibody concentration by age group, region of residence, and race. The anti-Hia was >0.1 µg/mL in 88.1% (348 of 395) and 91.0% (404 of 444) of samples from the decades prior and after the emergence of Hia, respectively (P = .17). No significant differences in antibody levels were detected between people from rural and urban regions (1.55 vs 2.08 µg/mL, P = .91 for age ≥5) or between AN and non-AN people (2.50 vs 2.60 µg/mL, P = .26). Our results are consistent with widespread Hia exposure in Alaska predating the first iHia case.

This qualitative analysis sought to understand the pre-market barriers and facilitators to scale-up infectious diseases POC testing in primary care settings at the national level. Key informant interviews were undertaken with people (n = 30) working in high- level positions relevant to infectious diseases POC testing in Australia. Participants were recruited from federal and state health departments, industry, and nongovernment national peak bodies. The Unitaid scalability framework informed this analysis to understand barriers and enablers to creating access conditions and establishing country readiness for market access of POC tests. Participants identified regulatory frameworks as significant barriers to market access. National strategies and advocacy were viewed as potential enablers to establishing country readiness. It was recommended that the national system for universal health care should fund infectious disease POC tests to ensure financial sustainability, though the existing pathology infrastructure was regarded as a likely inhibitor. Current regulatory frameworks inhibit market access for infectious disease POC testing devices for use in the primary care setting. National advocacy is urgently needed to gain government support and align national policies with regulatory frameworks.",BMC infectious diseases,2024-Nov,"Lafferty L, Applegate TL, Lewis S, Drysdale K, Monaghan R, Kelly-Hanku A, Guy R, Treloar C",8,1420,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

An intake of placebo, 200 mg, or 600 mg of LF were administered to healthy adults in Kyushu University of Health and Welfare for 12 weeks in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled parallel-group comparative trial. The primary endpoints were the prevalence and duration of infectious diseases and changes in immune parameters. Three hundred and ten subjects were randomized (placebo, n = 104; 200 mg, n = 103; 600 mg, n = 103). Twenty subjects were lost to the follow-up, leaving 290 for a full analysis set (n = 99; n = 95; n = 96). The duration (day) of total infectious diseases was shorter in the 200 mg group (2.0, p = 0.045) and 600 mg group (2.0, p = 0.010) than in the placebo group (3.0). The duration of summer colds was shorter in the 600 mg group (2.0, p = 0.036) than in the placebo group (3.0). No significant differences were observed in the prevalence of infectious diseases or changes in immune parameters. In exploratory investigations, changes in the neutrophil phagocytic capacity, cortisol concentrations, and T score of ""Vigor/Activity"" in the Profile of Mood States 2 were greater in the 600 mg group than in the placebo group, when analysis was done on the lower half groups at the baseline.

39178134,The Role of High-Level Isolation Units in Response to High-Consequence and Emerging Infectious Diseases: Experience of the German STAKOB Network.,"This case study describes the experience of the German Permanent Working Group of Competence and Treatment Centers for High Consequence Infectious Diseases, known as STAKOB (<i>Ständiger Arbeitskreis der Kompetenz- und Behandlungszentren für Krankheiten durch hochpathogene Erreger</i>). STAKOB brings together public health authorities (competence centers) and high-level isolation units (treatment centers) to collaborate on the clinical management of high-consequence infectious diseases (HCIDs) and emerging infectious diseases. The network is coordinated by the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's federal public health institute. The main tasks of STAKOB are to strengthen HCID clinical and public health management and increase expert knowledge on HCID and non-HCID emerging infectious diseases in Germany. STAKOB enables the exchange of knowledge and experiences; development of guidelines on infection prevention and control measures, clinical management, and therapy; and support for the World Health Organization and other outbreak responses internationally. The past years have shown how important the STAKOB network is for Germany-not only in providing critical care for HCID cases but also increasing capacity to support public health and clinical management of emerging infectious disease cases. However, maintaining several high-level isolation units in Germany requires a high commitment of financial, material, and human resources. Due to the rarity of HCID and emerging infectious disease events, maintaining the appropriate level of preparedness and ensuring sufficient investments is an ongoing struggle.

The earthquake damaged infrastructure supporting water, sanitation, and hygiene, and health-care facilities. The disruptions to epidemiological surveillance and ongoing disease control measures resulting from the earthquake will accelerate and expand ongoing and new outbreaks of many communicable diseases including measles, cholera, tuberculosis, and leishmaniasis. Investing in existing early warning and response network activities in the area is essential. Antimicrobial resistance, which had already been an increasing concern in Syria before the earthquake, will also be exacerbated given the high number of traumatic injuries and breakdown of antimicrobial stewardship, and the collapse of infection prevention and control measures.

36971007,Severe Infection and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease: A Multicohort Study.,"The excess risk of cardiovascular disease associated with a wide array of infectious diseases is unknown. We quantified the short- and long-term risk of major cardiovascular events in people with severe infection and estimated the population-attributable fraction. We analyzed data from 331 683 UK Biobank participants without cardiovascular disease at baseline (2006-2010) and replicated our main findings in an independent population from 3 prospective cohort studies comprising 271 329 community-dwelling participants from Finland (baseline 1986-2005). Cardiovascular risk factors were measured at baseline. We diagnosed infectious diseases (the exposure) and incident major cardiovascular events after infections, defined as myocardial infarction, cardiac death, or fatal or nonfatal stroke (the outcome) from linkage of participants to hospital and death registers. We computed adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for infectious diseases as short- and long-term risk factors for incident major cardiovascular events. We also calculated population-attributable fractions for long-term risk. In the UK Biobank (mean follow-up, 11.6 years), 54 434 participants were hospitalized for an infection, and 11 649 had an incident major cardiovascular event at follow-up. Relative to participants with no record of infectious disease, those who were hospitalized experienced increased risk of major cardiovascular events, largely irrespective of the type of infection. This association was strongest during the first month after infection (HR, 7.87 [95% CI, 6.36-9.73]), but remained elevated during the entire follow-up (HR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.40-1.54]). The findings were similar in the replication cohort (HR, 7.64 [95% CI, 5.82-10.03] during the first month; HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.34-1.48] during mean follow-up of 19.2 years). After controlling for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, the population-attributable fraction for severe infections and major cardiovascular events was 4.4% in the UK Biobank and 6.1% in the replication cohort. Infections severe enough to require hospital treatment were associated with increased risks for major cardiovascular disease events immediately after hospitalization. A small excess risk was also observed in the long-term, but residual confounding cannot be excluded.",Circulation,2023-May,"Sipilä PN, Lindbohm JV, Batty GD, Heikkilä N, Vahtera J, Suominen S, Väänänen A, Koskinen A, Nyberg ST, Meri S, Pentti J, Warren-Gash C, Hayward AC, Kivimäki M",14,2311,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Insights by comparison with other infectious and non-infectious diseases.,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has an impact on all aspects of patient care. Serum ferritin generally represents a biomarker of choice when iron deficiency is suspected. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase-protein exhibiting elevated serum concentration in various inflammatory diseases. Here we focus on the role of serum ferritin for diagnostic and clinical management of patients with COVID-19 in comparison with other infectious and non-infectious diseases. We examined scientific articles listed in PubMed reporting on ferritin in various infectious and non-infectious diseases. We then compared these results with nine current COVID-19 ferritin reports published in 2020. Several non-infectious, as well as non-COVID-19 infectious diseases, are characterised by a partly dramatic elevation of serum ferritin levels. All COVID-19 studies published between February and May 2020, which documented laboratory serum ferritin, indicate ferritin as a biomarker of COVID-19 severity in hospitalised patients. Serum ferritin may be considered both a prognostic and stratifying biomarker that can also contribute to therapeutic decision-making concerning patients with COVID-19. It should be emphasised, however, that most scientific reports refer to cohorts in the Asian region. Further validation in other cohorts is urgently required.","Biomarkers : biochemical indicators of exposure, response, and susceptibility to chemicals",2020-Dec,"Kappert K, Jahić A, Tauber R",3,1379,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Thus, describing the infectious disease transmission process to design effective intervention measures and restrict its spread is a critical scientific issue. We propose a level-dependent Markov model with infinite state space to characterize viral disorders like COVID-19. The levels and states in this model represent the stages of outbreak development and the possible number of infectious disease patients. The transfer of states between levels reflects the explosive transmission process of infectious disease. A simulation method with heterogeneous infection is proposed to solve the model rapidly. After that, simulation experiments were conducted using MATLAB according to the reported data on COVID-19 published by Johns Hopkins. Comparing the simulation results with the actual situation shows that our proposed model can well capture the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases with and without imposed interventions and evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies. Further, the influence of model parameters on transmission dynamics is analyzed, which helps to develop reasonable intervention strategies. The proposed approach extends the theoretical study of mathematical modeling of infectious diseases and contributes to developing models that can describe an infinite number of infected persons.",PloS one,2023-,"Wang C, Mustafa S",2,1471,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35020724,Incidence of common infectious diseases in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Recent reports indicate that respiratory infectious diseases were suppressed during the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 led to behavioral changes aimed to control droplet transmission or contact transmission. In this study, we examined the incidence of common infectious diseases in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 data were extracted from the national data based on the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NESID). Common infectious diseases were selected from notifiable infectious diseases under the NESID. The epidemic activity of the diseases during 2015-2020 was evaluated based on the Infectious Disease Weekly Reports published by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. Each disease was then categorized according to the route of transmission. Many Japanese people had adopted hygienic activities, such as wearing masks and hand washing, even before the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the correlation between the time-series of disease counts of common infectious diseases and COVID-19 over time using cross-correlation analysis. The weekly number of cases of measles, rotavirus, and several infections transmitted by droplet spread, was negatively correlated with the weekly number of cases of COVID-19 for up to 20 weeks in the past. According to the difference-in-differences analysis, the activity of influenza and rubella was significantly lower starting from the second week in 2020 than that in 2015-2019. Only legionellosis was more frequent throughout the year than in 2015-2019. Lower activity was also observed in some contact transmitted, airborne-transmitted, and fecal-oral transmitted diseases. However, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, exanthema subitum, showed the same trend as that over the previous 5 years. In conclusion, our study shows that public health interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic may have effectively prevented the transmission of most droplet-transmitted diseases and those transmitted through other routes.",PloS one,2022-,"Hibiya K, Iwata H, Kinjo T, Shinzato A, Tateyama M, Ueda S, Fujita J",7,2037,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32807876,Advances in nanomaterial vaccine strategies to address infectious diseases impacting global health.,"Despite the overwhelming success of vaccines in preventing infectious diseases, there remain numerous globally devastating diseases without fully protective vaccines, particularly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria and tuberculosis. Nanotechnology approaches are being developed both to design new vaccines against these diseases as well as to facilitate their global implementation. The reasons why a given pathogen may present difficulties for vaccine design are unique and tied to the co-evolutionary history of the pathogen and humans, but there are common challenges that nanotechnology is beginning to help address. In each case, a successful vaccine will need to raise immune responses that differ from the immune responses raised by normal infection. Nanomaterials, with their defined compositions, commonly modular construction, and length scales allowing the engagement of key immune pathways, collectively facilitate the iterative design process necessary to identify such protective immune responses and achieve them reliably. Nanomaterials also provide strategies for engineering the trafficking and delivery of vaccine components to key immune cells and lymphoid tissues, and they can be highly multivalent, improving their engagement with the immune system. This Review will discuss these aspects along with recent nanomaterial advances towards vaccines against infectious disease, with a particular emphasis on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.",Nature nanotechnology,2021-Apr,"Fries CN, Curvino EJ, Chen JL, Permar SR, Fouda GG, Collier JH",6,1471,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32544167,Coupling the circadian rhythms of population movement and the immune system in infectious disease modeling.,"The dynamics of infectious diseases propagating in populations depends both on human interaction patterns, the contagion process and the pathogenesis within hosts. The immune system follows a circadian rhythm and, consequently, the chance of getting infected varies with the time of day an individual is exposed to the pathogen. The movement and interaction of people also follow 24-hour cycles, which couples these two phenomena. We use a stochastic metapopulation model informed by hourly mobility data for two medium-sized Chinese cities. By this setup, we investigate how the epidemic risk depends on the difference of the clocks governing the population movement and the immune systems. In most of the scenarios we test, we observe circadian rhythms would constrain the pace and extent of disease emergence. The three measures (strength, outward transmission and introduction speeds) are highly correlated with each other. For example of the Yushu City, outward transmission speed and introduction speed are correlated with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.83, and the speeds correlate to strength with coefficients of -0.85 and -0.75, respectively (all have p < 0.05), in simulations with no circadian effect and R0 = 1.5. The relation between the circadian rhythms of the immune system and daily routines in human mobility can affect the pace and extent of infectious disease spreading.

35470930,Strategies for managing marine disease.,"The incidence of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) has increased in wildlife populations in recent years and is expected to continue to increase with global environmental change. Marine diseases are relatively understudied compared with terrestrial diseases but warrant parallel attention as they can disrupt ecosystems, cause economic loss, and threaten human livelihoods. Although there are many existing tools to combat the direct and indirect consequences of EIDs, these management strategies are often insufficient or ineffective in marine habitats compared with their terrestrial counterparts, often due to fundamental differences between marine and terrestrial systems. Here, we first illustrate how the marine environment and marine organism life histories present challenges and opportunities for wildlife disease management. We then assess the application of common disease management strategies to marine versus terrestrial systems to identify those that may be most effective for marine disease outbreak prevention, response, and recovery. Finally, we recommend multiple actions that will enable more successful management of marine wildlife disease emergencies in the future. These include prioritizing marine disease research and understanding its links to climate change, improving marine ecosystem health, forming better monitoring and response networks, developing marine veterinary medicine programs, and enacting policy that addresses marine and other wildlife diseases.

37837983,Overcoming publication and dissemination bias in infectious diseases clinical trials.,"Non-timely reporting, selective reporting, or non-reporting of clinical trial results are prevalent and serious issues. WHO mandates that summary results be available in registries within 12 months of study completion and published in full text within 24 months. However, only a limited number of clinical trials in infectious diseases, including those done during the COVID-19 pandemic, have their results posted on ClinicalTrials.gov. An analysis of 50 trials of eight antiviral drugs tested against COVID-19 with a completion date of at least 2 years ago revealed that only 18% had their results published in the registry, with 40% not publishing any results. Non-timely and non-reporting practices undermine patient participation and are ethically unacceptable. Strategies should include obligatory reporting of summary results within 12 months in clinical trial registries, with progress towards peer-reviewed publication within 24 months indicated. Timely publication of research papers should be encouraged through an automated flagging mechanism in clinical trial registries that draws attention to the status of results reporting, such as a green tick for trials that have reported summary results within 12 months and a red tick in case of failure to do so. We propose the inclusion of mandatory clinical trial reporting standards in the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines, which should prohibit sponsor contract clauses that restrict reporting (referred to as gag clauses) and require timely reporting of results as part of the ethics committees' clearance process for clinical trial protocols.",The Lancet.
