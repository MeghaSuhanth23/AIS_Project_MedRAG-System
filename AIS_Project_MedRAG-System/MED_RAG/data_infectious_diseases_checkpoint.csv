38635718,Interferon-<b>γ</b> and infectious diseases: Lessons and prospects.,"Infectious diseases continue to claim many lives. Prevention of morbidity and mortality from these diseases would benefit not just from new medicines and vaccines but also from a better understanding of what constitutes protective immunity. Among the major immune signals that mobilize host defense against infection is interferon-<b>γ</b> (IFN-<b>γ</b>), a protein secreted by lymphocytes. Forty years ago, IFN-<b>γ</b> was identified as a macrophage-activating factor, and, in recent years, there has been a resurgent interest in IFN-<b>γ</b> biology and its role in human defense. Here we assess the current understanding of IFN-<b>γ</b>, revisit its designation as an ""interferon,"" and weigh its prospects as a therapeutic against globally pervasive microbial pathogens.","Science (New York, N.Y.)",2024-Apr,"Casanova JL, MacMicking JD, Nathan CF",3,774,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33803407,The Interplay between the Gut Microbiome and the Immune System in the Context of Infectious Diseases throughout Life and the Role of Nutrition in Optimizing Treatment Strategies.,"Infectious diseases and infections remain a leading cause of death in low-income countries and a major risk to vulnerable groups, such as infants and the elderly. The immune system plays a crucial role in the susceptibility, persistence, and clearance of these infections. With 70-80% of immune cells being present in the gut, there is an intricate interplay between the intestinal microbiota, the intestinal epithelial layer, and the local mucosal immune system. In addition to the local mucosal immune responses in the gut, it is increasingly recognized that the gut microbiome also affects systemic immunity. Clinicians are more and more using the increased knowledge about these complex interactions between the immune system, the gut microbiome, and human pathogens. The now well-recognized impact of nutrition on the composition of the gut microbiota and the immune system elucidates the role nutrition can play in improving health. This review describes the mechanisms involved in maintaining the intricate balance between the microbiota, gut health, the local immune response, and systemic immunity, linking this to infectious diseases throughout life, and highlights the impact of nutrition in infectious disease prevention and treatment.",Nutrients,2021-Mar,"Wiertsema SP, van Bergenhenegouwen J, Garssen J, Knippels LMJ",4,1247,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34530712,"""Big Three"" Infectious Diseases: Tuberculosis, Malaria and HIV/AIDS.","Infectious diseases have been evolving and re-evolving over the ages and causing immense misery to humans. Among them, some have been prevented and eradicated, but few are still threatening the modern era since their origin. The majority of these infectious diseases are poverty-driven, hence highly prevalent in the lower-income and mid-income countries of Africa and Asia. The world's deadliest infections, including Tuberculosis, Malaria and HIV/AIDS, have been considered as the ""Big Three"" infectious diseases (BTIDs). With leading infections and deaths every year, the BTIDs have been recognized as the world's greatest pandemics. In light of these alarming situations, this review has been aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current status of chemotherapeutics, associated challenges and future perspectives of BTIDs.",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,2021-,"Makam P, Matsa R",2,838,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34350458,Clinical Practice Guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2021 Guideline on Diagnosis and Management of Acute Hematogenous Osteomyelitis in Pediatrics.,"This clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) in children was developed by a multidisciplinary panel representing Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). This guideline is intended for use by healthcare professionals who care for children with AHO, including specialists in pediatric infectious diseases, orthopedics, emergency care physicians, hospitalists, and any clinicians and healthcare providers caring for these patients. The panel's recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of AHO are based upon evidence derived from topic-specific systematic literature reviews. Summarized below are the recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of AHO in children. The panel followed a systematic process used in the development of other IDSA and PIDS clinical practice guidelines, which included a standardized methodology for rating the certainty of the evidence and strength of recommendation using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach.

36140733,Next Generation and Other Sequencing Technologies in Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have become increasingly available for use in the clinical microbiology diagnostic environment. There are three main applications of these technologies in the clinical microbiology laboratory: whole genome sequencing (WGS), targeted metagenomics sequencing and shotgun metagenomics sequencing. These applications are being utilized for initial identification of pathogenic organisms, the detection of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and for epidemiologic tracking of organisms within and outside hospital systems. In this review, we analyze these three applications and provide a comprehensive summary of how these applications are currently being used in public health, basic research, and clinical microbiology laboratory environments. In the public health arena, WGS is being used to identify and epidemiologically track food borne outbreaks and disease surveillance. In clinical hospital systems, WGS is used to identify multi-drug-resistant nosocomial infections and track the transmission of these organisms. In addition, we examine how metagenomics sequencing approaches (targeted and shotgun) are being used to circumvent the traditional and biased microbiology culture methods to identify potential pathogens directly from specimens. We also expand on the important factors to consider when implementing these technologies, and what is possible for these technologies in infectious disease diagnosis in the next 5 years.",Genes,2022-Aug,"Hilt EE, Ferrieri P",2,1479,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37909789,MicroRNAs in infectious diseases: potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are conserved, short, non-coding RNAs that play a crucial role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. They have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cancer and neurological, cardiovascular, and autoimmune diseases. Several recent studies have suggested that miRNAs are key players in regulating the differentiation, maturation, and activation of immune cells, thereby influencing the host immune response to infection. The resultant upregulation or downregulation of miRNAs from infection influences the protein expression of genes responsible for the immune response and can determine the risk of disease progression. Recently, miRNAs have been explored as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in various infectious diseases. This review summarizes our current understanding of the role of miRNAs during viral, fungal, bacterial, and parasitic infections from a clinical perspective, including critical functional mechanisms and implications for their potential use as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Clinical microbiology reviews,2023-Dec,"Kimura M, Kothari S, Gohir W, Camargo JF, Husain S",5,1055,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34037806,Arginine-dependent immune responses.,"A growing body of evidence indicates that, over the course of evolution of the immune system, arginine has been selected as a node for the regulation of immune responses. An appropriate supply of arginine has long been associated with the improvement of immune responses. In addition to being a building block for protein synthesis, arginine serves as a substrate for distinct metabolic pathways that profoundly affect immune cell biology; especially macrophage, dendritic cell and T cell immunobiology. Arginine availability, synthesis, and catabolism are highly interrelated aspects of immune responses and their fine-tuning can dictate divergent pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory immune outcomes. Here, we review the organismal pathways of arginine metabolism in humans and rodents, as essential modulators of the availability of this semi-essential amino acid for immune cells. We subsequently review well-established and novel findings on the functional impact of arginine biosynthetic and catabolic pathways on the main immune cell lineages. Finally, as arginine has emerged as a molecule impacting on a plethora of immune functions, we integrate key notions on how the disruption or perversion of arginine metabolism is implicated in pathologies ranging from infectious diseases to autoimmunity and cancer.",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,2021-Jul,"Martí I Líndez AA, Reith W",2,1317,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

33573529,Protection against severe infectious disease in the past.,"Before the 20<sup>th</sup> century many deaths in England, and most likely a majority, were caused by infectious diseases. The focus here is on the biggest killers, plague, typhus, smallpox, tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid, dysentery, childhood infections, pneumonia, and influenza. Many other infectious diseases including puerperal fever, relapsing fever, malaria, syphilis, meningitis, tetanus and gangrene caused thousands of deaths. This review of preventive measures, public health interventions and changes in behavior that reduced the risk of severe infections puts the response to recent epidemic challenges in historical perspective. Two new respiratory viruses have recently caused pandemics: an H1N1 influenza virus genetically related to pig viruses, and a bat-derived coronavirus causing COVID-19. Studies of infectious diseases emerging in human populations in recent decades indicate that the majority were zoonotic, and many of the causal pathogens had a wildlife origin. As hunter-gatherers, humans contracted pathogens from other species, and then from domesticated animals and rodents when they began to live in settled communities based on agriculture. In the modern world of large inter-connected urban populations and rapid transport, the risk of global transmission of new infectious diseases is high. Past and recent experience indicates that surveillance, prevention and control of infectious diseases are critical for global health. Effective interventions are required to control activities that risk dangerous pathogens transferring to humans from wild animals and those reared for food.",Pathogens and global health,2021-May,Mercer A,1,1615,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39256346,Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases: global trends and new strategies for their prevention and control.,"To adequately prepare for potential hazards caused by emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, the WHO has issued a list of high-priority pathogens that are likely to cause future outbreaks and for which research and development (R&D) efforts are dedicated, known as paramount R&D blueprints. Within R&D efforts, the goal is to obtain effective prophylactic and therapeutic approaches, which depends on a comprehensive knowledge of the etiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of these diseases. In this process, the accessibility of animal models is a priority bottleneck because it plays a key role in bridging the gap between in-depth understanding and control efforts for infectious diseases. Here, we reviewed preclinical animal models for high priority disease in terms of their ability to simulate human infections, including both natural susceptibility models, artificially engineered models, and surrogate models. In addition, we have thoroughly reviewed the current landscape of vaccines, antibodies, and small molecule drugs, particularly hopeful candidates in the advanced stages of these infectious diseases. More importantly, focusing on global trends and novel technologies, several aspects of the prevention and control of infectious disease were discussed in detail, including but not limited to gaps in currently available animal models and medical responses, better immune correlates of protection established in animal models and humans, further understanding of disease mechanisms, and the role of artificial intelligence in guiding or supplementing the development of animal models, vaccines, and drugs. Overall, this review described pioneering approaches and sophisticated techniques involved in the study of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, prevention, and clinical theatment of WHO high-priority pathogens and proposed potential directions. Technological advances in these aspects would consolidate the line of defense, thus ensuring a timely response to WHO high priority pathogens.",Signal transduction and targeted therapy,2024-Sep,"Wang S, Li W, Wang Z, Yang W, Li E, Xia X, Yan F, Chiu S",8,2012,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38963022,Clinical diagnostic value of targeted next‑generation sequencing for infectious diseases (Review).,"As sequencing technology transitions from research to clinical settings, due to technological maturity and cost reductions, metagenomic next‑generation sequencing (mNGS) is increasingly used. This shift underscores the growing need for more cost‑effective and universally accessible sequencing assays to improve patient care and public health. Therefore, targeted NGS (tNGS) is gaining prominence. tNGS involves enrichment of target pathogens in patient samples based on multiplex PCR amplification or probe capture with excellent sensitivity. It is increasingly used in clinical diagnostics due to its practicality and efficiency. The present review compares the principles of different enrichment methods. The high positivity rate of tNGS in the detection of pathogens was found in respiratory samples with specific instances. tNGS maintains high sensitivity (70.8‑95.0%) in samples with low pathogen loads, including blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, tNGS is effective in detecting drug‑resistant strains of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, allowing identification of resistance genes and guiding clinical treatment decisions, which is difficult to achieve with mNGS. In the present review, the application of tNGS in clinical settings and its current limitations are assessed. The continued development of tNGS has the potential to refine diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy and improving infectious disease management. However, further research to overcome technical challenges such as workflow time and cost is required.",Molecular medicine reports,2024-Sep,"Chen Q, Yi J, Liu Y, Yang C, Sun Y, Du J, Liu Y, Gu D, Liu H, Xu Y, Chen Y",11,1545,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37061101,Diagnostic stewardship in infectious diseases: a continuum of antimicrobial stewardship in the fight against antimicrobial resistance.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been exacerbated by the inappropriate use of diagnostics, leading to excessive prescription of antimicrobials, and is an imminent threat to global health. Diagnostic stewardship (DS) is an auxiliary to antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) and comprises ordering the right tests, for the right patient, at the right time. It also promotes the judicious use of rapid and novel molecular diagnostic tools to enable the initiation of proper antibiotic therapy, while avoiding excessive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Proper interpretation of test results is crucial to avoid overdiagnosis and excessive healthcare costs. Although many rapid diagnostic tools have been developed with a high diagnostic yield, they are often limited by accessibility, cost, and lack of knowledge regarding their use. Careful consideration of clinical signs and symptoms with knowledge of the local epidemiology are essential for DS. This enables appropriate interpretation of microbiological results. Multidisciplinary teams that include well trained professionals should cooperate to promote DS. Challenges and barriers to the implementation of DS are mostly caused by scarcity of resources and lack of trained personnel and, most importantly, lack of knowledge. The lack of resources is often due to absence of awareness of the impact that good medical microbiology diagnostic facilities and expertise can have on the proper use of antibiotics.",International journal of antimicrobial agents,2023-Jul,"Zakhour J, Haddad SF, Kerbage A, Wertheim H, Tattevin P, Voss A, Ünal S, Ouedraogo AS, Kanj SS",9,1457,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

35867217,Infectious diseases and cognition: do we have to worry?,"Age-related physiological changes, particularly immune system decline, may contribute to greater vulnerability to infectious diseases in older individuals. A growing body of evidence shows that both, acute, and chronic infections may be accompanied by cognitive disturbances as part of their manifestations. Given the importance of cognition in aging trajectories, the objective of this article was to review current knowledge on cognitive outcomes of infectious diseases in older adults, and to emphasize the importance of considering cognition as a domain of interest in its own rights in these diseases. A MEDLINE/PubMed database search was conducted to identify articles reporting cognitive impairment associated with various severe acute infections and specific chronic infectious conditions such as human immune deficiency virus, the herpes virus family, hepatitis C virus, Lyme borreliosis, Helicobacter pylori, periodontitis, and emerging pathogens like SARS-CoV-2, as well as potentially preventive strategies like vaccination. Taken together, the studies examined in the present review emphasize that numerous acute and chronic infectious diseases share mechanisms that, when added to specific risk factors frequently found in older persons, contribute to considerably increase the risk of cognitive outcomes such as cognitive decline and dementia. This review may help to appreciate the role that infectious diseases play in cognitive trajectories and thus promote further investigation on the topic.",Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2022-Nov,"Hernandez-Ruiz V, Letenneur L, Fülöp T, Helmer C, Roubaud-Baudron C, Avila-Funes JA, Amieva H",7,1511,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The factors that should be taken into consideration are the genetic adaptation of microbial agents and the characteristics of the human host or environment. The new approach to identifying new possible pathogens will have to go through the One Health approach and omics integration data, which are capable of identifying high-priority microorganisms in a short period of time. New bioinformatics technologies enable global integration and sharing of surveillance data for rapid public health decision-making to detect and prevent epidemics and pandemics, ensuring timely response and effective prevention measures. Machine learning tools are being more frequently utilized in the realm of infectious diseases to predict sepsis in patients, diagnose infectious diseases early, and forecast the effectiveness of treatment or the appropriate choice of antibiotic regimen based on clinical data.

Malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, cholera, Ebola, Lassa fever, and other tropical diseases, such as dengue and chikungunya, have had a profound impact on morbidity and mortality. Various factors contribute to the higher prevalence and incidence of infectious diseases in Africa, including socioeconomic challenges, limited access to health care, inadequate sanitation and hygiene infrastructure, climate-related factors, and endemicity of certain diseases in specific regions. A skilled workforce is crucial to addressing these challenges. Unfortunately, many countries in Africa often lack the required resources, and aspiring scientists frequently seek educational and career opportunities abroad, leading to a substantial loss of talent and expertise from the continent.

38851830,Depression and risk of infectious diseases: A mendelian randomization study.,"Previous observational inquiries have revealed a correlation between depression and infectious maladies. This study seeks to elucidate the causal linkages between depression, specifically Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and infectious diseases. Nevertheless, the causative nature of the association between MDD and infectious diseases remains elusive. Two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses was executed utilizing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly connected with MDD and infectious diseases as instrumental variables (IVs). A series of sensitivity analyses were subsequently conducted. Genetic variants linked to MDD were employed as instrumental variables sourced from a genome-wide meta-analyses comprising 500,199 individuals. Summary-level data on five infectious diseases, including candidiasis, pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI), upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), and urinary tract infections (UTI), were acquired from the UK Biobank and FinnGen study. Our findings evinced that genetically predicted MDD exhibited a heightened risk of candidiasis (OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.06-2.17; P = 2.38E-02), pneumonia (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.01-1.29; P = 3.16E-02), URTI (OR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.12-1.36; P = 3.71E-05), and UTI (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.12-1.42; P = 8.90E-05). Additionally, we identified bidirectional causal relationships between UTI and MDD. The associations between MDD and the risk of URTI and UTI remained consistent in multivariable MR analyses, accounting for genetically predicted smoking and body mass index. In conclusion, this investigation ascertained a causal connection between MDD and the susceptibility to infectious diseases, particularly URTI and UTI.",Translational psychiatry,2024-Jun,"Shi L, Ren J, Jin K, Li J",4,1721,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This article is part of an American Board of Pediatrics Foundation-sponsored supplement investigating the future of the pediatric subspecialty workforce. The article offers context to findings from a modeling analysis estimating the supply of PID subspecialists in the United States between 2020 and 2040. It provides an overview of children cared for by PID subspecialists, reviews the current state of the PID workforce, and discusses the projected headcount and clinical workforce equivalents of PID subspecialists at the national, census region, and census division levels over this 2-decade period. The article concludes by discussing the education and training, clinical practice, policy, and research implications of the data presented. Adjusting for population growth, the PID workforce is projected to grow more slowly than most other pediatric subspecialties and geographic disparities in access to PID care are expected to worsen. In models considering alternative scenarios, decreases in the number of fellows and time spent in clinical care significantly affect the PID workforce. Notably, model assumptions may not adequately account for potential threats to the PID workforce, including a declining number of fellows entering training and the unknown impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and future emerging infections on workforce attrition. Changes to education and training, clinical care, and policy are needed to ensure the PID workforce can meet the future needs of US children.",Pediatrics,2024-Feb,"Kelly MS, Cataldi JR, Schlaudecker EP, Shah SS, Vinci RJ, Myers AL",6,1692,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37801882,Economic sanctions and spread of infectious diseases.,"Economic sanctions can induce economic crises and compromise the determinants of health. In the literature, economic crises have been found to increase the risk of infectious disease outbreaks. Presumably, sanctions can increase the risk of infectious disease spreads, indirectly. However, non-economic factors can fuel the adverse impact of sanctions, including political consequences of sanctions and civil war. We performed a systematic literature review of articles in Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and the grey literature to assess empirically the impact of economic sanctions on the spread of infectious diseases within and beyond the borders of sanctioned countries. Our review did not identify any study meeting our inclusion criteria. Most of the studies did not control for major socio-political events, particularly armed conflicts in the sanctioned countries. This discovery underscores a notable gap in the examination of the impact of economic sanctions on the propagation of infectious diseases, presenting a threat to global health. Using the social-ecological model, we hypothesize how the economic crisis resulting from economic sanctions affects determinants of health, increases the risk of the spread of infectious diseases and hinders the response capacity of health systems.","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2023-Dec,"Aloosh M, Aloosh A",2,1326,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The shared symptoms among diseases and the emergence of new pathogen variations make diagnosis and treatment complex. Conventional diagnostic methods are laborious and intricate, underscoring the need for rapid, accurate techniques. Aptamer-based technologies offer a promising solution, as they are cost-effective, sensitive, specific, and convenient for molecular disease diagnosis. Aptamers, which are single-stranded RNA or DNA sequences, serve as nucleotide equivalents of monoclonal antibodies, displaying high specificity and affinity for target molecules. They are structurally robust, allowing for long-term storage without substantial activity loss. Aptamers find applications in diverse fields such as drug screening, material science, and environmental monitoring.

32031431,Companion and complementary diagnostics for infectious diseases.,"Companion diagnostics (CDx) are important in oncology therapeutic decision-making, but specific regulatory-approved CDx for infectious disease treatment are officially lacking. While not approved as CDx, several ID diagnostics are used as CDx. The diagnostics community, manufacturers, and regulatory agencies have made major efforts to ensure that diagnostics for new antimicrobials are available at or near release of new agents. This review highlights the status of Complementary and companion diagnostic (c/CDx) in the infectious disease literature, with a focus on genotypic antimicrobial resistance testing against pathogens as a class of diagnostic tests. CRISPR, sepsis markers, and narrow spectrum antimicrobials, in addition to current and emerging technologies, present opportunities for infectious disease c/CDx. Challenges include slow guideline revision, high costs for regulatory approval, lengthy buy in by agencies, discordant pharmaceutical/diagnostic partnerships, and higher treatment costs. The number of patients and available medications used to treat different infectious diseases is well suited to support competing diagnostic tests. However, newer approaches to treatment (for example, narrow spectrum antibiotics), may be well suited for a small number of patients, i.e. a niche market in support of a CDx.

38962577,Advances in Bacterial Lysate Immunotherapy for Infectious Diseases and Cancer.,"Antigenic cell fragments, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and other immunostimulants in bacterial lysates or extracts may induce local and systemic immune responses in specific and nonspecific paradigms. Based on current knowledge, this review aimed to determine whether bacterial lysate has comparable functions in infectious diseases and cancer treatment. In infectious diseases, including respiratory and urinary tract infections, immune system activation by bacterial lysate can identify and combat pathogens. Commercially available bacterial lysates, including OM-85, Ismigen, Lantigen B, and LW 50020, were effective in children and adults in treating respiratory tract infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rhinitis, and rhinosinusitis with varying degrees of success. Moreover, OM-89, Uromune, Urovac, Urivac, and ExPEC4V showed therapeutic benefits in controlling urinary tract infections in adults, especially women. Bacterial lysate-based therapeutics are safe, well-tolerated, and have few side effects, making them a good alternative for infectious disease management. Furthermore, a nonspecific immunomodulation by bacterial lysates may stimulate innate immunity, benefiting cancer treatment. ""Coley's vaccine"" has been used to treat sarcomas, carcinomas, lymphomas, melanomas, and myelomas with varying outcomes. Later, several similar bacterial lysate-based therapeutics have been developed to treat cancers, including bladder cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and myeloma; among them, BCG for in situ bladder cancer is well-known. Proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-<i>α</i>, may activate bacterial antigen-specific adaptive responses that could restore tumor antigen recognition and response by tumor-specific type 1 helper cells and cytotoxic T cells; therefore, bacterial lysates are worth investigating as a vaccination adjuvants or add-on therapies for several cancers.",Journal of immunology research,2024-,"Rahman MM, Grice ID, Ulett GC, Wei MQ",4,1943,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Breast abscesses are often a complication of infectious mastitis of the breast. Puerperal mastitis is the most common cause of breast abscess, typically affecting postpartum females. Often diagnosed clinically, it is usually treated with antibiotics without need for imaging. Non-puerperal mastitis is relatively uncommon and typically subareolar in location. Patients can present with asymmetric breast thickening, a palpable lump, nipple discharge, or axillary adenopathy. These presentations can mimic malignancy.

Tuberculosis (TB) has been a constant companion of humans for thousands of years and has heavily influenced population health in almost every phase of cultural and demographic evolution. TB in human populations has been dramatically influenced by behavior, demographic and epidemiological shifts, and other comorbidities through history. This paper critically discusses TB and some of its major comorbidities through history within a biocultural framework to show how transitions in human demography and culture affected the disease-scape of TB. In doing so, I address the potential synthesis of biocultural and epidemiological transition theory to better comprehend the mutual evolution of infectious diseases and humans.",Evolutionary anthropology,2023-Apr,van Doren TP,1,1052,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This paper reviews the epidemiological situation of EIDs and RIDs of global concern in the EMR between 2001 and 2018. To do a narrative review, a complete list of studies in the field was we prepared following a systematic search approach. Studies that were purposively reviewed were identified to summarize the epidemiological situation of each targeted disease. A comprehensive search of all published studies on EIDs and RIDs between 2001 and 2018 was carried out through search engines including Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect. Leishmaniasis, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are reported from all countries in the region. Chikungunya, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), dengue fever, and H5N1 have been increasing in number, frequency, and expanding in their geographic distribution. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which was reported in this region in 2012 is still a public health concern. There are challenges to control cholera, diphtheria, leishmaniasis, measles, and poliomyelitis in some of the countries. Moreover, Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever (AHF), and Rift Valley fever (RVF) are limited to some countries in the region. Also, there is little information about the real situation of the plague, Q fever, and tularemia.

However, the perceived infection risk can preclude traditional, invasive, complete diagnostic autopsy. Post-mortem examination is especially important in emerging infectious diseases with potentially unknown infection risks, but rapid acquisition of good quality tissue samples is needed as part of the scientific and public health response. Needle biopsy post-mortem is a minimally invasive, rapid, closed-body autopsy technique that was originally developed to minimise the infection risk to practitioners. Since its inception, needle biopsy post-mortem has also been used as a technique to support complete diagnostic autopsy provision in poorly resourced regions and to facilitate post-mortem examinations in communities that might have religious or cultural objections to an invasive autopsy.

32187985,Infectious Diseases and the Lymphoid Extracellular Matrix Remodeling: A Focus on Conduit System.,"The conduit system was described in lymphoid organs as a tubular and reticular set of structures compounded by collagen, laminin, perlecan, and heparin sulfate proteoglycan wrapped by reticular fibroblasts. This tubular system is capable of rapidly transport small molecules such as viruses, antigens, chemokines, cytokines, and immunoglobulins through lymphoid organs. This structure plays an important role in guiding the cells to their particular niches, therefore participating in cell cooperation, antigen presentation, and cellular activation. The remodeling of conduits has been described in chronic inflammation and infectious diseases to improve the transport of antigens to specific T and B cells in lymphoid tissue. However, malnutrition and infectious agents may induce extracellular matrix remodeling directly or indirectly, leading to the microarchitecture disorganization of secondary lymphoid organs and their conduit system. In this process, the fibers and cells that compound the conduit system may also be altered, which affects the development of a specific immune response. This review aims to discuss the extracellular matrix remodeling during infectious diseases with an emphasis on the alterations of molecules from the conduit system, which damages the cellular and molecular transit in secondary lymphoid organs compromising the immune response.",Cells,2020-Mar,"Morgado FN, da Silva AVA, Porrozzi R",3,1371,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Thus, nanotechnology provides an excellent opportunity to treat drug-resistant microbial infections. Numerous antibiotics have been used to inhibit the growth and kill of microbes, but the development of resistance and the emergence of side effects have severely limited the use of these agents. Due to the development of the nanotechnology, nanoparticles are widely used as antimicrobials. Silver and chitosan nanoparticles have antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial properties, and many studies confirm the antifungal properties of silver nanoparticles. Nowadays, the use of nanoparticles in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases has developed due to less side effects and also the help of these particles in effective drug delivery to the target tissue. Liposomes are also used as carriers of drug delivery, genes, and modeling of cell membranes in both animals and humans. The ability of these liposomes to encapsulate large amounts of drugs, minimize unwanted side effects, high effectiveness and low toxicity has attracted the interest of researchers.

Despite the adverse outcomes associated with diagnostic delays, few studies have examined the incidence and factors that influence diagnostic delays for different infectious diseases. The objective of this study was to understand the relative frequency of diagnostic delays for six infectious diseases commonly seen by infectious diseases (ID) consultants and to examine contributing factors for these delays. A 25-item survey to examine diagnostic delays in six infectious diseases was sent to all infectious diseases physicians in the Emerging Infections Network (EIN) who provide care to adult patients. Diseases included (1) tuberculosis, (2) non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections, (3) syphilis, (4) epidural abscess, (5) infective endocarditis, and (6) endemic fungal infections (e.g., histoplasmosis, blastomycosis). A total of 533 of 1,323 (40%) EIN members responded to the survey. Respondents perceived the diagnosis not being considered initially and the appropriate test not being ordered as the two most important contributors to diagnostic delays. Unusual clinical presentations and not consulting ID physicians early enough were also reported as a contributing factor to delays. Responses recorded in open-text fields also indicated errors related to testing as a likely cause of delays; specifically, test-related errors included ordering the wrong laboratory test, laboratory delays (specialized labs not available at the facility), and lab processing delays. Diagnostic delays commonly occur for the infectious diseases we considered. The contributing factors we identified are potential targets for future interventions to decrease diagnostic delays.","Diagnosis (Berlin, Germany)",2022-Aug,"Suneja M, Beekmann SE, Dhaliwal G, Miller AC, Polgreen PM",5,1736,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Four mortality patterns are recognized: the common U- and L-shaped curves of endemic infections and the unique W- and J-shaped curves of pandemic infections. We suggest that these patterns result from different sets of human genetic and immunological determinants. In this model, it is the interplay between (1) monogenic genotypes affecting immunity to primary infection that preferentially manifest early in life and related genotypes or their phenocopies, including auto-antibodies, which manifest later in life and (2) the occurrence and persistence of adaptive, acquired immunity to primary or cross-reactive infections, which shapes the age-dependent pattern of human deaths from infection.",Immunity,2024-Jul,"Abel L, Casanova JL",2,859,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This study aims to explore the spatial and temporal evolutionary characteristics of the incidence of Class B notifiable infectious diseases in China from 2007 to 2020, and to forecast the trend of it as well. Hopefully, it will provide a reference for the formulation of infectious disease prevention and control strategies. Data on the incidence rates of Class B notifiable infectious diseases in 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of China from 2007 to 2020 were collected for the prediction of the spatio-temporal evolution and spatial correlation as well as the incidence of Class B notifiable infectious diseases in China based on global spatial autocorrelation and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). From 2007 to 2020, the national incidence rate of Class B notifiable infectious diseases (from 272.37 per 100,000 in 2007 to 190.35 per 100,000 in 2020) decreases year by year, and the spatial distribution shows an ""east-central-west"" stepwise increase. From 2007 to 2020, the spatial clustering of the incidence of Class B notifiable infectious diseases is significant and increasing year by year (Moran's I index values range from 0.189 to 0.332, p < 0.05). The forecasted incidence rates of Class B notifiable infectious diseases nationwide from 2021 to 2024 (205.26/100,000, 199.95/100,000, 194.74/100,000 and 189.62/100,000) as well as the forecasted values for most regions show a downward trend, with only some regions (Guangdong, Hunan, Hainan, Tibet, Guangxi and Guizhou) showing an increasing trend year by year. The current study found that since there were significant regional disparities in the prevention and control of infectious diseases in China between 2007 and 2020, the reduction of the incidence of Class B notifiable infectious diseases requires the joint efforts of the surrounding provinces. Besides, special attention should be paid to provinces with an increasing trend in the incidence of Class B notifiable infectious diseases to prevent the re-emergence of certain traditional infectious diseases in a particular province or even the whole country, as well as the outbreak and spread of emerging infectious diseases.",BMC public health,2022-Jun,"Wang RN, Zhang YC, Yu BT, He YT, Li B, Zhang YL",6,2420,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

For this purpose, we use rich municipal-monthly panel data. We exploit the fact that municipalities closer to the main migration entry points have a disproportionate exposure to infected migrants when the cumulative migration flows increase.

32123000,Communicable diseases in humanitarian operations and disasters.,"Military organisations have battled communicable disease for millennia. They have pioneered disease prevention from the Crusades to the World Wars and continue to do so today. Predeployment vaccinations and chemoprophylaxis are effective in preventing communicable disease, as is reliable vector destruction and bite prevention, especially in the era of multidrug resistant organisms. These measures are unlikely to be fully possible in disasters, but reactive vaccination and efforts to reduce exposure to communicable disease should be a priority. Communicable diseases can be challenging to diagnose-the UK Defence Medical Services have become familiar with tools such as multiplex PCR and mass spectrometry. These have the potential to accurately identify organisms and sensitivity patterns in austere environments. Management of communicable diseases depends on accurate diagnosis and has a largely well-established evidence base but can be limited by a lack of resources and skills in an austere setting, therefore telemedicine can assist diagnosis and treatment of infections by projecting specialist skill. Systems such as EpiNATO2 are useful in monitoring diseases and identifying trends in order to establish control measures. Many of these tools and techniques are effective in austere environments and offer learning opportunities for those providing care in similar settings. Further research is ongoing into diagnostic tools as well as remote management.",BMJ military health,2022-Dec,Murphy RJ,1,1468,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32462426,The human genetic determinism of life-threatening infectious diseases: genetic heterogeneity and physiological homogeneity?,"Multicellular eukaryotes emerged late in evolution from an ocean of viruses, bacteria, archaea, and unicellular eukaryotes. These macroorganisms are exposed to and infected by a tremendous diversity of microorganisms. Those that are large enough can even be infected by multicellular fungi and parasites. Each interaction is unique, if only because it operates between two unique living organisms, in an infinite diversity of circumstances. This is neatly illustrated by the extraordinarily high level of interindividual clinical variability in human infections, even for a given pathogen, ranging from a total absence of clinical manifestations to death. We discuss here the idea that the determinism of human life-threatening infectious diseases can be governed by single-gene inborn errors of immunity, which are rarely Mendelian and frequently display incomplete penetrance. We briefly review the evidence in support of this notion obtained over the last two decades, referring to a number of focused and thorough reviews published by eminent colleagues in this issue of Human Genetics. It seems that almost any life-threatening infectious disease can be driven by at least one, and, perhaps, a great many diverse monogenic inborn errors, which may nonetheless be immunologically related. While the proportions of monogenic cases remain unknown, a picture in which genetic heterogeneity is combined with physiological homogeneity is emerging from these studies. A preliminary sketch of the human genetic architecture of severe infectious diseases is perhaps in sight.",Human genetics,2020-Jun,"Casanova JL, Abel L",2,1571,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

34319148,The Standardization and Control of Serology and Nucleic Acid Testing for Infectious Diseases.,"Historically, the detection of antibodies against infectious disease agents was achieved using test systems that utilized biological functions such as neutralization, complement fixation, hemagglutination, or visualization of binding of antibodies to specific antigens, by testing doubling dilutions of the patient sample to determine an endpoint. These test systems have since been replaced by automated platforms, many of which have been integrated into general medical pathology. Methods employed to standardize and control clinical chemistry testing have been applied to these serology tests. However, there is evidence that these methods are not suitable for infectious disease serology. An overriding reason is that, unlike testing for an inert chemical, testing for specific antibodies to infectious disease agents is highly variable; the measurand for each test system varies in choice of antigen, antibody classes/subclasses, modes of detection, and assay kinetics, and individuals' immune responses vary with time after exposure, individual immune-competency, nutrition, treatment, and exposure to variable circulating sero- or genotypes or organism mutations. Therefore, unlike that of inert chemicals, the quantification of antibodies cannot be standardized using traditional methods. However, there is evidence that the quantification of nucleic acid testing, reporting results in international units, has been successful across many viral load tests. Similarly, traditional methods used to control clinical chemistry testing, such as Westgard rules, are not appropriate for serology testing for infectious diseases, mainly due to variability due to frequent reagent lot changes. This review investigates the reasons why standardization and control of infectious diseases should be further investigated and more appropriate guidelines should be implemented.",Clinical microbiology reviews,2021-Dec,Dimech W,1,1870,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) are essential in reducing the incidence of MDRO by conserving antimicrobial use, minimizing treatment durations, and improving the appropriate use of diagnostic testing. However, the role of ASP in transplant infectious diseases (TID) is still evolving, necessitating greater collaboration between ASP and transplant programs. This collaboration will mitigate infection risks, reduce infection-associated costs, and improve outcomes.

Indeed, directly transmitted pathogens have long been considered a major cost of group living in humans and other social animals, as well as a driver of the evolution of group size and social behaviour. As the risk and frequency of emerging infectious diseases rise, the ability of social taxa to respond appropriately to changing infectious disease pressures could mean the difference between persistence and extinction. Here, we examine changes in the social behaviour of humans and wildlife in response to infectious diseases and compare these responses to theoretical expectations. We consider constraints on altering social behaviour in the face of emerging diseases, including the lack of behavioural plasticity, environmental limitations and conflicting pressures from the many benefits of group living. We also explore the ways that social animals can minimize the costs of disease-induced changes to sociality and the unique advantages that humans may have in maintaining the benefits of sociality despite social distancing.",Proceedings.

33435521,Magnesium in Infectious Diseases in Older People.,"Reduced magnesium (Mg) intake is a frequent cause of deficiency with age together with reduced absorption, renal wasting, and polypharmacotherapy. Chronic Mg deficiency may result in increased oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation, which may be linked to several age-related diseases, including higher predisposition to infectious diseases. Mg might play a role in the immune response being a cofactor for immunoglobulin synthesis and other processes strictly associated with the function of T and B cells. Mg is necessary for the biosynthesis, transport, and activation of vitamin D, another key factor in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. The regulation of cytosolic free Mg in immune cells involves Mg transport systems, such as the melastatin-like transient receptor potential 7 channel, the solute carrier family, and the magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1). The functional importance of Mg transport in immunity was unknown until the description of the primary immunodeficiency XMEN (X-linked immunodeficiency with Mg defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and neoplasia) due to a genetic deficiency of MAGT1 characterized by chronic Epstein-Barr virus infection. This and other research reporting associations of Mg deficit with viral and bacterial infections indicate a possible role of Mg deficit in the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its complications.

Flies make effective and applicable models for studying host-pathogen interactions thanks to their highly conserved innate immune systems and cellular processes commonly hijacked by pathogens. <i>Drosophila</i> researchers also possess the most powerful, rapid, and versatile tools for genetic manipulation in multicellular organisms. This allows for robust experiments in which specific pathogenic proteins can be expressed either one at a time or in conjunction with each other to dissect the molecular functions of each virulent factor in a cell-type-specific manner. Well documented phenotypes allow large genetic and pharmacological screens to be performed with relative ease using huge collections of mutant and transgenic strains that are publicly available.

In the 21st century, the emergence and re-emergence of several zoonotic and non-zoonotic global pandemic diseases of socio-economic importance has affected billions of humans and animals. The need for expensive equipment and laboratories, non-availability of on-site testing abilities, with time-consuming and low sensitivity and specificity issues of currently available diagnostic techniques to identify these pathogenic micro-organisms on a large scale highlighted the need for developing cheap, portable environment friendly diagnostic methods. In recent years, these issues have been addressed by clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based diagnostic platforms that have transformed the molecular diagnostic field due to their outstanding ultra-sensitive nucleic acid detecting capabilities. In this study, we highlight the types, potential of different Cas proteins, and amplification systems. We also illuminate the application of currently available CRISPR integrated setups on the diagnosis of infectious diseases, majorly in food-producing animals (pigs, ruminants, poultry, and aquaculture), domestic pets (dogs and cats), and diseases of zoonotic importance.

We conducted a methodologic review of test validation studies for OIE-listed diseases in wild mammals published between 2008 and 2017 and focused on study design, statistical analysis, and reporting of results. Most published papers addressed <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> infection in one or more wildlife species. Our review revealed limitations or missing information about sampled animals, identification criteria for positive and negative samples (case definition), representativeness of source and target populations, and species in the study, as well as information identifying animals sampled for calculations of DSe and DSp as naturally infected captive, free-ranging, or experimentally challenged animals. The deficiencies may have reflected omissions in reporting rather than design flaws, although lack of random sampling might have induced bias in estimates of DSe and DSp. We used case studies of validation of tests for hemorrhagic diseases in deer and white-nose syndrome in hibernating bats to demonstrate approaches for validation when new pathogen serotypes or genotypes are detected and diagnostic algorithms are changed, and how purposes of tests evolve together with the evolution of the pathogen after identification. We describe potential benefits of experimental challenge studies for obtaining DSe and DSp estimates, methods to maintain sample integrity, and Bayesian latent class models for statistical analysis.

Rapid diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases offers a better understanding of their pathogenesis. According to the World Health Organization, the ideal approach for detecting foreign pathogens should be rapid, specific, sensitive, instrument-free, and cost-effective. Nucleic acid pathogen detection methods, typically PCR, have numerous limitations, such as highly sophisticated equipment requirements, reagents, and trained personnel relying on well-established laboratories, besides being time-consuming. Thus, there is a crucial need to develop novel nucleic acid detection tools that are rapid, specific, sensitive, and cost-effective, particularly ones that can be used for versatile point-of-care diagnostic applications. Two new methods exploit unpredicted <i>in vitro</i> properties of CRISPR-Cas effectors, turning activated nucleases into basic amplifiers of a specific nucleic acid binding event. These effectors can be attached to a diversity of reporters and utilized in tandem with isothermal amplification approaches to create sensitive identification in multiple deployable field formats. Although still in their beginning, SHERLOCK and DETECTR technologies are potential methods for rapid detection and identification of infectious diseases, with ultrasensitive tests that do not require complicated processing.

Antibodies were integrated in our medical repertoire against infectious diseases more than hundred years ago by using animal sera to treat tetanus and diphtheria. In these days, most developed therapeutic antibodies target cancer or autoimmune diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic was a reminder about the importance of antibodies for therapy against infectious diseases. While monoclonal antibodies could be generated by hybridoma technology since the 70ies of the former century, nowadays antibody phage display, among other display technologies, is robustly established to discover new human monoclonal antibodies. Phage display is an <i>in vitro</i> technology which confers the potential for generating antibodies from universal libraries against any conceivable molecule of sufficient size and omits the limitations of the immune systems. If convalescent patients or immunized/infected animals are available, it is possible to construct immune phage display libraries to select <i>in vivo</i> affinity-matured antibodies. A further advantage is the availability of the DNA sequence encoding the phage displayed antibody fragment, which is packaged in the phage particles. Therefore, the selected antibody fragments can be rapidly further engineered in any needed antibody format according to the requirements of the final application.

Taking in account the complexity of inflammasome activation and that several regulatory steps are involved in maintaining its physiologic role in homeostasis and innate immune response, it does not surprise that several genetic variants in inflammasome components have been associated with common pathologies in the general population, such as autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular diseases, obesity and associated metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Moreover, the susceptibility to infectious agents and/or to develop severe complications during infections also has been related to inflammasome genetics.

Dysbiosis of the oral microbiome is the initiating factor that leads to oral infectious diseases. Infection is a sophisticated biological process involving interplay between the pathogen and the host, which often leads to activation of programmed cell death. Studies suggest that pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis are involved in multiple oral infectious diseases. Further understanding of crosstalk between cell death pathways has led to pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis being integrated into a single term: PANoptosis. PANoptosis is a multifaceted agent of the immune response that has important pathophysiological relevance to infectious diseases, autoimmunity, and cancer. As such, it plays an important role in innate immune cells that detect and eliminate intracellular pathogens. In addition to the classical model of influenza virus-infected and <i>Yersinia</i>-infected macrophages, other studies have expanded the scope of PANoptosis to include other microorganisms, as well as potential roles in cell types other than macrophages. In this review, we will summarize the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying inflammation and tissue destruction caused by oral pathogens. We present an overview of different pathogens that may induce activation of PANoptosis, along with the functional consequences of PANoptosis in the context of oral infectious diseases. To advance our understanding of immunology, we also explore the strategies used by microbes that enable immune evasion and replication within host cells.

34543228,"Ethics, Integrity, and Retributions of Digital Detection Surveillance Systems for Infectious Diseases: Systematic Literature Review.","The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the importance of the deployment of digital detection surveillance systems to support early warning and monitoring of infectious diseases. These opportunities create a ""double-edge sword,"" as the ethical governance of such approaches often lags behind technological achievements. The aim was to investigate ethical issues identified from utilizing artificial intelligence-augmented surveillance or early warning systems to monitor and detect common or novel infectious disease outbreaks. In a number of databases, we searched relevant articles that addressed ethical issues of using artificial intelligence, digital surveillance systems, early warning systems, and/or big data analytics technology for detecting, monitoring, or tracing infectious diseases according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, and further identified and analyzed them with a theoretical framework. This systematic review identified 29 articles presented in 6 major themes clustered under individual, organizational, and societal levels, including awareness of implementing digital surveillance, digital integrity, trust, privacy and confidentiality, civil rights, and governance. While these measures were understandable during a pandemic, the public had concerns about receiving inadequate information; unclear governance frameworks; and lack of privacy protection, data integrity, and autonomy when utilizing infectious disease digital surveillance. The barriers to engagement could widen existing health care disparities or digital divides by underrepresenting vulnerable and at-risk populations, and patients' highly sensitive data, such as their movements and contacts, could be exposed to outside sources, impinging significantly upon basic human and civil rights. Our findings inform ethical considerations for service delivery models for medical practitioners and policymakers involved in the use of digital surveillance for infectious disease spread, and provide a basis for a global governance structure.

36011854,Infectious Diseases Associated with Hydrometeorological Hazards in Europe: Disaster Risk Reduction in the Context of the Climate Crisis and the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Hydrometeorological hazards comprise a wide range of events, mainly floods, storms, droughts, and temperature extremes. Floods account for the majority of the related disasters in both developed and developing countries. Flooding alters the natural balance of the environment and frequently establish a favorable habitat for pathogens and vectors to thrive. Diseases caused by pathogens that require vehicle transmission from host to host (waterborne) or a host/vector as part of their life cycle (vector-borne) are those most likely to be affected by flooding. Considering the most notable recent destructive floods events of July 2021 that affected several Central Europe countries, we conducted a systematic literature review in order to identify documented sporadic cases and outbreaks of infectious diseases in humans in Europe, where hydrometeorological hazards, mainly floods, were thought to have been involved. The occurrence of water-, rodent-, and vector-borne diseases in several European countries is highlighted, as flooding and the harsh post-flood conditions favor their emergence and transmission. In this context, strategies for prevention and management of infectious disease outbreaks in flood-prone and flood-affected areas are also proposed and comprise pre- and post-flood prevention measures, pre- and post-outbreak prevention measures, as well as mitigation actions when an infectious disease outbreak finally occurs. Emphasis is also placed on the collision of floods, flood-related infectious disease outbreaks, and the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, which may result in unprecedented multi-hazard conditions and requires a multi-hazard approach for the effective disaster management and risk reduction.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022-Aug,"Mavrouli M, Mavroulis S, Lekkas E, Tsakris A",4,1727,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

34823730,Infectious Complications of Injection Drug Use.,"The opioid overdose epidemic is one of the leading causes of death in adults. Its devastating effects have included not only a burgeoning overdose crisis but also multiple converging infectious diseases epidemics. The use of both opioids and other substances through intravenous (IV) administration places individuals at increased risks of infectious diseases ranging from invasive bacterial and fungal infections to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and viral hepatitis. In 2012, there were 530,000 opioid use disorder (OUD)-related hospitalizations in the United States (US), with $700 million in costs associated with OUD-related infections. The scale of the crisis has continued to increase since that time, with hospitalizations for injection drug use-related infective endocarditis (IDU-IE) increasing by as much as 12-fold from 2010 to 2015. Deaths from IDU-IE alone are estimated to result in over 7,260,000 years of potential life lost over the next 10 years. There have been high-profile injection-related HIV outbreaks, and injection drug use (IDU) is now the most common risk factor for hepatitis C virus (HCV). As this epidemic continues to grow, clinicians in all aspects of medical care are increasingly confronted with infectious complications of IDU.

Infectious diseases were seen as a minor problem. This, however, changed in 2020 when the global COVID-19 pandemic broke out and a new danger emerged. The latest events generated a lot of discussion on health hazards associated with international tourism and uncontrolled spread of pathogens across the borders. The major health problems of travelers to developing countries with harsh environmental conditions and endemic infectious diseases include gastrointestinal disorders, dermatoses, respiratory infections and fevers of unknown origin. A medical interview by an experienced physician is the foundation of the post-travel screening process both in symptomatic and asymptomatic travelers; the interview should focus on identifying exposure to risk factors (endemic infectious diseases, failure to adopt disease prevention measures, consumption of food or water from unsafe sources, insect bites, animal bites, travelling in large groups, unsafe sex with casual partners). While physical examination (identification of abnormalities) and diagnostic tests (identification of pathogens) can be useful for detecting illnesses and asymptomatic infections as well as assessing the general health condition of a patient, including his immune system. The aim of the article is to provide information on the post-travel screening process in symptomatic and asymptomatic travelers who have returned from areas with harsh climate conditions and low sanitation standards.",International maritime health,2020-,Korzeniewski K,1,1599,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Doing this requires concentrated efforts in a variety of areas to advance the technological state of the art and at the same time implement ideas and explain to the everyday citizen what is happening. The world's experience with COVID-19 has revealed many gaps in our past approaches to anticipating emerging infectious diseases. Most approaches to predicting outbreaks and identifying emerging microbes of major consequence have been with those causing high morbidity and mortality in humans and animals. These lagging indicators offer limited ability to prevent disease spillover and amplifications in new hosts. Leading indicators and novel approaches are more valuable and now feasible, with multidisciplinary approaches also within our grasp to provide links to disease predictions through holistic monitoring of micro and macro ecological changes.

However, the impacts of the microbiome on immune system development, susceptibility to infectious diseases, and vaccine-elicited immune responses are emerging areas of interest. In this review, we provide an overview of development of the microbiome during childhood. We highlight available data suggesting that the microbiome is critical to maturation of the immune system and modifies susceptibility to a variety of infections during childhood and adolescence, including respiratory tract infections, Clostridioides difficile infection, and sexually transmitted infections. We discuss currently available and investigational therapeutics that have the potential to modify the microbiome to prevent or treat infections among children. Finally, we review the accumulating evidence that the gut microbiome influences vaccine-elicited immune responses among children. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have led to an explosion of studies associating the human microbiome with the risk and severity of infectious diseases. As our knowledge of the extent to which the microbiome influences childhood infections continues to grow, microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics will increasingly be incorporated into clinical practice to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases among children.",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,2024-Jul,"Heston SM, Hurst JH, Kelly MS",3,1410,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37232312,Surveillance and risk assessment for early detection of emerging infectious diseases in livestock.,"Those who work in the area of surveillance and prevention of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) face a challenge in accurately predicting where infection will occur and who (or what) it will affect. Establishing surveillance and control programmes for EIDs requires substantial and long-term commitment of resources that are limited in nature. This contrasts with the unquantifiable number of possible zoonotic and non-zoonotic infectious diseases that may emerge, even when the focus is restricted to diseases involving livestock. Such diseases may emerge from many combinations of, and changes in, host species, production systems, environments/habitats and pathogen types. Given these multiple elements, risk prioritisation frameworks should be used more widely to support decision-making and resource allocation for surveillance. In this paper, the authors use recent examples of EID events in livestock to review surveillance approaches for the early detection of EIDs, and highlight the need for surveillance programmes to be informed and prioritised by regularly updated risk assessment frameworks. They conclude by discussing some unmet needs in risk assessment practices for EIDs, and the need for improved coordination in global infectious disease surveillance.",Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),2023-May,"Drewe JA, Snary EL, Crotta M, Alarcon P, Guitian J",5,1272,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This existential threat forces us to recognise that our existence is completely dependent upon well-functioning ecosystems that sustain the diversity of life on our planet, including that required for human health. By synthesising data on the ecology, epidemiology and evolutionary biology of various pathogens, we are gaining a better understanding of factors that underlie disease emergence and spread. However, our knowledge remains rudimentary with limited insight into the complex feedback loops that underlie ecological stability, which are at risk of rapidly unravelling once certain tipping points are breached. In this paper, we consider the impact of climate change and biodiversity collapse on the ever-present risk of infectious disease emergence and spread. We review historical and contemporaneous infectious diseases that have been influenced by human environmental manipulation, including zoonoses and vector- and water-borne diseases, alongside an evaluation of the impact of migration, urbanisation and human density on transmissible diseases.

Over the years, zoonoses have become increasingly significant threats to global health. They form the dominant group of diseases among the emerging infectious diseases (EID) and currently account for 73% of EID. Approximately 25% of zoonoses originate in domestic animals. The etiological agents of zoonoses include different pathogens, with viruses accounting for approximately 30% of all zoonotic infections. Zoonotic diseases can be transmitted directly or indirectly, by contact, via aerosols, through a vector, or vertically in utero. Zoonotic diseases are found in every continent except Antarctica. Numerous factors associated with the pathogen, human activities, and the environment play significant roles in the transmission and emergence of zoonotic diseases. Effective response and control of zoonotic diseases call for multiple-sector involvement and collaboration according to the One Health concept.",Annual review of animal biosciences,2023-Feb,"Tomori O, Oluwayelu DO",2,1011,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The potential of this fast-acting, nonspecific memory compared to traditional adaptive immunological memory in prophylaxis and therapy has been a topic of great interest in many fields, including infectious diseases. Amidst the rise of antimicrobial resistance and climate change-two major threats to global health-, harnessing the advantages of trained immunity compared to traditional forms of prophylaxis and therapy could be game-changing. Here, we present recent works bridging trained immunity and infectious disease that raise important discoveries, questions, concerns, and novel avenues for the modulation of trained immunity in practice.

We review the challenges involved in modelling the dynamics of wildlife-human interfaces governing infectious disease emergence and spread. We argue that we need a better understanding of the dynamic nature of such interfaces, the underpinning diversity of pathogens and host-pathogen association networks, and the scales and frequencies at which environmental conditions enable spillover and host shifting from animals to humans to occur. The major drivers of the emergence of zoonoses are anthropogenic, including the global change in climate and land use. These, and other ecological processes pose challenges that must be overcome to counterbalance pandemic risk.

In response to this ongoing threat, significant efforts are underway to develop vaccines and antimicrobial agents. However, pathogens evolve resistance mechanisms, complicating their control. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the limitations of focusing solely on the pathogen-killing strategies of immunology and microbiology to address complex, multisystemic infectious diseases. This highlights the urgent need for practical advancements, such as microbiome therapeutics, that address these limitations while complementing traditional approaches. Our review emphasizes key outcomes in the field, including evidence of probiotics reducing disease severity and insights into host-microbiome crosstalk that have informed novel therapeutic strategies. These findings underscore the potential of microbiome-based interventions to promote physiological function alongside existing strategies aimed at enhancing host immune responses and pathogen destruction. This narrative review explores microbiome therapeutics as next-generation treatments for infectious diseases, focusing on the application of probiotics and their role in host-microbiome interactions. While offering a novel perspective grounded in a cooperative defense system, this review also addresses the practical challenges and limitations in translating these advancements into clinical settings.",Cells,2024-Dec,"Seo H, Kim S, Beck S, Song HY",4,1531,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35844858,Epidemiology and Economic Burden of Continuing Challenge of Infectious Diseases in India: Analysis of Socio-Demographic Differentials.,"Unlike other low- and middle-income countries, infectious diseases are still predominant, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are emerging without replacing the burden of infectious diseases in India, where it is imposing a double burden of diseases on households in the country. This study aimed to analyse the socio-economic and demographic differentials in the magnitude of economic burden and coping strategies associated with health expenditure on infectious diseases in India. National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) data on ""Key Indicators of Social Consumption in India: Health, (2017-18)"" have been employed in this study. The findings of the study revealed that more than 33% of the individuals are still suffering from infectious diseases out of the total ailing population in India. Based on the various socio-economic and demographic covariates, infectious diseases are highly prevalent among individuals with marginalized characteristics, such as individuals residing in rural areas, females, 0-14 age groups, Muslims, illiterates, scheduled tribes (STs), and scheduled castes (SCs), large family households, and economically poor people in the country. The per capita out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure on infectious diseases is INR 7.28 and INR 29.38 in inpatient and outpatient care, respectively. Whereas, monthly per patient OOP expenditure on infectious diseases by infection-affected populations is INR 881.56 and INR 1,156.34 in inpatient and outpatient care in India. The study found that people residing in rural areas, SCs followed by other backward classes (OBCs), illiterates, poor, and very poor are more dependent on borrowings, sale of assets, and other distressed sources of financing. However, under National Health Policy 2017, many initiatives, such as ""Ayushman Bharat,"" PM-JAY, and National Digital Health Mission (NDHM) in 2021, have been launched by the government of India in the recent years. These initiatives are holistically launched for ensuring better health facilities, but it is early to make any prediction regarding its outcomes; hopefully, the time will define it over the passing of a few more years.

Two reviewers independently determined inclusion and exclusion. Of 2,887 articles identified, 354 studies met inclusion criteria, the majority of which were application papers. Studies of airborne diseases were dominant, followed by vector-borne diseases. Most research used aggregated data instead of point data, and a significant proportion of articles used a repetition of a spatial clustering method, instead of using a ""true"" space-time detection approach, potentially leading to the detection of false positives. Noticeably, most articles did not make their data available, limiting replicability.

33491541,Drivers of Infectious Disease Seasonality: Potential Implications for COVID-19.,"Not 1 year has passed since the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its emergence, great uncertainty has surrounded the potential for COVID-19 to establish as a seasonally recurrent disease. Many infectious diseases, including endemic human coronaviruses, vary across the year. They show a wide range of seasonal waveforms, timing (phase), and amplitudes, which differ depending on the geographical region. Drivers of such patterns are predominantly studied from an epidemiological perspective with a focus on weather and behavior, but complementary insights emerge from physiological studies of seasonality in animals, including humans. Thus, we take a multidisciplinary approach to integrate knowledge from usually distinct fields. First, we review epidemiological evidence of environmental and behavioral drivers of infectious disease seasonality. Subsequently, we take a chronobiological perspective and discuss within-host changes that may affect susceptibility, morbidity, and mortality from infectious diseases. Based on photoperiodic, circannual, and comparative human data, we not only identify promising future avenues but also highlight the need for further studies in animal models. Our preliminary assessment is that host immune seasonality warrants evaluation alongside weather and human behavior as factors that may contribute to COVID-19 seasonality, and that the relative importance of these drivers requires further investigation. A major challenge to predicting seasonality of infectious diseases are rapid, human-induced changes in the hitherto predictable seasonality of our planet, whose influence we review in a final outlook section. We conclude that a proactive multidisciplinary approach is warranted to predict, mitigate, and prevent seasonal infectious diseases in our complex, changing human-earth system.",Journal of biological rhythms,2021-Feb,"Kronfeld-Schor N, Stevenson TJ, Nickbakhsh S, Schernhammer ES, Dopico XC, Dayan T, Martinez M, Helm B",8,1939,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

However, despite their lower abundance, viruses within the gut microbiota are gaining recognition for their crucial role in shaping the structure and function of the intestinal microbiota, with significant effects on the host as a whole, particularly the immune system. Similarly, environmental factors such as stress are key in modulating the host immune system, which in turn influences the composition of the gut virome and neurological functions through the bidirectional communication of the gut-brain axis. In this context, alterations in the host immune system due to stress and/or dysbiosis of the gut virome are critical factors in the development of both infectious and noninfectious diseases. The molecular mechanisms and correlation patterns between microbial species are not yet fully understood. This literature review seeks to explore the interconnected relationship between stress and the gut virome, with a focus on how this interaction is influenced by the host's immune system.

This study included adult inpatients who underwent ID consultations between October 2016 and March 2018. The demographic data, clinical manifestations, and final non-ID diagnoses of cases were explored. Among the 502 patients who underwent ID consultations, 45 (9.0%) were diagnosed with non-IDs. The most common diagnoses were tumors (22.2%, n = 10), connective tissue and collagen vascular diseases (13.3%, n = 6), other inflammatory diseases (8.9%, n = 4), and drug-induced fever (8.9%, n = 4). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of consultations for diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 22.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.1-48.2; p<0.01), consultations from the internal medicine department (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2-5.2; p = 0.02), and non-bacteremia cases (OR, 5.2; 95% CI, 1.4-19.3; p = 0.01) were independently associated with diagnosed non-IDs. Non-IDs after ID consultations were mainly tumor-related, inflammatory diseases, and drug fever. The presence of consultations for diagnosis, consultations from the internal medicine department and non-bacteremia cases were related to non-IDs among ID consultations.

This review aims to summarise the evidence for illnesses associated with travel in medical students taking part in electives abroad. Articles were identified through a literature search in two databases (until 30 July 2020) - PubMed and Web of Science. Sixteen articles were included in the systematic review. The results were classified into two broad categories: communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases. Gastrointestinal infections including travellers' diarrhoea were the most common infectious diseases reported by medical students abroad, followed by respiratory tract infections and skin infections. Blood-borne and sexually transmitted infection and systemic febrile infections due to vector-borne pathogens were rarely reported. Only six of the 16 studies addressed microbial carriage. The acquisition of resistant bacteria appeared to be frequent. Traffic accidents and mental health problems were also reported. One of the lessons learned from this review is the requirement for large-scale epidemiological studies to evaluate the burden of infectious diseases such as gastrointestinal, respiratory and blood-borne infections with microbiological documentation. In particular, the emergence of the acquisition of resistant bacteria may lead to a theoretical risk of spread to the community and hospitals.

Diagnostic strategies that rely solely on pathogen detection often are insufficient due to poor test characteristics, inability to differentiate colonization from infection, or protracted delay to result. Understanding the human response across different pathogens on a clinical and molecular level can provide more accurate, timely, and useful answers, especially in critical illness and diagnostic uncertainty. Improvements in understanding the human immune response including genomics, protein analysis, gene expression, and cellular morphology have led to rapid innovation of new host response-based diagnostic tests. This review describes the limitations of pathogen-focused technology and the benefits of examining the breadth of immune response to diagnose infection. It then explores biomarkers that have been studied for this purpose and scrutinizes the performance of host-based multianalyte testing. Currently cleared diagnostics and those in late-stage development are described in depth, with a focus on the purpose of testing and its utility for clinicians.

Factors associated with drug use including sharing needles and injecting supplies, presence of contaminants in drugs and drug use related paraphernalia, risky behaviors associated with drug use, immune suppression secondary to chronic drug use, poverty and homelessness all increase the risk of infections. Persons with SUD have low rates of health care utilization and may miss opportunities for early diagnosis and care of infectious complications of substance use. When infectious diseases are comorbid with drug use, they are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality and result in significant healthcare costs. Patients with SUD may be rescued from an overdose, detoxified or treated for a SUD but facilities and clinicians are often reluctant to assume responsibility for evaluation and treatment of concurrent infectious or medical diseases. Increased screening for these disorders, utilizing vaccinations and other preventative strategies including clean supplies and safe injecting sites and providing comprehensive substance use and infectious disease treatment have the potential to significantly improve patient related outcomes and enhance public health. In this paper we review the prevalence of various common infectious diseases among persons who use drugs, their clinical presentation, mode of transmission, screening and diagnosis.

33804605,Infectious Diseases Seeker (IDS): An Innovative Tool for Prompt Identification of Infectious Diseases during Outbreaks.,"Several technologies for rapid molecular identification of pathogens are currently available; jointly with monitoring tools (i.e., web-based surveillance tools, infectious diseases modelers, and epidemic intelligence methods), they represent important components for timely outbreak detection and identification of the involved pathogen. The application of these approaches is usually feasible and effective when performed by healthcare professionals with specific expertise and skills and when data and resources are easily accessible. Contrariwise, in the field situation where healthcare workers or first responders from heterogeneous competences can be asked to investigate an outbreak of unknown origin, a simple and suitable tool for rapid agent identification and appropriate outbreak management is highly needed. Most especially when time is limited, available data are incomplete, and accessible infrastructure and resources are inadequate. The use of a prompt, user-friendly, and accessible tool able to rapidly recognize an infectious disease outbreak and with high sensitivity and precision may be a game-changer to support emergency response and public health investigations. This paper presents the work performed to implement and test an innovative tool for prompt identification of infectious diseases during outbreaks, called Infectious Diseases Seeker (IDS). IDS is a standalone software that runs on the most common operative systems. It has been built by integrating a database containing an interim set of 60 different disease causative agents and COVID-19 data and is able to work in an off-line mode without requiring a network connection. IDS has been applied in a real and complex scenario in terms of concomitant infectious diseases (yellow fever, COVID-19, and Lassa fever), as can be in the second part of 2020 in Nigeria. The outcomes have allowed inferring that yellow fever (YF), and not Lassa fever, was affecting the area under investigation. Our result suggests that a tool like IDS could be valuable for the quick and easy identification and discrimination of infectious disease outbreaks even when concurrent outbreaks occur, like for the case study of YF and COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021-Mar,"Baldassi F, Carestia M, Moramarco S, Malizia A, Gaudio P",5,2225,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Animal sniffing is an innate behaviour, and animals' olfactory acuity is used for detecting people, weapons, bombs, narcotics and food. We briefly summarized current knowledge regarding the use of sniffing animals to diagnose some infectious diseases and the potential use of scent-based diagnostic instruments in microbiology. Information was sought through PubMed and extracted from peer-reviewed literature published between January 2000 and September 2019 and from reliable online news. The search terms 'odour', 'scent', 'bacteria', 'diagnostics', 'tuberculosis', 'malaria' and 'volatile compounds' were used. Four major areas of using sniffing animals are summarized. Dogs have been used to reliably detect stool associated with toxigenic Clostridioides difficile and for surveillance. Dogs showed high sensitivity and moderate specificity for detecting urinary tract infections in comparison to culture, especially for Escherichia coli. African giant pouched rats showed superiority for diagnosing tuberculosis over microscopy, but inferiority to culture/molecular methods. Several approaches for detecting malaria by analysing host skin odour or exhaled breath have been explored successfully. Some microbial infections produce specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can be analysed by spectrometry, metabolomics or other analytical approaches to replace animal sniffing. The results of sniffing animal studies are fascinating, and animal sniffing can provide intermediate diagnostic solutions for some infectious diseases. Lack of reproducibility, and cost of animal training and housing are major drawbacks for wider implementation of sniffing animals. The ultimate goal is to understand the biological background of this animal ability and to characterize the specific VOCs that animals are recognizing. VOC identification, improvement of odour sampling methods and development of point-of-care instruments could allow implementation of scent-based tests for major human pathogens.",Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,2020-Apr,"Cambau E, Poljak M",2,2179,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

37071521,Causality Network of Infectious Disease Revealed With Causal Decomposition.,"Causal inference in the field of infectious disease attempts to gain insight into the potential causal nature of an association between risk factors and diseases. Simulated causality inference experiments have shown preliminary promise in improving understanding of the transmission of infectious diseases but still lack sufficient quantitative causal inference studies based on real-world data. Here, we investigate the causal interactions between three different infectious diseases and related factors, using causal decomposition analysis, to characterize the nature of infectious disease transmission. We show that the complex interactions between infectious disease and human behavior have a quantifiable impact on transmission efficiency of infectious diseases. Our findings, by shedding light on the underlying transmission mechanism of infectious diseases, suggest that causal inference analysis is a promising approach to determine epidemiological interventions.",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,2023-Jul,"Sun J, Yuan K, Chen C, Xu H, Wang H, Zhi Y, Peng S, Peng CK, Huang N, Huang G, Yang A",11,971,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34024014,Transdermal drug delivery systems for fighting common viral infectious diseases.,"Transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS) have many advantages and represent an excellent alternative to oral delivery and hypodermic injections. TDDS are more convenient and less invasive tools for disease and viral infection treatment, prevention, detection, and surveillance. The emerging development of microneedles for TDDS has facilitated improved skin barrier penetration for the delivery of macromolecules or hydrophilic drugs. Microneedle TDDS patches can be fabricated to deliver virus vaccines and potentially provide a viable alternative vaccine modality that offers improved immunogenicity, thermostability, simplicity, safety, and compliance as well as sharp-waste reduction, increased cost-effectiveness, and the capacity for self-administration, which could improve vaccine distribution. These advantages make TDDS-based vaccine delivery an especially well-suited option for treatment of widespread viral infectious diseases including pandemics. Because microneedle-based bioassays employ transdermal extraction of interstitial fluid or blood, they can be used as a minimally invasive approach for surveying disease markers and providing point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. For cutaneous viral infections, TDDS can provide localized treatment with high specificity and less systemic toxicity. In summary, TDDS, especially those that employ microneedles, possess special attributes that can be leveraged to reduce morbidity and mortality from viral infectious diseases. In this regard, they may have considerable positive impact as a modality for improving global health. In this article, we introduce the possible role and summarize the current literature regarding TDDS applications for fighting common cutaneous or systemic viral infectious diseases, including herpes simplex, varicella or herpes zoster, warts, influenza, measles, and COVID-19.",Drug delivery and translational research,2021-Aug,"Wang FY, Chen Y, Huang YY, Cheng CM",4,1859,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37919210,Leveraging Donor Populations to Study the Epidemiology and Pathogenesis of Transfusion-Transmitted and Emerging Infectious Diseases.,"The tragedy of transfusion-associated hepatitis and HIV spurred a decades-long overhaul of the regulatory oversight and practice of blood transfusion. Consequent to improved donor selection, testing, process control, clinical transfusion practice and post-transfusion surveillance, transfusion in the United States and other high-income countries is now a very safe medical procedure. Nonetheless, pathogens continue to emerge and threaten the blood supply, highlighting the need for a proactive approach to blood transfusion safety. Blood donor populations and the global transfusion infrastructure are under-utilized resources for the study of infectious diseases. Blood donors are large, demographically diverse subsets of general populations for whom cross-sectional and longitudinal samples are readily accessible for serological and molecular testing. Blood donor collection networks span diverse geographies, including in low- and middle-income countries, where agents, especially zoonotic pathogens, are able to emerge and spread, given limited tools for recognition, surveillance and control. Routine laboratory storage and transportation, coupled with data capture, afford access to rich epidemiological data to assess the epidemiology and pathogenesis of established and emerging infections. Subsequent to the State of the Science in Transfusion Medicine symposium in 2022, our working group (WG), ""Emerging Infections: Impact on Blood Science, the Blood Supply, Blood Safety, and Public Health"" elected to focus on ""leveraging donor populations to study the epidemiology and pathogenesis of transfusion-transmitted and emerging infectious diseases."" The 5 landmark studies span (1) the implication of hepatitis C virus in post-transfusion hepatitis, (2) longitudinal evaluation of plasma donors with incident infections, thus informing the development of a widely used staging system for acute HIV infection, (3) explication of the dynamics of early West Nile Virus infection, (4) the deployment of combined molecular and serological donor screening for Babesia microti, to characterize its epidemiology and infectivity and facilitate routine donor screening, and (5) national serosurveillance for SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The studies highlight the interplay between infectious diseases and transfusion medicine, including the imperative to ensure blood transfusion safety and the broader application of blood donor populations to the study of infectious diseases.",Transfusion medicine reviews,2023-Oct,"Bloch EM, Busch MP, Corash LM, Dodd R, Hailu B, Kleinman S, O'Brien S, Petersen L, Stramer SL, Katz L",10,2492,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Due to geographic, political, social, behavioral, and genomic differences, some populations are more vulnerable to infectious disease spread than others. The purpose of this article is to present a framework for research and practice response to emergent infectious diseases that addresses multiple transdisciplinary actions to limit exposure or mitigate adverse outcomes for individuals and communities. Recent experience with new strains of emergent infectious diseases reinforces the importance of intervening at multiple levels, from genomics to political messaging to create multipronged, transdisciplinary interventions to contain the threat. In particular, incorporation of genomics into public health nursing practice of infectious diseases management can enhance existing regional-, community-, and individual-level health promotion and protection efforts, thus impacting long-term health outcomes.","Public health nursing (Boston, Mass.)",2023-Jan,"Prescott S, Schminkey D, Abukhalaf D, DeGuzman P, Dreisbach C",5,1061,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38787222,Is Pollution the Primary Driver of Infectious Syndemics?,"Syndemics, the adverse interaction of two or more coterminous diseases or other negative health conditions, have probably existed since human settlement, plant and animal domestication, urbanization, and the growth of social inequality beginning about 10-12,000 years ago. These dramatic changes in human social evolution significantly increased opportunities for the spread of zoonotic infectious diseases in denser human communities with increased sanitation challenges. In light of a growing body of research that indicates that anthropogenic air pollution causes numerous threats to health and is taking a far greater toll on human life and wellbeing than had been reported, this paper proposes the possibility that air pollution is now the primary driver of infectious disease syndemics. In support of this assertion, this paper reviews the growth and health impacts of air pollution, the relationship of air pollution to the development and spread of infectious diseases, and reported cases of air pollution-driven infectious disease syndemics, and presents public health recommendations for leveraging the biosocial insight of syndemic theory in responding to infectious disease.","Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2024-Apr,Singer M,1,1186,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

In this work, we intended to investigate the diagnostic value and clinical acceptance of paired-samples mNGS as compared to the culture method. A total of 361 patients with suspected infection were retrospectively included. With reference to the clinical diagnosis, we compared the diagnostic performance and clinical acceptance in pathogen detection between mNGS and culture tests. Moreover, the pathogen concordance of paired blood and respiratory tract (RT) samples in mNGS assay was investigated. Among 511 samples, 62.04% were shown to be pathogen positive by mNGS, and that for clinical diagnosis was 51.86% (265/511). When compared to culture assay (<i>n</i> = 428), mNGS had a significantly higher positivity rate (51.87% vs. 33.18%). With reference to the clinical diagnosis, the sensitivity of mNGS outperformed that of culture (89.08% vs. 56.72%). Importantly, mNGS exhibited a clinically accepted rate significantly superior to that of culture. In addition, the mNGS result from 53 paired blood and RT samples showed that most pairs were pathogen positive by both blood and RT, with pathogens largely being partially matched. Through this large-scale study, we further illustrated that mNGS had a clinically accepted rate and sensitivity superior to those of the traditional culture method in diagnosing infections. Moreover, blood and paired RT samples mostly shared partial-matched positive pathogens, especially for pathogens with abundant read numbers in RT, indicating that both blood and RT mNGS can aid the identification of pathogens for respiratory system infection.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2024-,"Li Z, Tan L, Zhang J, Long Q, Chen Z, Xiang Z, Wu W, Guo Z, Liu H, Hu B, Yang B, Hu M",12,1710,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This paper explored the significance of mathematical modeling in epidemic control efforts, focusing on the interplay between vaccination strategies, disease transmission rates, and population immunity. To facilitate meaningful comparisons of vaccination strategies, we maintained a consistent framework by fixing the vaccination capacity to vary from 10 to 100% of the total population. As an example, at a 50% vaccination capacity, the pulse strategy averted approximately 45.61% of deaths, while continuous and hybrid strategies averted around 45.18 and 45.69%, respectively. Sensitivity analysis further indicated that continuous vaccination has a more direct impact on reducing the basic reproduction number $ R_0 $ compared to pulse vaccination. By analyzing key parameters such as $ R_0 $, pulse vaccination coefficients, and continuous vaccination parameters, the study underscores the value of mathematical modeling in shaping public health policies and guiding decision-making during disease outbreaks.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2024-Sep,"Bolatova D, Kadyrov S, Kashkynbayev A",3,1197,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Microbiologists are often part of such teams, along with public health specialists, clinicians and entomologists, and can contribute to the response in multiple ways. The role of a microbiologist is critical not only for laboratory diagnosis of infectious diseases, but also for situational analysis and evaluation, planning, prevention and control. The task begins with risk assessment, specifically for identification of diseases epidemic and endemic to the area. Evaluation of existing laboratory setups and establishment of services where none exist is a priority, including facilitation of a tiered laboratory system. Training of laboratory staff at short notice in field settings, biosafety and biomedical waste management are niche areas where microbiologists can contribute. Emerging focus areas include establishment of modular laboratories, infection prevention and control in community evacuation centres and considerations for reopening of healthcare facilities closed due to extensive natural damage.

31284037,Profiling infectious diseases in Turkey after the influx of 3.5 million Syrian refugees.,"Since 2011, the conflict in Syria has led to over five million refugees. Turkey hosts the highest number of Syrian refugees in the world. By February 2019 over 3.6 million people had fled to Turkey to seek safety. Only 6.1% of Syrian refugees live in temporary shelters. Owing to the disrupted healthcare services, many children coming from the conflict zones are less likely to have received vaccination. In temporary shelters immunization coverage is >95% and the refugee population is receptive to vaccination. The objective of this study was to review the infectious diseases situation among Syrian refugees in Turkey. We have reviewed the reports and studies provided by the governmental and non-governmental organizations and obtained more detailed data from the Ministry of Health in Turkey. Between 2012 and 2016, 1 299 209 cases of respiratory tract infection and 158 058 episodes of diarrhoea with 59 bloody diarrhoeas were reported; 1354 hepatitis A cases and 108 active tuberculosis cases were detected and treated in the temporary shelters for Syrian refugees. Overall in Turkey, 7794 cutaneous leishmaniasis have been reported. Since the influx of Syrian refugees, there has been an increase in cases of leishmaniasis and measles. No significant increase was detected for tuberculosis, other vector-borne infections, and healthcare associated or sexually transmitted infections. The Syrian refugees can be considered as a vulnerable group in Turkey due to their living and working conditions.

33897683,Modulatory Effects of Probiotics During Pathogenic Infections With Emphasis on Immune Regulation.,"In order to inhibit pathogenic complications and to enhance animal and poultry growth, antibiotics have been extensively used for many years. Antibiotics applications not only affect target pathogens but also intestinal beneficially microbes, inducing long-lasting changes in intestinal microbiota associated with diseases. The application of antibiotics also has many other side effects like, intestinal barrier dysfunction, antibiotics residues in foodstuffs, nephropathy, allergy, bone marrow toxicity, mutagenicity, reproductive disorders, hepatotoxicity carcinogenicity, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which greatly compromise the efficacy of antibiotics. Thus, the development of new antibiotics is necessary, while the search for antibiotic alternatives continues. Probiotics are considered the ideal antibiotic substitute; in recent years, probiotic research concerning their application during pathogenic infections in humans, aquaculture, poultry, and livestock industry, with emphasis on modulating the immune system of the host, has been attracting considerable interest. Hence, the adverse effects of antibiotics and remedial effects of probiotics during infectious diseases have become central points of focus among researchers. Probiotics are live microorganisms, and when given in adequate quantities, confer good health effects to the host through different mechanisms. Among them, the regulation of host immune response during pathogenic infections is one of the most important mechanisms. A number of studies have investigated different aspects of probiotics. In this review, we mainly summarize recent discoveries and discuss two important aspects: (1) the application of probiotics during pathogenic infections; and (2) their modulatory effects on the immune response of the host during infectious and non-infectious diseases.",Frontiers in immunology,2021-,"Raheem A, Liang L, Zhang G, Cui S",4,1851,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33966687,Skewness in the literature on infectious livestock diseases in an emerging economy - the case of Vietnam.,"Livestock production has increased in many emerging economies, but productivity is often substantially impaired by infectious diseases. The first step towards improved livestock health and productivity is to map the presence of livestock diseases. The objective of this review was to summarize studies conducted on such diseases in an emerging economy, Vietnam, and thereby identifying knowledge gaps that may inform the design of surveillance and control programs. Few studies were found to evaluate the distribution of infectious livestock diseases other than avian influenza. Also, many regions with dense livestock populations had received little attention in terms of disease investigation. A large proportion of the studies dealt with zoonoses and food-borne infections which might be due to funding agencies priorities. On the contrary, studies targeting infections that affect livestock and their productivity were few. We think that this limitation in scientific reports on infectious diseases that only affect livestock productivity is a common phenomenon in low and lower middle income countries. More science-based data on such diseases would help policymakers to prioritize which livestock diseases should be subject to animal health programs aimed to support rural livelihoods and economic development.",Animal health research reviews,2021-Jun,"Rajala E, Lee HS, Nam NH, Huong CTT, Son HM, Wieland B, Magnusson U",7,1316,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

In this paper we discuss the results of these cohorts and their impact on the response to the HIV pandemic in Uganda. IDI invested in experienced system developers, clinic and laboratory capacity to create the infrastructure to host longitudinal cohorts. Several cohorts were created, including patients initiated and followed up on ART, specialized cohorts (e.g. TB co-infection) and long-term cohorts with patients on ART for over 10 years and aged 60 and above. These cohorts function as platforms for sub-studies, attracting collaborators and students. Data from the IDI cohorts contributed evidence to ART programs on when to start, which drugs to use, how to best monitor and which models of care to implement.

34611689,Nanomedicine as a promising strategy for the theranostics of infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi and their global spread pose a great threat to human health. The 2019 World Health Organization report predicted that infection-related mortality will be similar to cancer mortality by 2050. Particularly, the global cumulative numbers of the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have reached 110.7 million cases and over 2.4 million deaths as of February 23, 2021. Moreover, the crisis of these infectious diseases exposes the many problems of traditional diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, such as time-consuming and unselective detection methods, the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, serious side effects, and poor drug delivery. There is an urgent need for rapid and sensitive diagnosis as well as high efficacy and low toxicity treatments. The emergence of nanomedicine has provided a promising strategy to greatly enhance detection methods and drug treatment efficacy. Owing to their unique optical, magnetic, and electrical properties, nanoparticles (NPs) have great potential for the fast and selective detection of bacteria, viruses, and fungi. NPs exhibit remarkable antibacterial activity by releasing reactive oxygen species and metal ions, exerting photothermal effects, and causing destruction of the cell membrane. Nano-based delivery systems can further improve drug permeability, reduce the side effects of drugs, and prolong systemic circulation time and drug half-life. Moreover, effective drugs against COVID-19 are still lacking. Recently, nanomedicine has shown great potential to accelerate the development of safe and novel anti-COVID-19 drugs. This article reviews the fundamental mechanisms and the latest developments in the treatment and diagnosis of bacteria, viruses, and fungi and discusses the challenges and perspectives in the application of nanomedicine.",Journal of materials chemistry.

However, animal disease surveillance and diagnosis in LMICs is often challenging, and turnaround times between sample submission and diagnosis can take days to weeks. This diagnostic gap and subsequent disease under-reporting can allow emerging and transboundary animal pathogens to spread, with potentially serious and far-reaching consequences. Point-of-care tests (POCTs), which allow for rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases in non-laboratory settings, have the potential to significantly disrupt traditional animal health surveillance paradigms in LMICs. This literature review sought to identify POCTs currently available for diagnosing infectious animal diseases and to determine facilitators and barriers to their use and uptake in LMICs. Results indicated that some veterinary POCTs have been used for field-based animal disease diagnosis in LMICs with good results. However, many POCTs target a small number of key agricultural and zoonotic animal diseases, while few exist for other important animal diseases. POCT evaluation is rarely taken beyond the laboratory and into the field where they are predicted to have the greatest impact, and where conditions can greatly affect test performance. A lack of mandated test validation regulations for veterinary POCTs has allowed tests of varying quality to enter the market, presenting challenges for potential customers. The use of substandard, improperly validated or unsuitable POCTs in LMICs can greatly undermine their true potential and can have far-reaching negative impacts on disease control. To successfully implement novel rapid diagnostic pathways for animal disease in LMICs, technical, regulatory, socio-political and economic challenges must be overcome, and further research is urgently needed before the potential of animal disease POCTs can be fully realized.",Transboundary and emerging diseases,2021-Jul,"Hobbs EC, Colling A, Gurung RB, Allen J",4,2061,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The NET-Heart Project: Rationale and Design.,"Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of infections that are prevalent in many of the tropical and sub-tropical developing countries where poverty is rampant. NTDs have remained largely unnoticed in the global health agenda. There is a substantial gap between the burden of disease for NTDs in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and research devoted to the affected populations. We created a Latin-American initiative with emerging leaders (EL) from the Interamerican Society of Cardiology (IASC) with the objective to perform multiple systematic reviews of NTDs and other infectious diseases affecting the heart: The NET-Heart Project. To describe the rationale and design considerations of the NET-Heart project. The NET-Heart Project is a collaborative work of the IASC EL program. The main objective of the NET-Heart project is to systematically evaluate the available evidence of NTDs and other infectious diseases and their cardiovascular involvement. As a secondary objective, this initiative aims to offer recommendations and potential diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms that can aid the management of cardiovascular complications of these infectious diseases. After an expert discussion 17 initial infectious diseases were selected, for each disease we created one working group. The project was structured in different phases: Systematic review, brainstorming workshops, analysis and results, manuscript writing and recommendations and evaluation of clinical implications. The NET-Heart project is an innovative collaborative initiative created to assess burden and impact of NTDs and other infectious diseases in CVD.

39241918,Artificial intelligence with mass spectrometry-based multimodal molecular profiling methods for advancing therapeutic discovery of infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases, driven by a diverse array of pathogens, can swiftly undermine public health systems. Accurate diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases-centered around the identification of biomarkers and the elucidation of disease mechanisms-are in dire need of more versatile and practical analytical approaches. Mass spectrometry (MS)-based molecular profiling methods can deliver a wealth of information on a range of functional molecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, and metabolites. While MS-driven omics analyses can yield vast datasets, the sheer complexity and multi-dimensionality of MS data can significantly hinder the identification and characterization of functional molecules within specific biological processes and events. Artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a potent complementary tool that can substantially enhance the processing and interpretation of MS data. AI applications in this context lead to the reduction of spurious signals, the improvement of precision, the creation of standardized analytical frameworks, and the increase of data integration efficiency. This critical review emphasizes the pivotal roles of MS based omics strategies in the discovery of biomarkers and the clarification of infectious diseases. Additionally, the review underscores the transformative ability of AI techniques to enhance the utility of MS-based molecular profiling in the field of infectious diseases by refining the quality and practicality of data produced from omics analyses. In conclusion, we advocate for a forward-looking strategy that integrates AI with MS-based molecular profiling. This integration aims to transform the analytical landscape and the performance of biological molecule characterization, potentially down to the single-cell level. Such advancements are anticipated to propel the development of AI-driven predictive models, thus improving the monitoring of diagnostics and therapeutic discovery for the ongoing challenge related to infectious diseases.",Pharmacology & therapeutics,2024-Nov,"Liu J, Bao C, Zhang J, Han Z, Fang H, Lu H",6,2011,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Emerging infectious diseases also threaten livestock and wildlife populations around the world and can lead to devastating economic damages. China and the USA-due to their unparalleled resources, widespread engagement in activities driving emerging infectious diseases and national as well as geopolitical imperatives to contribute to global health security-play an essential role in our understanding of pandemic threats. Critical to efforts to mitigate risk is building upon existing investments in global capacity to develop training and research focused on the ecological factors driving infectious disease spillover from animals to humans. International cooperation, particularly between China and the USA, is essential to fully engage the resources and scientific strengths necessary to add this ecological emphasis to the pandemic preparedness strategy. Here, we review the world's current state of emerging infectious disease preparedness, the ecological and evolutionary knowledge needed to anticipate disease emergence, the roles that China and the USA currently play as sources and solutions to mitigating risk, and the next steps needed to better protect the global community from zoonotic disease.",EcoHealth,2020-Mar,"Smiley Evans T, Shi Z, Boots M, Liu W, Olival KJ, Xiao X, Vandewoude S, Brown H, Chen JL, Civitello DJ, Escobar L, Grohn Y, Li H, Lips K, Liu Q, Lu J, Martínez-López B, Shi J, Shi X, Xu B, Yuan L, Zhu G, Getz WM",23,1292,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34594332,Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-Like Receptors in Regulating the Immune Response in Infectious Diseases: A Window of Opportunity to Pathogen Persistence and a Sound Target in Therapeutics.,"Immunoregulatory receptors are essential for orchestrating an immune response as well as appropriate inflammation in infectious and non-communicable diseases. Among them, leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRs) consist of activating and inhibitory receptors that play an important role in regulating immune responses modulating the course of disease progression. On the one hand, inhibitory LILRs constitute a safe-guard system that mitigates the inflammatory response, allowing a prompt return to immune homeostasis. On the other hand, because of their unique capacity to attenuate immune responses, pathogens use inhibitory LILRs to evade immune recognition, thus facilitating their persistence within the host. Conversely, the engagement of activating LILRs triggers immune responses and the production of inflammatory mediators to fight microbes. However, their heightened activation could lead to an exacerbated immune response and persistent inflammation with major consequences on disease outcome and autoimmune disorders. Here, we review the genetic organisation, structure and ligands of LILRs as well as their role in regulating the immune response and inflammation. We also discuss the LILR-based strategies that pathogens use to evade immune responses. A better understanding of the contribution of LILRs to host-pathogen interactions is essential to define appropriate treatments to counteract the severity and/or persistence of pathogens in acute and chronic infectious diseases lacking efficient treatments.",Frontiers in immunology,2021-,"Abdallah F, Coindre S, Gardet M, Meurisse F, Naji A, Suganuma N, Abi-Rached L, Lambotte O, Favier B",9,1530,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This is the salient question that this research inquiry unravels for 34 African economies from 2000 to 2017. The empirical evidence revealed the following through a generalized method of moments (SGMM) inter alia: First, the mitigating roles of infectious diseases, such as malaria, HIV prevalence rate and AIDS, on global FDI inflows are unconditionally certified from a statistical and economic sense. Second, the diminishing influences of other confounders, such as low per capita GDP, shallow financial development, excruciating inflationary trend, and natural resource rents curse, are empirically endorsed, on the one hand, while the persistent nature of FDI and trade openness as boosting mechanisms for FDI are unambiguously applauded, on the other hand. Finally, a reduction in the numerical strength of the estimates after accounting for the outliers' effect from the models and the inclusion of additional controls do not diminish the robustness of already established findings, except for the HIV prevalence rate. On the policy front, if the foreign direct investment is truly pro-development outcomes, any policy interventions that eliminate infectious diseases will be Pareto-improving.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022-Nov,"Ajide KB, Zhang Q, Ibrahim RL, Shah SAR",4,1321,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
31538184,From the Pipeline to the Bedside: Advances and Challenges in Clinical Metagenomics.,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized multiple areas in the field of infectious diseases, from pathogen discovery to characterization of genes mediating drug resistance. Consequently, there is much anticipation that NGS technologies may be harnessed in the realm of diagnostic methods to complement or replace current culture-based and molecular microbiologic techniques. In this context, much consideration has been given to hypothesis-free, culture-independent tests that can be performed directly on primary clinical samples. The closest realizations of such universal diagnostic methods achieved to date are based on targeted amplicon and unbiased metagenomic shotgun NGS approaches. Depending on the exact details of implementation and analysis, these approaches have the potential to detect viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and archaea, including organisms that were previously undiscovered and those that are uncultivatable. Shotgun metagenomics approaches additionally can provide information on the presence of virulence and resistance genetic elements. While many limitations to the use of NGS in clinical microbiology laboratories are being overcome with decreasing technology costs, expanding curated pathogen sequence databases, and better data analysis tools, there remain many challenges to the routine use and implementation of these methods. This review summarizes recent advances in applications of targeted amplicon and shotgun-based metagenomics approaches to infectious disease diagnostic methods.

37335437,SPADE4: Sparsity and Delay Embedding Based Forecasting of Epidemics.,"Predicting the evolution of diseases is challenging, especially when the data availability is scarce and incomplete. The most popular tools for modelling and predicting infectious disease epidemics are compartmental models. They stratify the population into compartments according to health status and model the dynamics of these compartments using dynamical systems. However, these predefined systems may not capture the true dynamics of the epidemic due to the complexity of the disease transmission and human interactions. In order to overcome this drawback, we propose Sparsity and Delay Embedding based Forecasting (SPADE4) for predicting epidemics. SPADE4 predicts the future trajectory of an observable variable without the knowledge of the other variables or the underlying system. We use random features model with sparse regression to handle the data scarcity issue and employ Takens' delay embedding theorem to capture the nature of the underlying system from the observed variable.

34111134,"Which public health interventions are effective in reducing morbidity, mortality and health inequalities from infectious diseases amongst children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs): An umbrella review.","Despite significant progress in the last few decades, infectious diseases remain a major threat to child health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)-particularly amongst more disadvantaged groups. It is imperative to understand the best available evidence concerning which public health interventions reduce morbidity, mortality and health inequalities in children aged under five years. To address this gap, we carried out an umbrella review (a systematic reviews of reviews) to identify evidence on the effects of public health interventions (promotion, protection, prevention) on morbidity, mortality and/or health inequalities due to infectious diseases amongst children in LMICs. Ten databases were searched for records published between 2014-2021 alongside a manual search of gray literature. Articles were quality-assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews tool (AMSTAR 2). A narrative synthesis was conducted. We identified 60 systematic reviews synthesizing 453 individual primary studies. A majority of the reviews reported on preventive interventions (n = 48), with a minority on promotion (n = 17) and almost no reviews covering health protection interventions (n = 2). Effective interventions for improving child health across the whole population, as well as the most disadvantaged included communication, education and social mobilization for specific preventive services or tools, such as immunization or bed nets. For all other interventions, the effects were either unclear, unknown or detrimental, either at the overall population level or regarding health inequalities. We found few reviews reporting health inequalities information and the quality of the evidence base was generally low. Our umbrella review identified some prevention interventions that might be useful in reducing under five mortality from infectious diseases in LMICs, particularly amongst the most disadvantaged groups.",PloS one,2021-,"Besnier E, Thomson K, Stonkute D, Mohammad T, Akhter N, Todd A, Rom Jensen M, Kilvik A, Bambra C",9,1935,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36707203,Exploring the role of secretory proteins in the human infectious diseases diagnosis and therapeutics.,"Secretory proteins are playing important role during the host-pathogen interaction to develop the infection or protection into the cell. Pathogens developing infectious disease to human being are taken up by host macrophages or number of immune cells, play an important role in physiological, developmental and immunological function. At the same time, infectious agents are also secreting various proteins to neutralize the resistance caused by host cells and also helping the pathogens to develop the infection. Secretory proteins (secretome) are only developed at the time of host-pathogen interaction, therefore they become very important to develop the targeted and potential therapeutic strategies. Pathogen specific secretory proteins released during interaction with host cell provide opportunity to develop point of care and rapid diagnostic kits. Proteins secreted by pathogens at the time of interaction with host cell have also been found as immunogenic in nature and numbers of vaccines have been developed to control the spread of human infectious diseases. This chapter highlights the importance of secretory proteins in the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to fight against human infectious diseases.",Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology,2023-,"Kalita E, Panda M, Rao A, Prajapati VK",4,1236,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The sheer diversity of pathogens, AMR mechanisms, and transmission pathways connecting these reservoirs create the need for comprehensive cross-sectoral surveillance to effectively monitor risks. Current approaches are often siloed by discipline and sector, focusing independently on parts of the whole. Here we advocate that integrated surveillance approaches, developed through transdisciplinary cross-sector collaboration, are key to addressing the dual crises of infectious diseases and AMR. We first review the areas of need, challenges, and benefits of cross-sectoral surveillance, then summarise and evaluate the major detection methods already available to achieve this (culture, quantitative PCR, and metagenomic sequencing). Finally, we outline how cross-sectoral surveillance initiatives can be fostered at multiple scales of action, and present key considerations for implementation and the development of effective systems to manage and integrate this information for the benefit of multiple sectors.

39411713,Future applications of host direct therapies for infectious disease treatment.,"New and emerging pathogens, such as SARS-CoV2 have highlighted the requirement for threat agnostic therapies. Some antibiotics or antivirals can demonstrate broad-spectrum activity against pathogens in the same family or genus but efficacy can quickly reduce due to their specific mechanism of action and for the ability of the disease causing agent to evolve. This has led to the generation of antimicrobial resistant strains, making infectious diseases more difficult to treat. Alternative approaches therefore need to be considered, which include exploring the utility of Host-Directed Therapies (HDTs). This is a growing area with huge potential but difficulties arise due to the complexity of disease profiles. For example, a HDT given early during infection may not be appropriate or as effective when the disease has become chronic or when a patient is in intensive care. With the growing understanding of immune function, a new generation of HDT for the treatment of disease could allow targeting specific pathways to augment or diminish the host response, dependent upon disease profile, and allow for bespoke therapeutic management plans. This review highlights promising and approved HDTs that can manipulate the immune system throughout the spectrum of disease, in particular to viral and bacterial pathogens, and demonstrates how the advantages of HDT will soon outweigh the potential side effects.",Frontiers in immunology,2024-,"Thom RE, D'Elia RV",2,1411,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The present study presents and assesses the ATSS framework. During the study period of October 2017 through November 2018, we monitored 33 areas for symptoms of 9 categories: vomiting/nausea, dizziness, palpitation, unconsciousness, breathing disorder, fever, spasm/paralysis, collapse/weakness, and bloody emesis/nasal hemorrhage.

To evaluate demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who visited the ED of our hospital and underwent an IDCM consultation. In this cross-sectional study, we reviewed the medical records of adult patients who visited the ED of our hospital between May and August 2021 and needed IDCM consultation. The demographic data, the date and time of admission and consultation, the departments that were consulted before IDCM, laboratory results, diagnosis, and outcome were recorded. Out of 42,116 ED visits, 1,007 (2.4%) IDCM consultations were requested. The median time between admission and IDCM consultation was 239 min (150.0-373.5). Before 56.9% of IDCM consultations, pre-consultations were requested from other departments, and the time interval was significantly longer. The median age of patients was 68 years (51-77 years). Infections were confirmed by the IDCM physician in 79.6% of the consultations. The most diagnosed infections were urinary tract infections (32.4%), skin-soft tissue infections (16.9%) and lower respiratory tract infections (10.3%), whereas 9.3% of the consultations resulted in hospitalization to the infection ward, 25.1% to other wards, and 5% to the intensive care unit (ICU).

35095888,"The Interplay Between Neuroinfections, the Immune System and Neurological Disorders: A Focus on Africa.","Neurological disorders related to neuroinfections are highly prevalent in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), constituting a major cause of disability and economic burden for patients and society. These include epilepsy, dementia, motor neuron diseases, headache disorders, sleep disorders, and peripheral neuropathy. The highest prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is in SSA. Consequently, there is a high prevalence of neurological disorders associated with HIV infection such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, motor disorders, chronic headaches, and peripheral neuropathy in the region. The pathogenesis of these neurological disorders involves the direct role of the virus, some antiretroviral treatments, and the dysregulated immune system. Furthermore, the high prevalence of epilepsy in SSA (mainly due to perinatal causes) is exacerbated by infections such as toxoplasmosis, neurocysticercosis, onchocerciasis, malaria, bacterial meningitis, tuberculosis, and the immune reactions they elicit. Sleep disorders are another common problem in the region and have been associated with infectious diseases such as human African trypanosomiasis and HIV and involve the activation of the immune system. While most headache disorders are due to benign primary headaches, some secondary headaches are caused by infections (meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess). HIV and neurosyphilis, both common in SSA, can trigger long-standing immune activation in the central nervous system (CNS) potentially resulting in dementia. Despite the progress achieved in preventing diseases from the poliovirus and retroviruses, these microbes may cause motor neuron diseases in SSA. The immune mechanisms involved in these neurological disorders include increased cytokine levels, immune cells infiltration into the CNS, and autoantibodies.

Over the last decades, sequencing and bioinformatic solutions supporting CMg have much evolved and an increasing number of case reports and series covering various infectious diseases have been published. Metagenomics is a new approach to infectious disease diagnosis that is currently being developed and is certainly one of the most promising for the coming years. However, most CMg studies are retrospective, and few address the potential impact CMg could have on patient management, including initiation, adaptation, or cessation of antimicrobials. In this narrative review, we have discussed the potential role of CMg in bacteriology, virology, mycology, and parasitology. Several reports and case-series confirm that CMg is an innovative tool with which one can (i) identify more microorganisms than with conventional methods in a single test, (ii) obtain results within hours, and (iii) tailor the antimicrobial regimen of patients.

37232310,Reshaping surveillance for infectious diseases: less chasing of pathogens and more monitoring of drivers.,"Animal health surveillance, despite its name, tends to focus on looking for disease. Often this involves searching for cases of infection with known pathogens (â€˜pathogen chasing'). Such an approach is both resource intensive and limited by the requirement for prior knowledge of disease likelihood. In this paper, the authors propose the gradual reshaping of surveillance towards the systems level, focusing on the processes (â€˜drivers') that promote disease or health, rather than on the presence or absence of specific pathogens. Examples of relevant drivers include land-use change, increasing global interconnectedness, and finance and capital flows. Importantly, the authors suggest that surveillance should focus on detecting changes in patterns or quantities associated with such drivers. This would generate systems-level, risk-based surveillance information to identify areas where additional attention may be needed, and, over time, inform the implementation of prevention efforts. The collection, integration and analysis of data on drivers is likely to require investment in improving data infrastructures. A period of overlap would allow the two systems (traditional surveillance and driver monitoring) to be compared and calibrated. This would also lead to a better understanding of the drivers and their linkages, and thereby generate new knowledge that can improve surveillance and inform mitigation efforts. Since surveillance of drivers may give signals when changes are occurring, which could act as alerts and enable targeted mitigation, this might even enable disease to be prevented before it happens by directly intervening in the drivers themselves. Such surveillance focused on the drivers could be expected to bring additional benefits, since the same drivers promote multiple diseases. Further, focusing on drivers rather than pathogens should enable control of currently unknown diseases, making this approach particularly timely, given the increasing risk of emergence of new diseases.",Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),2023-May,"Drewe JA, George J, Hasler B",3,2017,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The identification of research themes and global contributions offers valuable insights. This manuscript aims to analyse and map scientific research on POCT in the context of infectious diseases. The study employed a comprehensive search strategy using terms related to POCT and infectious diseases. The search was conducted on the Scopus database, refining results based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The dataset of 1719 research articles was then subjected to descriptive analysis and mapping using VOSviewer. The research findings indicate an exponential growth in POCT-related publications, with 46.8% published post the COVID-19 pandemic. Plos One journal led in publication frequency, and Biosensors and Bioelectronics received the highest citations per article. North America and Western Europe dominated contributions, with notable participation from China, South Africa, and India. The research landscape revealed the following research themes: detection technologies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis, antibiotic optimisation, and schistosomiasis. Clinical trials focused on antibiotic prescribing, HIV, STIs, and specific infections. The findings suggest a shifting landscape towards POCT, emphasising the need for future planning and investment in healthcare systems. The research identifies areas for future exploration, such as the impact of POCT on antibiotic prescribing and its role in combating infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries. Implementation of POCT has the potential to revolutionise infectious disease management, improve patient outcomes, and reduce the global burden of diseases. Better public awareness, healthcare team management, and planning for POCT at entry points are crucial for societal benefit.

The paradigm of coevolution between pathogens and particular hosts teaches that emerging diseases occur only when pathogens evolve specific capacities that allow them to move to new hosts. EIDs ought to be rare and unpredictable, so crisis response is the best we can do. Alternatively, the Stockholm Paradigm suggests that the world is full of susceptible but unexposed hosts that pathogens could infect, given the opportunity. Global climate change, globalized trade and travel, urbanization and land-use changes (often associated with biodiversity loss) increase those opportunities, making EID frequent. We can, however, anticipate their arrival in new locations and their behaviour once they have arrived. We can 'find them before they find us', mitigating their impacts. The DAMA (Document, Assess, Monitor, Act) protocol alters the current reactive stance and embodies proactive solutions to anticipate and mitigate the impacts of EID, extending human and material resources and buying time for development of new vaccinations, medications and control measures.",Transboundary and emerging diseases,2022-Mar,"Brooks DR, Hoberg EP, Boeger WA, Trivellone V",4,1421,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35285684,Generation of Human Lung Organoid Cultures from Healthy and Tumor Tissue to Study Infectious Diseases.,"Respiratory viruses cause mild to severe diseases in humans every year, constituting a major public health problem. Characterizing the pathogenesis in physiologically relevant models is crucial for developing efficient vaccines and therapeutics. Here, we show that lung organoids derived from human primary or lung tumor tissue maintain the cellular composition and characteristics of the original tissue. Moreover, we show that these organoids sustain viral replication with particular infection foci formation, and they activate the expression of interferon-associated and proinflammatory genes responsible for mediating a robust innate immune response. All together, we show that three-dimensional (3D) lung organoids constitute a relevant platform to model diseases and enable the development of drug screenings. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> Three-dimensional (3D) human lung organoids reflect the native cell composition of the lung as well as its physiological properties. Human 3D lung organoids offer ideal conditions, such as timely availability in large quantities and high physiological relevance for reassessment and prediction of disease outbreaks of respiratory pathogens and pathogens that use the lung as a primary entry portal. Human lung organoids can be used in basic research and diagnostic settings as early warning cell culture systems and also serve as a relevant platform for modeling infectious diseases and drug development. They can be used to characterize pathogens and analyze the influence of infection on, for example, immunological parameters, such as the expression of interferon-associated and proinflammatory genes in the context of cancer. In our study, we found that cancer-derived lung organoids were more sensitive to influenza A virus infection than those derived from healthy tissue and demonstrated a decreased innate immune response.",Journal of virology,2022-Apr,"Salgueiro L, Kummer S, Sonntag-Buck V, Weiß A, Schneider MA, Kräusslich HG, Sotillo R",7,1865,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Their small size, good tissue penetration, high stability and solubility, ease of expression, refolding ability, and negligible immunogenicity in the human body have granted them excellence over conventional antibodies. Those exceptional attributes of nanobodies make them promising candidates for various applications in biotechnology, medicine, protein engineering, structural biology, food, and agriculture. This review presents an overview of their structure, development methods, advantages, possible challenges, and applications with special emphasis on infectious diseases-related ones. A showcase of how nanobodies can be harnessed for applications including neutralization of viruses and combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria is detailed. Overall, the impact of nanobodies in vaccine design, rapid diagnostics, and targeted therapies, besides exploring their role in deciphering microbial structures and virulence mechanisms are highlighted.

Many infectious diseases such as syphilis, diphtheria, measles, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome have specific and non-specific manifestations in the oral cavity. However, the same disease may have different oral manifestations in different patients clinically. We can apply the strategy of ""three unusuals and one change"" in clinical reasoning for diagnosis of infectious diseases with oral manifestations. The so-called ""three unusuals"" refer to unusual age, unusual location and unusual effect, and ""one change"" means the change from rare to common.

37395450,Antisense oligonucleotides: a promising therapeutic option against infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases have been one of the biggest health problems of humanity for centuries. Nucleic acid-based therapeutics have received attention in recent years with their effectiveness in the treatment of various infectious diseases and vaccine development studies. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the basic properties underlying the mechanism of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), their applications, and their challenges. The efficient delivery of ASOs is the greatest challenge for their therapeutic success, but this problem is overcome with new-generation antisense molecules developed with chemical modifications. The types, carrier molecules, and gene regions targeted by sequences have been summarized in detail. Research and development of antisense therapy is still in its infancy; however, gene silencing therapies appear to have the potential for faster and longer-lasting activity than conventional treatment strategies. On the other hand, realizing the potential of antisense therapy will require a large initial economic investment to ascertain the pharmacological properties and learn how to optimize them. The ability of ASOs to be rapidly designed and synthesized to target different microbes can reduce drug discovery time from 6 years to 1 year. Since ASOs are not particularly affected by resistance mechanisms, they come to the fore in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. The design-based flexibility of ASOs has enabled it to be used for different types of microorganisms/genes and successful <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> results have been revealed. The current review summarized a comprehensive understanding of ASO therapy in combating bacterial and viral infections.","Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",2024-,"Tekintaş Y, Temel A",2,1739,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Although diverse solutions have been proposed, one viable solution could be the use of immune system modulators. The induction of the immune response can be increased by histone deacetylase inhibitors (iHDAC), which in turn modulate the chromatin and increase the activation of different cellular pathways and nuclear factors such as STAT3, HIF-1α NF-kB, C/EBPα and, AP-1. These pathways are capable to promote several immune response-related molecules including those with antimicrobial properties such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that lead to the elimination of pathogens including multi drug-resistant strains.",Peptides,2021-Jun,"Rodríguez-Carlos A, Jacobo-Delgado YM, Santos-Mena AO, Rivas-Santiago B",4,795,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37963966,Emerging infectious disease surveillance using a hierarchical diagnosis model and the Knox algorithm.,"Emerging infectious diseases are a critical public health challenge in the twenty-first century. The recent proliferation of such diseases has raised major social and economic concerns. Therefore, early detection of emerging infectious diseases is essential. Subjects from five medical institutions in Beijing, China, which met the spatial-specific requirements, were analyzed. A quality control process was used to select 37,422 medical records of infectious diseases and 56,133 cases of non-infectious diseases. An emerging infectious disease detection model (EIDDM), a two-layer model that divides the problem into two sub-problems, i.e., whether a case is an infectious disease, and if so, whether it is a known infectious disease, was proposed. The first layer model adopts the binary classification model TextCNN-Attention. The second layer is a multi-classification model of LightGBM based on the one-vs-rest strategy. Based on the experimental results, a threshold of 0.5 is selected. The model results were compared with those of other models such as XGBoost and Random Forest using the following evaluation indicators: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The prediction performance of the first-layer TextCNN is better than that of other comparison models. Its average specificity for non-infectious diseases is 97.57%, with an average negative predictive value of 82.63%, indicating a low risk of misdiagnosing non-infectious diseases as infectious (i.e., a low false positive rate). Its average positive predictive value for eight selected infectious diseases is 95.07%, demonstrating the model's ability to avoid misdiagnoses. The overall average accuracy of the model is 86.11%. The average prediction accuracy of the second-layer LightGBM model for emerging infectious diseases reaches 90.44%. Furthermore, the response time of a single online reasoning using the LightGBM model is approximately 27 ms, which makes it suitable for analyzing clinical records in real time. Using the Knox method, we found that all the infectious diseases were within 2000 m in our case, and a clustering feature of spatiotemporal interactions (P < 0.05) was observed as well. Performance testing and model comparison results indicated that the EIDDM is fast and accurate and can be used to monitor the onset/outbreak of emerging infectious diseases in real-world hospitals.",Scientific reports,2023-Nov,"Wang M, Yang B, Liu Y, Yang Y, Ji H, Yang C",6,2428,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Both chapters are based on the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission standard, ISO/IEC 17025:2005 'General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories'. This paper provides an update of standards and regulatory bodies relevant for accreditation of quality management systems (QMS), with a focus on ISO/IEC 17025:2017 for testing and calibration laboratories. Important issues and considerations that a laboratory should address in the design and maintenance of its QMS are highlighted and examples provided, in particular aspects of test validation and verification, including measurement uncertainty (MU). A QMS aims to address all aspects of the laboratory operation, including staff, organisational structure, processes, and procedures. Accreditation of a diagnostic laboratory requires three notable components: (a) independent or third-party assessment; (b) suitably validated tests performed by proficient laboratory operators in an adequately equipped laboratory; and (c) ongoing internal and external quality control. Together, these components ensure a test outcome is the result of a standardised process and structured peer review, and demonstrate both competency and ability to produce technically valid diagnostic results that will meet the needs of customers - veterinarians, animal owners, regulators, organisations and industry - as well as the needs of decision-makers involved in animal health and surveillance programmes.",Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),2021-Jun,"Newberry KM, Colling A",2,1789,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The impact reflects three aspects, such as climate variables, selected infectious diseases, and infectious disease components. This study demonstrates how vulnerable people are to any ill consequences that climate change may have on their health. Humans can actively influence controllable correlated health impacts by taking proactive measures, such as increasing our understanding of the detrimental effects associated with specific diseases and the patterns in climate change. We can also carefully distribute technology and resources, encouraging exercise and public awareness. It is advised to take the following adaption measures: Considering how infectious diseases and climate change are not the only things that science has discovered and create locally efficient early warning systems for those effects to produce more scientific justifications and go beyond scientific reports.

32405321,Tooling-up for infectious disease transmission modelling.,"In this introduction to the Special Issue on methods for modelling of infectious disease epidemiology we provide a commentary and overview of the field. We suggest that the field has been through three revolutions that have focussed on specific methodological developments; disease dynamics and heterogeneity, advanced computing and inference, and complexity and application to the real-world. Infectious disease dynamics and heterogeneity dominated until the 1980s where the use of analytical models illustrated fundamental concepts such as herd immunity. The second revolution embraced the integration of data with models and the increased use of computing. From the turn of the century an emergence of novel datasets enabled improved modelling of real-world complexity. The emergence of more complex data that reflect the real-world heterogeneities in transmission resulted in the development of improved inference methods such as particle filtering. Each of these three revolutions have always kept the understanding of infectious disease spread as its motivation but have been developed through the use of new techniques, tools and the availability of data. We conclude by providing a commentary on what the next revoluition in infectious disease modelling may be.",Epidemics,2020-Sep,"Baguelin M, Medley GF, Nightingale ES, O'Reilly KM, Rees EM, Waterlow NR, Wagner M",7,1269,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Refugees settled at the Thai-Myanmar border are fully dependent on support for health services, shelter, food, education, water, and sanitation. The Non-Governmental Organization Malteser International developed an integrated Primary Health Care program in close cooperation with trained camp residents over 25 years in the two settlements under its supervision. The project has been funded by the European Commission Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO). This was a retrospective primary health care project evaluation. All-cause mortality; morbidity trends in malaria, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), watery diarrhea, and dysentery; and health service utilization covering a time span of 18 years were assessed. Programmatic changes in the Primary Health Care (PHC) project and events with a potential effect on health of the target population were examined. Despite the continuous drain of trained health care workers, the volatile influx of refugees, and the isolated location of the two camps, the initial basic curative health care developed into an integrated and comprehensive PHC project including a SPHERE-compliant water, sanitation, and hygiene program. Malaria, LRTIs, watery diarrhea, and dysentery morbidity dropped twelve, three, two, and fivefold, respectively, over the 18-year period evaluated while the health services utilization dropped from 7.1 to 2.9 consultations per refugee/year. The international community may face situations where integration of refugees into the health services of the host country is not possible. In such a context, integrated and evidence-based PHC adequately funded and implemented by one health agency is an effective and relevant approach to reduce the infectious diseases burden under the constraints of semipermanent living conditions.",Primary health care research & development,2022-Mar,"Mohr O, Benner MT, Sansoenboon A, Kaloy W, McGready R, Carrara VI",6,2038,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33956823,African based researchers' output on models for the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and public health interventions: A scoping review.,"Applied epidemiological models are used in predicting future trends of diseases, for the basic understanding of disease and health dynamics, and to improve the measurement of health indicators. Mapping the research outputs of epidemiological modelling studies concerned with transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and public health interventions in Africa will help to identify the areas with substantial levels of research activities, areas with gaps, and research output trends. A scoping review of applied epidemiological models of infectious disease studies that involved first or last authors affiliated to African institutions was conducted. Eligible studies were those concerned with the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and public health interventions. The review was consistent with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews. Four electronic databases were searched for peer-reviewed publications up to the end of April 2020. Of the 5927 publications identified, 181 met the inclusion criteria. The review identified 143 publications with first authors having an African institutional affiliation (AIA), while 81 had both first and last authors with an AIA. The publication authors were found to be predominantly affiliated with institutions based in South Africa and Kenya. Furthermore, human immunodeficiency virus, malaria, tuberculosis, and Ebola virus disease were found to be the most researched infectious diseases. There has been a gradual increase in research productivity across Africa especially in the last ten years, with several collaborative efforts spread both within and beyond Africa. Research productivity in applied epidemiological modelling studies of infectious diseases may have increased, but there remains an under-representation of African researchers as leading authors.

From the 1880s until World War I, concerns about ""infection by telephone"" in the British press prompted medical authorities and the National Telephone Company to investigate whether using the telephone, especially in public places, increased the possibility of contracting infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria. This article reconstructs for the first time these transnational debates and the associated medical experiments. In contrast to previous scholarship, which has conceptualized health concerns associated with the telephone primarily within the framework of a nervous modernity, this article argues that the anxieties about ""infectious telephones"" also reflected the complex negotiations surrounding the emergence of new telecommunication networks and medical theories.

33309629,Epidemiological trends of imported infectious diseases in Japan: Analysis of imported 2-year infectious disease registry data.,"The epidemiology of infectious diseases in Japan remains undefined despite the increasing tourism. GeoSentinel, an epidemiological surveillance system for reporting imported infectious diseases, has only two participating facilities in Japan. Although the number of infectious diseases is reported by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, there is no detailed clinical information about these cases. Therefore, we established J-RIDA (Japan Registry for Infectious Diseases from Abroad) to clarify the status of imported infectious diseases in Japan and provide detailed information. J-RIDA was started as a registry of imported infectious diseases. Case registration began in October 2017. Between October 2017 and September 2019, 15 medical institutions participated in this clinical study. The registry collected information about the patient's age, sex, nationality, chief complaint, consultation date, date of onset, whether visit was made to a travel clinic before travel, blood test results (if samples were collected), travel history, and final diagnosis. Of the 3046 cases included in this study, 46.7% to Southeast Asia, 13.0% to Africa, 13.7% to East Asia, 11.5% to South Asia, 7.5% to Europe, 3.8% to Central and South America, 4.6% to North America, 3.9% to Oceania, and 2.8% to Central and west Asia. More than 85% of chief complaints were fever and general symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory symptoms, or dermatologic problems.

Currently, we use PIA in the longitudinal study ZIFCO (Integrated DZIF Infection Cohort within the German National Cohort) in Hannover (Germany) to investigate e.g. associations of risk factors and infectious diseases. Our aim was to assess user acceptance and compliance to determine suitability of PIA for epidemiological research on transient infectious diseases. ZIFCO participants used PIA to answer weekly questionnaires on health status and report spontaneous onset of symptoms. In case of symptoms of a respiratory infection, the app requested participants to self-sample a nasal swab for viral analysis. To assess user acceptance, we implemented the System Usability Scale (SUS) and fitted a linear regression model on the resulting score. For investigation of compliance with submitting the weekly health questionnaires, we used a logistic regression model with binomial response. We analyzed data of 313 participants (median age 52.5 years, 52.4% women). An average SUS of 72.0 reveals good acceptance of PIA. Participants with a higher technology readiness score at the beginning of study participation also reported higher user acceptance. Overall compliance with submitting the weekly health questionnaires showed a median of 55.7%. Being female, of younger age and being enrolled for a longer time decreased the odds to respond. However, women over 60 had a higher chance to respond than women under 60, while men under 40 had the highest chance to respond. Compliance with nasal swab self-sampling was 77.2%.

Unaffected by the homeostasis mechanism in the human body, urine accommodates systemic changes and reflects the pathophysiological condition of an individual. Easy availability in large volumes and non-invasive sample collection have rendered urine an ideal source of biomarkers for various diseases. Infectious diseases may be communicable, and therefore early diagnosis and treatment are of immense importance. Current diagnostic approaches preclude the timely identification of clinical conditions and also lack portability. Point-of-care (POC) testing solutions have gained attention as alternative diagnostic measures due to their ability to provide rapid and on-site results. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) are the mainstay in POC device development and have attracted interest owing to their potential to provide instantaneous results in resource-limited settings. The discovery and optimization of a definitive biomarker can render POC testing an excellent platform, thus impacting unwarranted antibiotic administration and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. This Review summarizes the importance of urine as an emerging biological fluid in infectious disease research and diagnosis in clinical settings. We review the academic research related to LFAs. Further, we also describe commercial POC devices based on the identification of urinary biomarkers as diagnostic targets for infectious diseases.

The proposed method combines statistical modeling with numerical methods to solve nonlinear equations and obtain optimal batch sizes at each step of tests, with the flexibility to incorporate geographic and demographic information. In theory, this method substantially improves the false positive rate and positive predictive value as well. We also conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to verify this theory. Our simulation results show that our method significantly reduces the false negative rate. More accurate assessment can be made if the dilution effect or other practical factors are taken into consideration.

Disproportionate investment in vertical health programs can result in health systems vulnerable to collapse when resources are strained, such as during pandemics. Although NCDs are largely preventable, globally there is underinvestment in efforts to address them. Integrating health systems to collectively address NCDs and infectious diseases through a wide range of services in a comprehensive manner reduces the economic burden of healthcare and strengthens the healthcare system. Health system resiliency is essential for health security. In this article, we provide an economically sound approach to incorporating NCDs into routine healthcare services in LMICs through improved alignment of institutions that support prevention and control of both NCDs and infectious diseases. Examples from Zambia's multisector interventions to develop and support a national NCD action plan can inform and encourage LMIC countries to invest in systems integration to reduce the social and economic burden of NCDs and infectious diseases.",Health security,2022-,"Richter P, Aslam M, Kostova D, Lasu AAR, Vliet GV, Courtney LP, Chisenga T",7,1308,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34667214,Linking climate and infectious disease trends in the Northern/Arctic Region.,"Recognition of climate-sensitive infectious diseases is crucial for mitigating health threats from climate change. Recent studies have reasoned about potential climate sensitivity of diseases in the Northern/Arctic Region, where climate change is particularly pronounced. By linking disease and climate data for this region, we here comprehensively quantify empirical climate-disease relationships. Results show significant relationships of borreliosis, leptospirosis, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), Puumala virus infection, cryptosporidiosis, and Q fever with climate variables related to temperature and freshwater conditions. These data-driven results are consistent with previous reasoning-based propositions of climate-sensitive infections as increasing threats for humans, with notable exceptions for TBE and leptospirosis. For the latter, the data imply decrease with increasing temperature and precipitation experienced in, and projected for, the Northern/Arctic Region. This study provides significant data-based underpinning for simplified empirical assessments of the risks of several infectious diseases under future climate change.",Scientific reports,2021-Oct,"Ma Y, Destouni G, Kalantari Z, Omazic A, Evengård B, Berggren C, Thierfelder T",7,1144,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The study adopted a descriptive research design. The sample consisted of 686 cabin crew members. Data were collected online using a sociodemographic characteristics questionnaire, a scale of attitudes towards infectious diseases, the Health Perception Scale(HPS), and the Health Responsibility subscale(HRS) of the Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors Scale(HLBS). The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, v. 20.0). Number, percentage, mean, standard deviation, t-test, f test, and correlation were used for analysis. Participants had a mean HPS and HRS score of 56.12 ± 8.22 and 24.50 ± 7.05, respectively. The difference between the participants' marital status, position in the workplace, age group, number of children, occupational experience, exposure to communicable diseases, training on prevention from communicable diseases, voluntary vaccination status, and HPS and HRS scores were statistically significant(p < .05). There was a strong correlation between HPS and HRS scores(r = 0.664). Cabin crew members' health perceptions and health responsibilities were affected by numerous factors.

This study aimed to explore the capacity of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) in China to deal with infectious diseases now and in the future. A survey was conducted in 2015 among 973 public health professionals at CDCs in Beijing and four provinces, to assess their capacity to deal with emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Although most professionals were confident with the current capacity of CDCs to cope with outbreaks, nearly all indicated more funding was required to meet future challenges. Responses indicated that Yunnan Province faced more challenges than Anhui, Henan and Liaoning Provinces in being completely prepared and able to deal with outbreaks. Participants aged 20-39 years were more likely than those aged 40 and over to believe strategies such as interdisciplinary and international collaborations for disease surveillance and control, would assist capacity building. The capacity of China's CDCs to deal with infectious diseases was excellent. However, findings suggest it is imperative to increase the number of skilled CDC staff, financial support, and strengthen county level staff training and health education programs.","Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",2021-Apr,"Tong MX, Hansen A, Hanson-Easey S, Xiang J, Cameron S, Liu Q, Liu X, Sun Y, Weinstein P, Han GS, Mahmood A, Bi P",12,1307,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39043386,Archaea in the Human Microbiome and Potential Effects on Human Infectious Disease.,"Archaea represent a separate domain of life, next to bacteria and eukarya. As components of the human microbiome, archaea have been associated with various diseases, including periodontitis, endodontic infections, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and urogenital tract infections. Archaea are generally considered nonpathogenic; the reasons are speculative because of limited knowledge and gene annotation challenges. Nevertheless, archaeal syntrophic principles that shape global microbial networks aid both archaea and potentially pathogenic bacteria. Evaluating archaea interactions remains challenging, requiring clinical studies on inflammatory potential and the effects of archaeal metabolism. Establishing a culture collection is crucial for investigating archaea functions within the human microbiome, which could improve health outcomes in infectious diseases. We summarize potential reasons for archaeal nonpathogenicity, assess the association with infectious diseases in humans, and discuss the necessary experimental steps to enable mechanistic studies involving archaea.",Emerging infectious diseases,2024-Aug,"Duller S, Moissl-Eichinger C",2,1089,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34663839,Modelling infectious diseases with herd immunity in a randomly mixed population.,"The conventional susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model tends to magnify the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, and thus the estimated total infections and immunized population may be higher than the threshold required for infection control and eradication. The study developed a new SIR framework that allows the transmission rate of infectious diseases to decline along with the reduced risk of contact infection to overcome the limitations of the conventional SIR model. Two new SIR models were formulated to mimic the declining transmission rate of infectious diseases at different stages of transmission. Model A utilized the declining transmission rate along with the reduced risk of contact infection following infection, while Model B incorporated the declining transmission rate following recovery. Both new models and the conventional SIR model were then used to simulate an infectious disease with a basic reproduction number (r<sub>0</sub>) of 3.0 and a herd immunity threshold (HIT) of 0.667 with and without vaccination. Outcomes of simulations were assessed at the time when the total immunized population reached the level predicted by the HIT, and at the end of simulations. Further, all three models were used to simulate the transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza in the United States and disease burdens were projected and compared with estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the simulated infectious disease, in the initial phase of the outbreak, all three models performed expectedly when the sizes of infectious and recovered populations were relatively small. As the infectious population increased, the conventional SIR model appeared to overestimate the infections even when the HIT was achieved in all scenarios with and without vaccination. For the same scenario, Model A appeared to attain the level predicted by the HIT and in comparison, Model B projected the infectious disease to be controlled at the level predicted by the HIT only at high vaccination rates. For infectious diseases with high r<sub>0</sub>, and at low vaccination rates, the level at which the infectious disease was controlled cannot be accurately predicted by the current theorem. Transmission dynamics of infectious diseases with herd immunity can be accurately modelled by allowing the transmission rate of infectious diseases to decline along with the reduction of contact infection risk after recovery or vaccination. Model B provides a credible framework for modelling infectious diseases with herd immunity in a randomly mixed population.",Scientific reports,2021-Oct,"Law KB, M Peariasamy K, Mohd Ibrahim H, Abdullah NH",4,2597,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36117592,A simple nomogram for predicting infectious diseases in adult kidney transplantation recipients.,"To investigate the risk factors of infectious diseases in adult kidney transplantation recipients and to establish a simple and novel nomogram to guide the prophylactic antimicrobial therapy. Patients who received kidney transplantation between January 2018 and October 2021 were included in the study and were divided into a training and a testing set at a 1:1 ratio. Risk factors correlated to infectious diseases were selected using a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model. The prediction model was built by incorporating the variables selected by the LASSO model into a logistic regression equation. Calibration curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also applied to assess the model calibration and discrimination. A nomogram consisting of the selected factors was established to provide individualized risks of developing infections. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was adopted to estimate the net benefit and reduction in interventions for a range of clinically reasonable risk thresholds. In all, 863 adult kidney recipients were included in the study, and 407 (47.16%) of them developed infectious diseases during the 3-year follow-up period. A total of 8 variables were selected using LASSO regression and were retained for subsequent model construction and infection prediction. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.83 and 0.81 in the training and testing sets, with high F scores of 0.76 and 0.77, sensitivity of 0.76 and 0.81, and specificity of 0.88 and 0.74, respectively. A novel nomogram was developed based on 8 selected predictors (requirement for albumin infusion, requirement for red blood cell infusion, triglyceride, uric acid, creatinine, globulin, neutrophil percentage, and white blood cells). The net benefit indicated that the nomogram would reduce unnecessary interventions at a wide range of threshold probabilities in both sets. Adult kidney transplantation recipients are high-risk hosts for infectious diseases. The novel nomogram consisting of 8 factors reveals good predictive performance and may promote the reasonable antimicrobial prescription.

Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), a new assay that combines microfluidics technology with TaqMan-based PCR, provides absolute quantification without the need of the standard curves. With the development of ddPCR, it has become an ideal tool for microorganism detection. In this review, we summarized the major literature with regard to the application of ddPCR in detecting the pathogenic microorganisms of infectious diseases, including bacteria, fungi, and virus. The ddPCR method has the advantages of detecting the targeted DNA of infectious microorganisms, with high sensitivity, high precision, and absolute quantification.

Infectious diseases maintained by domestic species may impact threatened species such as Asian bovids, as they share natural resources and habitats. To predict the population impact of infectious diseases with different traits, we used stochastic mathematical models to simulate the population dynamics over 100 years for 100 times in a model gaur (<i>Bos gaurus</i>) population with and without disease. We simulated repeated introductions from a reservoir, such as domestic cattle. We selected six bovine infectious diseases; anthrax, bovine tuberculosis, haemorrhagic septicaemia, lumpy skin disease, foot and mouth disease and brucellosis, all of which have caused outbreaks in wildlife populations. From a starting population of 300, the disease-free population increased by an average of 228% over 100 years. Brucellosis with frequency-dependent transmission showed the highest average population declines (-97%), with population extinction occurring 16% of the time. Foot and mouth disease with frequency-dependent transmission showed the lowest impact, with an average population increase of 200%. Overall, acute infections with very high or low fatality had the lowest impact, whereas chronic infections produced the greatest population decline. These results may help disease management and surveillance strategies support wildlife conservation.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2024-Jul,"Horpiencharoen W, Marshall JC, Muylaert RL, John RS, Hayman DTS",5,1451,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34849837,The quantitative genetics of the prevalence of infectious diseases: hidden genetic variation due to indirect genetic effects dominates heritable variation and response to selection.,"Infectious diseases have profound effects on life, both in nature and agriculture. However, a quantitative genetic theory of the host population for the endemic prevalence of infectious diseases is almost entirely lacking. While several studies have demonstrated the relevance of transmission of infections for heritable variation and response to selection, current quantitative genetics ignores transmission. Thus, we lack concepts of breeding value and heritable variation for endemic prevalence, and poorly understand response of endemic prevalence to selection. Here, we integrate quantitative genetics and epidemiology, and propose a quantitative genetic theory for the basic reproduction number R0 and for the endemic prevalence of an infection. We first identify the genetic factors that determine the prevalence. Subsequently, we investigate the population-level consequences of individual genetic variation, for both R0 and the endemic prevalence. Next, we present expressions for the breeding value and heritable variation, for endemic prevalence and individual binary disease status, and show that these depend strongly on the prevalence. Results show that heritable variation for endemic prevalence is substantially greater than currently believed, and increases strongly when prevalence decreases, while heritability of disease status approaches zero. As a consequence, response of the endemic prevalence to selection for lower disease status accelerates considerably when prevalence decreases, in contrast to classical predictions. Finally, we show that most heritable variation for the endemic prevalence is hidden in indirect genetic effects, suggesting a key role for kin-group selection in the evolutionary history of current populations and for genetic improvement in animals and plants.",Genetics,2022-Jan,"Bijma P, Hulst AD, de Jong MCM",3,1806,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We collected data on refugees arriving to our attention in migrant centers in Sardinia, Italy. Socio-demographical data, anamnesis, and clinical features were collected. TST Mantoux was conducted, and X-ray chest (XRC) was performed if TST was positive. Blood-borne virus screening was proposed to all patients. Screening for STDs was offered according to guidelines, anamnesis, and physical examination. Eighty-one patients were included. Seventy (86.4%) were male, and the mean age was 24.8±5.7 years. Thirty-three (40.7%) had scabies. Overall, 40/81 (49.4%) had a positive TST Mantoux. One (2.5%) was hospitalized and died for multi-drug-resistant TB. One (2.5%) patient had intestinal-TB. 52/81 (64.2%) refused HIV screening, whereas no positivity was found among tested migrants. Sixty-two (76.5%) accepted HCV screening, and one (1.6%) had a positive test. Fifty-eight (71.6%%) accepted HBV testing, and 29 (50%) of them had positive serology.

Namely, whether urbanization will exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases. Based on 31 provincial data from 2002 to 2018 in China, the impact of urbanization on the spread of infectious diseases from the dimensions of ""population"" and ""land"" is analyzed in this paper by using the GMM (generalized method of moments) model. The empirical study shows that the population increase brought by urbanization does not aggravate the spread of infectious diseases. On the contrary, urban education, employment and entrepreneurship, housing, medical and health care, and other basic public services brought by population urbanization can help reduce the risk of the spread of infectious diseases. The increasing density of buildings caused by land urbanization increases the risk of the spread of infectious diseases. Moreover, the impact of urbanization on the spread of infectious diseases has regional heterogeneity.

37268063,One Health: The Role of Pathology as it Pertains to Diagnosis of Zoonoses and Discovery of Emerging Infections.,"Pathologists are an integral part of One Health as they are a critical component of the multidisciplinary team that diagnoses zoonotic diseases and discovers emerging pathogens. Both human and veterinary pathologists are uniquely positioned to identify clusters or trends in patient populations that can be caused by an infectious agent and preface emerging outbreaks. The repository of tissue samples available to pathologists is an invaluable resource that can be used to investigate a variety of pathogens. One Health is an encompassing approach that focuses on optimizing the health of humans, animals (domesticated and sylvatic), and the ecosystem, including plants, water, and vectors. In this integrated and balanced approach, multiple disciplines and sectors from local and global communities work together to promote overall well-being of the 3 components and address threats such as emerging infectious diseases and zoonoses. Zoonoses are defined as infectious diseases that are spread between animals and humans through different mechanisms, including direct contact, food, water, vectors, or fomites. This review highlights examples in which human and veterinary pathologists were an integral part of the multisectoral team that identified uncommon etiologic agents or pathologies that had not been elucidated clinically. As the team discovers an emerging infectious disease, pathologists develop and validate tests for epidemiologic and clinical use and provide surveillance data on these diseases. They define the pathogenesis and pathology that these new diseases cause. This review also presents examples that demonstrate the crucial role pathologists play in diagnosing zoonoses that have an impact on the food supply and the economy.","Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",2023-Aug,"Guarner J, Jean S",2,1751,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been classified as a zoonotic disease, however, no animal reservoir has yet been found, so this classification is premature. We propose that COVID-19 should instead be classified an ""<i>emerging infectious disease (EID) of probable animal origin</i>."" To explore if COVID-19 infection fits our proposed re-categorization vs. the contemporary definitions of zoonoses, we reviewed current evidence of infection origin and transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 virus and described this in the context of known zoonoses, EIDs and ""spill-over"" events. Although the initial one hundred COVID-19 patients were presumably exposed to the virus at a seafood Market in China, and despite the fact that 33 of 585 swab samples collected from surfaces and cages in the market tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, no virus was isolated directly from animals and no animal reservoir was detected. Elsewhere, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in animals including domesticated cats, dogs, and ferrets, as well as captive-managed mink, lions, tigers, deer, and mice confirming zooanthroponosis. Other than circumstantial evidence of zoonotic cases in mink farms in the Netherlands, no cases of natural transmission from wild or domesticated animals have been confirmed. More than 40 million human COVID-19 infections reported appear to be exclusively through human-human transmission. SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 do not meet the WHO definition of zoonoses.

39718814,Impact of psychological fear and media on infectious diseases induced by carriers.,"To manage risks and mitigate the transmission of infectious diseases, individuals often adopt strategies aimed at reducing interpersonal contact by implementing precautionary measures within their daily routines. These behavioral adjustments reduce the disease transmission rates. In this study, we present a novel mathematical model delineating diseases induced by carriers, incorporating multifaceted factors, such as psychological fear, media impact, and sanitation interventions. We analyze the system's dynamics using analytical as well as numerical methods. We find that rapid dissemination of information through social media can lead to oscillations, mitigated by introducing a sufficient baseline number of advertisements. The system undergoes a transition from the disease-free to endemic states via a transcritical bifurcation, occurring when the basic reproduction number surpasses unity. Through a Hopf bifurcation, the system shifts from a stable state to limit cycle oscillations once the growth rate of advertisements is above a critical value. Heightened levels of fear attenuate these oscillations, thereby stabilizing the system at an endemic state. Moreover, the system experiences periodic, higher-periodic, and chaotic oscillations when the growth rate of advertisements varies seasonally. Overall, our findings underscore the significant role of psychological fear, media influence, and sanitation measures in suppressing the prevalence of diseases induced by carriers from the targeted population.","Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2024-Dec,"Pal KK, Rai RK, Tiwari PK",3,1521,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The objectives of this study were to identify independent risk factors for PICU hospitalization with an infectious disease in children <5 years of age. In southern Israel, two populations live side by side: the middle-high income Jewish population and the low-income Bedouin population, both receiving equal and free medical care at the only tertiary medical center in the area. The study population included all children born in southern Israel and hospitalized at PICU with an infectious disease during 1991-2012. Risk factors for PICU hospitalizations were retrospectively studied by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard survival analyses. 9951 Jewish children and 18,002 Bedouin children were enrolled; overall, 1135 episodes of PICU hospitalizations with an infectious disease were recorded (879, 77.4% Bedouin and 256, 22.6% Jewish patients). Bedouin children had a higher risk for PICU hospitalization with an infectious disease compared with Jewish children (adjusted Hazard Ratio [adj.

32912135,Comprehensive host-pathogen protein-protein interaction network analysis.,"Infectious diseases are a cruel assassin with millions of victims around the world each year. Understanding infectious mechanism of viruses is indispensable for their inhibition. One of the best ways of unveiling this mechanism is to investigate the host-pathogen protein-protein interaction network. In this paper we try to disclose many properties of this network. We focus on human as host and integrate experimentally 32,859 interaction between human proteins and virus proteins from several databases. We investigate different properties of human proteins targeted by virus proteins and find that most of them have a considerable high centrality scores in human intra protein-protein interaction network. Investigating human proteins network properties which are targeted by different virus proteins can help us to design multipurpose drugs. As host-pathogen protein-protein interaction network is a bipartite network and centrality measures for this type of networks are scarce, we proposed seven new centrality measures for analyzing bipartite networks. Applying them to different virus strains reveals unrandomness of attack strategies of virus proteins which could help us in drug design hence elevating the quality of life. They could also be used in detecting host essential proteins. Essential proteins are those whose functions are critical for survival of its host. One of the proposed centralities named diversity of predators, outperforms the other existing centralities in terms of detecting essential proteins and could be used as an optimal essential proteins' marker. Different centralities were applied to analyze human protein-protein interaction network and to detect characteristics of human proteins targeted by virus proteins. Moreover, seven new centralities were proposed to analyze host-pathogen protein-protein interaction network and to detect pathogens' favorite host protein victims. Comparing different centralities in detecting essential proteins reveals that diversity of predator (one of the proposed centralities) is the best essential protein marker.",BMC bioinformatics,2020-Sep,"Khorsand B, Savadi A, Naghibzadeh M",3,2089,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39603978,Deceased Donor Infectious Diseases Testing and Antimicrobial Use: Surveys of Organ Procurement Organizations and Transplant Professionals.,"Donor screening and antimicrobial management processes are inconsistent across organ procurement organizations (OPOs) and transplant centers. As part of a Controversies Conference addressing the evaluation and management of infectious diseases (ID) in deceased donors sponsored by the American Society of Transplantation (AST), two online pre-meeting surveys were developed to inform conference proceedings and assess current practices and opinions on donor screening and antimicrobial management. Survey 1 addressed the current state of deceased donor ID testing, culture data communication, antimicrobial utilization, and involvement of transplant ID during donor management and was distributed to all 56 United States OPOs. Survey 2 evaluated transplant professionals' opinions regarding donor antimicrobial use and was sent to the AST Infectious Disease, Kidney Pancreas, Liver and Intestinal, and Thoracic and Critical Care Community of Practice listservs. Descriptive statistics were performed. Thirty-five (63%) unique responses were received from OPOs for Survey 1. Findings included variability in the timing of donor culture collection, frequent sampling of indwelling catheters, wide variation in the location of culture processing, and availability of additional susceptibility testing. Eighty-eight unique responses were received from approximately 1552 (6%) transplant providers for Survey 2. Of the respondents, 37% would not recommend standard antibiotics prior to organ recovery in the absence of suspected or confirmed infection. These surveys demonstrate variability in donor testing, donor antimicrobial utilization, and transplant provider opinions regarding the need for and selection of antimicrobial agents. Findings highlight opportunities for standardized approaches to donor testing and management.",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,2025-,"Pouch SM, Anesi JA, Pruett T, Harmon M, Dionne SO, Hasz R, La Hoz RM, Wolfe C, Ison MG",9,1825,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

39045894,Tackling transmission of infectious diseases: A probiotic-based system as a remedy for the spread of pathogenic and resistant microbes.,"Built environments (BEs) currently represent the areas in which human beings spend most of their life. Consistently, microbes populating BEs mostly derive from human occupants and can be easily transferred from BE to occupants. The hospital microbiome is a paradigmatic example, representing a reservoir for harmful pathogens that can be transmitted to susceptible patients, causing the healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Environmental cleaning is a crucial pillar in controlling BE pathogens and preventing related infections, and chemical disinfectants have been largely used so far towards this aim. However, despite their immediate effect, chemical-based disinfection is unable to prevent recontamination, has a high environmental impact, and can select/increase antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in treated microbes. To overcome these limitations, probiotic-based sanitation (PBS) strategies were recently proposed, built on the use of detergents added with selected probiotics able to displace surrounding pathogens by competitive exclusion. PBS was reported as an effective and low-impact alternative to chemical disinfection, providing stable rebalance of the BE microbiome and significantly reducing pathogens and HAIs compared to disinfectants, without exacerbating AMR and pollution concerns. This minireview summarizes the most significant results obtained by applying PBS in sanitary and non-sanitary settings, which overall suggest that PBS may effectively tackle the infectious risk meanwhile preventing the further spread of pathogenic and resistant microbes.",Microbial biotechnology,2024-Jul,"D'Accolti M, Soffritti I, Bini F, Mazziga E, Caselli E",5,1578,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Recent advancements in three-dimensional tissue cultures, or ""organoids"", have revolutionized the development of in vitro models for infectious diseases. Our study conducts a bibliometric analysis on the use of organoids in modeling infectious diseases, offering an in-depth overview of this field's current landscape. We examined scientific contributions from 2009 onward that focused on organoids in host‒pathogen interactions using the Web of Science Core Collection and OpenAlex database. Our analysis included temporal trends, reference aging, author, and institutional productivity, collaborative networks, citation metrics, keyword cluster dynamics, and disruptiveness of organoid models. VOSviewer, CiteSpace, and Python facilitated this analytical assessment. The findings reveal significant growth and advancements in organoid-based infectious disease research. Analysis of keywords and impactful publications identified three distinct developmental phases in this area that were significantly influenced by outbreaks of Zika and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The research also highlights the synergistic efforts between academia and publishers in tackling global pandemic challenges. Through mostly consolidating research efforts, organoids are proving to be a promising tool in infectious disease research for both human and animal infectious disease. Their integration into the field necessitates methodological refinements for better physiological emulation and the establishment of extensive organoid biobanks.

35168624,Deep learning model for multi-classification of infectious diseases from unstructured electronic medical records.,"Predictively diagnosing infectious diseases helps in providing better treatment and enhances the prevention and control of such diseases. This study uses actual data from a hospital. A multiple infectious disease diagnostic model (MIDDM) is designed for conducting multi-classification of infectious diseases so as to assist in clinical infectious-disease decision-making. Based on actual hospital medical records of infectious diseases from December 2012 to December 2020, a deep learning model for multi-classification research on infectious diseases is constructed. The data includes 20,620 cases covering seven types of infectious diseases, including outpatients and inpatients, of which training data accounted for 80%, i.e., 16,496 cases, and test data accounted for 20%, i.e., 4124 cases. Through the auto-encoder, data normalization and sparse data densification processing are carried out to improve the model training effect. A residual network and attention mechanism are introduced into the MIDDM model to improve the performance of the model. MIDDM achieved improved prediction results in diagnosing seven kinds of infectious diseases. In the case of similar disease diagnosis characteristics and similar interference factors, the prediction accuracy of disease classification with more sample data is significantly higher than the prediction accuracy of disease classification with fewer sample data. For instance, the training data for viral hepatitis, influenza, and hand foot and mouth disease were 2954, 3924, and 3015 respectively and the corresponding test accuracy rates were 99.86%, 98.47%, and 97.31%. There is less training data for syphilis, infectious diarrhea, and measles, i.e., 1208, 575, and 190 respectively and the corresponding test accuracy rates were noticeably lower, i.e., 83.03%, 87.30%, and42.11%. We also compared the MIDDM model with the models used in other studies. Using the same input data, taking viral hepatitis as an example, the accuracy of MIDDM is 99.44%, which is significantly higher than that of XGBoost (96.19%), Decision tree (90.13%), Bayesian method (85.19%), and logistic regression (91.26%). Other diseases were also significantly better predicted by MIDDM than by these three models. The application of the MIDDM model to multi-class diagnosis and prediction of infectious diseases can improve the accuracy of infectious-disease diagnosis. However, these results need to be further confirmed via clinical randomized controlled trials.",BMC medical informatics and decision making,2022-Feb,"Wang M, Wei Z, Jia M, Chen L, Ji H",5,2495,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32499776,From Beef to Bees: High-Throughput Kinome Analysis to Understand Host Responses of Livestock Species to Infectious Diseases and Industry-Associated Stress.,"Within human health research, the remarkable utility of kinase inhibitors as therapeutics has motivated efforts to understand biology at the level of global cellular kinase activity (the kinome). In contrast, the diminished potential for using kinase inhibitors in food animals has dampened efforts to translate this research approach to livestock species. This, in our opinion, was a lost opportunity for livestock researchers given the unique potential of kinome analysis to offer insight into complex biology. To remedy this situation, our lab developed user-friendly, cost-effective approaches for kinome analysis that can be readily incorporated into most research programs but with a specific priority to enable the technology to livestock researchers. These contributions include the development of custom software programs for the creation of species-specific kinome arrays as well as comprehensive deconvolution and analysis of kinome array data. Presented in this review are examples of the application of kinome analysis to highlight the utility of the technology to further our understanding of two key complex biological events of priority to the livestock industry: host immune responses to infectious diseases and animal stress responses. These advances and examples of application aim to provide both mechanisms and motivation for researchers, particularly livestock researchers, to incorporate kinome analysis into their research programs.",Frontiers in immunology,2020-,"Facciuolo A, Denomy C, Lipsit S, Kusalik A, Napper S",5,1456,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Consequently, infection control and prevention have become even more important. The key to determining and designing the most effective anti-infectious medication depends upon the immediate and accurate identification of the causative agent. The standard techniques used for routine infection screening and surveillance tests are shifting toward biosensors. Furthermore, biosensors are projected to be employed for microbiological detection to satisfy the higher accuracy required for clinical diagnosis. This is because of their compact size, real-time monitoring and ability to analyze large sample numbers with less sophistication and manpower requirement, which have allowed them to develop quickly with extensive uses. Biosensors have multiple applications in food safety, environmental surveillance, drug sensing and national security because they offer several advantages such as quick response, outstanding sensitivity, remarkable selectivity, high degree of accuracy and precision, ease of use and affordable price.

38632143,Identification of Early Warning Signals of Infectious Diseases in Hospitals by Integrating Clinical Treatment and Disease Prevention.,"The global incidence of infectious diseases has increased in recent years, posing a significant threat to human health. Hospitals typically serve as frontline institutions for detecting infectious diseases. However, accurately identifying warning signals of infectious diseases in a timely manner, especially emerging infectious diseases, can be challenging. Consequently, there is a pressing need to integrate treatment and disease prevention data to conduct comprehensive analyses aimed at preventing and controlling infectious diseases within hospitals. This paper examines the role of medical data in the early identification of infectious diseases, explores early warning technologies for infectious disease recognition, and assesses monitoring and early warning mechanisms for infectious diseases. We propose that hospitals adopt novel multidimensional early warning technologies to mine and analyze medical data from various systems, in compliance with national strategies to integrate clinical treatment and disease prevention. Furthermore, hospitals should establish institution-specific, clinical-based early warning models for infectious diseases to actively monitor early signals and enhance preparedness for infectious disease prevention and control.",Current medical science,2024-Apr,"Zhang L, Li MY, Zhi C, Zhu M, Ma H",5,1263,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This descriptive study aimed to quantify the disease burden leading to hospital-based care, repatriation or death in Dutch travelers during a stay in a foreign country, including Europe. Retrospective study of demographic and clinical data from three medical assistance centers (MACs) and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Dutch travelers receiving hospital-based care or who died abroad in the years 2010-2014. Diagnoses were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and classified using the Global Burden of Disease tool. Data was available for 77,741 travelers' incidents: 75,385 medical consultations and 2,356 deaths. Four in five travelers received inpatient care, of which 36% concerned older travelers (65+) who had significantly longer hospital stays. Overall the top three diagnoses were: injuries (29%), infectious diseases (17%), and cardiovascular diseases (17%). Mental illness was reported in nearly 1.5% of the travelers. Incidence proportions were highest in South-Eastern Asia, with enteric infections as most common diagnosis. Injuries and communicable diseases occurred most often in South-Eastern Asia, while non-communicable diseases were mostly reported in South America. One in five travelers who consulted a physician was repatriated back home, mostly on a scheduled flight with or without medical escort. Cardiovascular diseases and injuries were the leading causes of death. Not only communicable diseases, but also injuries and chronic diseases (in particular cardiovascular diseases) frequently affected travelers' health while staying abroad and frequently necessitated hospital-based care.

This review discusses the current status in the use and development of innovative strategies for pediatric infectious diseases in LMICs by focusing on surveillance, diagnosis, prevention, and management. Topics covered are: Minimally Invasive Tissue Sampling as a technique to accurately ascertain the cause of death; Genetic Surveillance to trace the pathogen genomic diversity and emergence of resistance; Artificial Intelligence as a multidisciplinary tool; Portable noninvasive imaging methods; and Prognostic Biomarkers to triage and risk stratify pediatric patients. To overcome the specific hurdles in child health for LMICs, some innovative strategies appear at the forefront of research. If the development of these next-generation tools remains focused on accessibility, sustainability and capacity building, reshaping epidemiological surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment in LMICs, can become a reality and result in a significant public health impact.

35860922,"How sex and gender matter in infectious diseases - outcomes of the first Polish conference ""A woman in an infectious diseases circle"".","Occurrence of infectious disease in a woman is an interdisciplinary area of medicine. The common problem of lower recruitment of women to clinical trials leads to the necessity to rely in clinical practice on the exchange of practical experiences, specialist consultations and individualization of treatment. As the COVID-19 pandemic shows, there is a close relationship between infectious diseases and civilization diseases. People suffering from chronic diseases are both more susceptible to infection and the more severe course of an infectious disease. On the other hand, infection may accelerate or initiate the onset of a noncommunicable disease. Women, especially those living with HIV, are a group with an underestimated risk of high blood pressure or some cancers. Therefore, one of the main goals of the conference is to break the stereotypes of thinking about health, in which gender is the main determinant of some screening tests. Late presentation of women to medical care is a significant problem that is of great importance in the diagnosis and treatment of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. Women put family and professional responsibilities in the first place, and they are known to downplay their own health problems. It leads to the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases or cancer at the stage of advanced changes, limiting the possibilities of effective therapy. Understanding gender attributed differences in the etiology and epidemiology of diseases allows for the improvement of patient care, as well as determines the right direction of reforms in the area of healthcare. It is essential to build models of care based on an interdisciplinary and patient-centered approach, with broad support from both stakeholders and NGOs. Each contact of the patient with the health care system should be seen as an opportunity for screening both in the area of civilization diseases, women's health, and infectious diseases corresponding to her lifestyle.",Przeglad epidemiologiczny,2022-,"Kowalska JD, Matłosz B, Przychodzeń S, Pogoda K, Horban A, Rosińska M",6,1981,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Infectious disease dynamics often depend on environmental conditions that drive occurrence, transmission and outbreaks. Remote sensing can contribute to infectious disease research and management by providing standardized environmental data across broad spatial and temporal extents, often at no cost to the user. Here, we (i) conduct a review of primary literature to quantify current uses of remote sensing in disease ecology; and (ii) synthesize qualitative information to identify opportunities for further integration of remote sensing into disease ecology. We identify that modern advances in airborne remote sensing are enabling early detection of forest pathogens and that satellite data are most commonly used to study geographically widespread human diseases. Opportunities remain for increased use of data products that characterize vegetation, surface water and soil; provide data at high spatio-temporal and spectral resolutions; and quantify uncertainty in measurements. Additionally, combining remote sensing with animal telemetry can support decision-making for disease management by providing insights into wildlife disease dynamics. Integrating these opportunities will advance both research and management of infectious diseases.",Proceedings.

37232315,Assessing the quality of data for drivers of disease emergence.,"Drivers are factors that have the potential to directly or indirectly influence the likelihood of infectious diseases emerging or re-emerging. It is likely that an emerging infectious disease (EID) rarely occurs as the result of only one driver; rather, a network of sub-drivers (factors that can influence a driver) are likely to provide conditions that allow a pathogen to (re-)emerge and become established. Data on sub-drivers have therefore been used by modellers to identify hotspots where EIDs may next occur, or to estimate which sub-drivers have the greatest influence on the likelihood of their occurrence. To minimise error and bias when modelling how sub-drivers interact, and thus aid in predicting the likelihood of infectious disease emergence, researchers need good-quality data to describe these sub-drivers. This study assesses the quality of the available data on sub-drivers of West Nile virus against various criteria as a case study. The data were found to be of varying quality with regard to fulfilling the criteria. The characteristic with the lowest score was completeness, i.e. where sufficient data are available to fulfil all the requirements for the model. This is an important characteristic as an incomplete data set could lead to erroneous conclusions being drawn from modelling studies. Thus, the availability of good-quality data is essential to reduce uncertainty when estimating the likelihood of where EID outbreaks may occur and identifying the points on the risk pathway where preventive measures may be taken.",Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics),2023-May,"Horigan V, Kelly L, Papa A, Koopmans MPG, Sikkema RS, Koren LGH, Snary EL",7,1550,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37818307,Study on the regional risk classification method for the prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases based on directed graph theory.,"Emerging infectious diseases are a class of diseases that are spreading rapidly and are highly contagious. It seriously affects social stability and poses a significant threat to human health, requiring urgent measures to deal with them. Its outbreak will very easily lead to the large-scale spread of the virus, causing social problems such as work stoppages and traffic control, thereby causing social panic and psychological unrest, affecting human activities and social stability, and even endangering lives. It is essential to prevent and control the spread of infectious diseases effectively. We aim to propose an effective method to classify the risk level of a new epidemic region by using graph theory and risk classification methods to provide a theoretical reference for the comprehensive evaluation and determination of epidemic prevention and control, as well as risk level classification. Using the graph theory method, we first define the network structure of social groups and construct the risk transmission network of the new epidemic region. Then, combined with the risk classification method, the classification of high, medium, and low risk levels of the new epidemic region is discussed from two cases with common and looped graph nodes, respectively. Finally, the reasonableness of the classification method is verified by simulation data. The directed weighted scale-free network can better describe the transmission law of an epidemic. Moreover, the proposed method of classifying the risk level of a region by using the correlation function between two regions and the risk value of the regional nodes can effectively evaluate the risk level of different regions in the new epidemic region. The experiments show that the number of medium and high risk nodes shows no increasing trend. The number of high-risk regions is relatively small compared to medium-risk regions, and the number of low-risk regions is the largest. It is necessary to distinguish scientifically between the risk level of the epidemic area and the neighboring regions so that the constructed social network model of the epidemic region's spread risk can better describe the spread of the epidemic risk in the social network relations.",Frontiers in public health,2023-,"Liu Y, Wang X, Zhang C",3,2231,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

(a) a PubMed search for 'antimicrobial stewardship' and 'emergency department', and (b) published reviews on effectiveness combined with publications from the first source. (a) An in depth analysis of selected publications provided four key antimicrobial use processes typically performed by front-line healthcare professionals in the ED: making a (tentative) clinical diagnosis, starting empirical therapy based on that diagnosis, performing microbiological tests before starting that therapy and following up patients who are discharged from the ED. (b) Further, we discuss the literature on improvement strategies in the ED focusing on guidelines and clinical pathways and multifaceted improvement strategies. We also summarize the evidence of microbiologic culture review. Based on our review of the literature, we describe four essential elements of antimicrobial use in the ED. Studying the various interventions targeting these care processes, we have found them to be of a variable degree of success.

The findings show that malaria, trachoma, smallpox, tuberculosis, rinderpest, venereal diseases, and diphtheria were among the most common infectious diseases. Poverty, illiteracy, poor public health, lack of medical facilities, and the geographical location were the main factors in the spread of these diseases. Considering the critical nature of the issue, the first Pahlavi government tried to control and prevent diseases by carrying out measures such as public education, establishing health and treatment centers and reforming their structure, sending doctors and distributing medicine, and implementing quarantine and vaccination. The results showed that the efforts of the first Pahlavi government in fighting infectious diseases in Ardabil were relatively successful and reduced the prevalence of some diseases.",Archives of Iranian medicine,2024-Dec,"Aghabeiglooei Z, Rezaei Orimi J, Marghoub Khajeh S, Mojahedi M, Ghaffari F",5,1317,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34924490,From SARS to the Omicron variant of COVID-19: China's policy adjustments and changes to prevent and control infectious diseases.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been the biggest public health crisis in a century. Since it was initially reported in 2019, the duration and intensity of its impacts are still in serious question around the world, and it is about to enter its third year. The first public health revolution failed to achieve its ultimate targets, as previously contained infectious diseases seem to have returned, and new infectious diseases continue to emerge. The prevention and control of infectious diseases is still a public health priority worldwide. After SARS, China adjusted a series of its infectious disease policies. In order to ensure the effectiveness and implementation of prevention and control interventions, the government should integrate the concept of public health. Perhaps we need a global public health system at the government level to fight the potential threat of infectious disease. This system could include multifaceted strategies, not just specific prevention and control interventions, and it could also be a comprehensive system to ensure unimpeded communication and cooperation as well as sustainable development.",Bioscience trends,2022-Jan,"Luo M, Liu Q, Wang J, Gong Z",4,1125,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Therefore, the national ID training is no longer accessible to pediatricians, and a specific program for pediatric ID (PID) is under development. We conducted a survey among French pediatric trainees enrolled in the former ID training to assess their satisfaction and describe the barriers they may have faced during the training. A questionnaire was sent in October 2018 to all pediatricians enrolled in this curriculum. Among the 17 trainees who replied, almost half (8/17) described the ID training as being hardly accessible to pediatricians, and six reported difficulties in finding a mandatory one-year position in an ID department to complete their training.

34600500,Governance structure affects transboundary disease management under alternative objectives.,"The development of public health policy is inextricably linked with governance structure. In our increasingly globalized world, human migration and infectious diseases often span multiple administrative jurisdictions that might have different systems of government and divergent management objectives. However, few studies have considered how the allocation of regulatory authority among jurisdictions can affect disease management outcomes. Here we evaluate the relative merits of decentralized and centralized management by developing and numerically analyzing a two-jurisdiction SIRS model that explicitly incorporates migration. In our model, managers choose between vaccination, isolation, medication, border closure, and a travel ban on infected individuals while aiming to minimize either the number of cases or the number of deaths. We consider a variety of scenarios and show how optimal strategies differ for decentralized and centralized management levels. We demonstrate that policies formed in the best interest of individual jurisdictions may not achieve global objectives, and identify situations where locally applied interventions can lead to an overall increase in the numbers of cases and deaths. Our approach underscores the importance of tailoring disease management plans to existing regulatory structures as part of an evidence-based decision framework. Most importantly, we demonstrate that there needs to be a greater consideration of the degree to which governance structure impacts disease outcomes.",BMC public health,2021-Oct,"Blackwood JC, Malakhov MM, Duan J, Pellett JJ, Phadke IS, Lenhart S, Sims C, Shea K",8,1526,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Patients with a fever of unknown origin (FUO) were evaluated to determine the etiology. In this study, 110 cases with FUO who were admitted to two hospitals with a total of 800 beds, in which 5000 daily outpatient patients were admitted between 2006 and 2016 have been evaluated retrospectively. Anamnesis and the findings were obtained from hospital records. Patients with a temperature higher than 38.3°C and lasting three weeks or longer without diagnosis despite one week of investigation in the hospital were included as FUO cases in this study. Nosocomial and neutropenic cases were excluded from the present study. Fifty-seven patients were male (52%), and the mean age was 40.2 ± 17.2. The distribution of the classic and HIV-associated cases was 85 (77.3%) and 18 (16.4%). Tuberculosis (TB) was the most frequent disease in both groups. The etiology was infectious in 68.2%, autoimmune in 14.5%, and neoplastic in 5.4%. There was no case of collagen vascular disease in the HIV-associated FUO group. As a result of our study, infectious diseases and TB were still the leading factors that caused FUO. TB has been notably found higher in the HIV-associated group than the classic group. FUO is usually either a rare cause or an unusual clinical presentation of a well-known infectious disease in Turkey.

36333699,Application of logistic differential equation models for early warning of infectious diseases in Jilin Province.,"There is still a relatively serious disease burden of infectious diseases and the warning time for different infectious diseases before implementation of interventions is important. The logistic differential equation models can be used for predicting early warning of infectious diseases. The aim of this study is to compare the disease fitting effects of the logistic differential equation (LDE) model and the generalized logistic differential equation (GLDE) model for the first time using data on multiple infectious diseases in Jilin Province and to calculate the early warning signals for different types of infectious diseases using these two models in Jilin Province to solve the disease early warning schedule for Jilin Province throughout the year. Collecting the incidence of 22 infectious diseases in Jilin Province, China. The LDE and GLDE models were used to calculate the recommended warning week (RWW), the epidemic acceleration week (EAW) and warning removed week (WRW) for acute infectious diseases with seasonality, respectively. Five diseases were selected for analysis based on screening principles: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), shigellosis, mumps, Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), and scarlet fever. The GLDE model fitted the above diseases better (0.80 ≤ R<sup>2</sup> ≤ 0.94, P <  0. 005) than the LDE model. The estimated warning durations (per year) of the LDE model for the above diseases were: weeks 12-23 and 40-50; weeks 20-36; weeks 15-24 and 43-52; weeks 26-34; and weeks 16-25 and 41-50. While the durations of early warning (per year) estimated by the GLDE model were: weeks 7-24 and 36-51; weeks 13-37; weeks 11-26 and 39-54; weeks 23-35; and weeks 12-26 and 40-50. Compared to the LDE model, the GLDE model provides a better fit to the actual disease incidence data. The RWW appeared to be earlier when estimated with the GLDE model than the LDE model.

The purpose of this study was to determine how fever of unknown origin (FUO) evolves over time and to determine the prognosis of patients in order to guide clinical diagnosis and treatment decisions. Based on FUO structured diagnosis scheme, prospectively included 320 patients who hospitalized at the Department of Infectious Diseases of the Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University from March 15, 2016 to December 31,2019 with FUO, to analysis the cause of FUO, pathogenetic distribution and prognosis, and to compare the etiological distribution of FUO between different years, genders, ages, and duration of fever. Among the 320 patients, 279 were finally diagnosed through various types of examination or diagnostic methods, and the diagnosis rate was 87.2%. Among all the causes of FUO, 69.3% were infectious diseases, of which Urinary tract infection 12.8% and lung infection 9.7% were the most common. The majority of pathogens are bacteria. Among contagious diseases, brucellosis is the most common. Non-infectious inflammatory diseases were responsible for 6.3% of cases, of which systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE) 1.9% was the most common; 5% were neoplastic diseases; 5.3% were other diseases; and in 12.8% of cases, the cause was unclear. In 2018-2019, the proportion of infectious diseases in FUO was higher than 2016-2017 (P < 0.05). The proportion of infectious diseases was higher in men and older FUO than in women and young and middle-aged (P < 0.05). According to follow-up, the mortality rate of FUO patients during hospitalization was low at 1.9%. Infectious diseases are the principal cause of FUO. There are temporal differences in the etiological distribution of FUO, and the etiology of FUO is closely related to the prognosis.

Community pharmacists are ready and equipped to provide patient care interventions like the test-and-treat model for acute infectious diseases. The objective of this study was to determine patients' experiences with rapid strep and influenza tests administered at community pharmacies, focusing on what impacted patients' decisions to receive care, their perception of the care received, and if offering these tests in community pharmacies expanded their access to care. Seven independently owned pharmacies in Tennessee and Kentucky from November 2020 to April 2021 recruited study participants. Qualitative semi-structured key informant interviews were conducted using the theory of planned behavior as a theoretical framework. Participant interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and independently coded by 2 investigators and reviewed by a third investigator. A qualitative analysis was completed, with a selection of supporting quotations for each theme. Qualitative analysis identified participant perceptions of rapid strep and flu POCT and treatments provided in community pharmacies, consistency and quality of patient care, and if these interventions expanded their access to care. A total of 11 patients participated in the interviews; of which, 9 (81.8%) participants were female, and participants ages ranged from 22 to 64 years (median, 40 years). Of 11, 7 participants received a strep test, 3 participants received a flu test, and 1 participant received both the tests. The analysis uncovered 10 major themes within the following 4 different categories: (1) convenience to patients, (2) quality of care received, (3) improved access to care, and (4) additional interventions for which patients want expanded access to care.

It is now possible to construct realistic models of infectious disease dynamics for the purposes of understanding global-scale epidemics. Nevertheless, a remaining unanswered question is how best to leverage the new data to parameterize models of movement, and whether one's choice of movement model impacts modeled disease outcomes. We adapt three well-studied models of infectious disease dynamics, the susceptible-infected-recovered model, the susceptible-infected-susceptible model, and the Ross-Macdonald model, to incorporate either of two candidate movement models. We describe the effect that the choice of movement model has on each disease model's results, finding that in all cases, there are parameter regimes where choosing one movement model instead of another has a profound impact on epidemiological outcomes. We further demonstrate the importance of choosing an appropriate movement model using the applied case of malaria transmission and importation on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, finding that one model produces intelligible predictions of <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>, whereas the other produces nonsensical results.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2021-May,"Citron DT, Guerra CA, Dolgert AJ, Wu SL, Henry JM, Sánchez C HM, Smith DL",7,1321,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

By dose, hypertension (954 doses) and diabetes (595 doses) were the first and second most frequent indication. Among children, fever and cough were the most common indication; ibuprofen and hederae helicis folium preparations were the most used medicines. Low prevalence was found of medicine use for the treatment of either infectious diseases or mental disorders. Among the Syrian AS&Rs in NRW who participated in the study, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) were common presumed causes of use of medication among adults.

Screening was done for hepatitis A (HAV), B (HBV) and C (HCV), syphilis, HIV, tuberculosis (TB) and intestinal parasites. In 245 IAC tested, 2% had evidence of recent HAV infection, 3% with HBV and one child with HCV, and no cases of HIV were found. One child had antibodies against syphilis (anti-Trpa AB positivity), and 2% were latently infected with tuberculosis. We found 30% infected with pathogenic intestinal parasites. Only 46% had serologic evidence of immunisation against HBV. The prevalence of infections in IAC was lower than previously reported but compared to the general population, a higher prevalence of intestinal parasites, hepatitis and tuberculosis was found. We recommend that IAC are offered screening shortly after arrival.","Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",2020-May,"Nielsen AV, Kjaergaard J, Pedersen TM, Helmuth IG, Nygaard U, Nielsen HW, Christensen VB, Kurtzhals JAL, Poulsen A",9,1284,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The conditions to the existence and uniqueness of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points in the SEWIR model are obtained. By using the Hurwitz criterion, the locally asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points is proved. We show the global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium point by the construction of Lyapunov function and LaSalle invariance principle. The globally asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium is verified by numerical simulation.

31740558,Antimicrobial Therapy in the Context of the Damage-Response Framework: the Prospect of Optimizing Therapy by Reducing Host Damage.,"By design, antimicrobial agents act directly on microbial targets. These drugs aim to eliminate microbes and are remarkably effective against susceptible organisms. Nonetheless, some patients succumb to infectious diseases despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Today, with very few exceptions, physicians select antimicrobial therapy based on its activity against the targeted organism without consideration of how the regimen affects patients' immune responses. An important concept to emerge in the past few decades is that immune responses to microbes can be detrimental by enhancing host damage, which can translate into clinical disease. A central tenet of the damage-response framework (DRF) of microbial pathogenesis is that the relevant outcome of host-microbe interaction is the damage that occurs in the host, which can be due to microbial factors, host factors, or both. Given that host damage can make patients sick, reducing it should be a goal of treating infectious diseases. Inflammation and damage that stem from the host response to an infectious disease can increase during therapy with some antimicrobial agents and decrease during therapy with others. When a patient cannot eliminate a microbe with their own immune response, antimicrobial therapy is essential for microbial elimination, and yet it can affect the inflammatory response. In this essay, we discuss antimicrobial therapy in the context of the DRF and propose that consideration of the DRF may help tailor therapy to a patient's need to augment or reduce inflammation.",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,2020-Jan,"Pirofski LA, Casadevall A",2,1557,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37934734,Impact of voluntary testing on infectious disease epidemiology: A game theoretic approach.,"The World Health Organization recommends test-and-treat interventions to curb and even eliminate epidemics of HIV, viral hepatitis, and sexually transmitted infections (e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and trichomoniasis). Epidemic models show these goals are achievable, provided the participation of individuals in test-and-treat interventions is sufficiently high. We combine epidemic models and game theoretic models to describe individual's decisions to get tested for infectious diseases within certain epidemiological contexts, and, implicitly, their voluntary participation to test-and-treat interventions. We develop three hybrid models, to discuss interventions against HIV, HCV, and sexually transmitted infections, and the potential behavioral response from the target population. Our findings are similar across diseases. Particularly, individuals use three distinct behavioral patterns relative to testing, based on their perceived costs for testing, besides the payoff for discovering their disease status. Firstly, if the cost of testing is too high, then individuals refrain from voluntary testing and get tested only if they are symptomatic. Secondly, if the cost is moderate, some individuals will test voluntarily, starting treatment if needed. Hence, the spread of the disease declines and the disease epidemiology is mitigated. Thirdly, the most beneficial testing behavior takes place as individuals perceive a per-test payoff that surpasses a certain threshold, every time they get tested. Consequently, individuals achieve high voluntary testing rates, which may result in the elimination of the epidemic, albeit on temporary basis. Trials and studies have attained different levels of participation and testing rates. To increase testing rates, they should provide each eligible individual with a payoff, above a given threshold, each time the individual tests voluntarily.",PloS one,2023-,"Pepiot A, Supervie V, Breban R",3,1903,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34543324,Analysis of social interactions and risk factors relevant to the spread of infectious diseases at hospitals and nursing homes.,"Ensuring the safety of healthcare workers is vital to overcome the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We here present an analysis of the social interactions between the healthcare workers at hospitals and nursing homes. Using data from an automated hand hygiene system, we inferred social interactions between healthcare workers to identify transmission paths of infection in hospitals and nursing homes. A majority of social interactions occurred in medication rooms and kitchens emphasising that health-care workers should be especially aware of following the infection prevention guidelines in these places. Using epidemiology simulations of disease at the locations, we found no need to quarantine all healthcare workers at work with a contagious colleague. Only 14.1% and 24.2% of the health-care workers in the hospitals and nursing homes are potentially infected when we disregard hand sanitization and assume the disease is very infectious. Based on our simulations, we observe a 41% and 26% reduction in the number of infected healthcare workers at the hospital and nursing home, when we assume that hand sanitization reduces the spread by 20% from people to people and 99% from people to objects. The analysis and results presented here forms a basis for future research to explore the potential of a fully automated contact tracing systems.",PloS one,2021-,"Hüttel FB, Iversen AM, Bo Hansen M, Kjær Ersbøll B, Ellermann-Eriksen S, Lundtorp Olsen N",6,1343,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35390112,Impact of an infectious diseases pharmacist-led intervention on antimicrobial stewardship program guideline adherence at a Thai medical center.,"To evaluate and compare antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) guideline adherence (primary outcome) as well as length of stay, 30-day all-cause mortality, clinical cure, antimicrobial consumption, and incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens (secondary outcomes) between an infectious diseases (ID) pharmacist-led intervention group and a standard ASP group. A quasi-experimental study was performed at Thammasat University Hospital between August 2019 and April 2020. Data including baseline characteristics and primary and secondary outcomes were collected from the electronic medical record by the ID pharmacist. The ASP guideline adherence in the ID pharmacist-led intervention group was significantly higher than in the standard ASP group (79% vs 56.6%; P < 0.001), especially with regard to appropriate indication (P < 0.001), dosage regimen (P = 0.005), and duration (P = 0.001). The acceptance rate of ID pharmacist recommendations was 81.8% (44/54). The most common key barriers to following recommendations were physician resistance (11/20; 55%) and high severity of disease in the patient (6/20; 30%). Compared to the standard ASP group, there was a trend toward clinical cure in the ID pharmacist-led intervention group (63.6% vs 56.1%; P = 0.127), while 30-day all-cause mortality (15.9% vs 1.5%; P = 0.344) and median length of stay (20 vs 18 days; P = 0.085) were similar in the 2 groups. Carbapenem (P = 0.042) and fosfomycin (P = 0.014) consumption declined in the ID pharmacist-led intervention group. A marginally significant decrease in the overall incidence of MDR pathogens was also observed in the ID pharmacist-led intervention group (coefficient, -5.93; P = 0.049). Our study demonstrates that an ID pharmacist-led intervention can improve ASP guideline adherence and may reduce carbapenem consumption.",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,2022-Jul,"Jantarathaneewat K, Montakantikul P, Weber DJ, Nanthapisal S, Rutjanawech S, Apisarnthanarak A",6,1837,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This secondary analysis study, based on a web-based cross-sectional survey, recruited participants from January 21 to 31, 2019. The participants were asked to recall the most memorable diagnostic error cases in which they were primarily involved. We gathered data on internists' demographics, time to error recognition, and error location. Factors causing diagnostic errors included environmental conditions, information processing, and cognitive bias. Participants scored the significance of each contributing factor on a Likert scale (0, unimportant; 10, extremely important). The Big Three comprised 54.1 % (n=372) of the 687 cases reviewed. The median physician age was 51.5 years (interquartile range, 42-58 years); 65.6 % of physicians worked in hospital settings. Delayed diagnoses were the most common among malignancies (n=64, 46 %). Diagnostic errors related to malignancy were frequent in general outpatient settings on weekdays and in the mornings and were not identified for several months following the event. Environmental factors often contributed to cardiovascular disease-related errors, which were typically identified within days in emergency departments, during night shifts, and on holidays. Information gathering and interpretation significantly impacted infectious disease diagnoses. The Big Three accounted for the majority of cases recalled by Japanese internists. The most relevant contributing factors were different for each of the three categories. Addressing these errors may require a unique approach based on the disease associations.","Diagnosis (Berlin, Germany)",2024-Aug,"Kunitomo K, Gupta A, Harada T, Watari T",4,1761,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38226809,"""Smart markets"": harnessing the potential of new technologies for endemic and emerging infectious disease surveillance in traditional food markets.","Emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases continue to threaten human and animal health, our social fabric, and the global economy. Zoonoses frequently emerge from congregate interfaces where multiple animal species and humans coexist, including farms and markets. Traditional food markets are widespread across the globe and create an interface where domestic and wild animals interact among themselves and with humans, increasing the risk of pathogen spillover. Despite decades of evidence linking markets to disease outbreaks across the world, there remains a striking lack of pathogen surveillance programs that can relay timely, cost-effective, and actionable information to decision-makers to protect human and animal health. However, the strategic incorporation of environmental surveillance systems in markets coupled with novel pathogen detection strategies can create an early warning system capable of alerting us to the risk of outbreaks before they happen. Here, we explore the concept of ""smart"" markets that utilize continuous surveillance systems to monitor the emergence of zoonotic pathogens with spillover potential.IMPORTANCEFast detection and rapid intervention are crucial to mitigate risks of pathogen emergence, spillover and spread-every second counts. However, comprehensive, active, longitudinal surveillance systems at high-risk interfaces that provide real-time data for action remain lacking. This paper proposes ""smart market"" systems harnessing cutting-edge tools and a range of sampling techniques, including wastewater and air collection, multiplex assays, and metagenomic sequencing.

34973415,A hot topic at the environment-health nexus: investigating the impact of climate change on infectious diseases.,"COVID-19 pandemic aside, climate change is the ultimate challenge of our time. However, to date, there has been insufficient political thrust to make that much-needed climate action a reality. Infectious diseases represent only one facet of the threats arising from climate change. Direct impacts from climate change include the more frequent occurrence and increased magnitude of extreme weather events, as well as changing temperatures and precipitation patterns. For climate-sensitive infectious diseases, these changes implicate a shift in geographical and temporal distribution, seasonality, and transmission intensity. Susceptibility to the deleterious effects of climate change is a net result of the interplay of not only environmental factors, but also human, societal, and economic factors, with social inequalities being a major determinant of vulnerability. The global South is already disproportionately affected by the climate crisis. The financial capacity to pursue adaptation options is also limited and unevenly distributed. Climate change-induced mortality and morbidity from both infectious and non-infectious diseases, among other adverse scenarios, are expected to rise globally in the future. The coming decade will be crucial for using all remaining opportunities to develop and implement adequate mitigation and adaptation strategies.",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2022-Mar,"Grobusch LC, Grobusch MP",2,1359,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35699560,The Italian Mandatory Notification System: An Important Public Health Tool For Continuous Monitoring Of Infectious Diseases.,"Infectious diseases still register significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Surveillance through a mandatory notification system allows the continuous analysis of the situation even at a local level and its importance has been highlighted by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aimed to outline the importance of the mandatory notification system as a Public Health tool in the continuous monitoring of infectious diseases. To this aim, we carried out a cross-sectional study examining the notifications reported in the Italian territory of Messina, Sicily, in the period 2001-2020. The institutional websites were examined and the notification data were used to obtain the incidences. Overall, a significant reduction of the incidence notification trend was observed. Chickenpox was by far the most notified infectious disease, followed by scabies, pediculosis, and brucellosis. Outbreaks of brucellosis, measles and hepatitis A occurred. All the diseases decreased over time, except syphilis, for which a significant increase was observed. Surveillance of infectious diseases through a mandatory notification system remains a bulwark of public health despite underreporting. Our study reflects the situation of a typical high-income area, although some unexpected criticisms are highlighted. Continuous information about correct behaviors through education campaigns are crucial in order to improve the situation.

35495886,A Secure High-Order Gene Interaction Detecting Method for Infectious Diseases.,"Infectious diseases pose a serious threat to human life, the Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) can analyze susceptibility genes of infectious diseases from the genetic level and carry out targeted prevention and treatment. The susceptibility genes for infectious diseases often act in combination with multiple susceptibility sites; therefore, high-order epistasis detection has become an important means. However, due to intensive computational burden and diversity of disease models, existing methods have drawbacks on low detection power, high computation cost, and preference for some types of disease models. Furthermore, these methods are exposed to repeated query and model inversion attacks in the process of iterative optimization, which may disclose Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) information associated with individual privacy. Therefore, in order to solve these problems, this paper proposed a safe harmony search algorithm for high-order gene interaction detection, termed as HS-DP. Firstly, the linear weighting method was used to integrate 5 objective functions to screen out high-order SNP sets with high correlation, including K2-Score, JS divergence, logistic regression, mutual information, and Gini. Then, based on the Differential Privacy (DP) theory, the function disturbance mechanism was introduced to protect the security of individual privacy information associated with the objective function, and we proved the rationality of the disturbance mechanism theoretically. Finally, the practicability and superiority of the algorithm were verified by experiments. Experimental results showed that the algorithm proposed in this paper could improve the detection accuracy to the greatest extent while guaranteeing privacy.",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2022-,"Wang H, Yin H, Wu X",3,1754,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This is a 3-year retrospective review of the ID consultations requested by GIM physicians in Japan at a community-based acute tertiary care teaching hospital in Tokyo from April 2018 to March 2021. Demographic data, such as reasons for consultation, causative organism, and final diagnoses, were collected. During the study period, ID consultations were requested by GIM physicians 128 times. The incidence rates of bacteremia and 30-day mortality were 65.6% (n = 84) and 3.1% (n = 4), respectively. The most common diagnostic classifications after ID consultation were bone/joint (24.2%, n = 31), respiratory (17.7%, n = 22), and cardiovascular infections (12.5%, n = 16). The most common final diagnoses were bacteremia (11.7%, n = 15), infective endocarditis (9.4%, n = 12), and vertebral osteomyelitis (7.8%, n = 10). This is the first study to describe the ID consultation cases requested by GIM physicians in Japan in a community-based acute tertiary care teaching hospital. Despite the shortage of ID specialists, GIM physicians covered a wide range of IDs, including bone/joint infections and infectious endocarditis, which require long-term care.

Analysis of the epidemiological situation was based on aggregated data from MZ-56 reports on infectious diseases, infections and poisoning sent from Sanitary Inspections to NIPH NIHNRI. Case-based data for gonorrhoea were analyzed in relation to transmission route and first place of medical diagnosis between 2017-2018. Between 2013-2018 in Poland 8,436 syphilis cases were diagnosed (mean diagnosis rate was 3.66 per 100,000), 2,395 gonorrhoeae cases, whereas number of Chlamydia trachomatis infections from 2014 to 2018 were 1,179 cases. In this time the decrease of 26.2% in newly recognized gonorrhoea cases were observed, whereas the diagnosis rate for chlamydia was stable grew up: from 0.42 per 100,000 in 2014 year to 0.80 in 2018 year. Most STI cases were recognized among men: male to female ratio for syphilis was 5:1, for gonorrhoea 11:1, whereas for chlamydia there is reverse tendency, there are more cases registered among women (0.8:1). There are lower STI diagnosis rates in Poland compare to European countries and there are visible big disproportion between number of cases among men and women.

34261848,Infectious disease activity during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan: Lessons learned from prevention and control measures.,"In Japan, the Law Concerning the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Medical Care for Patients with Infectious Diseases (the ""Infectious Diseases Control Law"") classifies infectious diseases as category I-V infectious diseases, pandemic influenza, and designated infectious diseases based on their infectivity, severity, and impact on public health. COVID-19 was designated as a designated infectious disease as of February 1, 2020 and then classified under pandemic influenza as of February 13, 2021. According to national reports from sentinel surveillance, some infectious diseases transmitted by droplets, contact, or orally declined during the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan. As of week 22 (June 6, 2021), there were 704 cumulative cases of seasonal influenza, 8,144 cumulative cases of chickenpox, 356 cumulative cases of mycoplasma pneumonia, and 45 cumulative cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis; these numbers were significantly lower than those last year, with 563,487 cumulative cases of seasonal influenza, 31,785 cumulative cases of chickenpox, 3,518 cumulative cases of mycoplasma pneumonia, and 250 cumulative cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis. Similarly, many infectious diseases transmitted by droplets or contact declined in other countries and areas during the COVID-19 pandemic. One can reasonably assume that various measures adopted to control the transmission of COVID-19 have played a role in reducing the spread of other infectious diseases, and especially those transmitted by droplets or contact.

Here, we describe a new Pediatric and Ambulatory Research in Infectious diseases network that combined automated data extraction from the computers of primary care pediatricians. Pediatricians who used the same software, AxiSanté 5-Infansoft for electronic medical records were specially trained in infectious diseases, encouraged to comply with French treatments' recommendations, use of point-of-care tests and vaccination guidelines. Infectious disease diagnoses in children <16 years old in the records triggered automatic data extraction of complete records. A quality control process and external validation were developed. From September 2017 to February 2020, 107 pediatricians enrolled 57,806 children (mean age 2.9 ± 2.6 years at diagnosis) with at least one infectious disease diagnosis among those followed by the network. Among the 118,193 diagnoses, the most frequent were acute otitis media (n = 44,924, 38.0%), tonsillopharyngitis (n = 13,334, 11.3%), gastroenteritis (n = 12,367, 10.5%), influenza (n = 11,062, 9.4%), bronchiolitis (n = 10,531, 8.9%), enteroviral infections (n = 8474, 7.2%) and chickenpox (n = 6857, 5.8%). A rapid diagnostic test was performed in 84.7% of cases of tonsillopharyngitis and was positive in 44%. The antibiotic recommendations from French guidelines were strictly followed: amoxicillin was the most prescribed antibiotic and less than 10% of presumed viral infections were treated. This ""tailor-made"" network set up with quality controls and external validation represents a new approach to the surveillance of pediatric infectious diseases in the digital era and could highly optimize pediatric practices.",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,2021-Jul,"Cohen R, Béchet S, Gelbert N, Frandji B, Vie Le Sage F, Thiebault G, Kochert F, Cahn-Sellem F, Werner A, Ouldali N, Levy C",11,1794,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35919978,Anticipating infectious disease re-emergence and elimination: a test of early warning signals using empirically based models.,"Timely forecasts of the emergence, re-emergence and elimination of human infectious diseases allow for proactive, rather than reactive, decisions that save lives. Recent theory suggests that a generic feature of dynamical systems approaching a tipping point-early warning signals (EWS) due to critical slowing down (CSD)-can anticipate disease emergence and elimination. Empirical studies documenting CSD in observed disease dynamics are scarce, but such demonstration of concept is essential to the further development of model-independent outbreak detection systems. Here, we use fitted, mechanistic models of measles transmission in four cities in Niger to detect CSD through statistical EWS. We find that several EWS accurately anticipate measles re-emergence and elimination, suggesting that CSD should be detectable before disease transmission systems cross key tipping points. These findings support the idea that statistical signals based on CSD, coupled with decision-support algorithms and expert judgement, could provide the basis for early warning systems of disease outbreaks.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2022-Aug,"Tredennick AT, O'Dea EB, Ferrari MJ, Park AW, Rohani P, Drake JM",6,1089,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38304377,OPTIMIZATION OF PRE-HOSPITAL FIRST AID MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR PATIENTS WITH INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN HUIZHOU CITY USING DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHM.,"The aim of the study was to optimize the pre-hospital first aid management strategy for patients with infectious diseases in Huizhou city, which is expected to provide a basis for the epidemic prevention and control, to save lives, and increase the pre-hospital first aid efficiency. At the Department of Emergency, Huizhou Third People's Hospital as the research subject, the common pre-hospital first aid procedure for infectious diseases was identified. The Petri net was used to model and determine the execution time of each link of the pre-hospital first aid process. The isomorphic Markov chain was used to optimize the pre-hospital first aid procedure for infectious diseases. In terms of the emergency path, deep learning was combined with the reinforcement learning model to construct the reinforcement learning model for ambulance path planning. Isomorphic Markov chain analysis revealed that the patient status when returning to the hospital, the time needed for the ambulance to come to designated location, and the on-site treatment were the main problems in the first aid process, and the time needed for the pre-hospital first aid process was reduced by 25.17% after optimization. In conclusion, Petri net and isomorphic Markov chain can optimize the pre-hospital first aid management strategies for patients with infectious diseases, and the use of deep learning algorithm can effectively plan the emergency path, achieving intelligent and informationalized pre-hospital transfer, which provides a basis for reducing the suffering, mortality, and disability rate of patients with infectious diseases.",Acta clinica Croatica,2023-Apr,"Zeng J, Chen W, Chen W, Wang Y, Li X",5,1617,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

(2018). However, larger studies on the complexity of patients related to the involvement of ID consultation services are missing. Data of patients being treated in 2015 and 2019 in four different German university hospitals was retrospectively collected. Data were collected from the hospitals' software system and included whether the patients received an ID consultation as well as patient clinical complexity level (PCCL), case mix index (CMI) and length of stay (LOS) as a measurement for the patients' complexity. Furthermore, a comparison of patients with distinct infectious diseases treated with or without an ID consultation was initiated. In total, 215.915 patients were included in the study, 3% (n = 6311) of those were seen by an ID consultant. Patients receiving ID consultations had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher PCCL (median 4 vs. 0), CMI (median 3,8 vs. 1,1) and deviation of the expected mean LOS (median 7 days vs. 0 days) than patients in the control group. No differences among hospitals or between years were observed. Comparing patients with distinct infectious diseases treated with or without an ID consultation, the differences were confirmed throughout the groups. Patients receiving ID consultations are highly complex, frequently need further treatment after discharge and have a high economic impact. Thus, ID specialists should be clinically trained in a broad spectrum of diseases and treating these complex patients should be sufficiently remunerated.",Infection,2024-Apr,"Meyer-Schwickerath C, Weber C, Hornuss D, Rieg S, Hitzenbichler F, Hagel S, Ankert J, Hennigs A, Glossmann J, Jung N",10,1640,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The major purpose of this article is to theoretically demonstrate that the Chinese government's intervention in large-scale infectious diseases is successful and efficient. Two potential strategies were considered: strategy 1 was infectious disease without government intervention, and strategy 2 was infectious disease with government intervention. By evolution model, this article illustrates the efficiency of big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China. Without government reimbursement, this article finds that high expenditures accelerate the disease infection. The number of infected persons decreases under big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China. The higher the treatment costs, the more important the government intervention. Big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China can serve as an efficient example to cope with big infectious diseases.","Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",2020-,"Nie KX, Wang C, Li XW",3,986,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33444390,Source identification of infectious diseases in networks via label ranking.,"Outbreaks of infectious diseases would cause great losses to the human society. Source identification in networks has drawn considerable interest in order to understand and control the infectious disease propagation processes. Unsatisfactory accuracy and high time complexity are major obstacles to practical applications under various real-world situations for existing source identification algorithms. This study attempts to measure the possibility for nodes to become the infection source through label ranking. A unified Label Ranking framework for source identification with complete observation and snapshot is proposed. Firstly, a basic label ranking algorithm with complete observation of the network considering both infected and uninfected nodes is designed. Our inferred infection source node with the highest label ranking tends to have more infected nodes surrounding it, which makes it likely to be in the center of infection subgraph and far from the uninfected frontier. A two-stage algorithm for source identification via semi-supervised learning and label ranking is further proposed to address the source identification issue with snapshot. Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world network datasets. It turns out that the proposed label ranking algorithms are capable of identifying the propagation source under different situations fairly accurately with acceptable computational complexity without knowing the underlying model of infection propagation. The effectiveness and efficiency of the label ranking algorithms proposed in this study make them be of practical value for infection source identification.",PloS one,2021-,"Zhou J, Jiang Y, Huang B",3,1659,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

34183192,Emergency Response: A Cross-sectional Study of Core Competencies for Nurses Regarding Major Infectious Disease Outbreaks.,"The core competencies of nursing personnel have been identified as a main factor affecting nursing effectiveness. This study examined core emergency response competencies of Chinese nursing personnel related to the outbreak of major infectious diseases. A survey was conducted among 960 nurses working in a tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China. Data were collected on core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel caring for patients with major infectious diseases, measuring overall competency as well as by dimensions of prevention ability, rescue ability, and preparation ability. A t-test and one-way analysis of variance were first analyzed for differences between groups, followed by multiple linear regression to analyze main influencing factors for core emergency response competencies. The average score for core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel delivering care to patients with major infectious diseases was 128.05 (SD 22.23) (range 36-180 points); or 71%, which is equivalent to moderate performance. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that the main influencing factors for these nursing personnel were before participation in emergency drills for infectious diseases, current educational background, and working experience in the realm of infectious disease nursing. The final model explained 8.4% of the variance in core emergency response competencies. These findings indicate that it is necessary to strengthen the training of nursing staff with educational background deficits or no prior work or drill experience related to infectious diseases to effectively improve the core emergency response competencies of nursing personnel relative to infectious diseases.",Journal of emergency nursing,2021-Nov,"Song S, Li X, Bell SA, Yang X, Zhang W",5,1724,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Given the importance of model-based analysis in managing public health crises, there has been an increase in post-pandemic creation of both academia-driven modelling centres, hubs and consortiums and government-driven public health agencies with in-house modelling units or teams. However, in the past, the delineation of roles and responsibilities between government- and academia-led modelling groups has often been unclear. Who should perform which tasks and when? This ambiguity can increase the risk of duplicated work or unaddressed gaps in analysis. It also raises questions about the sustainability of modelling capacity for addressing routine operational analytical needs while also developing new approaches that can be tailored for emergencies. In the sections below, we discuss factors that could inform decisions about where to locate infectious disease modelling activity. Rather than giving a fixed set of rules, we outlined key considerations and trade-offs that could be taken into account to enable academic and government modelling activities to complement each other effectively, which can in turn be refined as new public health crises emerge in future.",Epidemics,2024-Dec,"Pung R, Kucharski AJ",2,1333,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33734349,Why genetic selection to reduce the prevalence of infectious diseases is way more promising than currently believed.,"Genetic selection for improved disease resistance is an important part of strategies to combat infectious diseases in agriculture. Quantitative genetic analyses of binary disease status, however, indicate low heritability for most diseases, which restricts the rate of genetic reduction in disease prevalence. Moreover, the common liability threshold model suggests that eradication of an infectious disease via genetic selection is impossible because the observed-scale heritability goes to zero when the prevalence approaches zero. From infectious disease epidemiology, however, we know that eradication of infectious diseases is possible, both in theory and practice, because of positive feedback mechanisms leading to the phenomenon known as herd immunity. The common quantitative genetic models, however, ignore these feedback mechanisms. Here, we integrate quantitative genetic analysis of binary disease status with epidemiological models of transmission, aiming to identify the potential response to selection for reducing the prevalence of endemic infectious diseases. The results show that typical heritability values of binary disease status correspond to a very substantial genetic variation in disease susceptibility among individuals. Moreover, our results show that eradication of infectious diseases by genetic selection is possible in principle. These findings strongly disagree with predictions based on common quantitative genetic models, which ignore the positive feedback effects that occur when reducing the transmission of infectious diseases. Those feedback effects are a specific kind of Indirect Genetic Effects; they contribute substantially to the response to selection and the development of herd immunity (i.e., an effective reproduction ratio less than one).",Genetics,2021-Apr,"Hulst AD, de Jong MCM, Bijma P",3,1789,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Subways-an important aspect of daily travel in big cities-are high-risk sites for the transmission of urban epidemics. Intensive research examining the transmission mechanisms of infectious diseases in subways is necessary to ascertain the risk of disease transmission encountered by commuters. In this study, we improve the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model and propose the susceptible-exposed-infected-asymptomatic infected (SEIA) model. First, we added asymptomatic patients to the improved model as a parameter to explore the role of asymptomatic patients in the transmission of infectious diseases in a subway. The numbers of boarding and alighting passengers were added to the model as two time-varying parameters to simulate the exchange of passengers at each station. The improved model could simulate the transmission of infectious diseases in subways and identify the key factors of transmission. We then produced an example of the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in a subway using real subway passenger data substituted into the model for the calculations. We ascertained that the number of exposed people continuously increased with the operation of the subway. Asymptomatic patients had a greater impact on the transmission of infectious diseases than infected people in the course of transmission. The SEIA model constructed in this study accurately determined the spread of infectious diseases in a subway and may also be applicable to studies on the transmission of infectious diseases in other urban public transport systems.",Frontiers in public health,2024-,"Zhou F, Hou F, Wang J, Ma Q, Luo L",5,1695,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

It is shown that the reproduction number is the threshold value for eradicating disease in the sense that the disease-free steady state is globally stable if [Formula: see text] and there exists a unique endemic equilibrium if [Formula: see text]. The effective reproduction number is used as an objective to minimize the disease spread risk. Using the epidemic data from the early spread of Wuhan, China and demographic data of Wuhan, we figure out the strategies to distribute the vaccine to the age groups to achieve the optimal vaccination effects.

Over the last decade, successes in the scale up of HIV care and treatment programs has led to a burgeoning number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in care. At the same time, an epidemiologic shift has been witnessed with a concomitant rise in non-communicable diseases (NCD) related morbidity and mortality. Against low levels of domestic financing and strained healthcare delivery platforms, the NCD-HIV syndemic threatens to reverse gains made in care of people living with HIV (PLHIV). NCDs are the global health disruptor of the future. In this review, we draw three proposals for low and middle-income countries (LMICs) based on existing literature, that if contextually adopted would mitigate against impending poor NCD-HIV care outcomes. First, we call for an adoption of universal health coverage by countries in SSA. Secondly, we recommend leveraging on comparably formidable HIV healthcare delivery platforms through integration. Lastly, we advocate for institutional-response building through a multi-stakeholder governance and coordination mechanism.

39839432,Analysis report on trends in public infectious disease control in China.,"The prevention and control of public infectious diseases is a significant issue in the global health sector. Controlling infectious diseases is crucial for maintaining public health. As the most populous country in the world, China still faces a series of new challenges in the control of public infectious diseases. Therefore, it is of great significance to conduct an in-depth analysis of the trends in the control of public infectious diseases. This study selects the death rate, incidence rate, proportion of prevention and control funds input, and the proportion of professional technical personnel in China from 2018 to 2023 as research samples and conducts statistical analysis through multiple linear regression. Overall, factors such as the incidence rate, proportion of prevention and control funds input, and proportion of professional technical personnel can explain 98.7% of the trend changes in the infectious disease death rate. Through multiple regression analysis, the regression coefficient value of 0.001 for the incidence rate indicates a significant positive impact on the mortality rate, meaning that an increase in the incidence of infectious diseases leads to a rise in mortality. The regression coefficient value of -0.012 for the proportion of funding input suggests a significant negative impact on the mortality rate, implying that increased investment in prevention and control funds will correspondingly reduce the mortality rate of infectious diseases. On the other hand, merely increasing the number of professional and technical personnel is not sufficient to control the spread of infectious diseases; comprehensive use of various prevention and control measures is required for effective public infectious disease control. Public infectious disease prevention and control is a complex process that requires the consideration of multiple factors, rather than merely changing a single factor, particularly in controlling incidence rates and reasonably allocating funds. By refining the analysis of infectious disease control strategies and integrating diverse preventive and intervention measures, it is possible to better control the spread and mortality of infectious diseases, thereby protecting public health and safety.",Frontiers in public health,2024-,Zhang Z,1,2257,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39139663,The impact of population influx on infectious diseases - from the mediating effect of polluted air transmission.,"The global population influx during the COVID-19 pandemic poses significant challenges to public health, making the prevention and control of infectious diseases a pressing concern. This paper aims to examine the impact of population influx on the spread of infectious diseases, with a specific emphasis on the mediating role of air pollution in this process. A theoretical analysis is conducted to explore the relationship between population influx, air pollution, and infectious diseases. Additionally, we establish a series of econometric models and employ various empirical tests and analytical techniques, including mediation effect test, threshold effect test, and systematic GMM test, to evaluate our hypotheses. The results indicate that: (1) Population influx directly and indirectly impacts infectious diseases. Specifically, population influx not only directly elevates the risk of infectious diseases, but also indirectly increases the incidence rate of infectious diseases by intensifying air pollution. (2) The impact of population inflow on infectious diseases exhibits regional heterogeneity. Compared to central and western China, the eastern regions exhibit a significantly higher risk of infectious diseases, exceeding the national average. (3) External factors influence the relationship between population influx and infectious diseases differently. Personal income and medical resources both help mitigate the risk of infectious diseases due to population influx, with medical resources having a more substantial effect. Contrary to expectations, abundant educational resources have not reduced the risk, instead, they have exacerbated the risk associated with population influx.

33653146,Mapping time use in clinical trials for vaccines against emerging infectious diseases.,"Vaccines are potent tools to prevent outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases from becoming epidemics and need to be developed at an accelerated pace to have any impact on the course of an ongoing epidemic. The aim of this study was to describe time use in the execution of vaccine trials, to identify steps that could be accelerated to improve preparedness and planning for future emerging infectious diseases vaccine trials. We used a mixed-methods approach to map time use and process steps that could be accelerated during vaccine trials. Trials for vaccines against infectious diseases registered in three global trial databases reported in the period 2011-2017 were eligible to join the survey. We invited sponsors to contribute data through a predefined structured questionnaire for clinical trial process metrics. Data were stratified by trial phase, disease type (i.e. emerging infectious diseases or not emerging infectious diseases), sponsor type, and continent. Qualitative interviews were conducted with purposively selected sponsors, and thematic analysis of the interview transcripts was performed. Based on data from 155 vaccine trials including 29,071 subjects, 52% were phase I, 23% phase II, and 25% phase III. We found that the regulatory approval, subject enrollment, study execution, and study close-out accounted for most of the cycle time of the vaccine trial process. Cycle times for the regulatory and ethical approvals, contract agreement, site initiation, and study execution were shorter in trials conducted during outbreaks. Qualitative interviews indicated that early engagement of the regulatory and independent ethical committee authorities in planning the vaccine trials was critical for saving time in trial approval. Furthermore, adapting the trial implementation to the reality of the study sites and active involvement of the local investigators during the planning of the trial and protocol writing were stated to be of paramount importance to successful completion of trials at an accelerated pace. The regulatory approval, subject recruitment, study execution, and close-out cycle times accounted for most of the vaccine trial time use and are activities that could be accelerated during a vaccine trial planning and implementation. We encourage tracking of key cycle time metrics and facilitating sharing of knowledge across industry and academia, as this may serve to reduce the time from index case detection to access of a vaccine during emerging infectious diseases epidemics.","Clinical trials (London, England)",2021-Jun,"Mandi H, Yimer SA, Norheim G",3,2523,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36348272,Can breeders prevent pathogen adaptation when selecting for increased resistance to infectious diseases?,"Recent research shows that genetic selection has high potential to reduce the prevalence of infectious diseases in livestock. However, like all interventions that target infectious diseases, genetic selection of livestock can exert selection pressure on pathogen populations. Such selection on the pathogen may lead to escape strategies and reduce the effect of selection of livestock for disease resistance. Thus, to successfully breed livestock for lower disease prevalence, it is essential to develop strategies that prevent the invasion of pathogen mutants that escape host resistance. Here we investigate the conditions under which such ""escape mutants"" can replace wild-type pathogens in a closed livestock population using a mathematical model of disease transmission. Assuming a single gene that confers sufficient resistance, results show that genetic selection for resistance in livestock typically leads to an ""invasion window"" within which an escape mutant of the pathogen can invade. The bounds of the invasion window are determined by the frequency of resistant hosts in the population. The lower bound occurs when the escape mutant has an advantage over the wild-type pathogen in the population. The upper bound occurs when local eradication of the pathogen is expected. The invasion window is smallest when host resistance is strong and when infection with the wild-type pathogen provides cross immunity to infection with the escape mutant. To minimise opportunities for pathogens to adapt, under the assumptions of our model, the aim of disease control through genetic selection should be to achieve herd-level eradication of the infection faster than the rate of emergence of escape mutants of the pathogen. Especially for microparasitic infections, this could be achieved by placing animals into herds according to their genetic resistance, such that these herds stay completely out of the invasion window. In contrast to classical breeding theory, our model suggests that multi-trait selection with gradual improvement of each trait of the breeding goal might not be the best strategy when resistance to infectious disease is part of the breeding goal. Temporally, combining genetic selection with other interventions helps to make the invasion window smaller, and thereby reduces the risk of invasion of escape mutants.","Genetics, selection, evolution : GSE",2022-Nov,"Hulst AD, Bijma P, De Jong MCM",3,2340,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39176987,"Focus, vigilance, resilience: towards stronger infectious disease surveillance, threat detection and response in the EU/EEA.","This perspective summarises and explains the long-term surveillance framework 2021-2027 for infectious diseases in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) published in April 2023. It shows how shortcomings in the areas of public health focus, vigilance and resilience will be addressed through specific strategies in the coming years and how these strategies will lead to stronger surveillance systems for early detection and monitoring of public health threats as well as informing their effective prevention and control. A sharper public health focus is expected from a more targeted list of notifiable diseases, strictly public-health-objective-driven surveillance standards, and consequently, leaner surveillance systems. Vigilance should improve through mandatory event reporting, more automated epidemic intelligence processing and increased use of genomic surveillance. Finally, EU/EEA surveillance systems should become more resilient by modernising the underlying information technology infrastructure, expanding the influenza sentinel surveillance system to other respiratory viruses for better pandemic preparedness, and increasingly exploiting potentially more robust alternative data sources, such as electronic health records and wastewater surveillance. Continued close collaboration across EU/EEA countries will be key to ensuring the full implementation of this surveillance framework and more effective disease prevention and control.",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,2024-Aug,"Zucs P, Beauté J, Palm D, Spiteri G",4,1463,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This paper proposes a complex network epidemic model with nonlinear incidence rate and quadratic transmission. The Turing pattern, sensitivity analysis and parameter identification of the epidemic model under different network structures are studied; METHODS:: this paper discusses the Turing pattern of the model under different network structures, and identifies the key parameters of the model through sensitivity analysis. The influence of network dimension on the spread of infectious diseases on random networks is also explored, and the problems of minimum path and minimum cover set of random networks are further discussed. We also carry out parameter identification experiments, adopt gradient descent algorithm to realize heterogeneous spatial fitting pattern of red blood cell plasma and simulate the transmission path of COVID-19 through Markov chain Monte Carlo fitting experiment, verifying the effectiveness of the model; RESULTS:: the necessary conditions for Turing instability on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks are found. On the heterogeneous lattice network, we observe the special patterns of equal density population. Sensitivity analysis shows that the higher the infection rate, the more infected people. On random networks, the higher the dimension, the better the effect of suppressing the spread of infectious diseases. Through comparison experiment, it is found that gradient descent algorithm has the best performance in parameter identification experiments. Red blood cell plasma fitting experiment reveals the spatial density distribution of infection rate; CONCLUSIONS:: this study provides theoretical support for the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and the complex network model can simulate the transmission process of infectious diseases more accurately. Sensitivity analysis and parameter identification experiments reveal the key influencing factors of propagation and the role of network structure. The effectiveness of the model is supported by actual data, which is helpful for the government health departments to formulate scientific prevention and control strategies.",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,2025-Jan,"Zhu L, Chen S, Shen S",3,2260,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We first describe the long-term aging-profile of the population by describing the pattern and stability of equilibrium of the demographic model. We also investigate the disease transmission dynamics, using the epidemic model when the population reaches the positive equilibrium (limiting equation). We establish conditions for the existence, uniqueness and global stability of the disease endemic equilibrium. We then prove the global stability of the endemic equilibrium for the original epidemic model with varying population demographics. The global stability of the endemic equilibrium allows us to examine the effects of reproduction ageing and rate, under different family planning strategies, on the childhood infectious disease transmission dynamics. We also examine demographic distribution, diseases reproductive number, infant disease rate and age distribution of disease, and as such, the work can be potentially used to inform targeted age group for optimal vaccine booster programs.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2020-Nov,"Su Q, Wu J",2,1278,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We prospectively assessed the effectiveness of mNGS in 70 febrile inpatients with suspected infections at Hematology department of the Children's Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health. 69/70 patients were given empirical antibiotics prior to mNGS. A total of 104 samples (62 plasma, 34 throat swabs, 4 bone marrow, 4 bronchoalveolar lavage) were collected on day 1-28 (mean 6.9) following symptom onset and underwent mNGS testing. Traditional microbiological tests discovered causal microorganisms in 5/70 (7.14%) patients, which were also detected by mNGS. In addition, mNGS reported possible pathogens when routine tests were negative. Antibiotics were adjusted accordingly in 55/70 (78.6%) patients that led to improvement/relief of symptoms within 3 days. In contrast, mNGS results were considered irrelevant in 15/70 (21.4%) patients by a board of clinicians, based on biochemical, serological, imaging evidence, and experiences. mNGS expanded the capacity of pathogen detection and made a positive impact on clinical management of suspected infections through (a) differential diagnosis which may rule out infectious diseases and (b) adjustment or de-escalation of empirical antibiotics.",International journal of laboratory hematology,2021-Apr,"Shen H, Shen D, Song H, Wu X, Xu C, Su G, Liu C, Zhang J",8,1503,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

As a first step to determine whether investing in such a system offers value for money, this study used contingent valuation to estimate people's willingness to pay for such an early warning system in six European countries. The contingent valuation experiment was conducted through online questionnaires administered in February to March 2018 to cross-sectional, representative samples in the UK, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and The Netherlands, yielding a total sample size of 3140. Mean willingness to pay for an early warning system was €21.80 (median €10.00) per household per month. Pooled regression results indicate that willingness to pay increased with household income and risk aversion, while they decreased with age. Overall, our results indicate that approximately 80-90% of people would be willing to pay for an increase in health safety in the form of an early warning system for infectious diseases and food-borne outbreaks.

To assess how common assumptions relate to real-world interactions, we analysed 11 networks from five settings and developed metrics, capturing crucial epidemiological features of these networks. We developed a novel metric, the 'retention index', to characterize the distribution of retained contacts over consecutive time steps relative to fully static and dynamic networks. In workplaces and schools, contacts in the same department formed most of the retained contacts. In contrast, no clear contact type dominated the retained contacts in hospitals, thus reducing overall risk of disease introduction would be more effective than control targeted at departments. We estimated the contacts repetition over multiple days and showed that simple resource planning models overestimate the number of unique contacts by 20%-70%. We distinguished the difference between 'superspreader' and infectious individuals driving 'superspreading events' by measuring how often the individual represents the top 80% of contacts in the time steps over the study duration. We showed an inherent difficulty in identifying 'superspreaders' reliably: less than 20% of the individuals in most settings were highly connected for multiple time steps.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2024-Dec,"Pung R, Firth JA, Russell TW, Rogers T, Lee VJ, Kucharski AJ",6,1421,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Patients with results that met predefined categories were included for review by a panel of 3 infectious diseases physicians and one clinical microbiologist. Predefined categories included reports with fungal, parasitic, notable bacterial, notable viral pathogens, or polybacterial results (≥3 bacteria). Polybacterial results were further classified into patterns of microbiome detected. Clinical impact and its correlation with result or patient characteristics were explored. Ninety-two patients met the inclusion criteria, most were immunocompromised (73%). Positive KT results that met predefined categories had the following clinical impact: positive in 30.4%, negative in 2.2%, and none in 65.2%. Polybacterial results, especially interpreted as oral flora had lowest clinical impact (7.1% and 0.0%, respectively), while detection of parasites or notable bacterial pathogens had the highest clinical impact (100% and 77.8%, respectively). There was no correlation between patient characteristics and clinical impact. Among a cohort of largely immunocompromised patients, we were able to demonstrate clinical impact of specific KT result types and patterns but did not find correlation between patient characteristics and clinical impact.

38857274,Infection patterns in simple and complex contagion processes on networks.,"Contagion processes, representing the spread of infectious diseases, information, or social behaviors, are often schematized as taking place on networks, which encode for instance the interactions between individuals. The impact of the network structure on spreading process has been widely investigated, but not the reverse question: do different processes unfolding on a given network lead to different infection patterns? How do the infection patterns depend on a model's parameters or on the nature of the contagion processes? Here we address this issue by investigating the infection patterns for a variety of models. In simple contagion processes, where contagion events involve one connection at a time, we find that the infection patterns are extremely robust across models and parameters. In complex contagion models instead, in which multiple interactions are needed for a contagion event, non-trivial dependencies on models parameters emerge, as the infection pattern depends on the interplay between pairwise and group contagions. In models involving threshold mechanisms moreover, slight parameter changes can significantly impact the spreading paths. Our results show that it is possible to study crucial features of a spread from schematized models, and inform us on the variations between spreading patterns in processes of different nature.",PLoS computational biology,2024-Jun,"Contreras DA, Cencetti G, Barrat A",3,1357,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We hypothesised that key properties of these patterns can be inferred from multiple infection data in longitudinal follow-ups. We developed a simulator for epidemics with multiple infections on networks and analysed the resulting individual infection time series by introducing similarity metrics between hosts based on their multiple infection histories. We find that, depending on infection multiplicity and network sampling, multiple infection summary statistics can recover network properties such as degree distribution. Furthermore, we show that by mining simulation outputs for multiple infection patterns, one can detect immunological interference between pathogens (i.e. the fact that past infections in a host condition future probability of infection). The combination of individual-based simulations and analysis of multiple infection histories opens promising perspectives to infer and validate transmission networks and immunological interference for infectious diseases from longitudinal cohort data.",PLoS computational biology,2021-Sep,"Selinger C, Alizon S",2,1154,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

A critical parameter of any such model is the transmission rate. Temporal variation in the transmission rate has a profound influence on disease spread. For this reason, estimation of time-varying transmission rates is an important step in identifying mechanisms that underlie patterns in observed disease incidence and mortality. Here, we present and test fast methods for reconstructing transmission rates from time series of reported incidence. Using simulated data, we quantify the sensitivity of these methods to parameters of the data-generating process and to mis-specification of input parameters by the user. We show that sensitivity to the user's estimate of the initial number of susceptible individuals-considered to be a major limitation of similar methods-can be eliminated by an efficient, ""peak-to-peak"" iterative technique, which we propose. The method of transmission rate estimation that we advocate is extremely fast, for even the longest infectious disease time series that exist.

Although illicit use of other opioids has been associated with transmission of viral and bacterial infections, limited data exist for the prevalence of infectious diseases among illicit fentanyl users. The purpose of this study was to assess the likelihood of infectious disease testing and infection prevalence among illicit fentanyl users. Results from urine drug screens (UDSs) performed from August 13, 2019, to October 16, 2019, were obtained from the laboratory information system with concurrent microbial testing. Patients were categorized based on UDS results, and illicit drug use was inferred from physician encounter notes in the electronic medical record. Suspected illicit drugs users with fentanyl detected by UDS were more likely to be screened [odds ratio (OR): 1.7; 95% CI, 1.26-2.4] and test positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) by immunoassay (OR: 5.89; 95% CI, 2.93-11.31) than patients without drugs detected. Patients with suspected illicit fentanyl use who were discharged from the emergency department (ED) were less likely to be tested for HCV than patients in outpatient settings (OR: 3.47; 95% CI, 1.05-10.4) and inpatient settings (OR: 17.43; 95% CI, 6.53-45.88).

33963679,'Accidents waiting to happen'-Insights from a simple model on the emergence of infectious agents in new hosts.,"This study evaluates through modelling the possible individual and combined effect of three populational parameters of pathogens (reproduction rate; rate of novelty emergence; and propagule size) on the colonization of new host species-putatively the most fundamental process leading to the emergence of new infectious diseases. The results are analysed under the theoretical framework of the Stockholm Paradigm using IBM simulations to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of the pathogen population and the possible role of Ecological Fitting. The simulations suggest that all three parameters positively influence the success of colonization of new hosts by a novel parasite population, but contrary to the prevailing belief, the rate of novelty emergence (e.g. mutations) is the least important factor. Maximization of all parameters results in a synergetic facilitation of the colonization and emulates the expected scenario for pathogenic microorganisms. The simulations also provide theoretical support for the retention of the capacity of fast-evolving lineages to retro-colonize their previous host species/lineage by ecological fitting. Capacity is, thus, much larger than we can anticipate. Hence, the results support the empirical observations that opportunity of encounter (i.e. the breakdown in mechanisms for ecological isolation) is a fundamental determinant to the emergence of new associations-especially Emergent Infectious Diseases-and the dynamics of host exploration, as observed in SARS-CoV-2. Insights on the dynamics of Emergent Infectious Diseases derived from the simulations and from the Stockholm Paradigm are discussed.",Transboundary and emerging diseases,2022-Jul,"Feronato SG, Araujo S, Boeger WA",3,1656,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39501756,Model-informed optimal allocation of limited resources to mitigate infectious disease outbreaks in societies at war.,"Infectious diseases thrive in war-torn societies. The recent sharp increase in human conflict and war thus requires the development of disease mitigation tools that account for the specifics of war, such as the scarcity of important public health resources. We developed a compartmental, differential equation-based disease model that considers key social, war and disease mechanisms, such as gender homophily and the replacement of soldiers. This model enables the identification of optimal allocation strategies that, given limited resources required for treating infected individuals, minimize disease burden, assessed by total mortality and final epidemic size. A comprehensive model analysis reveals that the level of resource scarcity fundamentally affects the optimal allocation. Desynchronization of the epidemic peaks among several population subgroups emerges as a desirable principle since it reduces disease spread between different subgroups. Further, the level of preferential mixing among people of the same gender, gender homophily, proves to strongly affect disease dynamics and optimal treatment allocation strategies, highlighting the importance of accurately accounting for heterogeneous mixing patterns. Altogether, the findings help answer a timely question: how can infectious diseases be best controlled in societies at war? The developed model can be easily extended to specific diseases, countries and interventions.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2024-Nov,"Srivastava V, Sarkar D, Kadelka C",3,1442,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The presence of spatial heterogeneity and the movement of individuals play crucial roles in determining the persistence and eradication of infectious diseases. To capture these dynamics, we introduce a moving strategy called risk-induced dispersal (RID) for infected individuals in a continuous-time patch model of the SIS epidemic. First, we establish a continuous-time <i>n</i>-patch model and verify that the RID strategy is an effective approach for attaining a disease-free state. This is substantiated through simulations conducted on 7-patch models and analytical results derived from 2-patch models. Second, we extend our analysis by adapting the patch model into a diffusive epidemic model. This extension allows us to explore further the impact of the RID movement strategy on disease transmission and control.

The median of total accuracy was 97.41% (range: 93.85%-99.04%). The AUCs exceeded 0.98 in 11 of 12 diseases, except in dengue fever (0.613). The M-index was 0.960 (95%CI 0.941-0.978).A novel classification model was constructed based on Bayesian approach to discriminate common infectious diseases in Zhejiang province, China. After entering symptoms and signs, abnormal lab test results, epidemiological features and city of disease origin, an output list of possible diseases ranked according to the calculated probabilities can be provided. The discrimination performance was reasonably good, making it useful in epidemiological applications.",Medicine,2020-Feb,"Li F, Shen Y, Lv D, Lin J, Liu B, He F, Wang Z",7,1542,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
31670456,Factors influencing nurses' intention to care for patients with emerging infectious diseases: Application of the theory of planned behavior.,"Emerging infectious diseases have caused many health problems and have been identified as a major health issue worldwide. The aim of this descriptive, cross-sectional survey study was to investigate nursing intention among nurses caring for emerging infectious disease patients in Korea and to describe factors influencing nurses' intention to care by applying the theory of planned behavior. A total of 147 Korean nurses were included and data accrued using an online questionnaire. Among the independent variables, perceived behavioral control, attitudes toward the behavior, and sex significantly influenced nursing intention. These variables explained 55.1% of nursing intention to care for patients with emerging infectious diseases, and perceived behavioral control (confidence or self-efficacy in caring for patients) was the strongest predictor. These findings showed the usefulness of the theory of planned behavior in predicting nurses' intention to care for patients with emerging infectious diseases. Providing an educational program on caring for patients with pandemic diseases would also increase self-confidence and reduce concerns. In addition, institutional support, such as compensation payments and recognition from administrators, would also strengthen positive attitudes among nurses.",Nursing & health sciences,2020-Mar,"Lee J, Kang SJ",2,1306,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35716723,A direct comparison of methods for assessing the threat from emerging infectious diseases in seasonally varying environments.,"Seasonal variations in environmental conditions lead to changing infectious disease epidemic risks at different times of year. The probability that early cases initiate a major epidemic depends on the season in which the pathogen enters the population. The instantaneous epidemic risk (IER) can be tracked. This quantity is straightforward to calculate, and corresponds to the probability of a major epidemic starting from a single case introduced at time t=t<sub>0</sub>, assuming that environmental conditions remain identical from that time onwards (i.e. for all t≥t<sub>0</sub>). However, the threat when a pathogen enters the population in fact depends on changes in environmental conditions occurring within the timescale of the initial phase of the outbreak. For that reason, we compare the IER with a different metric: the case epidemic risk (CER). The CER corresponds to the probability of a major epidemic starting from a single case entering the population at time t=t<sub>0</sub>, accounting for changes in environmental conditions after that time. We show how the IER and CER can be calculated using different epidemiological models (the stochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Removed model and a stochastic host-vector model that is parameterised using temperature data for Miami) in which transmission parameter values vary temporally. While the IER is always easy to calculate numerically, the adaptable method we provide for calculating the CER for the host-vector model can also be applied easily and solved using widely available software tools. In line with previous research, we demonstrate that, if a pathogen is likely to either invade the population or fade out on a fast timescale compared to changes in environmental conditions, the IER closely matches the CER. However, if this is not the case, the IER and the CER can be significantly different, and so the CER should be used. This demonstrates the need to consider future changes in environmental conditions carefully when assessing the risk posed by emerging pathogens.",Journal of theoretical biology,2022-Sep,"Kaye AR, Hart WS, Bromiley J, Iwami S, Thompson RN",5,2044,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Traditional culture-based testing can be augmented by more rapid testing modalities to provide clinically actionable information as quickly as possible. Despite improvements in patient outcomes, many clinical microbiology laboratories are facing challenges to in-sourcing these technologies. Depending on a multitude of factors, including size, location and patient population served, these barriers may affect some laboratories and hospital systems to greater or lesser extents than others. It will be up to each individual facility to ascertain its ability to overcome barriers. To aid in this self-assessment, we present for thoughtful consideration a discussion of the barriers to implementation of rapid identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing technologies, with specific attention to matters of financial cost, staff expertise, operational issues and stakeholder buy-in.",The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,2024-Sep,"Simons CC, Capraro GA",2,1055,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The multiagent description leads to the study of the evolution over time of a system of kinetic equations for the wealth densities of susceptible, infectious, and recovered individuals, whose proportions are driven by a classical compartmental model in epidemiology. Explicit calculations show that the spread of the disease seriously affects the distribution of wealth, which, unlike the situation in the absence of epidemics, can converge toward a stationary state with a bimodal form. Furthermore, simulations confirm the ability of the model to describe different phenomenon characteristics of economic trends in situations compromised by the rapid spread of an epidemic, such as the unequal impact on the various wealth classes and the risk of a shrinking middle class.",Physical review.

39052140,Fitting Epidemic Models to Data: A Tutorial in Memory of Fred Brauer.,"Fred Brauer was an eminent mathematician who studied dynamical systems, especially differential equations. He made many contributions to mathematical epidemiology, a field that is strongly connected to data, but he always chose to avoid data analysis. Nevertheless, he recognized that fitting models to data is usually necessary when attempting to apply infectious disease transmission models to real public health problems. He was curious to know how one goes about fitting dynamical models to data, and why it can be hard. Initially in response to Fred's questions, we developed a user-friendly R package, fitode, that facilitates fitting ordinary differential equations to observed time series. Here, we use this package to provide a brief tutorial introduction to fitting compartmental epidemic models to a single observed time series. We assume that, like Fred, the reader is familiar with dynamical systems from a mathematical perspective, but has limited experience with statistical methodology or optimization techniques.",Bulletin of mathematical biology,2024-Jul,"Earn DJD, Park SW, Bolker BM",3,1029,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35400176,Utility of Broad-Range PCR Sequencing for Infectious Diseases Clinical Decision Making: a Pediatric Center Experience.,"Broad-range PCR (BRPCR) sequencing is a promising tool for diagnosis of infectious conditions when traditional microbiologic strategies fail to identify a pathogen. Data on the optimal clinical scenarios in which to use this tool are limited. We assessed, via retrospective chart review, the rate of organism identification and impact on clinical management from BRPCR testing sent from our quaternary care children's hospital between February 2010 and June 2020. A total of 382 samples were sent from 269 individual patients. A total of 200 (74.3%) patients were immunocompromised. Median age at time of sample collection was 10.0 years (interquartile range, 4.2 to 15.8). A total of 254/377 (64.7%) samples were from patients known to be on ≥1 antimicrobial in the 24 h prior to sample collection. A total of 112/382 (29.3%) samples were from patients ultimately diagnosed with a bacterial or fungal infection by another testing modality. The most common sample types were bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (45), lung tissue (41), and bone (39). An organism was identified from 83 (21.7%) samples, but results from only 19 (5.0%) samples led to a change in management. Organisms were identified from 18 (40%) BAL samples; only 2 (4.4%) were judged to be clinically significant. A total of 4/12 (33.3%) samples from cardiac hardware changed clinical management. We found that only 5% of BRPCR results influenced antimicrobial management in a diverse pediatric cohort. Our findings suggest that the impact on clinical management varied widely by sample type. Additional work is necessary to characterize the ideal clinical scenarios in which BRPCR should be used.",Journal of clinical microbiology,2022-May,"Naureckas Li C, Nakamura MM",2,1664,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38574784,Mpox across countries from Central and Eastern Europe - 2022 outbreak.,"The aim of the study was to assess socio-demographical characteristics, clinical presentation, and outcomes in patients diagnosed with mpox. A survey on patients diagnosed with mpox was performed in 14 countries from Central and Eastern Europe. Data was compared according to HIV status and country of origin (EU vs. non-EU). Mpox diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR from oropharyngeal swabs, skin lesions, and other body fluids. Out of 154 patients confirmed with mpox in 2022, 99.3% were males, with a median age (years) of 35 (IQR 30-39), 90.2% MSM and 48.7% PLWH. Compared to HIV-negative subjects, PLWH had more frequent high-risk behaviours:chemsex (p = 0.015), group sex (p = 0.027), and a history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (p = 0.004). Persons from EU were more often PLWH (p = 0.042), MSM (p < 0.0001), had multiple sexual partners (p = 0.025), practiced chemsex (p = 0.008) or group-sex (p = 0.005) and had more often history of STIs (p < 0.0001). The median CD4 cell count/mL at mpox diagnosis was 713 (IQR 486-996) and 73.5% had undetectable HIV VL. The commonest clinical features were fever (108 cases), lymphadenopathy (78), and vesiculo-pustular rash: penile (76), perianal (48), limbs (67). Fifty-one (31%) persons were hospitalized due to complications or epidemiological reasons. Three patients received tecovirimat or cidofovir. The outcome was favorable for all patients, including 4 with severe forms. Mpox was diagnosed predominantly in young MSM, with high-risk behaviors and history of STIs.

33106525,Disentangling etiologies of CNS infections in Singapore using multiple correspondence analysis and random forest.,"Central nervous system (CNS) infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide, with mounting concern about new and emerging neurologic infections. Stratifying etiologies based on initial clinical and laboratory data would facilitate etiology-based treatment rather than relying on empirical treatment. Here, we report the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of patients with CNS infections from a prospective surveillance study that took place between 2013 and 2016 in Singapore. Using multiple correspondence analysis and random forest, we analyzed the link between clinical presentation, laboratory results, outcome and etiology. Of 199 patients, etiology was identified as infectious in 110 (55.3%, 95%-CI 48.3-62.0), immune-mediated in 10 (5.0%, 95%-CI 2.8-9.0), and unknown in 79 patients (39.7%, 95%-CI 33.2-46.6). The initial presenting clinical features were associated with the prognosis at 2 weeks, while laboratory-related parameters were related to the etiology of CNS disease. The parameters measured were helpful to stratify etiologies in broad categories, but were not able to discriminate completely between all the etiologies. Our results suggest that while prognosis of CNS is clearly related to the initial clinical presentation, pinpointing etiology remains challenging. Bio-computational methods which identify patterns in complex datasets may help to supplement CNS infection diagnostic and prognostic decisions.",Scientific reports,2020-Oct,"Zellweger RM, Yacoub S, Chan YFZ, Soon D, Shafi H, Ooi ST, Chan M, Jacobson L, Sessions OM, Vincent A, Low JGH, Ooi EE, Wang L, Wijaya L, Tan K",15,1447,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The model is developed based on the six compartments: susceptible, latent, infected, asymptomatic, treated, and recovered individuals. We determine the effective reproduction number for this nonautonomous system, and analytic discussion shows that at least one positive periodic solution exists for R<sub>0</sub>>1. The model is simulated using the RK-45 numerical method, and the parameter values for the model are taken from the available literature. From the numerical results, we observe that the degree of seasonality and vaccine efficacy significantly impact the amplitude of the epidemic curve. The latent-infected phase plane shows that periodic solutions exhibit a period-doubling bifurcation as the amplitude of seasonality increases. Finally, the model outcome was compared with the actual field data and found to be consistent.","Comparative immunology, microbiology and infectious diseases",2024-Jan,"Malek A, Hoque A",2,979,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
31880086,Multilayer network analysis unravels haulage vehicles as a hidden threat to the British swine industry.,"When assessing the role of live animal trade networks in the spread of infectious diseases in livestock, attention has focused mainly on direct movements of animals between premises, whereas the role of haulage vehicles used during transport, an indirect route for disease transmission, has largely been ignored. Here, we have assessed the impact of sharing haulage vehicles from livestock transport service providers on the connectivity between farms as well as on the spread of swine infectious diseases in Great Britain (GB). Using all pig movement records between April 2012 and March 2014 in GB, we built a series of directed and weighted static multiplex networks consisting of two layers of identical nodes, where nodes (farms) are linked either by (a) the direct movement of pigs and (b) the shared use of haulage vehicles.

Each provider participated in one of three on-site focus groups. Participants answered questions about how they gained their knowledge, felt about caring for EVD patients, made decisions about caring for EVD patients, and suggestions for improvement of ID preparedness. Focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and coded using inductive content analysis. <b>Results:</b> Analysis revealed five prominent themes: reactions to scare, education/training, danger, decision making, and suggestions for future responses. Overall, first responders were excited to be a part of the response to EVD. They were more comfortable caring for EVD patients if they received adequate education and transparency from the administration. This resulted in a decreased perceived danger of the disease and decreased hesitancy when caring for EVD patients. However, those that expressed the most hesitancy also expressed the most emotional distress. Suggestions for improvement of ID preparedness included continuing education, tiered training models, peer training models, collaboration between emergency medical services (EMS) systems, better communication between departments, and the development of an infectious disease response team. <b>Conclusions:</b> Although first responders were excited to be a part of the response to EVD, this did not come without hesitation and emotional distress. Some of these concerns may be mitigated by first providing a clear definition of ""duty to care,"" followed by interventions such as the development of clear and consistent ID preparedness training and interventions that address the emotional distress experienced by these providers.",Prehospital emergency care,2020-,"Alexander AB, Masters MM, Warren K",3,2115,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

39325530,An Ontology to Bridge the Clinical Management of Patients and Public Health Responses for Strengthening Infectious Disease Surveillance: Design Science Study.,"Novel surveillance approaches using digital technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), have evolved, enhancing traditional infectious disease surveillance systems by enabling real-time detection of outbreaks and reaching a wider population. However, disparate, heterogenous infectious disease surveillance systems often operate in silos due to a lack of interoperability. As a life-changing clinical use case, the COVID-19 pandemic has manifested that a lack of interoperability can severely inhibit public health responses to emerging infectious diseases. Interoperability is thus critical for building a robust ecosystem of infectious disease surveillance and enhancing preparedness for future outbreaks. The primary enabler for semantic interoperability is ontology. This study aims to design the IoT-based management of infectious disease ontology (IoT-MIDO) to enhance data sharing and integration of data collected from IoT-driven patient health monitoring, clinical management of individual patients, and disparate heterogeneous infectious disease surveillance. The ontology modeling approach was chosen for its semantic richness in knowledge representation, flexibility, ease of extensibility, and capability for knowledge inference and reasoning. The IoT-MIDO was developed using the basic formal ontology (BFO) as the top-level ontology. We reused the classes from existing BFO-based ontologies as much as possible to maximize the interoperability with other BFO-based ontologies and databases that rely on them. We formulated the competency questions as requirements for the ontology to achieve the intended goals. We designed an ontology to integrate data from heterogeneous sources, including IoT-driven patient monitoring, clinical management of individual patients, and infectious disease surveillance systems. This integration aims to facilitate the collaboration between clinical care and public health domains. We also demonstrate five use cases using the simplified ontological models to show the potential applications of IoT-MIDO: (1) IoT-driven patient monitoring, risk assessment, early warning, and risk management; (2) clinical management of patients with infectious diseases; (3) epidemic risk analysis for timely response at the public health level; (4) infectious disease surveillance; and (5) transforming patient information into surveillance information. The development of the IoT-MIDO was driven by competency questions. Being able to answer all the formulated competency questions, we successfully demonstrated that our ontology has the potential to facilitate data sharing and integration for orchestrating IoT-driven patient health monitoring in the context of an infectious disease epidemic, clinical patient management, infectious disease surveillance, and epidemic risk analysis. The novelty and uniqueness of the ontology lie in building a bridge to link IoT-based individual patient monitoring and early warning based on patient risk assessment to infectious disease epidemic surveillance at the public health level. The ontology can also serve as a starting point to enable potential decision support systems, providing actionable insights to support public health organizations and practitioners in making informed decisions in a timely manner.",JMIR formative research,2024-Sep,"Lim S, Johannesson P",2,3298,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39587221,Causal inference concepts can guide research into the effects of climate on infectious diseases.,"A pressing question resulting from global warming is how climate change will affect infectious diseases. Answering this question requires research into the effects of weather on the population dynamics of transmission and infection; elucidating these effects, however, has proved difficult due to the challenges of assessing causality from the predominantly observational data available in epidemiological research. Here we show how concepts from causal inference-the sub-field of statistics aiming at inferring causality from data-can guide that research. Through a series of case studies, we illustrate how such concepts can help assess study design and strategically choose a study's location, evaluate and reduce the risk of bias, and interpret the multifaceted effects of meteorological variables on transmission. More broadly, we argue that interdisciplinary approaches based on explicit causal frameworks are crucial for reliably estimating the effect of weather and accurately predicting the consequences of climate change.",Nature ecology & evolution,2025-Feb,"Barrero Guevara LA, Kramer SC, Kurth T, Domenech de Cellès M",4,1031,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

To address this issue, we consider the spread of infectious diseases through a mean field game version of a SIR compartmental model with social structure, in which individuals are grouped by their age class and interact together in different settings. In our game theoretical approach, individuals can choose to limit their contacts if the epidemic is too virulent, but this effort comes with a social cost. We further compare the Nash equilibrium obtained in this way with the societal optimum that would be obtained if a benevolent central planner could decide on the strategy of each individual, as well as to the more realistic situation where an approximation of this optimum is reached through social policies such as lockdown.",Physical review.

To characterize the clinicopathologic features of granulomas in this population and develop a clinically judicious approach to their evaluation. We performed chart reviews of solid organ and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients at Yale New Haven Hospital to identify patients with granulomas on biopsy obtained pathologic specimens. Pretransplant and posttransplant specimens were included. Data points included demographics, clinical presentation, epidemiologic risk factors, biopsy indication, location and timing, immunosuppression, histopathology, microbiology, and associated clinical diagnosis. Granuloma-related readmissions and mortality were recorded at 1, 3, and 12 months. Biopsy proven granulomas were identified in 56 of 2139 (2.6%) patients. Of 56, 16 (29%) were infectious. Common infectious etiologies were bartonellosis (n = 3) and cytomegalovirus hepatitis (n = 3). Tuberculosis was not identified. Clinical symptoms prompted tissue biopsy in 27 of 56 (48.2%) cases while biopsies were obtained for evaluation of incidental findings or routine disease surveillance in 29 of 56 (51.8%). Presence of symptoms was significantly associated with infectious etiologies; 11 of 27 (40.7%) symptomatic patients compared with 5 of 29 (17.2%) asymptomatic patients had infectious causes. One death from granulomatous cryptogenic organizing pneumonia occurred. In pretransplant asymptomatic patients, no episodes of symptomatic disease occurred posttransplantation. Granulomas were uncommon in a large transplant population; most were noninfectious but presence of symptoms was associated with infectious etiologies.

38777941,Metagenomic next-generation sequencing as a diagnostic tool in the clinical routine of an infectious diseases department: a retrospective cohort study.,"Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of circulating cell-free DNA from plasma is a hypothesis-independent broadband diagnostic method for identification of potential pathogens. So far, it has only been investigated in special risk populations (e.g. patients with neutropenic fever). To investigate the extent to which mNGS (DISQVER® platform) can be used in routine clinical practice. We collected whole blood specimens for mNGS testing, blood cultures (BC), and pathogen-specific PCR diagnostics. Clinical data and pathogen diagnostics were retrospectively reviewed by an infectious disease expert panel regarding the adjustment of anti-infective therapy. In 55 selected patients (median age 53 years, 67% male) with heterogeneous diagnoses, a total of 66 different microorganisms and viruses were detected using mNGS (51% viruses, 38% bacteria, 8% fungi, 3% parasites). The overall positivity rate of mNGS was 53% (29/55). Fifty-two out of 66 (79%) potential pathogens detected by mNGS were found in patients with primary or secondary immunodeficiency. The concordance rates of BC and pathogen-specific PCR diagnostics with mNGS testing were 14% (4/28) and 36% (10/28), respectively (p < 0.001). An additional bacterial pathogen (Streptococcus agalactiae) could only be detected by BC. Therapeutic consequences regarding anti-infective therapy were drawn from 23 pathogens (35% of detections), with 18 of these detections occurring in patients with immunodeficiency. We conclude that mNGS is a useful diagnostic tool, but should only be performed selectively in addition to routine diagnostics of infectious diseases. The limited number of patients and the retrospective study design do not allow any further conclusions.",Infection,2024-Aug,"Kalbitz S, Ermisch J, Kellner N, Nickel O, Borte S, Marx K, Lübbert C",7,1732,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32060265,Systematic selection between age and household structure for models aimed at emerging epidemic predictions.,"Numerous epidemic models have been developed to capture aspects of human contact patterns, making model selection challenging when they fit (often-scarce) early epidemic data equally well but differ in predictions. Here we consider the invasion of a novel directly transmissible infection and perform an extensive, systematic and transparent comparison of models with explicit age and/or household structure, to determine the accuracy loss in predictions in the absence of interventions when ignoring either or both social components. We conclude that, with heterogeneous and assortative contact patterns relevant to respiratory infections, the model's age stratification is crucial for accurate predictions. Conversely, the household structure is only needed if transmission is highly concentrated in households, as suggested by an empirical but robust rule of thumb based on household secondary attack rate. This work serves as a template to guide the simplicity/accuracy trade-off in designing models aimed at initial, rapid assessment of potential epidemic severity.",Nature communications,2020-Feb,"Pellis L, Cauchemez S, Ferguson NM, Fraser C",4,1070,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32892785,Development of a systematic mapping review protocol for the most recent evidence on ruminant infectious disease frequency and disease-associated mortality: Ethiopia as a case study.,"Almost 19% of the GDP of Ethiopia results from livestock production. Ruminants, in particular, form the majority of the national herd and are a critical source of income for smallholder farmers. Infectious diseases have been identified as a major cause of reduced livestock productivity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); therefore, a sound and comprehensive understanding of the relevant evidence would be beneficial in order to enable decision making on disease control policies. However, livestock disease data from sub-Saharan Africa is variable and disparate, which poses a challenge for evidence synthesis. This paper describes a protocol for a systematic mapping review of the recent available evidence on ruminant disease prevalence and associated mortality in Ethiopia. Literature sources will be identified using database search strategies. The titles, abstracts and, subsequently, full texts will be screened for inclusion based on predefined eligibility criteria. Specific data will be extracted and a preliminary qualitative assessment of the evidence will be performed using predefined indicators. The planned systematic map will be the first to provide a large-scale overview of the available ruminant disease evidence in Ethiopia; the final output will be an interactive dashboard tool to inform critical stakeholders in policy and research.",Animal health research reviews,2020-Jun,"Tsouloufi TK, Donnison LM, Smyth KL, Peters AR",4,1367,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32777587,"Blood culture reports by infectious disease physicians can improve prognosis of bacteremia, including weekend-onset cases.","Cases of positive blood cultures were previously reported by a microbiological technologist (MT) to an attending physician (AP), and the Antimicrobial Stewardship team provided medical assistance by grasping the situation at the morning meeting the next day. Since April 2018, MTs have reported positive blood cultures to an infectious disease physician (IDP), who proposes the management approach to the AP and provides weekend support. This study assessed the effectiveness of blood culture reports provided by IDPs to APs on outcomes of bacteremia, including weekend-onset cases. Patient characteristics and prognoses before (October 2017 to March 2018) and after intervention (April to September 2018) were compared. The pre-intervention and post-intervention groups comprised 134 and 161 patients, respectively. Patients were more likely to be older (>65 years) in the post-intervention group (p < 0.05). There were no significant between-group differences in infection severity. The rate of de-escalation significantly increased from 38.1%-57.8% (p = 0.001). The rates of 28-day and in-hospital mortality reduced following the intervention (21.3% vs. 8.2% and 32.8% vs. 10.6%; p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively). In-hospital mortality for weekend-onset cases also reduced following the intervention (33.3% vs. 12.9%, p = 0.01). Sepsis was a poor prognostic factor (OR 8.070, 95% CI 3.320-19.600, p < 0.001) and intervention was a good prognostic factor (OR 0.311, 95% CI 0.142-0.680, p = 0.003) affecting 28-day mortality in multivariate analysis.

We assessed their influence on improving the diagnostic accuracy of blood culture-positive inpatients at a Japanese cancer center. Our single-center, retrospective observational study was conducted from April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2022 to evaluate two phases: pre-intervention (notification of antimicrobials by the infection control team) and post-intervention (ASP implementation and ID consultation service establishment). There were 42,514 inpatients: 22,096 during the pre-intervention and 20,418 during the intervention periods. A total of 939 blood culture-positive episodes (pre-intervention, n = 434; post-intervention, n = 505) were analyzed. During the pre-intervention period, 28.1% of the patients had an unknown diagnosis, which decreased significantly to 1.2% post-intervention. Furthermore, hepatobiliary tract and other infections increased significantly post-intervention, and the mortality rate due to Staphylococcus aureus infection decreased from 28.6% pre-intervention to 10.4% post-intervention. The trend and level of the total number of culture specimens submitted per 1000 patient days for all culture specimens increased significantly post-intervention. Notably, the two-set rate of monthly blood cultures increased significantly. In conclusion, improving the overall diagnostic process with ASP and ID consultations at cancer centers could lead to the optimization of patient care.",Scientific reports,2024-Feb,"Itoh N, Akazawa N, Kawabata T, Yamaguchi M, Kodama EN, Ohmagari N",6,1561,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model is known to have an exact semi-analytical solution. In the current study, the approach of Harko et al. (Appl. Math. Comput. 236:184-194, 2014) is generalised to obtain an approximate semi-analytical solution of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model. The SEIR model curves have nearly the same shapes as the SIR ones, but with a stretch factor applied to them across time that is related to the ratio of the incubation to infectious periods. This finding implies an approximate characteristic timescale, scaled by this stretch factor, that is universal to all SEIR models, which only depends on the basic reproduction number and initial fraction of the population that is infectious.",Scientific reports,2020-Nov,"Heng K, Althaus CL",2,862,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The aim of our prospective single-centre clinical study was to assess the proportion of readable results and errors compared with routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing and the clinical consequences drawn by infectious disease (ID) physicians from RAST results during same-day bedside consultation. All positive blood cultures suitable for RAST from January to December 2019 were included and RAST results at 4 and 6 h compared with standard disc diffusion. The real-life impact of RAST on clinical decisions was assessed during same-day ID bedside consultation. The proportion of readable RAST results was significantly higher after 6 h of incubation compared with after 4 h (881/930 versus 642/847; P < 0.0001). Major and very major errors were rare (17/642 after 4 h and 12/881 after 6 h; P = 0.087). ID consultation was performed in 134 patients after the RAST result. Antimicrobial treatment was changed in 73 patients and 84 additional measures (i.e. imaging studies, surgery, additional resistance testing) were ordered in 62 patients. RAST according to EUCAST methods was easy to implement with a low number of major and very major errors after 6 h of incubation.

33378896,Global behavior of a multi-group SEIR epidemic model with age structure and spatial diffusion.,"Different epidemic models with one or two characteristics of multi-group, age structure and spatial diffusion have been proposed, but few models take all three into consideration. In this paper, a novel multi-group SEIR epidemic model with both age structure and spatial diffusion is constructed for the first time ever to study the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. We first analytically study the positivity, boundedness, existence and uniqueness of solution and the existence of compact global attractor of the associated solution semiflow. Based on some assumptions for parameters, we then show that the disease-free steady state is globally asymptotically stable by utilizing appropriate Lyapunov functionals and the LaSalle's invariance principle. By means of Perron-Frobenius theorem and graph-theoretical results, the existence and global stability of endemic steady state are ensured under appropriate conditions. Finally, feasibility of main theoretical results is showed with the aid of numerical examples for model with two groups which is important from the viewpoint of applications.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2020-Oct,"Liu P, Li HX",2,1109,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32066365,Enhancing the Alternative Cellular Energy (ACE) Pathway with KELEA Activated Water as Therapy for Infectious Diseases.,"Many infectious diseases have yet to be conquered by modern medicine. This is generally attributed to both a failure of the immune system and the lack of an effective anti-microbial pharmaceutical. Infections can be regarded as a competitive process between the microbe and the host for cellular energy-generated resources. Cells obtain energy not only from the metabolism of food but also from the alternative cellular energy (ACE) pathway. This pathway utilizes an environmental force termed as KELEA (kinetic energy limiting electrostatic attraction), which provides an added kinetic/chemical energy to the body's fluids. The ACE pathway can be enhanced through the use of KELEA activated water, which is currently available under different names from several sources. Enhancing the body's ACE pathway, including the use of a wearable waterceutical ™, provides a novel means of potentially increasing the body's resistance against all infectious diseases.",Infectious disorders drug targets,2021-,Martin WJ,1,958,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32434483,Migrants and imported disease: Trends of admission in an Italian infectious disease ward during the migration crisis of 2015-2017.,"Since 2014, the migrant population residing in Europe has dramatically increased. Migrants' unmet health needs represent a barrier to integration and should be promptly addressed, without stigma, in order to favour resettlement. All-cause of admissions in the migrant population at the Infectious Disease Clinic of Policlinico San Martino Hospital in Genoa between 2015 and 2017 were analysed. Patients were classified by duration of residence in Italy according to the Recommendation on Statistics of International Migration, cause of hospitalization, and region of origin. All data were evaluated with SPSS Statistics. Two hundred thirty-five people were admitted, 86 (36.5%) of them residing in Italy for less than 1 year. Except for a significant increase in migrants from Africa, there was no change considering the area of origin, hospitalization reason or by comparing residency in Italy for more or less than 1 year. A considerable number of hospitalizations were related to non-communicable pathologies and latent tuberculosis infection. Residents in Italy for less than 1 year or with active tuberculosis had prolonged hospitalizations, while HIV-infected had shorter hospital stays. No difference in terms of diagnosis were found between migrants with longer or shorter period of residence in Italy. Adequate outpatient services for the management of communicable diseases could significantly reduce the length of hospitalizations in the migrant population.",BMC public health,2020-May,"Del Puente F, Riccardi N, Taramasso L, Sarteschi G, Pincino R, Di Biagio A",6,1468,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32962383,Mathematical modeling and cellular automata simulation of infectious disease dynamics: Applications to the understanding of herd immunity.,"The complexity associated with an epidemic defies any quantitatively reliable predictive theoretical scheme. Here, we pursue a generalized mathematical model and cellular automata simulations to study the dynamics of infectious diseases and apply it in the context of the COVID-19 spread. Our model is inspired by the theory of coupled chemical reactions to treat multiple parallel reaction pathways. We essentially ask the question: how hard could the time evolution toward the desired herd immunity (HI) be on the lives of people? We demonstrate that the answer to this question requires the study of two implicit functions, which are determined by several rate constants, which are time-dependent themselves. Implementation of different strategies to counter the spread of the disease requires a certain degree of a quantitative understanding of the time-dependence of the outcome. Here, we compartmentalize the susceptible population into two categories, (i) vulnerables and (ii) resilients (including asymptomatic carriers), and study the dynamical evolution of the disease progression. We obtain the relative fatality of these two sub-categories as a function of the percentages of the vulnerable and resilient population and the complex dependence on the rate of attainment of herd immunity. We attempt to study and quantify possible adverse effects of the progression rate of the epidemic on the recovery rates of vulnerables, in the course of attaining HI. We find the important result that slower attainment of the HI is relatively less fatal. However, slower progress toward HI could be complicated by many intervening factors.",The Journal of chemical physics,2020-Sep,"Mondal S, Mukherjee S, Bagchi B",3,1638,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We present a modelling approach for the study of mobility that adapts dynamically according to individual state, epidemic/social-contagion state and network topology in accordance with limited data and/or common behavioral models. We demonstrate that even for simple compartmental network processes, our approach leads to complex spatial patterns of infection in the endemic state dependent on individual behavior. Specifically, we characterize the resulting phenomena in terms of phase separation, highlighting phase transitions between distinct spatial states and determining the systems' phase diagram. The existence of such phases implies that small changes in the populations' perceptions could lead to drastic changes in the spatial extent and morphology of the epidemic/social phenomena.",Scientific reports,2020-May,"Harding N, Spinney RE, Prokopenko M",3,955,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

However, any errors contained within Knowledge Panels could result in the widespread distribution of inaccurate health information. We explored the potential for inaccuracies to exist within Google's health-based Knowledge Panels by focusing on a single well-studied pathogen, Ebola virus (EBOV). We then evaluated the accuracy of those transmission modes listed within the Google Ebola Knowledge Panel and investigated the pervasiveness of any misconceptions associated with inaccurate transmission modes among persons living in Africa. We found that the Google Ebola Knowledge Panel inaccurately listed insect bites or stings as modes of EBOV transmission. Our scoping review found 27 articles and reports that revealed that 9 of 11 countries where misconceptions regarding insect transmission of EBOV have been reported are locations of current (i.e., Democratic Republic of Congo and Guinea) or previous EBOV outbreaks. We found reports that up to 26.6% (155/582) of study respondents in Democratic Republic of Congo believed mosquito bite avoidance would prevent EBOV; in other locations of previous large-scale EBOV outbreaks (e.g., Guinea), up to 61.0% (304/498) of respondents believed insects were involved in EBOV transmission. Our findings highlight the potential for errors to exist within the health information contained in Google's health-based Knowledge Panels.

Data from the Norwegian Patient Registry (on diagnoses from secondary/tertiary care), Medical Birth Registry of Norway, and Statistics Norway were linked by the national personal identification number. Seven diagnostic infection categories were included from 2008 onwards. The study population included children born in Norway aged 0-10 years between 2008 and 2018 (<i>N</i> = 988,647). Hazards of infection diagnoses by parental region of origin (adjusted for sex, birth year, parental education, household income and mother's parity) and by parental education and household income were assessed by Cox regression. High parental education was associated with lower hazard of infection diagnoses among children of Norwegian-born parents, but associations were less consistent among children with immigrant parents. Lower household income was related to hazard of most infectious diagnoses among children with both Norwegian-born and immigrant parents. Assessed by region diagnoses of viral and bacterial infections and infections of the musculoskeletal system and soft tissue were not associated with household income.

It aims to stimulate a discussion within the veterinary profession regarding how our current approaches: prevent or promote emerging infectious diseases and re-emerging infectious diseases; provide opportunities to improve our preventive contributions going forward; and can yield significant cobenefits.",Australian veterinary journal,2024-Sep,Alders RG,1,1049,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36490362,Kidney Pathology of Tropical and Nontropical Infectious Diseases in the Pediatric Population.,"To review kidney pathology of tropical and nontropical infectious diseases in the pediatric population. We review 4 tropical and 2 nontropical infectious diseases that affect the kidneys of children in terms of their direct and indirect pathogenetic mechanism in inducing kidney damage. We demonstrate clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, kidney pathology, and laboratory diagnostic methods for (1) renal cryptococcosis, which represents involvement of a pure direct pathway; (2) schistosomiasis and dengue fever as examples of dual direct and indirect pathways; and (3) congenital syphilis, visceral leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease, which represent indirect pathways. Infective agents affect the kidneys of children mainly through indirect mechanisms, such as through immunological mechanisms as part of an antigenic response. A direct mechanism of kidney injury, however, is less known within the medical community simply because the direct mechanism is rarely encountered in nontropical countries. In some infectious diseases, both indirect and direct pathways are responsible in inducing 2 sets of morphologically separate kidney lesions.",American journal of clinical pathology,2023-Feb,"Williams M, Reisler J, James T, Afrouzian M",4,1146,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38052576,Can infectious diseases eradicate host species? The effect of infection-age structure.,"It is a fundamental question in mathematical epidemiology whether deadly infectious diseases only lead to a mere decline of their host populations or whether they can cause their complete disappearance. Upper density-dependent incidences do not lead to host extinction in simple, deterministic SI or SIS (susceptible-infectious) epidemic models. Infection-age structure is introduced into SIS models because of the biological accuracy offered by considering arbitrarily distributed infectious periods. In an SIS model with infection-age structure, survival of the susceptible host population is established for incidences that depend on the infection-age density in a general way. This confirms previous host persistence results without infection-age for incidence functions that are not generalizations of frequency-dependent transmission. For certain power incidences, hosts persist if some infected individuals leave the infected class and become susceptible again and the return rate dominates the infection-age dependent infectivity in a sufficient way. The hosts may be driven into extinction by the infectious disease if there is no return into the susceptible class at all.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2023-Oct,"Ponce J, Thieme HR",2,1181,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34288795,Adjuvants: friends in vaccine formulations against infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases represent a major cause of deaths worldwide. No vaccine or effective treatment exists nowadays, especially against intracellular pathogens. The increase in multiple drug and superbug antibiotic resistance strains, excessive medication, or misuse of drugs has prompted the search for other safe and effective alternatives. Consistent with this, adjuvants (Latin word ""adjuvare"": ""help or aid"") co-administered (Exo) in vaccines have emerged as a promising alternative to initiate and boost an innate, downstream signal that led to adaptative immune response. Nowadays, a promising model of strong immunogens and adjuvants at mucosal sites are the microbial bacterial toxins. Other adjuvants that are also used and might successfully replace aluminum salts in combination with nanotechnology are CpG-ODN, poly IC, type I IFNs, mRNA platforms. Therefore, in the present review, we focused to revisit the old to the new adjuvants compounds, the properties that make them friends in vaccine formulations against infectious diseases.",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,2021-Oct,"Guerrero Manriquez GG, Tuero I",2,1047,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37419128,The challenges in the monitoring of infectious diseases after the earthquake in Türkiye in 2023.,"After the devastating earthquake in Türkiye and Syria in February, 2023, the long-term failure to meet the need for shelter, unfavourable living conditions in tent settlements, poor access to clean drinking water, water suitable for personal hygiene, and sanitary facilities, as well as interruptions in provision of primary health-care services, have emerged as the most important risk factors contributing to the spread of infectious diseases. 3 months after the earthquake, most of these problems persist in Türkiye. Data on the control of infectious diseases are scarce according to the reports prepared by medical specialist associations based on observations of health-care providers working in the region and statements made by the local health authorities. According to these unsystematised data, and considering the conditions in the region, faecal-oral transmissible gastrointestinal infections, as well as respiratory and vector-borne infections, are the main challenges. Vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, varicella, meningitis, and polio can be spread in temporary shelters due to interrupted vaccine services and crowded living conditions. In addition to controlling risk factors for infectious diseases, sharing data on the status and control of infectious diseases in the region with the community, health-care providers, and relevant expert groups should be a priority to improve the understanding of the effects of interventions and prepare for possible infectious disease outbreaks.",The Lancet.

38767202,"Climate change, its impact on emerging infectious diseases and new technologies to combat the challenge.","<b>ABSTRACT</b>Improved sanitation, increased access to health care, and advances in preventive and clinical medicine have reduced the mortality and morbidity rates of several infectious diseases. However, recent outbreaks of several emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) have caused substantial mortality and morbidity, and the frequency of these outbreaks is likely to increase due to pathogen, environmental, and population effects driven by climate change. Extreme or persistent changes in temperature, precipitation, humidity, and air pollution associated with climate change can, for example, expand the size of EID reservoirs, increase host-pathogen and cross-species host contacts to promote transmission or spillover events, and degrade the overall health of susceptible host populations leading to new EID outbreaks. It is therefore vital to establish global strategies to track and model potential responses of candidate EIDs to project their future behaviour and guide research efforts on early detection and diagnosis technologies and vaccine development efforts for these targets. Multi-disciplinary collaborations are demanding to develop effective inter-continental surveillance and modelling platforms that employ artificial intelligence to mitigate climate change effects on EID outbreaks. In this review, we discuss how climate change has increased the risk of EIDs and describe novel approaches to improve surveillance of emerging pathogens that pose the risk for EID outbreaks, new and existing measures that could be used to contain or reduce the risk of future EID outbreaks, and new methods to improve EID tracking during further outbreaks to limit disease transmission.",Emerging microbes & infections,2024-Dec,"Liao H, Lyon CJ, Ying B, Hu T",4,1692,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
31002338,A Retrospective Cohort Study to Assess the Impact of an Inpatient Infectious Disease Telemedicine Consultation Service on Hospital and Patient Outcomes.,"Here, we review our experience of providing inpatient infectious disease (ID) consultations using real-time interactive telemedicine assessments. We sought to obtain a baseline and document trends regarding the use of telemedicine ID (teleID) consults as an adjunct to the standard of care through the time period in which teleID consultations were introduced. Data were pulled via manual, retrospective chart reviews of the electronic medical record. Primary outcomes included lengths of stay (LOS), antibiotic usage, and relapse incidences. There were a total of 244 patients at 1 remote hospital site who were provided with ID consultations, either in person, via teleID, or both. Before the availability of teleID (pre-teleID), there were 73 patients transferred for ID consults, while 171 patients were seen via teleID once available. While all 73 patients in the pre-teleID group were transferred from the remote hospital to the hub hospital, only 14 (8.2%) of all remote hospital patients assessed by teleID were transferred. Patient LOS across both facilities decreased when patients were seen via teleID, compared to pre-teleID (P = .0001). The median number of days that patients received antibiotics decreased in the teleID group (median 15, interquartile range [IQR] 9-25), compared to the pre-teleID group (median 19, IQR 11-28), but this decrease was not statistically significant (P = .0770). There was no statistically significant difference in relapse rates, although data were lacking because of patients being lost to follow-up.

The Stockholm Paradigm suggests that their toll will grow tragically in the face of climate change, in particular. The best research protocol for predicting and preventing infectious disease emergence states that an urgent search must commence to identify unknown human and animal pathogens. This short communication proposes that the ethnobiological knowledge of indigenous and impoverished communities can be a source of information about some of those unknown pathogens. I present the ecological and anthropological theory behind this proposal, followed by a few case studies that serve as a limited proof of concept. This paper also serves as a call to action for the medical anthropology community. It gives a brief primer on the EID crisis and how anthropology research may be vital to limiting its havoc on global health. Local knowledge is not likely to play a major role in EID research initiatives, but the incorporation of an awareness of EIDs into standard medical anthropological practice would have myriad other benefits.",Social science & medicine (1982),2020-Aug,Gaddy HG,1,1107,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33357052,The use of molecular xenomonitoring for surveillance of mosquito-borne diseases.,"The scientific community recognizes that molecular xenomonitoring (MX) can allow infected mosquitoes to serve as a proxy for human infection in vector-borne disease surveillance, but developing reliable MX systems for programmatic use has been challenging. The primary aim of this article is to examine the available evidence to recommend how MX can best be used for various purposes. Although much of the literature published within the last 20 years focuses on using MX for lymphatic filariasis elimination, a growing body of evidence supports its use in early warning systems for emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). An MX system design must consider the goal and target (e.g. diseases targeted for elimination versus EIDs), mosquito and pathogen characteristics, and context (e.g. setting and health system). MX is currently used as a 'supplement' to human surveillance and will not be considered as a 'replacement' until the correlation between pathogen-infection rates in human and mosquito populations is better understood. Establishing such relationships may not be feasible in elimination scenarios, due to increasingly dwindling human infection prevalence after successful control, but may still be possible for EIDs and in integrated disease surveillance systems.

39619659,Application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of infectious diseases.,"Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a transformative approach in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, utilizing unbiased high-throughput sequencing to directly detect and characterize microbial genomes from clinical samples. This review comprehensively outlines the fundamental principles, sequencing workflow, and platforms utilized in mNGS technology. The methodological backbone involves shotgun sequencing of total nucleic acids extracted from diverse sample types, enabling simultaneous detection of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites without prior knowledge of the infectious agent. Key advantages of mNGS include its capability to identify rare, novel, or unculturable pathogens, providing a more comprehensive view of microbial communities compared to traditional culture-based methods. Despite these strengths, challenges such as data analysis complexity, high cost, and the need for optimized sample preparation protocols remain significant hurdles. The application of mNGS across various systemic infections highlights its clinical utility. Case studies discussed in this review illustrate its efficacy in diagnosing respiratory tract infections, bloodstream infections, central nervous system infections, gastrointestinal infections, and others. By rapidly identifying pathogens and their genomic characteristics, mNGS facilitates timely and targeted therapeutic interventions, thereby improving patient outcomes and infection control measures. Looking ahead, the future of mNGS in infectious disease diagnostics appears promising. Advances in bioinformatics tools and sequencing technologies are anticipated to streamline data analysis, enhance sensitivity and specificity, and reduce turnaround times. Integration with clinical decision support systems promises to further optimize mNGS utilization in routine clinical practice. In conclusion, mNGS represents a paradigm shift in the field of infectious disease diagnostics, offering unparalleled insights into microbial diversity and pathogenesis. While challenges persist, ongoing technological advancements hold immense potential to consolidate mNGS as a pivotal tool in the armamentarium of modern medicine, empowering clinicians with precise, rapid, and comprehensive pathogen detection capabilities.",Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2024-,"Zhao Y, Zhang W, Zhang X",3,2288,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Electronic systems can be used to achieve the goal of collecting data from heterogeneous datasets and to support multicenter clinical trials. The <i>Ligurian Infectious Diseases Network</i> (LIDN) is a web-based platform for data collection and reuse originating from a regional effort and involving many professionals from different fields. The objective of this work is to present an integrated system of ad hoc interfaces and tools that we use to perform pseudonymous clinical data collection, both manually and automatically, to support clinical trials.

39407144,Association of modifiable risk factors and infectious diseases among individuals with hypertension: a prospective cohort study.,"A comprehensive assessment of combined modifiable risk factors in relation to infectious diseases among individuals with hypertension is lacking, and the potential mechanisms of these associations remain unclear. To investigate the prospective associations of a combination of lifestyle behaviors and cardiometabolic factors with the risk of infectious diseases among individuals with hypertension and to estimate whether and to what extent blood biomarkers mediate these associations. This cohort study included 147,188 participants with hypertension and complete data on modifiable risk factors from the UK Biobank. Health score was constructed from eight modifiable risk factors, including four lifestyle behaviors (diet, physical activity, smoking, and sleep duration) and four cardiometabolic factors (body mass index, blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the health score and infectious diseases. The mediation analysis was performed to assess the potential intermediation effects of blood biomarkers. Over a median follow-up of 12.5 years, 27,398 participants with infectious diseases were documented, with 960 respiratory infectious diseases and 7940 digestive infectious diseases. After adjusting for potential confounders, the HR (95% CI) for the highest versus the lowest quartile of health score was 0.64 (0.62, 0.66) for infectious diseases, 0.72 (0.60, 0.86) for respiratory infectious diseases, and 0.66 (0.62, 0.71) for digestive infectious diseases. Stratified factors including duration of hypertension did not modify the associations between the health score and infectious diseases. In addition, biomarkers including inflammation and renal function collectively explained 46.60% of the associations between the combined lifestyle factors and infectious disease risk among individuals with hypertension. Ideal management of combined modifiable risk factors was associated with lower risks of infectious diseases and might produce profound changes in blood biomarkers among individuals with hypertension. Additionally, specific biomarkers appeared to serve as an intermediate between combined lifestyle factors and infectious diseases. These insights highlighted the important role of a combination of healthy lifestyle and favorable cardiometabolic status in reducing disease burden and facilitated the understanding of biological mechanisms underlying modifiable risk factors with infectious diseases.",BMC infectious diseases,2024-Oct,"Hu N, Ai B, Wang Y, Ren Y, Chen H, Chen Z, Li W",7,2559,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Recently, the role of natural ecosystems in reducing disease emergence risk has gained prominence in decision-making processes, as scientific evidence indicates that human-driven pressure, such as habitat destruction and deforestation, can trigger the emergence of zoonotic infectious diseases. However, the intricate relationship between biodiversity and emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) remains only partially understood. Here, we updated the most comprehensive zoonotic EID event database with the latest reported events to analyse the relationship between EIDs of wildlife origin (zoonoses) and various facets of ecological integrity. We found EID risk was strongly predicted by structural integrity metrics such as human footprint and ecoregion intactness, in addition to environmental variables such as tropical rainforest density and mammal species richness. EID events were more likely to occur in areas with intermediate levels of compositional and structural integrity, underscoring the risk posed by human encroachment into pristine, undisturbed lands. Our study highlights the need to identify novel indicators and targets that can effectively address EID risk alongside other pressing global challenges in sustainable development, ultimately informing strategies for preserving both human and environmental health.","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2024-Jun,"Marcolin L, Tonelli A, Di Marco M",3,1505,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33839288,CRISPR-Cas systems for diagnosing infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases are a global health problem affecting billions of people. Developing rapid and sensitive diagnostic tools is key for successful patient management and curbing disease spread. Currently available diagnostics are very specific and sensitive but time-consuming and require expensive laboratory settings and well-trained personnel; thus, they are not available in resource-limited areas, for the purposes of large-scale screenings and in case of outbreaks and epidemics. Developing new, rapid, and affordable point-of-care diagnostic assays is urgently needed. This review focuses on CRISPR-based technologies and their perspectives to become platforms for point-of-care nucleic acid detection methods and as deployable diagnostic platforms that could help to identify and curb outbreaks and emerging epidemics. We describe the mechanisms and function of different classes and types of CRISPR-Cas systems, including pros and cons for developing molecular diagnostic tests and applications of each type to detect a wide range of infectious agents. Many Cas proteins (Cas3, Cas9, Cas12, Cas13, Cas14 etc.) have been leveraged to create highly accurate and sensitive diagnostic tools combined with technologies of signal amplification and fluorescent, potentiometric, colorimetric, lateral flow assay detection and other. In particular, the most advanced platforms -- SHERLOCK/v2, DETECTR, CARMEN or CRISPR-Chip -- enable detection of attomolar amounts of pathogenic nucleic acids with specificity comparable to that of PCR but with minimal technical settings. Further developing CRISPR-based diagnostic tools promises to dramatically transform molecular diagnostics, making them easily affordable and accessible virtually anywhere in the world. The burden of socially significant diseases, frequent outbreaks, recent epidemics (MERS, SARS and the ongoing COVID-19) and outbreaks of zoonotic viruses (African Swine Fever Virus etc.) urgently need the developing and distribution of express-diagnostic tools.

In this work, we evaluate the time shift produced in the number of people infected from one disease when interacting with another disease. Using a compartmental model, we produce different forms of relationship as competition, cooperation, and independence, assessing the effect of each one in the final result. We focus on the case of the unidirectional coupling between diseases, which enables us to study the impact of a perturbation to a driving disease on the driven one. We found that the prevalence of the driven disease is strongly affected if its time scale, defined by the time where the infection reaches the peak, is comparable to that of the driving disease. The secondary peak of the infection was observed under cooperative coupling if the time scale of the driving disease is much longer than that of the driven one.","Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2020-Sep,"Olivares P, Creixell W, Fujiwara N",3,1086,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

However, these require expensive reagents, equipment, and sophisticated infrastructure, as well as highly trained workers. In this context, it is necessary to identify new diagnostic strategies to overcome these issues. Recently, CRISPR/Cas based diagnosis has revolutionized the area of molecular diagnostics of pathogenic diseases. In this review, we have discussed the different classes of CRISPR-Cas systems and their functions, and then focused on recent advances in CRISPR-based diagnosis technologies and the perspective of using this as a potential biosensing platform to detect infectious disease.",Microbiological research,2022-Oct,"Padmanaban V, Ranganathan UDK",2,1140,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34815507,Socioeconomic variation of multimorbidity in Colombian older adults.,"Multimorbidity (MM) prevalence among older adults is increasing worldwide. Variations regarding the socioeconomic characteristics of the individuals and their context have been described, mostly in high-income settings. However, further research is needed to understand the effect of the coexistence of infectious diseases along with socioeconomic factors regarding MM. This study aims to examine the variation of MM regarding infectious diseases mortality after adjusting for socioeconomic factors. A cross-sectional multilevel study with a nationally representative sample of 17,571 Colombian adults of 60 years of age or older was conducted. Individual socioeconomic, demographic, childhood and health related characteristics, as well as group level variables (multidimensional poverty index and infectious diseases mortality rate) were analyzed. A two-level stepwise structural equation model was used to simultaneously adjust for the individual and contextual effects. Multimorbidity prevalence was 62.3% (95% CI 61.7-62.9). In the multilevel adjusted models, age, female sex, having functional limitations, non-white ethnicity, high body mass index, higher income, physical inactivity and living in urban areas were associated with multimorbidity among the sample for this study. The median odds ratio for multidimensional poverty was 1.18 (1.16-1.19; p = 0.008) and for infectious diseases was 1.25 (1.22-1.28; p = 0.014). This paper demonstrates that MM varies regarding the mortality of infectious diseases and shows a strong association between MM and poverty in a low-middle income country. Differences in the factors involved in the etiology of multimorbidity are expected among wealthy and poor countries regarding availability and prioritization of health services.",Scientific reports,2021-Nov,"Ballesteros SM, Moreno-Montoya J, Grooten WJA, Barrera-López P, De la Hoz-Valle JA",5,1779,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33262758,Inflammaging in Endemic Areas for Infectious Diseases.,"Immunosenescence is marked by a systemic process named inflammaging along with a series of defects in the immunological activity that results in poor responses to infectious agents and to vaccination. Inflammaging, a state of low-grade chronic inflammation, usually leads to chronic inflammatory diseases and frailty in the elderly. However, some elderly escape from frailty and reach advanced age free of the consequences of inflammaging. This process has been called immunological remodeling, and it is the hallmark of healthy aging as described in the studies of centenarians in Italy. The biological markers of healthy aging are still a matter of debate, and the studies on the topic have focused on inflammatory <i>versus</i> remodeling processes and molecules. The sub-clinical inflammatory status associated with aging might be a deleterious event for populations living in countries where chronic infectious diseases are not prevalent. Nevertheless, in other parts of the world where they are, two possibilities may occur. Inflammatory responses may have a protective effect against these infectious agents. At the same time, the long-term consequences of protective immune responses during chronic infections may result in accelerated immunosenescence in these individuals. Therefore, the biological markers of healthy aging can vary according to environmental, cultural, and geographical settings that reflect worldwide, and in a non-biased, non-westernized perspective, the changes that we experience regarding our contacts with microorganisms and the outcomes of such contacts.",Frontiers in immunology,2020-,"Batista MA, Calvo-Fortes F, Silveira-Nunes G, Camatta GC, Speziali E, Turroni S, Teixeira-Carvalho A, Martins-Filho OA, Neretti N, Maioli TU, Santos RR, Brigidi P, Franceschi C, Faria AMC",14,1589,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Individuals invest in their health to slow down health deficit accumulation and take measures to protect themselves from infectious diseases. We calibrate the model for an average American and explore how health expenditure, life expectancy, and the value of life depend on individual characteristics, medical technology, and the disease environment. We then use counterfactual computational experiments of the U.S. epidemiological transition 1860-2010 to show that the decline of infectious diseases caused a substantial decline of chronic diseases and contributed more to increasing life expectancy than advances in the treatment of chronic diseases.",Economics and human biology,2024-Jan,"Strulik H, Grossmann V",2,918,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37218364,Causes of thrombocytopenia in dogs in the United Kingdom: A retrospective study of 762 cases.,"Thrombocytopenia is a common laboratory abnormality in dogs, and numerous diseases have been associated with its development. Estimates for the sensitivity and specificity of the degree of reduction of platelet concentration for the diagnosis of primary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (pITP) have not been reported. To report the prevalence of different causes of thrombocytopenia in dogs in the United Kingdom and to investigate the utility of platelet concentration to differentiate causes of thrombocytopenia. Medical records of 762 dogs with thrombocytopenia presented to seven referral hospitals from January 2017 to December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Cases were assigned into the following categories: pITP, infectious diseases, neoplasia, inflammatory/other immune-mediated disorders and miscellaneous causes. The prevalence of the different categories was estimated, and platelet concentrations were compared. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to investigate the utility of platelet concentration to differentiate between causes of thrombocytopenia. The most common disease category associated with thrombocytopenia was neoplasia (27.3%), followed by miscellaneous causes (26.9%), pITP (18.8%), inflammatory/immune-mediated disorders (14.4%) and infectious diseases (12.6%). Dogs with pITP had significantly lower platelet concentrations (median 8 × 10<sup>9</sup> /L, range: 0-70 × 10<sup>9</sup> /L) than dogs in the other four categories. Platelet concentration was useful for distinguishing pITP from other causes of thrombocytopenia (area under ROC curve = 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.87, 0.92), with a platelet concentration ≤12 × 10<sup>9</sup> /L being 60% sensitive and 90% specific. Severe thrombocytopenia was highly specific for a diagnosis of pITP, which was more prevalent in this UK population of thrombocytopenic dogs compared with previous epidemiological studies. Conversely, the proportion of dogs with infectious diseases was lower than in previous reports from other locations.",Veterinary medicine and science,2023-Jul,"Martín-Ambrosio Francés M, Seth M, Sharman M, Pollard D, Ortiz AL, Miller R, Natsiopoulos T, Walker D, Jones B, Hardwick J, Glanemann B, Garcia AS, Bacon J, Selgas AG",14,2045,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) based diagnostics that identify microbial nucleic acids in clinical samples (mNGS for pathogen identification or mNGSpi) may be a useful tool in addressing some of these challenges. Studies of mNGSpi in immunocompromised hosts have demonstrated that these diagnostics are capable of identifying causative organisms in a subset of patients for whom conventional testing has been negative. While these studies provide proof of concept for mNGSpi utility, they have a number of limitations, which make it difficult to confidently assess test performance and clinical impact based on current data. Future studies will likely feature larger cohort sizes and controlled interventional study designs that assess the impact of mNGSpi on clinical endpoints.

The generalized cure rate model is based on bounded cumulative hazard function, which is a non-mixture model, and is developed using a two-parameter Weibull distribution as the baseline distribution, to estimate the cure rate using maximum likelihood method and real data with R and STATA software. The results showed that the cure rate of tuberculosis (TB) patients was 26.3%, which was higher than that of TB patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; 23.1%). The non-parametric median survival time of TB patients was 51 months, while that of TB patients co-infected with HIV was 33 months. Moreover, no risk factors were associated with TB patients co-infected with HIV, while age was a significant risk factor for TB patients among the suspected risk factors considered. Furthermore, the bounded cumulative hazard function was extended to accommodate infectious diseases with co-infections by deriving an appropriate probability density function, determining the distribution, and using real data. Governments and related health authorities are also encouraged to take appropriate actions to combat infectious diseases with possible co-infections.",PloS one,2020-,"Balogun OS, Gao XZ, Jolayemi ET, Olaleye SA",4,1371,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34018336,Spillover of zoonotic pathogens: A review of reviews.,"Zoonotic spillover and subsequent disease emergence cause significant, long-lasting impacts on our social, economic, environmental and political systems. Identifying and averting spillover transmission is crucial for preventing outbreaks and mitigating infectious disease burdens. Investigating the processes that lead to spillover fundamentally involves interactions between animals, humans, pathogens and the environments they inhabit. Accordingly, it is recognized that transdisciplinary approaches provide a more holistic understanding of spillover phenomena. To characterize the discourse about spillover within and between disciplines, we conducted a review of review papers about spillover from multiple disciplines. We systematically searched and screened literature from several databases to identify a corpus of review papers from ten academic disciplines. We performed qualitative content analysis on text where authors described either a spillover pathway, or a conceptual gap in spillover theory. Cluster analysis of pathway data identified nine major spillover processes discussed in the review literature. We summarized the main features of each process, how different disciplines contributed to them, and identified specialist and generalist disciplines based on the breadth of processes they studied. Network analyses showed strong similarities between concepts reviewed by 'One Health' disciplines (e.g. Veterinary Science & Animal Health, Public Health & Medicine, Ecology & Evolution, Environmental Science), which had broad conceptual scope and were well-connected to other disciplines. By contrast, awas focused on processes that are relatively overlooked by other disciplines, especially those involving food behaviour and livestock husbandry practices. Virology and Cellular & Molecular Biology were narrower in scope, primarily focusing on concepts related to adaption and evolution of zoonotic viruses. Finally, we identified priority areas for future research into zoonotic spillover by studying the gap data.",Zoonoses and public health,2021-Sep,"Sánchez CA, Venkatachalam-Vaz J, Drake JM",3,2036,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33627706,Infectious disease outbreak prediction using media articles with machine learning models.,"When a newly emerging infectious disease breaks out in a country, it brings critical damage to both human health conditions and the national economy. For this reason, apprehending which disease will newly emerge, and preparing countermeasures for that disease, are required. Many different types of infectious diseases are emerging and threatening global human health conditions. For this reason, the detection of emerging infectious disease pattern is critical. However, as the epidemic spread of infectious disease occurs sporadically and rapidly, it is not easy to predict whether an infectious disease will emerge or not. Furthermore, accumulating data related to a specific infectious disease is not easy. For these reasons, finding useful data and building a prediction model with these data is required. The Internet press releases numerous articles every day that rapidly reflect currently pending issues. Thus, in this research, we accumulated Internet articles from Medisys that were related to infectious disease, to see if news data could be used to predict infectious disease outbreak. Articles related to infectious disease from January to December 2019 were collected. In this study, we evaluated if newly emerging infectious diseases could be detected using the news article data.

33960715,'It's our job': Constraints to investigation of atypical disease events-Opinions of Australian veterinarians.,"Frontline health practitioners need to be adequately prepared to recognize and respond to atypical disease presentations, some of which may have zoonotic potential. Data from previous research have suggested that veterinarians may face challenges in investigation of disease events due to time and money constraints. As part of an Australia-wide survey project, veterinarians were asked to answer an open-ended question regarding potential constraints in investigation of atypical disease events where there may be concern about a zoonosis or emerging infectious disease. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic content analysis with the consideration of the respondent's area of practice and level of experience. Five main themes were identified which encapsulated constraints to disease investigation described by participants, namely: (a) financing of disease investigations, including client willingness/ability to pay in absence of alternative government schemes; (b) client-related factors, including willingness to consent to investigation and comply with instructions; (c) professional preparedness to act, related to practitioner knowledge and technical competency; (d) workplace environment, impacted by physical, logistical and managerial aspects of workplaces; and (e) access to external technical support, primarily from government veterinary services. Successful investigation and management of atypical diseases, including potential zoonoses, requires preparedness of all veterinarians. Continuing professional education for veterinarians in infection prevention and control and biosecurity, alongside adequate government funding and support will help facilitate optimal health and biosecurity outcomes.

This study investigated trends in mortality and the economic burden of infectious diseases. Healthcare data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (2009-2019) and the Korean Statistics Information Service (1997-2019) were used. We selected 10 infectious disease groups (intestinal infections, tuberculosis, vaccine- preventable diseases, sepsis, viral hepatitis, HIV-related diseases, central nervous system infections, rheumatic heart diseases, respiratory tract infections, and arthropod-borne viral diseases). The age-standardized mortality rate for infectious diseases increased from 27.2 per 100,000 population in 1997 to 37.1 per 100,000 population in 2019 and has had an upward trend since 2004. During this same period, significant increases were seen in respiratory tract infections and among elderly persons, especially those aged ≥85 years. The costs for infectious diseases increased from 4.126 billion US dollar (USD) in 2009 to 6.612 billion USD in 2019, with respiratory tract infections accounting for 3.699 billion USD (69%). The annual cost per patient for visits for medical care due to infectious diseases increased from 131 USD in 2009 to 204 USD in 2019. Mortality among elderly persons and those with respiratory tract infections increased during the study period. The economic burden of infectious diseases has consistently increased, especially for respiratory tract infections. It is therefore essential to establish effective management policies that considers specific infectious diseases and patient groups.",Epidemiology and health,2022-,"Baik D, Kim BW, Ki M",3,1750,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Buprenorphine is safe and effective for OUD but remains underutilized. The prevalence and geographic distribution of ID physicians who are waivered to prescribe buprenorphine are unknown. This cross-sectional study merged data from several publicly available datasets from 1 November 2021 to 15 January 2022. Our primary outcome was the proportion of ID physicians possessing buprenorphine waivers in the United States. We identified individual- and county-level characteristics associated with buprenorphine waiver possession. We then used geospatial analysis to determine the geographic distribution of waivered ID physicians. We identified 6372 ID physicians in the United States, among whom 170 (2.7%) possessed waivers. Most ID physicians (97.3%) practiced in metropolitan counties. In our multivariable analysis, ID physicians had lower odds of having a waiver for every 10-year increase since graduating medical school (OR: .79; 95% CI: .68-.91). ID physicians practicing in counties with a higher proportion of uninsured residents had lower odds of having a waiver (OR: .75; 95% CI: .62-.90). Among counties with ≥1 ID physician (n = 729), only 11.2% had ≥1 waivered ID physician. We found an extremely low prevalence and skewed geographic distribution of ID physicians with buprenorphine waivers.

39231189,Prediction of infectious diseases using sentiment analysis on social media data.,"As the influence and risk of infectious diseases increase, efforts are being made to predict the number of confirmed infectious disease patients, but research involving the qualitative opinions of social media users is scarce. However, social data can change the psychology and behaviors of crowds through information dissemination, which can affect the spread of infectious diseases. Existing studies have used the number of confirmed cases and spatial data to predict the number of confirmed cases of infectious diseases. However, studies using opinions from social data that affect changes in human behavior in relation to the spread of infectious diseases are inadequate. Therefore, herein, we propose a new approach for sentiment analysis of social data by using opinion mining and to predict the number of confirmed cases of infectious diseases by using machine learning techniques. To build a sentiment dictionary specialized for predicting infectious diseases, we used Word2Vec to expand the existing sentiment dictionary and calculate the daily sentiment polarity by dividing it into positive and negative polarities from collected social data. Thereafter, we developed an algorithm to predict the number of confirmed infectious patients by using both positive and negative polarities with DNN, LSTM and GRU. The method proposed herein showed that the prediction results of the number of confirmed cases obtained using opinion mining were 1.12% and 3% better than those obtained without using opinion mining in LSTM and GRU model, and it is expected that social data will be used from a qualitative perspective for predicting the number of confirmed cases of infectious diseases.",PloS one,2024-,"Song Y, Yoon B",2,1688,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We report on the impact of COVID-19 on travel-related infectious diseases as recorded by EuroTravNet clinics. Travelers who presented between January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2021 were included. Comparisons were made between the pre-pandemic period (14 months from January 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020); and the pandemic period (19 months from March 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021). Of the 15,124 visits to the network during the 33-month observation period, 10,941 (72%) were during the pre-pandemic period, and 4183 (28%) during the pandemic period. Average monthly visits declined from 782/month (pre-COVID-19 era) to 220/month (COVID-19 pandemic era). Among non-migrants, the top-10 countries of exposure changed after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; destinations such as Italy and Austria, where COVID-19 exposure peaked in the first months, replaced typical travel destinations in Asia (Thailand, Indonesia, India). There was a small decline in migrant patients reported, with little change in the top countries of exposure (Bolivia, Mali). The three top diagnoses with the largest overall decreases in relative frequency were acute gastroenteritis (-5.3%), rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (-2.8%), and dengue (-2.6%).

Low- and middle-income countries bear the major burden of these infections due to inadequate hygiene and subpar laboratory facilities, making it challenging to monitor and detect infections in a timely manner. However, even developed countries are not immune to these diseases, as inadequate wastewater management and contaminated drinking water supplies can also contribute to disease outbreaks. Nucleic acid amplification tests have proven to be effective for early disease intervention and surveillance of both new and existing diseases. In recent years, paper-based diagnostic devices have made significant progress and become an essential tool in detecting and managing water-associated infectious diseases.

34214237,Mammal assemblage composition predicts global patterns in emerging infectious disease risk.,"As a source of emerging infectious diseases, wildlife assemblages (and related spatial patterns) must be quantitatively assessed to help identify high-risk locations. Previous assessments have largely focussed on the distributions of individual species; however, transmission dynamics are expected to depend on assemblage composition. Moreover, disease-diversity relationships have mainly been studied in the context of species loss, but assemblage composition and disease risk (e.g. infection prevalence in wildlife assemblages) can change without extinction. Based on the predicted distributions and abundances of 4466 mammal species, we estimated global patterns of disease risk through the calculation of the community-level basic reproductive ratio R0, an index of invasion potential, persistence, and maximum prevalence of a pathogen in a wildlife assemblage. For density-dependent diseases, we found that, in addition to tropical areas which are commonly viewed as infectious disease hotspots, northern temperate latitudes included high-risk areas. We also forecasted the effects of climate change and habitat loss from 2015 to 2035. Over this period, many local assemblages showed no net loss of species richness, but the assemblage composition (i.e. the mix of species and their abundances) changed considerably. Simultaneously, most areas experienced a decreased risk of density-dependent diseases but an increased risk of frequency-dependent diseases. We further explored the factors driving these changes in disease risk. Our results suggest that biodiversity and changes therein jointly influence disease risk. Understanding these changes and their drivers and ultimately identifying emerging infectious disease hotspots can help health officials prioritize resource distribution.",Global change biology,2021-Oct,"Wang YXG, Matson KD, Santini L, Visconti P, Hilbers JP, Huijbregts MAJ, Xu Y, Prins HHT, Allen T, Huang ZYX, de Boer WF",11,1793,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35389523,Great ape health watch: Enhancing surveillance for emerging infectious diseases in great apes.,"Infectious diseases have the potential to extirpate populations of great apes. As the interface between humans and great apes expands, zoonoses pose an increasingly severe threat to already endangered great ape populations. Despite recognition of the threat posed by human pathogens to great apes, health monitoring is only conducted for a small fraction of the world's wild great apes (and mostly those that are habituated) meaning that outbreaks of disease often go unrecognized and therefore unmitigated. This lack of surveillance (even in sites where capacity to conduct surveillance is present) is the most significant limiting factor in our ability to quickly detect and respond to emerging infectious diseases in great apes when they first appear. Accordingly, we must create a surveillance system that links disease outbreaks in humans and great apes in time and space, and enables veterinarians, clinicians, conservation managers, national decision makers, and the global health community to respond quickly to these events. Here, we review existing great ape health surveillance programs in African range habitats to identify successes, gaps, and challenges. We use these findings to argue that standardization of surveillance across sites and geographic scales, that monitors primate health in real-time and generates early warnings of disease outbreaks, is an efficient, low-cost step to conserve great ape populations. Such a surveillance program, which we call ""Great Ape Health Watch"" would lead to long-term improvements in outbreak preparedness, prevention, detection, and response, while generating valuable data for epidemiological research and sustainable conservation planning. Standardized monitoring of great apes would also make it easier to integrate with human surveillance activities. This approach would empower local stakeholders to link wildlife and human health, allowing for near real-time, bidirectional surveillance at the great ape-human interface.",American journal of primatology,2022-May,"Zimmerman DM, Mitchell SL, Wolf TM, Deere JR, Noheri JB, Takahashi E, Cranfield MR, Travis DA, Hassell JM",9,1983,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32933375,Transient indicators of tipping points in infectious diseases.,"The majority of known early warning indicators of critical transitions rely on asymptotic resilience and critical slowing down. In continuous systems, critical slowing down is mathematically described by a decrease in magnitude of the dominant eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix on the approach to a critical transition. Here, we show that measures of transient dynamics, specifically, reactivity and the maximum of the amplification envelope, also change systematically as a bifurcation is approached in an important class of models for epidemics of infectious diseases. Furthermore, we introduce indicators designed to detect trends in these measures and find that they reliably classify time series of case notifications simulated from stochastic models according to levels of vaccine uptake.

36430676,ILCs-Crucial Players in Enteric Infectious Diseases.,"Research of the last decade has remarkably increased our understanding of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). ILCs, in analogy to T helper (Th) cells and their cytokine and transcription factor profile, are categorized into three distinct populations: ILC1s express the transcription factor T-bet and secrete IFNγ, ILC2s depend on the expression of GATA-3 and release IL-5 and IL-13, and ILC3s express RORγt and secrete IL-17 and IL-22. Noteworthy, ILCs maintain a level of plasticity, depending on exposed cytokines and environmental stimuli. Furthermore, ILCs are tissue resident cells primarily localized at common entry points for pathogens such as the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They have the unique capacity to initiate rapid responses against pathogens, provoked by changes of the cytokine profile of the respective tissue. Moreover, they regulate tissue inflammation and homeostasis. In case of intracellular pathogens entering the mucosal tissue, ILC1s respond by secreting cytokines (e.g., IFNγ) to limit the pathogen spread. Upon infection with helminths, intestinal epithelial cells produce alarmins (e.g., IL-25) and activate ILC2s to secrete IL-13, which induces differentiation of intestinal stem cells into tuft and goblet cells, important for parasite expulsion. Additionally, during bacterial infection ILC3-derived IL-22 is required for bacterial clearance by regulating antimicrobial gene expression in epithelial cells. Thus, ILCs can limit infectious diseases via secretion of inflammatory mediators and interaction with other cell types. In this review, we will address the role of ILCs during enteric infectious diseases.",International journal of molecular sciences,2022-Nov,"Leupold T, Wirtz S",2,1651,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39191837,Exploring the determinants of under-five mortality and morbidity from infectious diseases in Cambodia-a traditional and machine learning approach.,"Cambodia has made progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and burden of infectious diseases among children over the last decades. However the determinants of child mortality and morbidity in Cambodia is not well understood, and no recent analysis has been conducted to investigate possible determinants. We applied a multivariable logistical regression model and a conditional random forest to explore possible determinants of under-five mortality and under-five child morbidity from infectious diseases using the most recent Demographic Health Survey in 2021-2022. Our findings show that the majority (58%) of under-five deaths occurred during the neonatal period. Contraceptive use of the mother led to lower odds of under-five mortality (0.51 [95% CI 0.32-0.80], p-value 0.003), while being born fourth or later was associated with increased odds (3.25 [95% CI 1.09-9.66], p-value 0.034). Improved household water source and higher household wealth quintile was associated with lower odds of infectious disease while living in the Great Lake or Coastal region led to increased odds respectively. The odds ratios were consistent with the results from the conditional random forest. The study showcases how closely related child mortality and morbidity due to infectious disease are to broader social development in Cambodia and the importance of accelerating progress in many sectors to end preventable child mortality and morbidity.",Scientific reports,2024-Aug,"Helldén D, Sok S, Nordenstam A, Orsini N, Nordenstedt H, Alfvén T",6,1446,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

While there is an extensive body of literature surrounding cardiac infections including endocarditis, this is less so the case for other endovascular infections. The objective of this narrative review is to summarize the epidemiology, clinical features, and selected management of severe vascular infections exclusive of those involving the heart. Endovascular infections may involve either the arterial or venous vasculature and may arise in native vessels or secondary to implanted devices. Management is complex and requires multi-disciplinary involvement from the outset. Infective arteritis or device-related arterial infection involves removal of the infected tissue or device. In cases where complete excision is not possible, prolonged courses of antimicrobials are required. Serious infections associated with the venous system include septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular and other deep veins, and intracranial/venous sinuses. Source control is of paramount importance in these cases with adjunctive antimicrobial therapy. The role of anticoagulation is controversial although recommended in the absence of contraindications. An improved understanding of the management of these infections, and thus improved patient outcomes, requires multi-center, international collaboration.",Intensive care medicine,2020-Feb,"Denny KJ, Kumar A, Timsit JF, Laupland KB",4,1378,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

As a critical element, the receptor determines the selectivity, stability, and accuracy of the electrochemical biosensors. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and surface imprinted polymers (SIPs) have great potential to be robust artificial receptors. Therefore, extensive studies have been reported to develop MIPs/SIPs for the detection of infectious diseases with high selectivity and reliability. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of recognition events between imprinted polymers with different biomarkers, such as signaling molecules, microbial toxins, viruses, and bacterial and fungal cells. Then, various preparation methods of MIPs/SIPs for electrochemical biosensors are summarized. Especially, the methods of electropolymerization and micro-contact imprinting are emphasized. Furthermore, applications of MIPs/SIPs based electrochemical biosensors for infectious disease detection are highlighted.

39024833,Multiple antimicrobial and immune-modulating activities of cysteamine in infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases are a major threat to global health and cause millions of deaths every year, particularly in developing countries. The emergence of multidrug resistance challenges current antimicrobial treatments, inducing uncertainty in therapeutic protocols. New compounds are therefore necessary. A drug repurposing approach could play a critical role in developing new treatments used either alone or in combination with standard therapy regimens. Herein, we focused on cysteamine, an aminothiol endogenously synthesized by human cells during the degradation of coenzyme-A, which is a drug approved for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis. Cysteamine influences many biological processes due to the presence of the highly reactive thiol group. This review provides an overview of cysteamine-mediated effects on different viruses, bacteria and parasites, with a particular focus on infections caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Overcrowded refugee camps with poor sanitation and limited resources have fueled outbreaks, exacerbated by disrupted immunization programs and seasonal rains. Malaria is spreading rapidly due to inadequate mosquito control, while cholera outbreaks, linked to unsafe water and poor sanitation, have overwhelmed health facilities. Measles outbreaks are escalating due to low vaccination coverage, leaving vulnerable populations unprotected. The regional and global impacts are significant, as displaced populations crossing borders risk spreading diseases. Addressing this crisis requires urgent international collaboration to restore healthcare services, improve living conditions in camps, resume vaccination programs, and strengthen regional disease surveillance. Timely, coordinated responses are essential to mitigate health risks and protect global health security.

37291522,Constructing an emergency preparedness evaluation index system for public use during major emerging infectious disease outbreaks: a Delphi study.,"The major emerging infectious diseases (MEIDs) have occurred frequently and become increasingly serious in the world. Sufficient personal emergency preparedness is critical for the general people in efficiently responding to and recovering from MEIDs. Nevertheless, few specific indicators are available for assessing the individual emergency preparedness of the general public during these periods. Therefore, the aim of this study was to construct an index system for comprehensively evaluating the personal emergency preparedness of the public regarding MEIDs. Based on the global national-level emergency preparedness index framework and a literature review, a preliminary index system was constructed. From June 2022 to September 2022, a panel of 20 experts from nine provinces and municipalities across multiple research areas participated in this Delphi study. They rated the importance of pre-defined indicators using a five-point Likert scale and provided their qualitative comments. According to the feedback of each round of experts, the indicators of the evaluation index system were revised. After two rounds of expert consultation the evaluation index system reached a consensus, containing five first-level indicators, cooperating with prevention and control work, improving emergency response capacity, securing supplies and equipment, preparing economic resources, maintaining physical and mental health with affiliated 20 s-level indicators and 53 third-level indicators. The expert authority coefficient of consultation was 0.88 and 0.90. The Kendall's coefficient of concordance of expert consultations was 0.294 and 0.322, respectively. The differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). A valid, reliable and scientific evaluation index system was established. This personal emergency preparedness index system, as a precursor form, will further lay the foundation for the formation of an assessment instrument. At the same time, it could provide a reference for future education and training of emergency preparedness for the general public.",BMC public health,2023-Jun,"Wei W, Liu Y, Zhou N, Tian M, Xie L, Watson R, Dai F, Chen Y, Hu W",9,2072,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Through simulation study using a Julia language software package, Pathogen.jl, we explore the models with respect to their ability to jointly infer latent event times, latent disease transmission networks, and the TN-ILM parameters. We find good parameter, event time, and transmission network inference, with enhanced performance for inference of transmission networks in epidemic simulations that have higher spatial signals in their infectivity kernel.

32628658,Winter is coming: Pathogen emergence in seasonal environments.,"Many infectious diseases exhibit seasonal dynamics driven by periodic fluctuations of the environment. Predicting the risk of pathogen emergence at different points in time is key for the development of effective public health strategies. Here we study the impact of seasonality on the probability of emergence of directly transmitted pathogens under different epidemiological scenarios. We show that when the period of the fluctuation is large relative to the duration of the infection, the probability of emergence varies dramatically with the time at which the pathogen is introduced in the host population. In particular, we identify a new effect of seasonality (the winter is coming effect) where the probability of emergence is vanishingly small even though pathogen transmission is high. We use this theoretical framework to compare the impact of different preventive control strategies on the average probability of emergence. We show that, when pathogen eradication is not attainable, the optimal strategy is to act intensively in a narrow time interval. Interestingly, the optimal control strategy is not always the strategy minimizing R0, the basic reproduction ratio of the pathogen. This theoretical framework is extended to study the probability of emergence of vector borne diseases in seasonal environments and we show how it can be used to improve risk maps of Zika virus emergence.",PLoS computational biology,2020-Jul,"Carmona P, Gandon S",2,1399,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This work presents a hybrid machine-learning model that could predict the validity of the infectious disease's news spread on the media. The proposed hybrid machine learning (ML) model uses the Dynamic Classifier Selection (DCS) process to validate news. Several machine learning models, such as K-Neighbors-Neighbor (KNN), AdaBoost (AB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), SVC, Gaussian Naïve Base (GNB), and Logistic Regression (LR) are tested in the simulation process on benchmark dataset. The simulation employs three DCS process methods: overall Local Accuracy (OLA), Meta Dynamic ensemble selection (META-DES), and Bagging. From seven ML classifiers, the AdaBoost with Bagging DCS method got a 97.45% high accuracy rate for training samples and a 97.56% high accuracy rate for testing samples. The second high accuracy was obtained at 96.12% for training and 96.45% for testing samples from AdaBoost with the Meta-DES method. Overall, the AdaBoost with Bagging model obtained higher accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity rate with minimum FPR and FNR for validation.",Microscopy research and technique,2023-May,Bahaj SA,1,1271,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34734569,Emerging infectious diseases of amphibians in Poland: distribution and environmental drivers.,"Emerging infectious diseases are a threat to biodiversity and have taken a large toll on amphibian populations worldwide. The chytrid fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and B. salamandrivorans (Bsal), and the iridovirus Ranavirus (Rv), are of concern as all have contributed to amphibian declines. In central and eastern Europe, their geographical and host distributions and main environmental drivers determining prevalence are poorly known. We screened over 1000 amphibians from natural and captive populations in Poland for the presence of Bd, Bsal and Rv. In wild amphibian populations, we found that Bd is widespread, present in 46 out of 115 sampled localities as well as 2 captive colonies, and relatively common with overall prevalence at 14.4% in 9 species. We found lower prevalence of Rv at 2.4%, present in 11 out of 92 sampling sites, with a taxonomic breadth of 8 different amphibian species. Bsal infection was not detected in any individuals. In natural populations, Pelophylax esculentus and Bombina variegata accounted for 75% of all Bd infections, suggesting a major role for these 2 species as pathogen reservoirs in Central European freshwater habitats. General linear models showed that climatic as well as landscape features are associated with Bd infection in Poland. We found that higher average annual temperature constrains Bd infection, while landscapes with numerous water bodies or artificial elements (a surrogate for urbanization) increase the chances of infection. Our results show that a combination of climatic and landscape variables may drive regional and local pathogen emergence.",Diseases of aquatic organisms,2021-Nov,"Palomar G, Jakóbik J, Bosch J, Kolenda K, Kaczmarski M, Jośko P, Roces-Díaz JV, Stachyra P, Thumsová B, Zieliński P, Pabijan M",11,1625,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Mathematical modelling is a useful tool to better understand these diseases and to plan prevention and interventions. In this article, discrete-time binomial chain models, which are used for modelling the transmission of infectious diseases, have been extended by the addition of a spatial component. The spatial component is included in the function which represents the number of contacts that an individual makes. The spatio-stochastic model is derived to form three cases to match different modelling scenarios, namely: a model with only local transmission, a model with interaction between spatial units but no migration, and a model with interaction and migration between spatial units. Simulations are then used to compare the different models. The spatio-stochastic model is also demonstrated with an application to measles data. From this study, it can be seen that the type of model and inclusion of a spatial component plays an important role in the transmission of infectious diseases. The importance of choosing a model which best represents the dynamics and circumstances of an infectious disease is highlighted. The models presented in this paper allows flexibility which accommodate for a wide range of modelling cases.",Journal of theoretical biology,2022-Jan,Manjoo-Docrat R,1,1344,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

These include user applicability, utility of IT features but also stable financial support. Funding closely intertwines with implementations in terms of geographical reach, disease focus, and sustainability. However, the practice of evidence sharing on geographical and disease coverage, costs, and funding sources for improving the implementation of these systems on the continent is unclear. To analyse the key characteristics and availability of evidence for implementing digital infectious disease surveillance systems in Africa namely their disease focus, geographical reach, cost reporting, and external funding support. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature for the period 2003 to 2022 (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022300849). We searched five databases (PubMed, MEDLINE over Ovid, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) and websites of WHO, Africa CDC, and public health institutes of African countries. We mapped the distribution of projects by country; identified reported implementation cost components; categorised the availability of data on cost components; and identified supporting funding institutions outside Africa. A total of 29 reports from 2,033 search results were eligible for analysis. We identified 27 projects implemented in 13 countries, across 32 sites. Of these, 24 (75%) were pilot projects with a median duration of 16 months, (IQR: 5-40). Of the 27 projects, 5 (19%) were implemented for HIV/AIDs and tuberculosis, 4 (15%) for malaria, 4 (15%) for all notifiable diseases, and 4 (15%) for One Health.

33395431,The winding road to health: A systematic scoping review on the effect of geographical accessibility to health care on infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries.,"Geographical accessibility to healthcare is an important component of infectious disease dynamics. Timely access to health facilities can prevent disease progression and enables disease notification through surveillance systems. The importance of accounting for physical accessibility in response to infectious diseases is increasingly recognized. Yet, there is no comprehensive review of the literature available on infectious diseases in relation to geographical accessibility to care. Therefore, we aimed at evaluating the current state of knowledge on the effect of geographical accessibility to health care on infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries. A search strategy was developed and conducted on Web of Science and PubMed on 4 March 2019. New publications were checked until May 28, 2020. All publication dates were eligible. Data was charted into a tabular format and descriptive data analyses were carried out to identify geographical regions, infectious diseases, and measures of physical accessibility among other factors. Search queries in PubMed and Web of Science yielded 560 unique publications. After title and abstract screening 99 articles were read in full detail, from which 64 articles were selected, including 10 manually. Results of the included publications could be broadly categorized into three groups: (1) decreased spatial accessibility to health care was associated with a higher infectious disease burden, (2) decreased accessibility was associated to lower disease reporting, minimizing true understanding of disease distribution, and (3) the occurrence of an infectious disease outbreak negatively impacted health care accessibility in affected regions. In the majority of studies, poor geographical accessibility to health care was associated with higher disease incidence, more severe health outcomes, higher mortality, and lower disease reporting. No difference was seen between countries or infectious diseases. Currently, policy-makers and scientists rely on data collected through passive surveillance systems, introducing uncertainty on disease estimates for remote communities. Our results highlight the need for increasing integration of geographical accessibility measures in disease risk modelling, allowing more realistic disease estimates and enhancing our understanding of true disease burden. Additionally, disease risk estimates could be used in turn to optimize the allocation of health services in the prevention and detection of infectious diseases.",PloS one,2021-,"Hierink F, Okiro EA, Flahault A, Ray N",4,2519,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

34637486,A retrospective observational study of the impact of 16s and 18s ribosomal RNA PCR on antimicrobial treatment over seven years: A tertiary hospital experience.,"Although culture-based methods remain a staple element of microbiology analysis, advanced molecular methods increasingly supplement the testing repertoire. Since the advent of 16s and 18s ribosomal RNA PCR in the 2000s, there has been interest in its utility for pathogen detection. Nonetheless, studies assessing the impact on antimicrobial prescribing are limited. We report a single-centre experience of the influence of 16s and 18s PCR testing on antimicrobial treatment, including a cost-analysis. Data were collected retrospectively for all samples sent for 16s and 18s PCR testing between January 2014 and December 2020. Results were compared to any culture-based result. Assessment focused on any change of antimicrobial treatment based on PCR result, or use of the result as supportive evidence for microbiological diagnosis. 310 samples relevant to 268 patients were referred for 16s/18s rRNA PCR testing during the period. Culture was performed for 234 samples. Enrichment culture was performed for 83 samples. 82 of 300 samples sent for 16s PCR had positive results (20.8%). When culture was performed, enrichment reduced the outcome of 16s PCR only positive results (4/36 [11.1%] versus 14/35 [40.0%], p = 0.030 where a pathogen found). 18s PCR yielded 9 positive results from 67 samples. The 16s PCR result influenced antimicrobial change for 6 patients (2.2%). We estimated the cost for 16s PCR testing to result in one significant change in antimicrobial therapy to be €3,340. 18s PCR did not alter antimicrobial treatment. There was limited impact of 16s PCR results on antimicrobial treatments. Relevance to practice was affected by relatively long turn-around-time for results. Utility may be increased in specialised surgical centres, or by reducing turn-around-time. Enrichment culture should be considered on samples where 16s PCR is requested.

The CD36-specific ligands are involved in regulating the immune response during infectious and non-infectious diseases in the host. The role of CD36 in regulating the innate immune response during Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, Malaria, Leishmaniasis, HIV, and Sepsis in a ligand- mediated fashion. Apart from infectious diseases, it is also considered to be involved in metabolic disorders such as Atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's, cancer, and Diabetes. The ligand binding to scavenger receptor modulates the CD36 down-stream innate immune response, and it can be exploited to design suitable immuno-modulators.

The causes of death were massive postoperative bleeding (1 case) and sepsis (3 cases). Pneumonectomy for benign disease is a high-risk procedure performed for a variety of indications. While morbidity is often significant, once the perioperative risk has passed, the one-year survival rate can be very satisfying in selected patients with benign disease.","Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",2023-,"D'Ambrosio PD, Mariani AW, Júnior ER, de Medeiros IL, Oliveira LCS, Neto AG, Terra RM, Pêgo-Fernandes PM",8,1607,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39680617,Climate change and Vibrio vulnificus dynamics: A blueprint for infectious diseases.,"Climate change is having increasingly profound effects on human health, notably those associated with the occurrence, distribution, and transmission of infectious diseases. The number of disparate ecological parameters and pathogens affected by climate change are vast and expansive. Disentangling the complex relationship between these variables is critical for the development of effective countermeasures against its effects. The pathogen Vibrio vulnificus, a naturally occurring aquatic bacterium that causes fulminant septicemia, represents a quintessential climate-sensitive organism. In this review, we use V. vulnificus as a model organism to elucidate the intricate network of interactions between climatic factors and pathogens, with the objective of identifying common patterns by which climate change is affecting their disease burden. Recent findings indicate that in regions native to V. vulnificus or related pathogens, climate-driven natural disasters are the chief contributors to their disease outbreaks. Concurrently, climate change is increasing the environmental suitability of areas non-endemic to their diseases, promoting a surge in their natural populations and transmission dynamics, thus elevating the risk of new outbreaks. We highlight potential risk factors and climatic drivers aggravating the threat of V. vulnificus transmission under both scenarios and propose potential measures for mitigating its impact. By defining the mechanisms by which climate change influences V. vulnificus disease burden, we aim to shed light on the transmission dynamics of related disease-causing agents, thereby laying the groundwork for early warning systems and broadly applicable control measures.",PLoS pathogens,2024-Dec,"Jayakumar JM, Martinez-Urtaza J, Brumfield KD, Jutla AS, Colwell RR, Cordero OX, Almagro-Moreno S",7,1714,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39463118,Challenges and Strategies for Controlling Indonesia's Emerging and Re-Emerging Infection Diseases (EID-REIDs).,"This review aims to highlight the occurrences of several emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, particularly 13 types under surveillance of Indonesia's emerging contagious disease task force. These diseases are considered potentially epidemic, due to the nature of tropical climate and high humidity of Indonesia's area. Several factors contribute to the emergence of these diseases: in conjunction with human behavior. Most of these diseases are zoonotic, specifically spread by viruses. The latest emerging infectious disease in Indonesia is monkeypox. Controlling the management of EID-REIDs presents a major obstacle for international health initiatives, particularly in Indonesia because of its extensive population, varied geographical landscape, and constrained resources. Overcoming these obstacles demands tactics like prioritizing Indonesian policies, bolstering disease monitoring systems, upgrading diagnostic capacities, fortifying public health facilities, fostering community involvement and education, and executing efficient prevention and management protocols. These strategies should be implemented in collaboration with international partners and organizations to effectively control and prevent the spread of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases in Indonesia.",Acta medica Indonesiana,2024-Jul,"Triyono EA, Arini M, Asmarawati TP, Wirantara H, Tan F",5,1295,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

These biosensors allow for the detection of target analytes at ultra-low concentrations, which is mandatory for early disease diagnosis. Nanostructure-decorated platforms have been demonstrated to enhance the analytical performance of electrochemical biosensors. In addition, glycans anchored to electrode platforms as bioreceptors exhibit high specificity toward biomarker detection. Both attributes offer a synergy that allows ultrasensitive detection of molecular targets of clinical interest. In this context, we review recent advances in electrochemical glycobiosensors for detecting infectious diseases and cancer biomarkers focused on colorectal cancer. We also describe general aspects of structural glycobiology, definitions, and classification of electrochemical biosensors and discuss relevant works on electrochemical glycobiosensors in the last ten years. Finally, we summarize the advances in electrochemical glycobiosensors and comment on some challenges and limitations needed to advance toward real clinical applications of these devices.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2022-Dec,"Echeverri D, Orozco J",2,1247,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The HCT procedure is complex, dynamic, and a high risk for infectious complications. Therefore, there is an important role for an ID and AMS pharmacist to collaborate with the primary treating team, with ongoing care, involving the optimal individual patient prophylactic, pre-emptive and treatment management of infections in this high-risk population. This review highlights key factors for consideration of ID/AMS Pharmacists in relation to HCT, including important aspects in the evaluation of infection risk prior to transplant, risk from donor sources, length of, and changes in immunosuppression, and potential drug-drug interactions from other essential supportive care therapies.",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,2023-Nov,"Weerdenburg H, Lindsay J",2,1048,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33393066,CRISPR-based strategies in infectious disease diagnosis and therapy.,"CRISPR gene-editing technology has the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases, but most clinicians are unaware of its broad applicability. Derived from an ancient microbial defence system, these so-called ""molecular scissors"" enable precise gene editing with a low error rate. However, CRISPR systems can also be targeted against pathogenic DNA or RNA sequences. This potential is being combined with innovative delivery systems to develop new therapeutic approaches to infectious diseases. We searched Pubmed and Google Scholar for CRISPR-based strategies in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. Reference lists were reviewed and synthesized for narrative review. CRISPR-based strategies represent a novel approach to many challenging infectious diseases. CRISPR technologies can be harnessed to create rapid, low-cost diagnostic systems, as well as to identify drug-resistance genes. Therapeutic strategies, such as CRISPR systems that cleave integrated viral genomes or that target resistant bacteria, are in development. CRISPR-based therapies for emerging viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, have also been proposed. Finally, CRISPR systems can be used to reprogram human B cells to produce neutralizing antibodies. The risks of CRISPR-based therapies include off-target and on-target modifications. Strategies to control these risks are being developed and a phase 1 clinical trials of CRISPR-based therapies for cancer and monogenic diseases are already underway.

The current state of the art for rapid detection of infectious diseases and their clinical applications and challenges were discussed. Label-free electroanalytical methods are probably the most promising means to achieve this. We are currently in the early stages of the emerging technology of using label-free electrochemistry of proteins to develop biosensors. To date, antibody-based biosensors have been intensively developed, although many improvements in reproducibility and sensitivity are still needed. Moreover, there is no doubt that a growing number of aptamers and hopefully label-free biosensors based on nanomaterials will soon be used for disease diagnosis and therapy monitoring.

36345644,Time to address quality control processes applied to antibody testing for infectious diseases.,"As testing for infectious diseases moves from manual, biological testing such as complement fixation to high throughput automated autoanalyzer, the methods for controlling these assays have also changed to reflect those used in clinical chemistry. However, there are many differences between infectious disease serology and clinical chemistry testing, and these differences have not been considered when applying traditional quality control methods to serology. Infectious disease serology, which is highly regulated, detects antibodies of varying classes and to multiple and different antigens that change according to the organisms' genotype/serotype and stage of disease. Although the tests report a numerical value (usually signal to cut-off), they are not measuring an amount of antibodies, but the intensity of binding within the test system. All serology assays experience lot-to-lot variation, making the use of quality control methods used in clinical chemistry inappropriate. In many jurisdictions, the use of the manufacturer-provided kit controls is mandatory to validate the test run. Use of third-party controls, which are highly recommended by ISO 15189 and the World Health Organization, must be manufactured in a manner whereby they have minimal lot-to-lot variation and at a level where they detect exceptional variation.

The study of this joint dynamics presents formidable mathematical challenges due to a limited number of hospital beds. We have derived the invasion reproduction number, which investigates the potential of a newly emerged infectious disease to persist when some infectious diseases are already invaded the host population. We have shown that the proposed system exhibits transcritical, saddle-node, Hopf, and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations under certain conditions. We have also shown that the total number of infected individuals may increase if the fraction of the total number of hospital beds is not properly allotted to the existing and a newly emerged infectious disease.

32048110,Are infectious diseases risk factors for sarcoidosis or a result of reverse causation? Findings from a population-based nested case-control study.,"Findings from molecular studies suggesting that several infectious agents cause sarcoidosis are intriguing yet conflicting and likely biased due to their cross-sectional design. As done in other inflammatory diseases to overcome this issue, prospectively-collected register data could be used, but reverse causation is a threat when the onset of disease is difficult to establish. We investigated the association between infectious diseases and sarcoidosis to understand if they are etiologically related. We conducted a nested case-control study (2009-2013) using incident sarcoidosis cases from the Swedish National Patient Register (n = 4075) and matched general population controls (n = 40,688). Infectious disease was defined using inpatient/outpatient visits and/or antimicrobial dispensations starting 3 years before diagnosis/matching. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of sarcoidosis were estimated using conditional logistic regression and tested for robustness assuming the presence of reverse causation bias. The aOR of sarcoidosis associated with history of infectious disease was 1.19 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09, 1.29; 21% vs. 16% exposed cases and controls, respectively). Upper respiratory and ocular infections conferred the highest OR. Findings were similar when we altered the infection definition or varied the infection-sarcoidosis latency period (1-7 years). In bias analyses assuming one in 10 infections occurred because of preclinical sarcoidosis, the observed association was completely attenuated (aOR 1.02; 95% CI 0.90, 1.15). Our findings, likely induced by reverse causation due to preclinical sarcoidosis, do not support the hypothesis that common symptomatic infectious diseases are etiologically linked to sarcoidosis. Caution for reverse causation bias is required when the real disease onset is unknown.",European journal of epidemiology,2020-Nov,"Rossides M, Kullberg S, Askling J, Eklund A, Grunewald J, Di Giuseppe D, Arkema EV",7,1839,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

However, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the comparative treatment that persons who are homeless receive. This study seeks to describe this potential difference in treatment, including diagnostic services tested, procedures performed and medications prescribed. This study used a retrospective, cohort study design to analyse data from the 2007-2010 United States National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey database, specifically looking at the emergency department subset. Complex sample logistic regression analysis was used to compare variables, including diagnostic services, procedures and medication classes prescribed between homeless and private residence individuals seeking emergency department treatment for infectious diseases. Findings were then adjusted for potential confounding variables. Compared with private residence individuals, persons who are homeless and presenting with an infectious disease were more likely (adjusted OR: 10.99, CI 1.08 to 111.40, p<0.05) to receive sutures or staples and less likely (adjusted OR: 0.29, CI 0.10 to 0.87, p<0.05) to be provided medications when presenting with an infectious disease in US emergency departments. Significant differences were also detected in prescribing habits of multiple anti-infective medication classes. This study detected a significant difference in suturing/stapling and medication prescribing patterns for persons who are homeless with an infectious disease in US emergency departments. While some findings can likely be explained by the prevalence of specific infectious organisms in homeless populations, other findings would benefit from further research.",Journal of epidemiology and community health,2024-Nov,"Barnes J, Segars L, Wasserman JA, Karabon P, Taylor TAH",5,1852,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

38273726,The Prevalence of and Responses to Infectious Diseases in No Sangchu Ilgi.,"This paper examines the patterns of infectious diseases during the Joseon dynasty in the 18th and 19th centuries, as described in No Sangchu Ilgi (the diaries of No Sangchu) and the responses of No Sangchu and his family. During this period, infectious diseases such as smallpox and measles were prevalent. No Sangchu's diaries detailed accounts related to his family and hometown. For example, the diaries show that the infection rate was high among young children, such as No's younger siblings and nephews. The process of nursing them is meticulously documented. To address infectious diseases, No sought medical assistance by meeting with doctors or visiting pharmacies for prescribed remedies. Additionally, he and his family would relocate to temples or relatives' homes to avoid areas with severe outbreaks. When engaged in official duties, updates about his family and hometown were received through letters, and the diary primarily focused on the circumstances at his workplace. In 1799, while working in the central government, No encountered a large-scale outbreak of infectious diseases. He extensively documented the resulting damage, including the loss of his own family members. An examination of his diaries not only reveals No Sangchu's individual responses but also sheds light on the state's efforts to maintain a relief system. In summary, No Sangchu Ilgi provides detailed records of infectious diseases directly related to household well-being and the state's to infectious diseases, making it a valuable source for understanding the experience of infectious diseases in the late Joseon period.",Ui sahak,2023-Dec,Im H,1,1616,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Little is known about the hazards and manifestations of infectious disease (ID) events occurring in kidney transplant recipients with HIV. Using linked information collected in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) and the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS), we described in-depth demographical and clinical characteristics of PWH who received a K-Tx since 2008. Further, we performed recurrent time to event analyses to understand whether HIV was an independent risk factor for ID events. Overall, 24 PWH with 57 ID events were included in this study (100% match of SHCS to STCS). Of these, 17 (70.8%) patients had at least one ID event: 22 (38.6%) viral (HIV not counted), 18 (31.6%) bacterial, one (1.8%) fungal and 16 (28.1%) probable infections. Most ID events affected the respiratory tract (25, 37.3%) or the urinary tract (13, 19.4%). Pathogen types and infection sites were similar in PWH and a matched control group of HIV-uninfected patients. HIV was not an independent risk factor for ID events (adjusted hazard ratio 0.94, p = 0.9).

However, body temperature varies over the course of a day and across individual characteristics; such variation may limit the detection of febrile episodes complicating the diagnostic process. Our objective was to describe individual variation in diurnal temperature patterns during episodes of febrile activity using millions of recorded temperatures and evaluate the probability of recording a fever by sex and for different age groups. We use timestamped deidentified temperature readings from thermometers across the US to construct illness episodes where continuous periods of activity in a single user included a febrile reading. We model the mean temperature recorded and probability of registering a fever across the course of a day using sinusoidal regression models while accounting for user age and sex. We then estimate the probability of recording a fever by time of day for children, working-age adults, and older adults. We find wide variation in body temperatures over the course of a day and across individual characteristics. The diurnal temperature pattern differed between men and women, and average temperatures declined for older age groups. The likelihood of detecting a fever varied widely by the time of day and by an individual's age or sex. Time of day and demographics should be considered when using body temperatures for diagnostic or screening purposes.

We investigated the epidemiology of 36 communicable diseases during 2015-2021 in Japan and compared the number of cases in each disease between the prepandemic (2015-2019) and intrapandemic (2020-2021) periods. Relationships between the incidence of the infectious diseases and the COVID-19 pandemic were also investigated. Of 36 communicable diseases, the number of cases in the 27 diseases (75%) mainly caused by pathogens transmitted by droplet or contact was lower intrapandemic than prepandemic, and the cases of 21 diseases (58%) continued to decrease intrapandemic. The number of cases of six diseases (17%) was higher intrapandemic than prepandemic, and the cases of two diseases (5.6%), Japanese spotted fever and syphilis, continued to increase intrapandemic. Time trend analyses revealed a positive correlation between case numbers of communicable diseases and the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the case numbers of hand-foot-and-mouth disease and respiratory syncytial virus infection rebounded in 2021 after decreasing in 2020.

This narrative review aims to describe some characteristics, including health risks, of the more well-known and frequently undertaken ones. A literature search was conducted using keywords related to the characteristics (frequency of occurrence, duration, calendar period, reasons behind their undertaking and the common health risks) of Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and Jewish religious MGs. About 600 million trips are undertaken to religious sites annually. The characteristics vary between religions and between pilgrimages. However, religious MGs share common health risks, but these are reported in a heterogenous manner. European Christian pilgrimages reported both communicable diseases, such as norovirus outbreaks linked to the Marian Shrine of Lourdes in France, and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). NCDs predominated at the Catholic pilgrimage to the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico, which documented 11 million attendees in 1 week. The Zion Christian Church Easter gathering in South Africa, attended by ~10 million pilgrims, reported mostly motor vehicle accidents. Muslim pilgrimages such as the Arbaeen (20 million pilgrims) and Hajj documented a high incidence of respiratory tract infections, up to 80% during Hajj. Heat injuries and stampedes have been associated with Hajj. The Hindu Kumbh Mela pilgrimage, which attracted 100 million pilgrims in 2013, documented respiratory conditions in 70% of consultations. A deadly stampede occurred at the 2021 Jewish Lag BaOmer MG. Communicable and NCD differ among the different religious MGs. Gaps exists in the surveillance, reporting and data accessibility of health risks associated with religious MGs.

31996099,Game theoretic modelling of infectious disease dynamics and intervention methods: a review.,"We review research studies which use game theory to model the decision-making of individuals during an epidemic, attempting to classify the literature and identify the emerging trends in this field. The literature is classified based on (i) type of population modelling (classical or network-based), (ii) frequency of the game (non-repeated or repeated), and (iii) type of strategy adoption (self-learning or imitation). The choice of model is shown to depend on many factors such as the immunity to the disease, the strength of immunity conferred by the vaccine, the size of population and the level of mixing therein. We highlight that while early studies used classical compartmental modelling with self-learning games, in recent years, there is a substantial growth of network-based modelling with imitation games. The review indicates that game theory continues to be an effective tool to model decision-making by individuals with respect to intervention (vaccination or social distancing).",Journal of biological dynamics,2020-Dec,"Chang SL, Piraveenan M, Pattison P, Prokopenko M",4,995,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

34476957,Pathological findings in African buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) in South Africa.,"The African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) is an iconic species of South African megafauna. As the farmed buffalo population expands, the potential impacts on population health and disease transmission warrant investigation. A retrospective study of skin biopsy and necropsy samples from 429 animals was performed to assess the spectrum of conditions seen in buffaloes in South Africa. Determination of the cause of death (or euthanasia) could not be made in 33.1% (136/411) of the necropsy cases submitted due to autolysis or the absence of significant lesions in the samples submitted. Infectious and parasitic diseases accounted for 53.5% (147/275) of adult fatal cases and non-infectious conditions accounted for 34.9% (96/275). Abortions and neonatal deaths made up 11.6% (32/275) of necropsy cases. Rift Valley fever, bovine viral diarrhoea, malignant catarrhal fever, tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia, anaesthetic deaths, cachexia and hepatotoxic lesions were the most common causes of death. The range of infectious, parasitic and non-infectious diseases to which African buffaloes were susceptible was largely similar to diseases in domestic cattle which supports concerns regarding disease transmission between the two species. The similarity between diseases experienced in both species will assist wildlife veterinarians in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases in captive African buffaloes. The present study likely does not represent accurate disease prevalence data within the source population of buffaloes, and diseases such as anthrax, brucellosis and foot and mouth disease are under-represented in this study.

38393523,The History of Controlling and Treating Infectious Diseases in Ancient China.,"Infectious diseases are the common enemies of mankind. In the course of historical development, they persistently threaten human health and safety. Even today, despite the developments in medical science, we cannot escape the fear and suffering caused by infectious diseases. Whether in ancient or modern times, the source of infection, route of transmission, and a susceptible population are the three key conditions for the prevalence and spread of infectious diseases. All factors closely related to these three conditions can affect the prevalence of infectious diseases. China is one of the cradles of world civilization. The ancient people accumulated a great deal of experience and lessons in the long struggle against infectious diseases. In the face of the current threat posed by widespread infectious disease, it is imperative to review and summarize ancient Chinese ideas and health policies on epidemic prevention and control to inspire contemporary efforts in the prevention and control of infectious disease.

33296387,How to better communicate the exponential growth of infectious diseases.,"Exponential growth bias is the phenomenon whereby humans underestimate exponential growth. In the context of infectious diseases, this bias may lead to a failure to understand the magnitude of the benefit of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Communicating the same scenario in different ways (framing) has been found to have a large impact on people's evaluations and behavior in the contexts of social behavior, risk taking and health care. We find that framing matters for people's assessment of the benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions. In two commonly used frames, most subjects in our experiment drastically underestimate the number of cases avoided by adopting non-pharmaceutical interventions. Framing growth in terms of doubling times rather than growth rates reduces the bias. When the scenario is framed in terms of time gained rather than cases avoided, the median subject assesses the benefit of non-pharmaceutical interventions correctly. These findings suggest changes that could be adopted to better communicate the exponential spread of infectious diseases.",PloS one,2020-,"Schonger M, Sele D",2,1081,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Cell membrane-based nanoplatforms endow nanoparticles with versatile characteristics, such as half-life extension, targeting ability, and immune-system regulation. However, monotypic cell membrane usually fails to provoke strong immune response for immunotherapy while maintaining good biosafety. The integration of different cell-membrane types provides a promising approach to construct multifunctional nanoplatforms for improved immunotherapeutic efficacy by enhancing immunogenicity or targeting function, evading immune clearance, or combining with other therapeutic modalities. In this review, the design principles, preparation strategies, and applications of hybrid cell membrane-based nanoplatforms for cancer and infection immunotherapy are first discussed.

35270663,Can El Niño-Southern Oscillation Increase Respiratory Infectious Diseases in China? An Empirical Study of 31 Provinces.,"Respiratory infectious diseases (RID) are the major form of infectious diseases in China, and are highly susceptible to climatic conditions. Current research mainly focuses on the impact of weather on RID, but there is a lack of research on the effect of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on RID. Therefore, this paper uses the system generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) and the data of 31 provinces in China from 2007 to 2018 to construct a dynamic panel model to empirically test the causality between ENSO and RID morbidity. Moreover, this paper considers the moderating effects of per capita disposable income and average years of education on this causality. The results show that ENSO can positively and significantly impact RID morbidity, which is 5.842% higher during El Niño years than normal years. In addition, per capita disposable income and average years of education can effectively weaken the relationship between ENSO and RID morbidity. Thus, this paper is of great significance for improving the RID early climate warning system in China and effectively controlling the spread of RID.",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022-Mar,"Tang Q, Gong K, Xiong L, Dong Y, Xu W",5,1108,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37945127,Microbial cell-free DNA detection: Minimally invasive diagnosis of infectious diseases.,"Detection of infectious diseases, especially among immunocompromised and patients on prolonged anti-microbial treatment, remains challenging, limited by conventional techniques with low sensitivity and long-turnaround time. Molecular detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) also has limited utility as it requires a targeted approach with prior suspicion of the infecting organism. Advancements in sequencing methodologies, specifically next-generation sequencing (NGS), have presented a promising opportunity to identify pathogens in cases where conventional techniques may be inadequate. However, the direct application of these techniques for diagnosing invasive infections is still limited by the need for invasive sampling, highlighting the pressing need to develop and implement non-invasive or minimally invasive approaches to improve the diagnosis of invasive infections. The objectives of this article are to explore the notable features, clinical utility, and constraints associated with the detection of microbial circulating cell-free DNA (mcfDNA) as a minimally invasive diagnostic tool for infectious diseases. The mcfDNA detection provides an opportunity to identify micro-organisms in the blood of a patient. It is especially beneficial in immunocompromised patients where invasive sampling is not possible or where repeated cultures are negative. This review will discuss the applications and constraints of detecting mcfDNA for diagnosing infections and the various platforms available for its detection.",Indian journal of medical microbiology,2023-,"Kanaujia R, Sharma V, Biswal M, Singh S, Ray P, Angrup A",6,1527,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

32650013,Infectious disease antibodies for biomedical applications: A mini review of immune antibody phage library repertoire.,"Antibody phage display is regarded as a critical tool for the development of monoclonal antibodies for infectious diseases. The different classes of antibody libraries are classified based on the source of repertoire used to generate the libraries. Immune antibody libraries are generated from disease infected host or immunization against an infectious agent. Antibodies derived from immune libraries are distinct from those derived from naïve libraries as the host's in vivo immune mechanisms shape the antibody repertoire to yield high affinity antibodies. As the immune system is constantly evolving in accordance to the health state of an individual, immune libraries can offer more than just infection-specific antibodies but also antibodies derived from the memory B-cells much like naïve libraries. The combinatorial nature of the gene cloning process would give rise to a combination of natural and un-natural antibody gene pairings in the immune library. These factors have a profound impact on the coverage of immune antibody libraries to target both disease-specific and non-disease specific antigens. This review looks at the diverse nature of antibody responses for immune library generation and discusses the extended potential of a disease-specified immune library in the context of phage display.",International journal of biological macromolecules,2020-Nov,"Lai JY, Lim TS",2,1313,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Therefore, early detection of infectious diseases is a significant need, and many researchers have developed models to diagnose them in the early stages. This paper reviewed research articles for recent machine-learning (ML) algorithms applied to infectious disease diagnosis. We searched the Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Springer, and IEEE databases from 2015 to 2022, identified the pros and cons of the reviewed ML models, and discussed the possible recommendations to advance the studies in this field. We found that most of the articles used small datasets, and few of them used real-time data. Our results demonstrated that a suitable ML technique depends on the nature of the dataset and the desired goal. Moreover, heterogeneous data could ensure the model's generalization, while big data, many features, and a hybrid model will increase the resulting performance. Furthermore, using other techniques such as deep learning and NLP to extract vast features from unstructured data is a powerful approach to enhancing the performance of ML diagnostic models.",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,2022-,"Alqaissi EY, Alotaibi FS, Ramzan MS",3,1219,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37192524,Estimating the prevalence of two or more diseases using outcomes from multiplex group testing.,"When screening a population for infectious diseases, pooling individual specimens (e.g., blood, swabs, urine, etc.) can provide enormous cost savings when compared to testing specimens individually. In the biostatistics literature, testing pools of specimens is commonly known as group testing or pooled testing. Although estimating a population-level prevalence with group testing data has received a large amount of attention, most of this work has focused on applications involving a single disease, such as human immunodeficiency virus. Modern methods of screening now involve testing pools and individuals for multiple diseases simultaneously through the use of multiplex assays. Hou et al. (2017, Biometrics, 73, 656-665) and Hou et al. (2020, Biostatistics, 21, 417-431) recently proposed group testing protocols for multiplex assays and derived relevant case identification characteristics, including the expected number of tests and those which quantify classification accuracy. In this article, we describe Bayesian methods to estimate population-level disease probabilities from implementing these protocols or any other multiplex group testing protocol which might be carried out in practice. Our estimation methods can be used with multiplex assays for two or more diseases while incorporating the possibility of test misclassification for each disease. We use chlamydia and gonorrhea testing data collected at the State Hygienic Laboratory at the University of Iowa to illustrate our work.

There seems to exist a negative correlation between the amount of biomedical research funding and disease burden from all Sub-Saharan African countries. In this study, we describe funding patterns for biomedical research, explore the correlation between funding and burden of diseases, and quantify inequalities in funds distribution across diseases in Gabon over the period 2005-2015. Data on medical research funds from 2005 to 2015 were retrieved through a structured questionnaire distributed to Gabonese biomedical research institutions and by consulting online databases. Data on the burden of diseases were gathered from the World Health Organization and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We used Kendall rank correlation coefficient to explore the correlation between cumulative funds over time and the burden of disease. The inequality distribution of funding across diseases was assessed through Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve. Biomedical research funding was characterized by a remarkable growth from 2005 to 2010 and a decline from 2010 to 2014. Funds were mostly from external sources and from partnerships. There was inequality in research funds allocation across diseases and malaria was far the most funded disease. There was a significant negative correlation between cumulative funding and the burden of HIV, tuberculosis, and of Helminthiasis (from 2006 to 2010) suggesting that research may be contributing to the management of such diseases. A positive, although not significant, correlation was found between cumulative funds and malaria burden. The negative correlation between HIV and tuberculosis cumulative funding and burden suggests that research may be contributing to the management of such diseases but further research is needed to assess the causal direction of such as relationship. As the burden of non-communicable diseases is increasing, more research funds should be focused on those.

We analyzed Google Trends (GT) and Twitter data from 1/1/2020 to 3/31/2020 in Canada and used various signal-processing techniques to remove noise from the data. Data on COVID-19 cases was obtained from the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group. We conducted time-lagged cross-correlation analyses and developed the long short-term memory model for forecasting daily COVID-19 cases. Among symptom keywords, ""cough,"" ""runny nose,"" and ""anosmia"" were strong signals with high cross-correlation coefficients >0.8 ( rCough = 0.825, t - 9; rRunnyNose = 0.816, t - 11; rAnosmia = 0.812, t - 3 ), showing that searching for ""cough,"" ""runny nose,"" and ""anosmia"" on GT correlated with the incidence of COVID-19 and peaked 9, 11, and 3 days earlier than the incidence peak, respectively. For symptoms- and COVID-related Tweet counts, the cross-correlations of Tweet signals and daily cases were rTweetSymptoms = 0.868, t - 11 and tTweetCOVID = 0.840, t - 10, respectively. The LSTM forecasting model achieved the best performance (MSE = 124.78, R2 = 0.88, adjusted R2 = 0.87) using GT signals with cross-correlation coefficients >0.75. Combining GT and Tweet signals did not improve the model performance.

Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial to impede the progression of a disease and break the chain of transmission. Conventional diagnostic techniques are typically time-consuming and costly, making them inefficient for early diagnosis of infections and inconvenient for use at the point of care. Developments of sensitive, rapid, and affordable diagnostic methods are necessary to improve the clinical management of infectious diseases. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) systems have emerged as a robust biosensing platform due to their label-free mechanism, which allows the detection and quantification of a wide range of biomolecules. The high sensitivity and short detection time offered by QCM-based biosensors are attractive for the early detection of infections and the routine monitoring of disease progression. Herein, the strategies employed in QCM-based biosensors for the detection of infectious diseases are extensively reviewed, with a focus on prevalent diseases for which improved diagnostic techniques are in high demand.

To curb the dispersal of such diseases, proper management of healthcare facilities and vaccines are core drivers. In the present work, we assess the unified impact of healthcare facilities and vaccination on the control of an infectious disease by formulating a mathematical model. To formulate the model for any region, we consider four classes of human population; namely, susceptible, infected, hospitalized, and vaccinated. It is assumed that the increment in number of beds in hospitals is continuously made in proportion to the number of infected individuals. To ensure the occurrence of transcritical, saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations, the conditions are derived. The normal form is obtained to show the existence of Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. To validate the analytically obtained results, we have conducted some numerical simulations.

33382076,The Swiss STAR trial - an evaluation of target groups for sexually transmitted infection screening in the sub-sample of women.,"In Switzerland, universal health insurance does not cover any routine testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), not even in individuals at high risk, and extra-genital swabbing is not standard of care. We compared STI prevalence in a multicentre prospective observational cohort of multi-partner women with/without sex work and evaluated associated risk factors. Between January 2016 and June 2017, we offered free STI testing to women with multiple&nbsp; sexual partners (three or more in the previous 12 months), with follow-up examinations every 6 months. We used multiplex polymerase chain-reaction testing (for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium) for pooled swabs (pharynx, urethra/vagina, anus), and antibody tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Treponema pallidum at every visit, and for hepatitis B and C at baseline. We screened 490 female sex workers (FSWs), including 17 trans women, and 92 other multi-partner women. More than half reported a steady partner. Previously undiagnosed HIV was found in 0.2% vs 0.0%, respectively, and T. pallidum antibodies in 5.9% vs 0.0%. STIs requiring antibiotic treatment comprised: active syphilis 1.2% vs 0.0%; N. gonorrhoeae 4.9% vs 0.0%; C. trachomatis 6.3% vs 5.4%, T. vaginalis 10.4% vs 0.0%; M. genitalium 6.7% vs 6.5%. One in four FSWs vs one in nine other women had one or more of these STIs at baseline. 15.8% vs 3.8% had a history of hepatitis B, 45.5% vs 22.8% had no immunity (HBs-AB &lt;10 IU/l).

Metagenomic next-generation sequencing for infectious diseases promises an unbiased approach to detection of microbes that does not depend on growth in culture or the targeting of specific pathogens. However, the issues of contamination, interpretation of results, selection of databases used for analysis, and prediction of antimicrobial susceptibilities from sequencing data remain challenges. In this Point-Counterpoint, Steve Miller and Charles Chiu discuss the pros of using direct metagenomic sequencing, while Kyle Rodino and Melissa Miller argue for the use of caution.",Journal of clinical microbiology,2020-Feb,"Miller S, Chiu C, Rodino KG, Miller MB",4,856,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Ultrasound imaging has emerged as a valuable tool in the assessment of gastrointestinal pathologies, offering non-invasive and real-time visualization of anatomical structures. This review aims to explore the role of ultrasound in the diagnosis and management of infectious diseases involving the gastrointestinal tract. We discuss the imaging features of various infectious etiologies, such as bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections, highlighting characteristic findings on ultrasound scans. Additionally, we provide insights into the utility of ultrasound for the assessment of treatment response. Through a comprehensive analysis of existing literature and clinical case studies, this review underscores the significance of ultrasound imaging as a frontline modality in the diagnosis and management of infectious diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract.","Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2024-Aug,"Aprile F, Vangeli M, Allocca M, Zilli A, Argollo MC, D'amico F, Parigi TL, Danese S, Furfaro F",9,1035,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

38789528,Bridging the gap with multispecific immune cell engagers in cancer and infectious diseases.,"By binding to multiple antigens simultaneously, multispecific antibodies are expected to substantially improve both the activity and long-term efficacy of antibody-based immunotherapy. Immune cell engagers, a subclass of antibody-based constructs, consist of engineered structures designed to bridge immune effector cells to their target, thereby redirecting the immune response toward the tumor cells or infected cells. The increasing number of recent clinical trials evaluating immune cell engagers reflects the important role of these molecules in new therapeutic approaches for cancer and infections. In this review, we discuss how different immune cell types (T and natural killer lymphocytes, as well as myeloid cells) can be bound by immune cell engagers in immunotherapy for cancer and infectious diseases. Furthermore, we explore the preclinical and clinical advancements of these constructs, and we discuss the challenges in translating the current knowledge from cancer to the virology field. Finally, we speculate on the promising future directions that immune cell engagers may take in cancer treatment and antiviral therapy.",Cellular & molecular immunology,2024-Jul,"Rolin C, Zimmer J, Seguin-Devaux C",3,1138,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38006200,Infectious disease in the Pleistocene: Old friends or old foes?,"The impact of endemic and epidemic disease on humans has traditionally been seen as a comparatively recent historical phenomenon associated with the Neolithisation of human groups, an increase in population size led by sedentarism, and increasing contact with domesticated animals as well as species occupying opportunistic symbiotic and ectosymbiotic relationships with humans. The orthodox approach is that Neolithisation created the conditions for increasing population size able to support a reservoir of infectious disease sufficient to act as selective pressure. This orthodoxy is the result of an overly simplistic reliance on skeletal data assuming that no skeletal lesions equated to a healthy individual, underpinned by the assumption that hunter-gatherer groups were inherently healthy while agricultural groups acted as infectious disease reservoirs. The work of van Blerkom, Am. J. Phys. Anthropol., vol. suppl 37 (2003), Wolfe et al., Nature, vol. 447 (2007) and Houldcroft and Underdown, Am. J. Phys. Anthropol., vol. 160, (2016) has changed this landscape by arguing that humans and pathogens have long been fellow travelers. The package of infectious diseases experienced by our ancient ancestors may not be as dissimilar to modern infectious diseases as was once believed. The importance of DNA, from ancient and modern sources, to the study of the antiquity of infectious disease, and its role as a selective pressure cannot be overstated. Here we consider evidence of ancient epidemic and endemic infectious diseases with inferences from modern and ancient human and hominin DNA, and from circulating and extinct pathogen genomes. We argue that the pandemics of the past are a vital tool to unlock the weapons needed to fight pandemics of the future.",American journal of biological anthropology,2023-Dec,"Houldcroft CJ, Underdown S",2,1770,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

In recent years, new emerging and advanced nano-technology carrier liposomes have been widely studied towards producing drugs and vaccines capable of targeting infectious diseases. Liposomes portrayed biocompatible and biodegradable properties with versatile flexibility, characteristics that are advantageous for a good targeting at the site of action. The success of liposomes has renewed interest in the research and development of liposomal drugs and vaccines shifting the paradigm in infectious diseases treatment.

The ongoing spread of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the increased use of immunosuppressive therapy and the persistence of overcrowding and suboptimal sanitation in underdeveloped areas facilitate both disease transmission from environmental and foodborne sources and person-to-person transmission. Clinicians increasingly rely on endoscopic biopsy sample interpretation to diagnose gastrointestinal infections. Thus, pathologists must be aware of diagnostic features of a variety of microbial pathogens. Detection with molecular techniques also allows for correlation between infectious agents and their histopathological features, which has expanded our knowledge of the inflammatory changes produced by infectious agents. This review covers infectious disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract encountered in surgical pathology. Clinical, endoscopic and pathological features are presented.

35624657,Current Advancements and Future Road Map to Develop ASSURED Microfluidic Biosensors for Infectious and Non-Infectious Diseases.,"Better diagnostics are always essential for the treatment and prevention of a disease. Existing technologies for detecting infectious and non-infectious diseases are mostly tedious, expensive, and do not meet the World Health Organization's (WHO) ASSURED (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable to end user) criteria. Hence, more accurate, sensitive, and faster diagnostic technologies that meet the ASSURED criteria are highly required for timely and evidenced-based treatment. Presently, the diagnostics industry is finding interest in microfluidics-based biosensors, as this integration comprises all qualities, such as reduction in the size of the equipment, rapid turnaround time, possibility of parallel multiple analysis or multiplexing, etc. Microfluidics deal with the manipulation/analysis of fluid within micrometer-sized channels. Biosensors comprise biomolecules immobilized on a physicochemical transducer for the detection of a specific analyte. In this review article, we provide an outline of the history of microfluidics, current practices in the selection of materials in microfluidics, and how and where microfluidics-based biosensors have been used for the diagnosis of infectious and non-infectious diseases. Our inclination in this review article is toward the employment of microfluidics-based biosensors for the improvement of already existing/traditional methods in order to reduce efforts without compromising the accuracy of the diagnostic test.

34112116,Clinical application of cell-free next-generation sequencing for infectious diseases at a tertiary children's hospital.,"Children affected by infectious diseases may not always have a detectable infectious etiology. Diagnostic uncertainty can lead to prolonged hospitalizations, inappropriately broad or extended courses of antibiotics, invasive diagnostic procedures, and difficulty predicting the clinical course and outcome. Cell-free plasma next-generation sequencing (cfNGS) can identify viral, bacterial, and fungal infections by detecting pathogen DNA in peripheral blood. This testing modality offers the ability to test for many organisms at once in a shotgun metagenomic approach with a rapid turnaround time. We sought to compare the results of cfNGS to conventional diagnostic test results and describe the impact of cfNGS on clinical care in a diverse pediatric population at a large academic children's hospital. We performed a retrospective chart review of hospitalized subjects at a tertiary pediatric hospital to determine the diagnostic yield of cfNGS and its impact on clinical care. We describe the clinical application of results from 142 cfNGS tests in the management of 110 subjects over an 8-month study period. In comparison to conventional testing as a reference standard, cfNGS was found to have a positive percent agreement of 89.6% and negative percent agreement of 52.3%. Furthermore, 32.4% of cfNGS results were directly applied to make a clinical change in management. We demonstrate the clinically utility of cfNGS in the management of acutely ill children. Future studies, both retrospective and prospective, are needed to clarify the optimal indications for testing.",BMC infectious diseases,2021-Jun,"Wilke J, Ramchandar N, Cannavino C, Pong A, Tremoulet A, Padua LT, Harvey H, Foley J, Farnaes L, Coufal NG",10,1580,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

It is unclear if this could potentially guide diagnostic evaluations. We examined the association between symptom duration and diagnostic and prognostic outcomes in FUO/IUO. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of adult patients meeting criteria for FUO/IUO from a tertiary care center in Belgium between 2000 and 2019. The association between symptom duration and outcomes of interest were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. Among 602 patients who met criteria for FUO/IUO (mean age 54 years, 43% female), 132 (22%) and 68 (11%) had symptoms for 3-12 months and >12 months, respectively. There were no significant differences in diagnosis or all-cause mortality between a symptom duration of <3 months and 3-12 months. In contrast, those who had a symptom duration of >12 months were less likely to receive a final diagnosis (aHR 0.42, 95% CI 0.30-0.60), in particular a diagnosis of infectious disorders (aHR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12-0.74), malignancies (aHR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03-0.46), and miscellaneous conditions (aHR 0.22, 95% CI 0.07-0.71), but no significant differences were seen in noninfectious inflammatory disorders (aHR 0.74, 95% CI 0.48-1.15) or all-cause mortality (aHR 0.55, 95% CI 0.19-1.54).

34194045,Thinking clearly about social aspects of infectious disease transmission.,"Social and cultural forces shape almost every aspect of infectious disease transmission in human populations, as well as our ability to measure, understand, and respond to epidemics. For directly transmitted infections, pathogen transmission relies on human-to-human contact, with kinship, household, and societal structures shaping contact patterns that in turn determine epidemic dynamics. Social, economic, and cultural forces also shape patterns of exposure, health-seeking behaviour, infection outcomes, the likelihood of diagnosis and reporting of cases, and the uptake of interventions. Although these social aspects of epidemiology are hard to quantify and have limited the generalizability of modelling frameworks in a policy context, new sources of data on relevant aspects of human behaviour are increasingly available. Researchers have begun to embrace data from mobile devices and other technologies as useful proxies for behavioural drivers of disease transmission, but there is much work to be done to measure and validate these approaches, particularly for policy-making. Here we discuss how integrating local knowledge in the design of model frameworks and the interpretation of new data streams offers the possibility of policy-relevant models for public health decision-making as well as the development of robust, generalizable theories about human behaviour in relation to infectious diseases.",Nature,2021-Jul,"Buckee C, Noor A, Sattenspiel L",3,1414,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Among challenges to application of clinical xenotransplantation are unknown risks of transmission of animal microbes to immunosuppressed recipients or the community. Experience in allotransplantation and in preclinical models suggests that viral infections are the greatest concern. Worldwide, the distribution of swine pathogens is heterogeneous and cannot be fully controlled by international agricultural regulations. It is possible to screen source animals for potential human pathogens before procuring organs in a manner not possible within the time available for surveillance testing in allotransplantation. Infection control measures require microbiological assays for surveillance of source animals and xenograft recipients and research into zoonotic potential of porcine organisms.

The propagation of variants of viruses is an interesting problem. We perform numerical simulations of the microscopic epidemic model based on network theory for the spread of variants. Assume that a small number of individuals infected with the variant are added to widespread infection with the original virus. When a highly infectious variant that is more transmissible than the original lineage is added, the variant spreads quickly to the wide space. On the other hand, if the infectivity is about the same as that of the original virus, the infection will not spread. The rate of spread is not linear as a function of the infection strength but increases non-linearly. This cannot be explained by the compartmental model of epidemiology but can be understood in terms of the dynamic absorbing state known from the contact process.",Scientific reports,2022-Jan,"Okabe Y, Shudo A",2,894,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

These rodents are purchased from pet shops, breeders, and online. Consequently, some of these rodents may subtly transmit diseases as they may be asymptomatic to certain pathogens. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> We systematically searched four academic databases viz. Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus to determine zoonotic pathogens associated with pet and feeder rodents globally. Our searches were performed in R statistical software using the packages ""metagear"" and ""revtool"". <b><i>Results:</i></b> We found 62 studies reporting on zoonotic pathogens between 1973 and 2022 from 16 countries representing 4 continents, namely Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America. The review identified 30 zoonotic pathogens isolated from pet and feeder rodents, including the African pygmy mouse (<i>Mus minutoides</i>), brown rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>), and the house mouse (<i>Mus musculus</i>). The greatest number of pathogens was reported from the United States, followed by Togo and the United Kingdom. Bacterial pathogens were the most prevalent. However, the Seoul virus and rat bite fever (<i>Streptobacillus moniliformis</i>) were the most studied pathogens, found in more than one country, with reported outbreak cases. Most of the zoonotic pathogens were isolated from rodents acquired from pet shops. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> We recommend that pet and feeder rodents purchased from pet shops should be regularly screened for potential zoonotic pathogens as some of these animals may not show clinical signs of the illness. There is also a critical need to develop strict regulations and policies, especially in underdeveloped and developing regions for an effective surveillance process, which will include early detection, rapid response, and control of zoonotic diseases globally.","Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)",2023-Nov,"Shivambu N, Shivambu TC, Chimimba CT",3,1926,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39116182,Interacting particle models on the impact of spatially heterogeneous human behavioral factors on dynamics of infectious diseases.,"Human behaviors have non-negligible impacts on spread of contagious disease. For instance, large-scale gathering and high mobility of population could lead to accelerated disease transmission, while public behavioral changes in response to pandemics may effectively reduce contacts and suppress the peak of the outbreak. In order to understand how spatial characteristics like population mobility and clustering interplay with epidemic outbreaks, we formulate a stochastic-statistical environment-epidemic dynamic system (SEEDS) via an agent-based biased random walk model on a two-dimensional lattice. The ""popularity"" and ""awareness"" variables are taken into consideration to capture human natural and preventive behavioral factors, which are assumed to guide and bias agent movement in a combined way. It is found that the presence of the spatial heterogeneity, like social influence locality and spatial clustering induced by self-aggregation, potentially suppresses the contacts between agents and consequently flats the epidemic curve. Surprisedly, disease responses might not necessarily reduce the susceptibility of informed individuals and even aggravate disease outbreak if each individual responds independently upon their awareness. The disease control is achieved effectively only if there are coordinated public-health interventions and public compliance to these measures. Therefore, our model may be useful for quantitative evaluations of a variety of public-health policies.",PLoS computational biology,2024-Aug,"Xiong Y, Wang C, Zhang Y",3,1491,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The objective of the current study was to assess research activity on climate change and health with an emphasis on infectious diseases. A bibliometric method was applied using SciVerse Scopus. Documents on climate change and human health were called ""health-related literature"" while documents on climate change and infectious diseases were called ""infection-related literature"". The study period was from 1980 to 2019. The search query found 4247 documents in the health-related literature and 1207 in the infection-related literature. The growth of publications showed a steep increase after 2007. There were four research themes in the health-related literature: (1) climate change and infectious diseases; (2) climate change, public health and food security; (3) heat waves, mortality, and non-communicable diseases; and (4) climate change, air pollution, allergy, and respiratory health. The most frequently encountered pathogens/infectious diseases in the infection-related literature were malaria and dengue. Documents in infection-related literature had a higher h-index than documents in the health-related literature. The top-cited documents in the health-related literature focused on food security, public health, and infectious diseases while those in infection-related literature focused on water-, vector-, and mosquito-borne diseases. The European region had the highest contribution in health-related literature (n = 1626; 38.3%) and infection-related literature (n = 497; 41.2%). The USA led with 1235 (29.1%) documents in health-related literature and 365 (30.2%) documents in infection-related literature. The Australian National University ranked first in the health-related literature while the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ranked first in the infection-related literature.

Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death that occurs most frequently upon infection. However, inflammation is not the only cause by which pyroptosis involved in atherosclerosis. During pyroptosis, a large amount of microparticles are released from pyroptotic cells, which not only transfer inflammatory mediators to arterial vessel, but also mediate the interaction between a variety of cells, leading to endothelial injury, macrophage infiltration, vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation, thereby accelerating atherosclerosis.

However, it remains poorly understood, and there is considerable heterogeneity in its use. In this scoping review, we explain how to design, use and analyse a DOOR endpoint, and highlight several pitfalls and potential improvements that can be made to DOOR/RADAR. The Ovid MEDLINE database was searched for terms related to DOOR in English-language articles published up to 31 December 2022. Articles discussing DOOR methodology and/or reporting clinical trial analyses (as either primary, secondary, or post-hoc analysis) using a DOOR outcome were included. Seventeen articles were included in the final review, of which nine reported DOOR analyses of 12 RCTs. Eight articles discussed DOOR methodology. We synthesised information from these articles and discuss (a) how to develop a DOOR scale, (b) how to conduct a DOOR/RADAR analysis, (c) use in clinical trials, (d) use of alternative tiebreakers apart from RADAR, (e) partial credit analyses, and (f) criticisms and pitfalls of DOOR/RADAR. DOOR is an important innovation for RCTs in infectious diseases. We highlight potential areas of methodological improvement for future research. There remains considerable heterogeneity in its implementation, and further collaborative efforts, with a more diverse range of perspectives, should be made to develop consensus scales for use in prospective studies.",Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,2023-Aug,"Ong SWX, Petersiel N, Loewenthal MR, Daneman N, Tong SYC, Davis JS",6,1664,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38417659,Towards development of functional climate-driven early warning systems for climate-sensitive infectious diseases: Statistical models and recommendations.,"Climate, weather and environmental change have significantly influenced patterns of infectious disease transmission, necessitating the development of early warning systems to anticipate potential impacts and respond in a timely and effective way. Statistical modelling plays a pivotal role in understanding the intricate relationships between climatic factors and infectious disease transmission. For example, time series regression modelling and spatial cluster analysis have been employed to identify risk factors and predict spatial and temporal patterns of infectious diseases. Recently advanced spatio-temporal models and machine learning offer an increasingly robust framework for modelling uncertainty, which is essential in climate-driven disease surveillance due to the dynamic and multifaceted nature of the data. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including deep learning and neural networks, excel in capturing intricate patterns and hidden relationships within climate and environmental data sets. Web-based data has emerged as a powerful complement to other datasets encompassing climate variables and disease occurrences. However, given the complexity and non-linearity of climate-disease interactions, advanced techniques are required to integrate and analyse these diverse data to obtain more accurate predictions of impending outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics. This article presents an overview of an approach to creating climate-driven early warning systems with a focus on statistical model suitability and selection, along with recommendations for utilizing spatio-temporal and machine learning techniques. By addressing the limitations and embracing the recommendations for future research, we could enhance preparedness and response strategies, ultimately contributing to the safeguarding of public health in the face of evolving climate challenges.",Environmental research,2024-May,"Haque S, Mengersen K, Barr I, Wang L, Yang W, Vardoulakis S, Bambrick H, Hu W",8,1888,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35878824,Deep similarity analysis and forecasting of actual outbreak of major infectious diseases using Internet-Sourced data.,"Perhaps no other generation in the span of recorded human history has endured the risks of infectious diseases as has the current generation. The prevalence of infectious diseases is caused mainly by unlimited contact between people in a highly globalized world. Disease control and prevention (CDC) promptly collect and produce disease outbreak statistics, but CDCs rely on a curated, centralized collection system, and requires up to two weeks of lead time. Consequently, the quick release of disease outbreak information has become a great challenge. Infectious disease outbreak information is recorded and spread somewhere on the Internet much faster than CDC announcements, and Internet-sourced data have shown non-substitutable potential to watch and predict infectious disease outbreaks in advance. In this study, we performed a thorough analysis to show the similarity between the Korean Center of Disease Control (KCDC) infectious disease datasets and three Internet-sourced data for nine major infectious diseases in terms of time-series volume. The results show that many of infectious disease outbreak have strongly related to Internet-sourced data. We analyzed several factors that affect the similarity. Our analysis shows that the increase in the number of Internet-sourced data correlates with the increase in the number of infected people and thus, show the positive similarity. We also found that the greater the number of infectious disease outbreaks corresponds to having a wider spread of outbreak regions, in which it also proves to have higher similarity. We presented the prediction result of infectious disease outbreak using various Internet-sourced data and an effective deep learning algorithm. It showed that there are positive correlations between the number of infected people or the number of related web data and the prediction accuracy. We developed and currently operate a web-based system to show the similarity between KCDC and related Internet-sourced data for infectious diseases. This paper helps people to identify what kind of Internet-sourced data they need to use to predict and track a specific infectious disease outbreak. We considered as much as nine major diseases and three kinds of Internet-sourced data together, and we can say that our finding did not depend on specific infectious disease nor specific Internet-sourced data.",Journal of biomedical informatics,2022-Sep,"Jang B, Kim Y, Il Kim G, Wook Kim J",4,2378,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

One major challenge in combatting such diseases is a lack of effective drugs or specific treatments. In addition, drug resistance to currently available therapeutics and adverse effects caused by long-term overuse are both serious public health issues. A promising treatment strategy is to employ cell-membrane mimics as decoys to trap and to detain the pathogens. In this Perspective, we briefly review the infection mechanisms adopted by different pathogens at the cellular membrane interface and highlight the applications of cell-membrane-mimicking nanodecoys for systemic protection against infectious diseases. We also discuss the implication of nanodecoy-pathogen complexes in the development of vaccines.

Public health stakeholders and decision-makers are called upon to set up or strengthen surveillance systems in areas hosting Olympic or Paralympic Games (OPGs) or large-scale international competitions, the objective being to detect and manage outbreaks should they occur during that period. We undertook a narrative review of the literature so as to identify major reported infectious disease outbreaks linked with or during OPGs / international sporting events during warm seasons. Our review found that since 1992, Summer Olympic and Paralympic games and international football competitions have been associated with sporadic cases of infectious diseases, principally respiratory, gastrointestinal/foodborne, but not with any major communicable or other infectious disease outbreak. Communicable disease risks should be assessed for the population taken as a whole, an integrated ecosystem with several population compartments potentially exchanging pathogens among one another. Although the Games afford an opportunity to federate or invent new surveillance systems to fill a gap, surveillance should be based on existing medical and laboratory systems, proven tools reinforced with the necessary human and financial resources. The performance of the public health surveillance system is ultimately predicated on trust on the part of participating clinicians, policymakers and international partners.",Infectious diseases now,2024-Jun,"Gallien Y, Fournet N, Delamare H, Haroutunian L, Tarantola A",5,1599,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35596137,A compelling demonstration of why traditional statistical regression models cannot be used to identify risk factors from case data on infectious diseases: a simulation study.,"Regression models are often used to explain the relative risk of infectious diseases among groups. For example, overrepresentation of immigrants among COVID-19 cases has been found in multiple countries. Several studies apply regression models to investigate whether different risk factors can explain this overrepresentation among immigrants without considering dependence between the cases. We study the appropriateness of traditional statistical regression methods for identifying risk factors for infectious diseases, by a simulation study. We model infectious disease spread by a simple, population-structured version of an SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered)-model, which is one of the most famous and well-established models for infectious disease spread. The population is thus divided into different sub-groups. We vary the contact structure between the sub-groups of the population. We analyse the relation between individual-level risk of infection and group-level relative risk. We analyse whether Poisson regression estimators can capture the true, underlying parameters of transmission. We assess both the quantitative and qualitative accuracy of the estimated regression coefficients. We illustrate that there is no clear relationship between differences in individual characteristics and group-level overrepresentation -small differences on the individual level can result in arbitrarily high overrepresentation. We demonstrate that individual risk of infection cannot be properly defined without simultaneous specification of the infection level of the population. We argue that the estimated regression coefficients are not interpretable and show that it is not possible to adjust for other variables by standard regression methods. Finally, we illustrate that regression models can result in the significance of variables unrelated to infection risk in the constructed simulation example (e.g. ethnicity), particularly when a large proportion of contacts is within the same group. Traditional regression models which are valid for modelling risk between groups for non-communicable diseases are not valid for infectious diseases. By applying such methods to identify risk factors of infectious diseases, one risks ending up with wrong conclusions. Output from such analyses should therefore be treated with great caution.",BMC medical research methodology,2022-May,"Engebretsen S, Rø G, de Blasio BF",3,2341,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34272205,The evolution of rapid antigen detection systems and their application for COVID-19 and other serious respiratory infectious diseases.,"Making the correct diagnosis of a patient seeking medical attention is the ultimate goal of a practicing physician, irrespective of whether the cause of the patient's condition is infectious or non-infectious. Antigen detection tests can be used to aid in the diagnosis of various infectious-related disorders including COVID-19 where it has become especially important due to the serious nature of this disease and its worldwide prevalence. These tests closely mimic one of the earliest prototypes - the urine pregnancy test - and as a result they have gained wide acceptance based on their overall simplicity, low cost and relative accuracy. In some situations, especially as a screening test, they can be used instead of the more technically demanding and complex molecular and serologic assays that are still useful and helpful under many different circumstances. Antigen detection systems are based on finding a particular immunogenic component, typically a protein or polysaccharide molecule, that is both unique and an integral part of the pathogen or other biological entity. Because these tests generally provide only qualitative results, they often need to be supplemented with other and sometimes more sophisticated laboratory-based diagnostic procedures to corroborate the initial test result. In this review, we first describe general background information on antigen-detection methods, including any unique aspects of their overall design, and then follow with an extensive description on the merits and limitations of these tests for detecting COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, for other serious respiratory diseases caused by three common bacterial pathogens - Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila.","Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi",2021-Oct,"S Pavia C, M Plummer M",2,1754,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33112102,Evolution of epidemiological thought in medicine taking into account the evolution of Polish epidemiology in the 20th century.,"Communicable diseases have accompanied humanity since the beginning of its existence. The first descriptions of diseases appeared in the 8th century B.C. in the Iliad, Homer. Epidemics of communicable diseases were often described in social context by poets, historians, and chroniclers. Medicine as a science until the 19th century could not provide answers concerning the aetiology of epidemic diseases or propose therapies with measurable benefits. For centuries the fight against epidemics was the duty of administrative services. Quarantine, isolation (including forced isolation), sanitary cordons, and disinfection procedures involving the moxibustion, burning of objects, clothing and bodies, etc. were introduced very early on. The knowledge of practical measures taken during repeated epidemics of various communicable diseases in Europe laid the foundations for the development of social medicine in the 18th century. In the 19th century, methods such as statistics, comparison of patient groups, mathematics and others were introduced to assess the effectiveness of prophylactic and therapeutic measures. In the 19th century it became possible to distinguish a new science - epidemiology. The missing element was the so-called ""bacteriological breakthrough"". After the discovery and description of bacteria, there was a tumultuous development of bacteriology, vaccines were created and huge financial resources were allocated to bacteriological institutes. After extensive use of chemotherapeutics and antibiotics, it turned out in the mid-20th century that the mortality from communicable diseasesis statistically lower in some countries than in others.In the 1940s, population-based cardiological studies using epidemiological patterns were introduced in the United States, and in the 1950s epidemiological congresses worldwide accepted that it was reasonable for epidemiology to investigate the occurrence and causes of communicable and non-communicable diseases. In Poland, in 1964, at the 4th Congress of the Polish Society of Epidemiologists and Doctors of Infectious Diseases in Cracow, a decision was made to extend epidemiological studies to non-communicable diseases.",Przeglad epidemiologiczny,2020-,Paliga RE,1,2189,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

33830353,Stochastic models of infectious diseases in a periodic environment with application to cholera epidemics.,"Seasonal variation affects the dynamics of many infectious diseases including influenza, cholera and malaria. The time when infectious individuals are first introduced into a population is crucial in predicting whether a major disease outbreak occurs. In this investigation, we apply a time-nonhomogeneous stochastic process for a cholera epidemic with seasonal periodicity and a multitype branching process approximation to obtain an analytical estimate for the probability of an outbreak. In particular, an analytic estimate of the probability of disease extinction is shown to satisfy a system of ordinary differential equations which follows from the backward Kolmogorov differential equation. An explicit expression for the mean (resp. variance) of the first extinction time given an extinction occurs is derived based on the analytic estimate for the extinction probability. Our results indicate that the probability of a disease outbreak, and mean and standard derivation of the first time to disease extinction are periodic in time and depend on the time when the infectious individuals or free-living pathogens are introduced. Numerical simulations are then carried out to validate the analytical predictions using two examples of the general cholera model. At the end, the developed theoretical results are extended to more general models of infectious diseases.",Journal of mathematical biology,2021-Apr,"Allen LJS, Wang X",2,1372,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

31790029,Advances in vaccinating immunocompromised children.,"Immunocompromised children are a largely under-vaccinated population and are vulnerable to acquiring vaccine-preventable infections (VPIs). A variety of factors contribute to poor vaccine coverage including: severity of underlying illness, sporadic contact with primary care physicians, and lack of awareness among specialty providers regarding vaccination status. In this review, we report recent data regarding incidence of VPIs, new approaches to vaccine use, rates of vaccine coverage, and strategies to optimize vaccine administration in immunocompromised populations. Pediatric transplant recipients and patients with autoimmune disorders receiving novel biological therapies, represent growing immunocompromised patient populations. VPIs continue to be a concern for such patients. Underlying disease severity may limit efforts to immunize pediatric patients early in their disease process, prior to immunosuppression. Inactive vaccines are safe and immunogenic after the introduction of immunosuppression, but live vaccines are typically contraindicated. Emerging data support the safety and effectiveness of live vaccines in certain immunocompromised individuals. Care providers must remain vigilant in maintaining patients' vaccination status based on current vaccination guidelines, and create a multidisciplinary approach to optimizing vaccination. Immunocompromised children remain under-vaccinated and vulnerable to VPIs.

39671879,Aging and infectious diseases in myasthenia gravis.,"Over the past 120 years, mortality associated with myasthenia gravis (MG) has steadily decreased while the incidence of MG has increased. While mortality due to MG has been ≤5 % for at least the past 25 years, the prevalence of MG has increased. This increase in prevalence of MG may be due, in part, to improvements in diagnostics but also to an aging global population and immunosenescence as the largest increases in MG prevalence have been in patients ≥65 years old. In fact, a ""very late-onset"" subtype of MG has been proposed for patients diagnosed at or after age 65 years. These patients are predominantly anti-AChR antibody positive and thymoma negative. Preferred therapeutic options differ based on age at MG onset. Immunosenescence may play a role not only in MG etiology but also in the increased susceptibility of MG patients to infection. Immunosuppressive effects of MG therapies can also increase vulnerability to infection. Despite the improvements in MG treatment, mortality in MG patients remains higher than in the non-MG population. This is partly due to increased vulnerability to infection but also due to infection acting as a precipitating factor for MG exacerbation or crisis. The increased infection risk inherent with MG and the increased risk resulting from some therapies calls for increased diligence in monitoring and treating infections in MG patients.",Journal of the neurological sciences,2025-Jan,"Bril V, Gilhus NE",2,1386,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

32411619,Current and Future Point-of-Care Tests for Emerging and New Respiratory Viruses and Future Perspectives.,"The availability of pathogen-specific treatment options for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) increased the need for rapid diagnostic tests. Besides, retrospective studies, improved lab-based detection methods and the intensified search for new viruses since the beginning of the twenty-first century led to the discovery of several novel respiratory viruses. Among them are human bocavirus (HBoV), human coronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1, -NL63), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus type C (RV-C), and human polyomaviruses (KIPyV, WUPyV). Additionally, new viruses like SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), novel strains of influenza virus A and B, and (most recently) SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged. Although clinical presentation may be similar among different viruses, associated symptoms may range from a mild cold to a severe respiratory illness, and thus require a fast and reliable diagnosis. The increasing number of commercially available rapid point-of-care tests (POCTs) for respiratory viruses illustrates both the need for this kind of tests but also the problem, i.e., that the majority of such assays has significant limitations. In this review, we summarize recently published characteristics of POCTs and discuss their implications for the treatment of RTIs. The second key aspect of this work is a description of new and innovative diagnostic techniques, ranging from biosensors to novel portable and current lab-based nucleic acid amplification methods with the potential future use in point-of-care settings.

32283358,Future perspectives of wastewater-based epidemiology: Monitoring infectious disease spread and resistance to the community level.,"Infectious diseases are acknowledged as one of the most critical threats to global public health today. Climate change, unprecedented population growth with accelerated rates of antimicrobial resistance, have resulted in both the emergence of novel pathogenic organisms and the re-emergence of infections that were once controlled. The consequences have led to an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases globally. The ability to rapidly monitor the spread of diseases is key for prevention, intervention and control, however several limitations exist for current surveillance systems and the capacity to cope with the rapid population growth and environmental changes. Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) is a new epidemiology tool that has potential to act as a complementary approach for current infectious disease surveillance systems and an early warning system for disease outbreaks. WBE postulates that through the analysis of population pooled wastewater, infectious disease and resistance spread, the emergence of new disease outbreak to the community level can be monitored comprehensively and in real-time. This manuscript provides critical overview of current infectious disease surveillance status, as well as it introduces WBE and its recent advancements.

We hypothesised that intrapartum antibiotic exposure is associated with the occurrence of childhood infectious diseases because it influences the development of the gut microbiome. The cohort for this population-based study comprised vaginally delivered children born in Northern Finland in 2007-2018. We used structured electronic medical records linked to comprehensive national registers. Primary outcome was the number of infectious disease episodes leading to an emergency room visit, outpatient hospital visit, or hospitalisation from birth until five years of age. Analyses were performed on 9733 children (48.8% girls) exposed to intrapartum antibiotics and on 35,842 unexposed children (49.9% girls). Exposure to intrapartum antibiotics was associated with increased risk of any infectious disease episode at the ages 7-28 days (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 1.30, 95% CI 1.10-1.54) and 1-2 years (aIRR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18). The occurrence of urinary tract infections was associated with the exposure to intrapartum antibiotics whereas the occurrence of severe infections caused by pathogens susceptible to penicillin was reversely associated with the exposure to intrapartum antibiotics. Maternal intrapartum antibiotics were associated with the occurrence of infectious diseases in the offspring. The observed associations appeared to depend on bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility to penicillin. Pediatric Research Foundation, Alma och K.A.

33482767,"Prioritisation for future surveillance, prevention and control of 98 communicable diseases in Belgium: a 2018 multi-criteria decision analysis study.","National public health agencies are required to prioritise infectious diseases for prevention and control. We applied the prioritisation method recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to rank infectious diseases, according to their relative importance for surveillance and public health, to inform future public health action in Belgium. We applied the multi-criteria-decision-analysis approach. A working group of epidemiologists and statisticians from Belgium (n = 6) designed a balanced set of prioritisation criteria. A panel of Belgian experts (n = 80) allocated in an online survey each criteria a weight, according to perceived relative importance. Next, experts (n = 37) scored each disease against each criteria in an online survey, guided by disease-specific factsheets referring the period 2010-2016 in Belgium. The weighted sum of the criteria's scores composed the final weighted score per disease, on which the ranking was based. Sensitivity analyses quantified the impact of eight alternative analysis scenarios on the top-20 ranked diseases. We identified criteria and diseases associated with data-gaps as those with the highest number of blank answers in the scoring survey. Principle components of the final weighted score were identified. Working groups selected 98 diseases and 18 criteria, structured in five criteria groups. The diseases ranked highest were (in order) pertussis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis C and hepatitis B. Among the five criteria groups, overall the highest weights were assigned to 'impact on the patient', followed by 'impact on public health', while different perceptions were identified between clinicians, microbiologists and epidemiologists. Among the 18 individual criteria, 'spreading potential' and 'events requiring public health action' were assigned the highest weights. Principle components clustered with thematic disease groups. Notable data gaps were found among hospital-related diseases. We ranked infectious diseases using a standardised reproducible approach. The diseases ranked highest are included in current public health programs, but additional reflection for example about needs among risk groups is recommended.

39102612,NLRP3 Inflammasomes: Dual Function in Infectious Diseases.,"The Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been the most distinctive polymer protein complex. After recognizing the endogenous and exogenous danger signals, NLRP3 can cause inflammation by pyroptosis and secretion of mature, bioactive forms of IL-1β and IL-18. The NLRP3 inflammasome is essential in the genesis and progression of infectious illnesses. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of the NLRP3 inflammasome in infectious diseases, focusing on its two-sided effects. As an essential part of host defense with a protective impact, abnormal NLRP3 inflammasome activation, however, result in a systemic high inflammatory response, leading to subsequent damage. In addition, scientific evidence of small molecules, biologics, and phytochemicals acting on the NLRP3 inflammasome has been reviewed. We believe that the NLRP3 inflammasome helps us understand the pathological mechanism of different stages of infectious diseases and that inhibitors targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome will become a new and valuable research direction for the treatment of infectious diseases.","Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2024-Aug,"Li Y, Qiang R, Cao Z, Wu Q, Wang J, Lyu W",6,1116,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34888640,Setting Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing Breakpoints: A Primer for Pediatric Infectious Diseases Specialists on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Approach.,"Breakpoints are the values used by clinical microbiology laboratories to interpret the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) and classify isolates as susceptible or resistant. Whether the breakpoints applied by laboratories accurately predict the likelihood of successful treatment with a particular antimicrobial is an issue of critical importance to quality clinical care. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sets breakpoints, and globally, breakpoints are also set by 2 standards development organizations, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST); individual laboratories may choose which breakpoints to implement. Many CLSI breakpoints are recognized by FDA, facilitating their incorporation into widely used commercial AST devices. The CLSI Subcommittee on AST's consensus approach to establishing (and as needed, revising) breakpoints involves integration of currently available microbiological, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic, and clinical data. Here, an overview of the CLSI process for establishing breakpoints is provided.",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,2022-Feb,"Pierce VM, Mathers AJ",2,1165,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38049022,Migration in French Guiana: Implications in health and infectious diseases.,"In French Guiana, more than a third of the population, and nearly half of the adults, are of foreign origin. This immigration is explained by the French standard of living, which is attractive to nationals of surrounding countries. Infectious diseases remain in the top 10 causes of premature death, often in the most precarious populations. In this context we aimed to synthesize the state of the knowledge regarding immigration and infectious diseases in French Guiana and the general implications that follow this diagnosis. For HIV, although the majority of patients are of foreign origin, estimates of the presumed date of infection based on CD4 erosion modelling and from molecular analyses suggest that the majority of transmissions in foreign-born individuals occur in French Guiana and that the Guiana shield has been a crossroad between Latin America and the Caribbean. Among key populations bridging these regions illegal gold miners are very mobile and have the greatest proportion B Caribbean HIV viruses. Gold miners have been a key vulnerable population for falciparum malaria and other tropical diseases such as leishmaniasis, leprosy, or leptospirosis. The complex history of migrations in French Guiana and on the Guiana Shield is also reflected in the fingerprinting of mycobacterium tuberculosis and the high incidence of tuberculosis in French Guiana, notably in immigrants, reflects the incidences in the countries of origin of patients. The high burden of infectious diseases in immigrants in French Guiana is first and foremost a reflection of the precarious living conditions within French Guiana and suggests that community-based proactive interventions are crucial to reduce transmission, morbidity, and mortality from infectious diseases.",Travel medicine and infectious disease,2024-,"Nacher M, Epelboin L, Bonifay T, Djossou F, Blaizot R, Couppié P, Adenis A, Lucarelli A, Lambert Y, Schaub R, Douine M",11,1766,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38523847,Evidence-based Decision Making: Infectious Disease Modeling Training for Policymakers in East Africa.,"Mathematical modeling of infectious diseases is an important decision-making tool for outbreak control. However, in Africa, limited expertise reduces the use and impact of these tools on policy. Therefore, there is a need to build capacity in Africa for the use of mathematical modeling to inform policy. Here we describe our experience implementing a mathematical modeling training program for public health professionals in East Africa. We used a deliverable-driven and learning-by-doing model to introduce trainees to the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. The training comprised two two-week in-person sessions and a practicum where trainees received intensive mentorship. Trainees evaluated the content and structure of the course at the end of each week, and this feedback informed the strategy for subsequent weeks. Out of 875 applications from 38 countries, we selected ten trainees from three countries - Rwanda (6), Kenya (2), and Uganda (2) - with guidance from an advisory committee. Nine trainees were based at government institutions and one at an academic organization. Participants gained skills in developing models to answer questions of interest and critically appraising modeling studies. At the end of the training, trainees prepared policy briefs summarizing their modeling study findings. These were presented at a dissemination event to policymakers, researchers, and program managers. All trainees indicated they would recommend the course to colleagues and rated the quality of the training with a median score of 9/10. Mathematical modeling training programs for public health professionals in Africa can be an effective tool for research capacity building and policy support to mitigate infectious disease burden and forecast resources. Overall, the course was successful, owing to a combination of factors, including institutional support, trainees' commitment, intensive mentorship, a diverse trainee pool, and regular evaluations.",Annals of global health,2024-,"Ofori SK, Dankwa EA, Ngwakongnwi E, Amberbir A, Bekele A, Murray MB, Grad YH, Buckee CO, Hedt-Gauthier BL",9,1972,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38135583,Enduring echoes: Post-infectious long-term changes in innate immunity.,"Upon encountering pathogens, the immune system typically responds by initiating an acute and self-limiting reaction, with symptoms subsiding after the pathogen has been cleared. However, long-term post-infectious clinical symptoms can manifest months or even years after the initial infection. 'Trained immunity', the functional reprogramming of innate immune cells through epigenetic and metabolic rewiring, has been proposed as a key concept for understanding these long-term effects. Although trained immunity can result in enhanced protection against reinfection with heterologous pathogens, it can also contribute to detrimental outcomes. Persisting and excessive inflammation can cause tissue damage and aggravate immune-mediated conditions and cardiovascular complications. On the other hand, suppression of immune cell effector functions by long-lasting epigenetic changes can result in post-infectious immune paralysis. Distinct stimuli can evoke different trained immunity programs, potentially resulting in different consequences for the host. In this review, we provide an overview of both the adaptive and maladaptive consequences of infectious diseases. We discuss how long-term immune dysregulation in patients can be addressed by tailoring host-directed interventions and identify areas of scientific and therapeutic potential to advance further.",European journal of internal medicine,2024-May,"Dulfer EA, Joosten LAB, Netea MG",3,1362,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

It allows clinicians to offer the most appropriate treatment more quickly. As POCT devices have increased in accuracy and become more cost-effective, their use has grown, but a systematic assessment of their use for clinical and public health management of infectious diseases in EU/EEA countries has not been previously undertaken. <b>Methods:</b> A scoping review of the literature on POCT in EU/ EEA countries as at November 2019, and a survey of key stakeholders. <b>Results:</b> 350 relevant articles were identified and 54 survey responses from 26 EU/EEA countries were analysed. POCT is available for a range of infectious diseases and in all countries responding to the survey (for at least one disease). POCT is commonly available for influenza, HIV/AIDS, Legionnaires' disease and malaria, where it is used in at least half of EU/EEA countries. While POCT has the potential to support many improvements to clinical care of infectious diseases (e.g., faster diagnosis, more appropriate use of antimicrobials), the results suggest POCT is infrequently used to support public health functions (e.g., disease surveillance and reporting). <b>Conclusion:</b> Although POCT is in use to some extent in all EU/EEA countries, the full benefits of POCT in wider public health functions have yet to be realised.

33934756,Nanomaterial application in bio/sensors for the detection of infectious diseases.,"Infectious diseases are a potential risk for public health and the global economy. Fast and accurate detection of the pathogens that cause these infections is important to avoid the transmission of the diseases. Conventional methods for the detection of these microorganisms are time-consuming, costly, and not applicable for on-site monitoring. Biosensors can provide a fast, reliable, and point of care diagnostic. Nanomaterials, due to their outstanding electrical, chemical, and optical features, have become key players in the area of biosensors. This review will cover different nanomaterials that employed in electrochemical, optical, and instrumental biosensors for infectious disease diagnosis and how these contributed to enhancing the sensitivity and rapidity of the various sensing platforms.

Different countries face unique challenges related to these diseases. This study introduces innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI) based methodologies to enhance diagnostic accuracy through the analysis of medical imagery. It achieves this by developing a mathematical model capable of identifying potential infectious diseases from images, utilizing a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) framework. This cutting-edge approach combines Hypersoft Set (HSS) within a fuzzy context, pioneering in AI-driven diagnostic processes. The decision-making process might suggest actions such as isolation, quarantine in either domestic settings or specialized facilities, or admission to a hospital for further treatment. The use of visual aids in this research not only improves understanding but also highlights the effectiveness and significance of the proposed methods. The foundational theory and the results from this novel approach demonstrate its potential for widespread application in fields like machine learning, deep learning, and pattern recognition, indicating a significant stride in the fight against infectious diseases through advanced diagnostic techniques.",Artificial intelligence in medicine,2025-Jan,"Ahsan M, Damaševičius R",2,1351,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36790531,Classical fever of unknown origin in 21 countries with different economic development: an international ID-IRI study.,"Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is a serious challenge for physicians. The aim of the present study was to consider epidemiology and dynamics of FUO in countries with different economic development. The data of FUO patients hospitalized/followed between 1st July 2016 and 1st July 2021 were collected retrospectively and submitted from referral centers in 21 countries through ID-IRI clinical research platform. The countries were categorized into developing (low-income (LI) and lower middle-income (LMI) economies) and developed countries (upper middle-income (UMI) and high-income (HI) economies). This research included 788 patients. FUO diagnoses were as follows: infections (51.6%; n = 407), neoplasms (11.4%, n = 90), collagen vascular disorders (9.3%, n = 73), undiagnosed (20.1%, n = 158), miscellaneous diseases (7.7%, n = 60). The most common infections were tuberculosis (n = 45, 5.7%), brucellosis (n = 39, 4.9%), rickettsiosis (n = 23, 2.9%), HIV infection (n = 20, 2.5%), and typhoid fever (n = 13, 1.6%). Cardiovascular infections (n = 56, 7.1%) were the most common infectious syndromes. Only collagen vascular disorders were reported significantly more from developed countries (RR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.19-3.38). FUO had similar characteristics in LI/LMI and UMI/HI countries including the portion of undiagnosed cases (OR, 95% CI; 0.87 (0.65-1.15)), death attributed to FUO (RR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.65-1.15, p-value = 0.3355), and the mean duration until diagnosis (p = 0.9663). Various aspects of FUO cannot be determined by the economic development solely. Other development indices can be considered in future analyses.

Experience in a tertiary care hospital.,"One of the most important public health concerns is the ever-growing problem of antibiotic resistance. Importantly, the rate of introduction of new molecules into clinical practice has slowed down considerably. Moreover, the rapid emergence of resistance shortens the effective 'lifespan' of these molecules. The quality of care before and after active intervention and feedback was evaluated in patients diagnosed with sepsis/septic shock or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in the ICUs of Hacettepe University Adult and Oncology Hospitals. There was a significant increase in total scores.

32942143,Advances in point-of-care nucleic acid extraction technologies for rapid diagnosis of human and plant diseases.,"Global health and food security constantly face the challenge of emerging human and plant diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other pathogens. Disease outbreaks such as SARS, MERS, Swine Flu, Ebola, and COVID-19 (on-going) have caused suffering, death, and economic losses worldwide. To prevent the spread of disease and protect human populations, rapid point-of-care (POC) molecular diagnosis of human and plant diseases play an increasingly crucial role. Nucleic acid-based molecular diagnosis reveals valuable information at the genomic level about the identity of the disease-causing pathogens and their pathogenesis, which help researchers, healthcare professionals, and patients to detect the presence of pathogens, track the spread of disease, and guide treatment more efficiently. A typical nucleic acid-based diagnostic test consists of three major steps: nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and amplicon detection. Among these steps, nucleic acid extraction is the first step of sample preparation, which remains one of the main challenges when converting laboratory molecular assays into POC tests. Sample preparation from human and plant specimens is a time-consuming and multi-step process, which requires well-equipped laboratories and skilled lab personnel. To perform rapid molecular diagnosis in resource-limited settings, simpler and instrument-free nucleic acid extraction techniques are required to improve the speed of field detection with minimal human intervention. This review summarizes the recent advances in POC nucleic acid extraction technologies. In particular, this review focuses on novel devices or methods that have demonstrated applicability and robustness for the isolation of high-quality nucleic acid from complex raw samples, such as human blood, saliva, sputum, nasal swabs, urine, and plant tissues. The integration of these rapid nucleic acid preparation methods with miniaturized assay and sensor technologies would pave the road for the ""sample-in-result-out"" diagnosis of human and plant diseases, especially in remote or resource-limited settings.",Biosensors & bioelectronics,2020-Dec,"Paul R, Ostermann E, Wei Q",3,2110,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39135523,Clinical effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 on other nationally notifiable infectious diseases in South Korea.,"This study aimed to assess the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic on nationally notifiable infectious diseases (NNIDs) in South Korea. Long-term data on seven NNIDs from 2018 to 2021 were analyzed to identify trends and change points using a change point detection technique. The timings of the NPI implementations were compared to the identified change points to determine their association. Varicella, mumps, and scarlet fever showed a significant decrease in incidence following the implementation of NPIs during the COVID-19 pandemic. These diseases, which are primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets, demonstrated a clear response to NPIs. However, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) showed an increasing trend unrelated to the timing of NPI implementation, suggesting the complex nature of controlling healthcare-associated infections. Hepatitis A, hepatitis C, and scrub typhus did not show significant changes associated with NPIs, likely due to their non-respiratory route of transmission. NPIs effectively controlled NNIDs, particularly those transmitted through respiratory infections. However, the impact varied depending on the disease. Understanding the effectiveness and limitations of NPIs is crucial for developing comprehensive public health strategies during infectious disease outbreaks.",The Korean journal of internal medicine,2024-Sep,"Lee HJ, Hwang BS, Im SH, Mun SK, Chang M",5,1383,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Although tremendous advancement continues in transplantation medicine, pediatric-specific data and evidence are limited. In Japan, the majority of TIDs had not been managed by infectious disease specialists because pediatric infectious diseases have not been recognized as a solo subspecialty until recently in Japan. However, in the last decade, there was a new movement for pediatric TID in Japan; some pediatric infectious disease specialists trained outside Japan have been playing an important role in managing pediatric TID in a few academic and pediatric institutions.

34873882,A Multicenter Study of Real-world Practice for Management of Abnormal Liver Function Tests in Children with Acute Infectious Diseases.,"Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) are commonly seen in pediatric patients with acute infectious diseases. Few studies and no definite clinical guidelines for these conditions are available. The present study aimed to elucidate the causes and factors associated with prolongation of liver enzyme elevation. We also investigated actual real-world practices in Korea. A retrospective study was performed on all patients younger than 18 years, who visited six tertiary teaching hospitals around Korea in 2018 for acute infectious diseases and showed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels above 60 IU/L without other specific conditions that could cause ALT elevation. We categorized the infections that cause LFT elevation into six groups: respiratory infection, gastrointestinal infection, urinary tract infection, other febrile disease, Epstein-Barr virus infection, and cytomegalovirus infection. We collected data on the medical specialty of the attending physician who followed up the subject, follow-up duration, percentage of follow-up loss, and their investigation. A total of 613 patients were enrolled in this study, half of whom (50.7%) were younger than 12 months. The mean initial aspartate aminotransferase and ALT values were 171.2 ± 274.1 and 194.9 ± 316.1 IU/L (range 23-2,881, 60-2,949 IU/L), respectively; however, other LFTs were within the normal range. Respiratory infection was the most common diagnosis (45.0%), and rhinovirus was the most commonly identified pathogen (9.8%). The follow-up rate was higher with pediatric gastroenterologists (90.5%) and non-gastroenterology pediatricians (76.4%) than with pediatric residents and emergency doctors. Older age was related to better ALT recovery (odds ratio [OR] of age for month = 1.003; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.001-1.004; <i>P</i> = 0.004), while the number of infection episodes (OR = 0.626; 95% CI, 0.505-0.777; <i>P</i> < 0.001) was associated with poor ALT recovery. Abdominal sonography was the most commonly used diagnostic tool (36.9%), followed by the hepatotropic virus workup. The modalities of hepatitis workup were significantly differently applied by physicians based on their specialties and institutions. Abnormal liver function test after a systemic infection was common in respiratory infection and under the age of 1 year. Age, number of infections, and initial results of LFTs were related to ALT recovery time. Inter-physician, inter-institution, and inter-specialty variances were observed in real-world practice.",Journal of Korean medical science,2021-Dec,"Lee Y, Yi DY, Lee YM, Choi SY, Choi YJ, Lee KJ",6,2516,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36869834,Ophthalmic and immunopathological characterization of systemic infectious diseases in cats.,"Ocular involvement in systemic diseases is frequent in cats; however, without concurrent clinical and ophthalmic examinations with gross and/or histologic analysis of the eye, these findings can be underdiagnosed. This article aims to provide gross, histologic, and immunohistochemical characteristics of ocular lesions from cats submitted to necropsy, focusing on those caused by systemic infectious agents. Cats that died due to a systemic infectious disease were selected based on necropsy diagnosis and presence of ocular lesions. Gross, histologic, and immunohistochemical findings were recorded. From April 2018 to September 2019, 849 eyes of 428 cats were evaluated. Histologic abnormalities were seen in 29% of cases, which were classified as inflammatory (41%), neoplastic (32%), degenerative (19%), and metabolic/vascular (8%). Macroscopic changes were present in one-third of eyes with histologic lesions. Of these, 40% were attributed to inflammatory or neoplastic diseases associated with infectious agents. The most important infectious agents causing ocular disease in this study were feline leukemia virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and <i>Cryptococcus</i> sp. The most common ocular abnormalities associated with infectious agents were uveitis (anterior, posterior, or panuveitis), optic neuritis, and meningitis of the optic nerve. Ocular lesions secondary to systemic infections in cats are frequent; however, these are not always diagnosed because gross lesions are less common than histologic lesions. Therefore, both gross and histologic evaluation of the eyes of cats is recommended, mainly for cases in which the clinical suspicion or necropsy diagnosis suggests that an infectious agent might be related to the cause of death.",Veterinary pathology,2023-May,"Wronski JG, de Cecco BS, Raiter J, Henker LC, de Lorenzo C, Bandinelli MB, Driemeier D, Pavarini SP, Sonne L",9,1762,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34892274,Design of Novel End-effectors for Robot-assisted Swab Sampling to Combat Respiratory Infectious Diseases.,"The COVID-19 outbreak has caused the mortality worldwide and the use of swab sampling is a common way of screening and diagnosis. To combat respiratory infectious diseases and assist sampling, robots have been utilized and shown promising potentials. Nonetheless, a safe, patient-friendly, and low-cost swabbing system would be crucial for the practical implementation of robots in hospitals or inspection stations. In this study, we proposed two recyclable and cost-efficient end-effector designs that can be equipped at the distal end of a robot to passively regulate or actively sense the force exerted onto patients. One way is to introduce passive compliant mechanisms with soft material to increase the flexibility of the swabbing system, while the other way is utilizing a force-sensing gripper with embedded optoelectronic sensors to actively sense the force or torque. The proposed designs were modelled computationally and tested experimentally. It is identified that the passive compliant mechanisms can increase the flexibility of the swabbing system when subjected to the lateral force and mitigate the vertical force resulted from buckling. The lateral force range that the force-sensing gripper can detect is 0-0.35 N and the vertical force range causing buckling effect that can be sensed by gripper is 1.5-2.5 N.",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

38447267,The clinical applications of immunosequencing.,"Technological advances in high-throughput sequencing have opened the door for the interrogation of adaptive immune responses at unprecedented scale. It is now possible to determine the sequences of antibodies or T-cell receptors produced by individual B and T cells in a sample. This capability, termed immunosequencing, has transformed the study of both infectious and non-infectious diseases by allowing the tracking of dynamic changes in B and T cell clonal populations over time. This has improved our understanding of the pathology of cancers, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases. However, to date there has been only limited clinical adoption of the technology. Advances over the last decade and on the horizon that reduce costs and improve interpretability could enable widespread clinical use. Many clinical applications have been proposed and, while most are still undergoing research and development, some methods relying on immunosequencing data have been implemented, the most widespread of which is the detection of measurable residual disease.

37015800,Health inequalities in infectious diseases: a systematic overview of reviews.,"The aim of this systematic overview of reviews was to synthesise available evidence on inequalities in infectious disease based on three dimensions of inequalities; inclusion health groups, protected characteristics and socioeconomic inequalities. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and OpenGrey databases in November 2021. We included reviews published from the year 2000 which examined inequalities in the incidence, prevalence or consequences of infectious diseases based on the dimensions of interest. Our search focused on tuberculosis, HIV, sexually transmitted infections, hepatitis C, vaccination and antimicrobial resistance. However, we also included eligible reviews of any other infectious diseases. We appraised the quality of reviews using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews V.2 (AMSTAR2) checklist. We conducted a narrative data synthesis. We included 108 reviews in our synthesis covering all the dimensions of inequalities for most of the infectious disease topics of interest, however the quality and volume of review evidence and consistency of their findings varied. The existing literature reviews provide strong evidence that people in inclusion health groups and lower socioeconomic status are consistently at higher risk of infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance and incomplete/delayed vaccination. In the protected characteristics dimension, ethnicity, and sexual orientation are important factors contributing to inequalities across the various infectious disease topics included in this overview of reviews. We identified many reviews that provide evidence of various types of health inequalities in different infectious diseases, vaccination, and antimicrobial resistance. We also highlight areas where reviews may be lacking. The commonalities in the associations and their directions suggest it might be worth targeting interventions for some high risk-groups that may have benefits across multiple infectious disease outcomes rather than operating purely in infectious disease siloes.",BMJ open,2023-Apr,"Ayorinde A, Ghosh I, Ali I, Zahair I, Olarewaju O, Singh M, Meehan E, Anjorin SS, Rotheram S, Barr B, McCarthy N, Oyebode O",12,2042,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38904125,Mapping the evidence on integrated service delivery for non-communicable and infectious disease comorbidity in sub-Saharan Africa: protocol for a scoping review.,"The concurrent occurrence of infectious diseases (IDs) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) presents complex healthcare challenges in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where healthcare systems often grapple with limited resources. While an integrated care approach has been advocated to address these complex challenges, there is a recognised gap in comprehensive evidence regarding the various models of integrated care, their components and the feasibility of their implementation. This scoping review aims to bridge this gap by examining the breadth and nature of evidence on integrated care models for NCDs and IDs within SSA, thereby updating the current evidence base in the domain. Based on the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) framework for scoping reviews, this study will include peer-reviewed and grey literature reporting on integrated care models for NCD-ID comorbidities in SSA. A comprehensive search of published sources in electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Health System Evidence and Research4Life) and grey literature (Google Scholar, EBSCO Open Dissertations and relevant organisational websites) will be conducted to identify sources of information reported in English from 2018 onwards. The review will consider sources of evidence reporting on integrated care model for NCDs such as diabetes; chronic cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney diseases; cancers; epilepsy; and mental illness, and comorbid IDs such as HIV, tuberculosis and malaria. All sources of evidence will be considered irrespective of the study designs or methods used. The review will exclude sources that solely focus on the differentiated or patient-centred care delivery approach, and that focus on other conditions, populations or settings. The reviewers will independently screen the sources for eligibility and extract data using a JBI-adapted data tool on the Parsifal review platform. Data will be analysed using descriptive and thematic analyses and results will be presented in tables, figures, diagrams and a narrative summary. Ethical approval is not required for this review as it will synthesise published data and does not involve human participants. The final report will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The findings will be used to inform future research.

32293833,Emerging and reemerging respiratory viral infections up to Covid-19.,"Infectious diseases remain as the significant causes of human and animal morbidity and mortality, leading to extensive outbreaks and epidemics. Acute respiratory viral diseases claim over 4 million deaths and cause millions of hospitalizations in developing countries every year. Emerging viruses, especially the RNA viruses, are more pathogenic since most people have no herd immunity. The RNA viruses can adapt to the rapidly changing global and local environment due to the high error rate of their polymerases that replicate their genomes. Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is determined as an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan. Herein we discuss emerging and reemerging respiratory viral infections till to SARS-CoV-2.",Turkish journal of medical sciences,2020-Apr,"Çelik I, Saatçi E, Eyüboğlu AF",3,837,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33917745,Mitigating Future Respiratory Virus Pandemics: New Threats and Approaches to Consider.,"Despite many recent efforts to predict and control emerging infectious disease threats to humans, we failed to anticipate the zoonotic viruses which led to pandemics in 2009 and 2020. The morbidity, mortality, and economic costs of these pandemics have been staggering. We desperately need a more targeted, cost-efficient, and sustainable strategy to detect and mitigate future zoonotic respiratory virus threats. Evidence suggests that the transition from an animal virus to a human pathogen is incremental and requires a considerable number of spillover events and considerable time before a pandemic variant emerges. This evolutionary view argues for the refocusing of public health resources on novel respiratory virus surveillance at human-animal interfaces in geographical hotspots for emerging infectious diseases. Where human-animal interface surveillance is not possible, a secondary high-yield, cost-efficient strategy is to conduct novel respiratory virus surveillance among pneumonia patients in these same hotspots. When novel pathogens are discovered, they must be quickly assessed for their human risk and, if indicated, mitigation strategies initiated. In this review, we discuss the most common respiratory virus threats, current efforts at early emerging pathogen detection, and propose and defend new molecular pathogen discovery strategies with the goal of preempting future pandemics.",Viruses,2021-Apr,"Gray GC, Robie ER, Studstill CJ, Nunn CL",4,1405,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

36925106,Over-interpretation of findings in diagnostic accuracy studies of infectious diseases.,"To assess the prevalence of overly positive interpretation, also called 'spin',-of results in diagnostic accuracy studies of infectious diseases and to identify suggestions for improvement. A PubMed search was performed to identify diagnostic accuracy studies of infectious diseases published between January and March 2019. Each article was assessed by two authors independently to identify study characteristics and forms of actual and potential over-interpretation. 'Actual over-interpretation' was defined as conclusions that were not on the basis of study aims or conclusions that were more favourable than justified by the study findings. There are other practices that may result in the over-interpretation of study findings and these have been described as 'potential over-interpretation'. The final analysis included 120 studies. Favourable or promising recommendations were made in the main text of 101 (84%) of the included studies. Evidence of actual over-interpretation (spin) was found in 30 (25%) articles, with 22 (18%) studies reporting a conclusion that did not match the study aims and 56 (47%) studies with a more positive conclusion in the abstract than the main text. All analysed studies exhibited at least one form of potential over-interpretation, with was most commonly a lack of sample size calculation (n = 109, 91%) and not reporting a null hypothesis (n = 115, 96%). Evidence of over-interpretation of results was found in one-third of the included studies.

39212633,Clinical Management of Hospitalized Patients With High-Consequence Infectious Diseases in England.,"Infectious disease physicians in England have been diagnosing and managing occasional cases of viral hemorrhagic fever since 1971, including the United Kingdom's first case of Ebola virus disease in 1976. Specialist isolation facilities to provide safe and effective care have been present since that time. Following the emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, and the avian influenza A (H7N9) outbreak in 2013, and the 2014-2016 Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa, clinical and public health preparedness and response pathways in England have been strengthened for these types of diseases, now called high-consequence infectious diseases (HCIDs). The HCID program, led by NHS England and Public Health England between 2016 and 2018, helped to deliver these enhancements, which have since been used on multiple occasions for new UK cases and outbreaks of MERS, mpox, avian influenza, and Lassa fever. Additionally, HCID pathways were activated for COVID-19 during the first 3 months of 2020, before the pandemic had been declared and little was known about COVID-19 but HCID status had been assigned temporarily to COVID-19 as a precaution. The HCID program also led to the commissioning of a network of new airborne HCID treatment centers in England, to supplement the existing network of contact HCID treatment centers, which includes the United Kingdom's only 2 high-level isolation units. In this case study, the authors describe the airborne and contact HCID treatment center networks in England, including their formation and structures, their approach to safe and effective clinical management of patients with HCIDs in the United Kingdom, and challenges they may face going forward.",Health security,2024-Sep,"Alonso A, Cohen J, Cole J, Emonts M, Karunaharan N, Meadows C, O'Hara G, Owens S, Payne B, Porter D, Ratcliffe L, Riordan A, Schmid ML, Sinha R, Tunbridge A, Whittaker E, Beadsworth M, Dunning J",18,1721,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35246236,"Epidemiological characteristics of imported respiratory infectious diseases in China, 2014‒2018.","With the progress of globalization, international mobility increases, greatly facilitating cross-border transmission of respiratory infectious diseases (RIDs). This study aimed to analyze the epidemiological characteristics and factors influencing imported RIDs, with the goal of providing evidence to support adoption of high-tech, intelligent methods to early find imported RIDs and prevent their spread in China. We obtained data of imported RIDs cases from 2014 to 2018 from the Inbound Sentinel Network of Customs and the National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System in China. We analyzed spatial, temporal, and population distribution characteristics of the imported RIDs. We developed an index to describe seasonality. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine associations between independent variables and imported cases. Data analyses and visualizations were conducted with R software. From a total of 1 409 265 253 inbound travelers, 31 732 (2.25/100 000) imported RIDs cases were reported. RIDs cases were imported from 142 countries and five continents. The incidence of imported RIDs was nearly 5 times higher in 2018 (2.81/100 000) than in 2014 (0.58/100 000). Among foreigners, incidence rates were higher among males (5.32/100 000), 0-14-year-olds (15.15/100 000), and cases originating in Oceania (11.10/100 000). The vast majority (90.3%) of imported RIDs were influenza, with seasonality consistent with annual seasonality of influenza. The spatial distribution of imported RIDs was different between Chinese citizens and foreigners. Increases in inbound travel volume and the number of influenza cases in source countries were associated with the number of imported RIDs. Our study documented importation of RIDs into China from 142 countries. Inbound travel poses a significant risks bringing important RIDs to China. It is urgent to strengthen surveillance at customs of inbound travelers and establish an intelligent surveillance and early warning system to prevent importation of RIDs to China for preventing further spread within China.",Infectious diseases of poverty,2022-Mar,"Wang JL, Chen T, Deng LL, Han YJ, Wang DY, Wang LP, He GX",7,2075,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35666334,A Data-driven Horizon Scan of Bacterial Pathogens at the Wildlife-livestock Interface.,"Many livestock diseases rely on wildlife for the transmission or maintenance of the pathogen, and the wildlife-livestock interface represents a potential site of disease emergence for novel pathogens in livestock. Predicting which pathogen species are most likely to emerge in the future is an important challenge for infectious disease surveillance and intelligence. We used a machine learning approach to conduct a data-driven horizon scan of bacterial associations at the wildlife-livestock interface for cows, sheep, and pigs. Our model identified and ranked from 76 to 189 potential novel bacterial species that might associate with each livestock species. Wildlife reservoirs of known and novel bacteria were shared among all three species, suggesting that targeting surveillance and/or control efforts towards these reservoirs could contribute disproportionately to reducing spillover risk to livestock. By predicting pathogen-host associations at the wildlife-livestock interface, we demonstrate one way to plan for and prevent disease emergence in livestock.",EcoHealth,2022-Jun,"Evans MV, Drake JM",2,1067,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35798518,Pivotal role of environmental toxicants on developing infectious diseases in LMICs: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Environmental toxicants such as chemical pollution have an enormous impact on the health of people and the planet. Emerging findings suggest that non-communicable diseases are linked to early and chronic environmental exposures. However, the rapid globalisation in developing countries, environmental change and the emergence, spread, persistence and severity of infectious diseases are not yet well understood. The aim of this study is to understand which environmental toxicants are commonly associated with infectious diseases in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). A total of four electronic databases, MEDLINE through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) be searched to identify relevant studies and will be screened by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool for randomised control trials (RCTs) and ROB assessment tool for non-randomised studies for non-RCTs will be used to assess the ROB. A meta-analysis will be used to determine the pooled effect if we find out the included articles have similar environmental exposure, participant groups, study design and outcome measures. A narrative synthesis of the findings will be provided, along with summaries of the intervention effect. Heterogeneity between the studies will be assessed, and sensitivity analysis will be conducted based on study quality. Findings will be summarised in a single manuscript. This review attempts to explore the pivotal role of environmental toxicants in predisposing, developing, persistent and severity of infectious diseases in LMICs. Findings from this study will highlight the effects of individual environmental toxicants' role on infectious disease outcomes for the early prevention and limit toxic exposure to guide individual, community, and occupational health policy for future strategies.

33283238,"Epidemiology of imported infectious diseases, China, 2014-18.","The frequent movement of population between countries brings an increasing number of travel-related infections. This study aims to define the spectrum and dynamics of imported infections observed from international travel in the Chinese mainland. Sick travellers were screened by inbound sentinel surveillance and post-travel clinic visits from 2014 to 18. The infections were classified as respiratory, gastrointestinal, vector-borne, blood/sexually transmitted and mucocutaneous. The analysed variables included the place of origin of the travellers (Chinese or foreign) and the time when travel-related infection was present (at the time of return, during travel and post-travel visits to the clinic). In total, 58 677 cases were identified amongst 1 409 265 253 travellers, with an incidence of 41.64/million, comprising during-travel incidence of 27.44/million and a post-travel incidence of 14.20/million. Respiratory infections constituted the highest proportion of illnesses during travel (81.19%, 31 393 of 38 667), which mainly came from Asian countries and tourists; with influenza virus and rhinovirus infections being mainly diagnosed. Vector-borne diseases constituted the highest proportion of post-travel illnesses (98.14%, 19 638 of 20 010), which were mainly diagnosed from African countries and labourers; with malaria and dengue fever being mainly diagnosed. The differential infection spectrum varied in terms of the traveller's demography, travel destination and travel purpose. As such, a higher proportion of foreign travellers had blood/sexually transmitted diseases (89.85%, 2832 of 3152), while Chinese citizens had a higher prevalence of vector-borne diseases (85.98%, 19 247 of 22 387) and gastrointestinal diseases (79.36%, 1115 of 1405). The highest incidence rate was observed amongst travellers arriving from Africa, while the lowest was observed amongst travellers arriving from Europe. The findings might help in preparing recommendations for travellers and also aid in primary care or other clinics that prepare travellers before trips abroad.

Additionally, to describe an accompanying opt-out antimicrobial stewardship approach that addresses provider nonresponsiveness. Prospective audit and feedback is recommended by antimicrobial stewardship guidelines; however, execution can be difficult due to labor requirements, delays in communication, and provider nonparticipation. The Norton E-ASP was developed to address these issues by reliably identifying target patients, documenting assessments, streamlining recommendation delivery, promoting handoff, and providing automated tracking of recommendation responses. Opt-out stewardship allows recommendations to be implemented if not rejected after 24 hours. A 25% reduction in target antimicrobial use has been achieved and sustained with the program. Use of the Norton E-ASP, including opt-out antimicrobial stewardship, broadened the reach and furthered the impact of infectious diseases pharmacists. Successes of this program justified addition of 3 full-time infectious diseases pharmacist positions at a large community health system.

Infection screening programmes across Europe work in disease silos with a focus on individual diseases at the time of arrival. We argue that European health-care practitioners and policy makers would benefit from developing a framework of universal health care for migrants, which proactively offers early testing and vaccinations by delivering multi-disease testing and catch-up vaccination programmes integrated within existing health systems. Such interventions should be codeveloped with migrant populations to overcome barriers faced in accessing services.

Here, we report the epidemiological features and changes in notifiable infectious diseases in China from 1986 to 2016 to explore the factors contributing to the successful control of infectious diseases and the challenges faced in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. The data of notifiable infectious diseases in China from 1986 to 2016 were collected from the monthly analysis report of the National Infectious Disease Surveillance System. Joinpoint regression models were used to examine incidence and mortality trends from 1986 to 2016. IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0, Excel 2010 and R x64 3.5.2 were used for data analysis. A total of 132 858 005 cases of notifiable infectious diseases were reported over these 31 years, with an average yearly incidence of 342.14/100 000. There were 284 694 deaths with an average yearly mortality rate of 0.73/100 000. The overall incidence and overall mortality of notifiable infectious diseases both showed a ""U"" distribution (ie, a decrease, stable, an increase, stable again). The top five diseases in terms of incidence were hand, foot and mouth disease, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis, other infectious causes of diarrhea and dysentery, accounting for 78.0% of all reported cases. The top five causes of death were HIV/AIDS, rabies, tuberculosis, viral hepatitis and epidemic encephalitis B, which accounted for 76.07% of all mortalities. The diseases with the top five fatality rates were rabies, H5N1, H7N9, HIV/AIDS and plague, with rates of 91.06%, 66.07%, 38.51%, 25.19% and 10.31%, respectively.

Sierra Leone has one of the world's highest prevalences of functional difficulties among children, but little is known about the co-occurrence of major infectious diseases and healthcare-seeking behaviours among children with disabilities. We used household survey cross-sectional data on children 2-4 years old and logistic regression models estimating ORs between functional difficulties and symptoms of infectious diseases including diarrhoea, fever and acute respiratory infection (ARI), adjusted for sex, age and stunting. We also examined whether caregivers sought advice or treatment for the illness from any source and if the child was given any treatment for the illness. There was an increased risk of fever among children with functional difficulty (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8) and children with severe functional difficulty (AOR=1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.7). Children with severe functional difficulty were also at increased risk of diarrhoea (AOR=1.8, 95% CI=1.1 to 3.3). There were no significant differences in seeking advice or treatment for diarrhoea, fever or ARI symptoms between the groups.

Understanding the factors that affect the transmission and distribution of zoonoses is necessary to identify at-risk locations and populations. The One Health approach seeks to understand, report, and interpret these factors and requires collaboration between private and governmental institutions. One Health should focus on neglected tropical diseases (NTD) and prioritize development of interventions to control and prevent the transmission of diseases that spread between animals and humans.

Increased travel and trade, growing population density, changes in urbanization, and climate have a critical impact on infectious disease spread. Currently, the world is confronted with the emergence of a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, responsible for yet more than 800 000 deaths globally. Outbreaks caused by viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, HIV, Ebola, influenza, and Zika, have increased over the past decade, underlining the need for a rapid development of diagnostics and vaccines. Hence, the rational identification of biomarkers for diagnostic measures on the one hand, and antigenic targets for vaccine development on the other, are of utmost importance. Peptide microarrays can display large numbers of putative target proteins translated into overlapping linear (and cyclic) peptides for a multiplexed, high-throughput antibody analysis. This enabled for example the identification of discriminant/diagnostic epitopes in Zika or influenza and mapping epitope evolution in natural infections versus vaccinations. In this review, we highlight synthesis platforms that facilitate fast and flexible generation of high-density peptide microarrays. We further outline the multifaceted applications of these peptide array platforms for the development of serological tests and vaccines to quickly encounter pandemic threats.",Journal of proteome research,2020-Nov,"Heiss K, Heidepriem J, Fischer N, Weber LK, Dahlke C, Jaenisch T, Loeffler FF",7,1427,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

However, based on current knowledge about drivers of disease emergence, we show that High Asia is rapidly developing conditions that favor increased emergence of infectious diseases and zoonoses. This is because of the existing prevalence of potentially serious pathogens in the system; intensifying environmental degradation; rapid changes in local ecological, socio-ecological, and socio-economic factors; and global risk intensifiers such as climate change and globalization.

34799142,"Meeting report: CEPI consultation on accelerating access to novel vaccines against emerging infectious diseases for pregnant and lactating women, London, 12-13 February 2020.","Infectious diseases may cause serious morbidity and mortality in pregnant women, their foetuses, and infants; the risk associated with any newly emerging infectious disease (EID) is likely unknown at the time of its emergence. While the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic shows that the development of vaccines against new pathogens can be considerably accelerated, the immunization of pregnant women generally lags behind the general population. Guided by the priority pathogen list for WHO's R&D Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics, this workshop sought to define the evidence needed for use of vaccines against EIDs in pregnant and lactating women, using Lassa fever as a model. Close to 60 maternal immunization (MI) and vaccine safety experts, regulators, vaccine developers, Lassa fever experts, and investigators from Lassa-affected countries examined the critical steps for vaccine development and immunization decisions for pregnant and lactating women. This paper reports on key themes and recommendations from the workshop. Current practice still assumes the exclusion of pregnant women from early vaccine trials. A shift in paradigm is needed to progress towards initial inclusion of pregnant women in Phase 2 and 3 trials. Several practical avenues were delineated. Participants agreed that vaccine platforms should be assessed early for their suitability for maternal immunization. It was noted that, in some cases, nonclinical data derived from assessing a given platform using other antigens may be adequate evidence to proceed to a first clinical evaluation and that concurrence from regulators may be sought with supporting rationale. For clinical trials, essential prerequisites such as documenting the disease burden in pregnant women, study site infrastructure, capabilities, and staff experience were noted. Early and sustained communication with the local community was considered paramount in any program for the conduct of MI trials and planned vaccine introduction.",Vaccine,2021-Dec,"Voss G, Jacquet JM, Tornieporth N, Kampmann B, Karron R, Meulen AS, Chen R, Gruber M, Lurie N, Weller C, Cramer JP, Saville M, Darko M",13,1990,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38458421,Effectiveness of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of infectious diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Early diagnosis of infectious diseases remains a challenge. This study assessed the diagnostic value of mNGS in infections and explored the effect of various factors on the accuracy of mNGS. An electronic article search of PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase was performed. A total of 85 papers were eligible for inclusion and analysis. Stata 12.0 was used for statistical calculation to evaluate the efficacy of mNGS for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. The AUC of 85 studies was 0.88 (95%CI, 0.85-0.90). The AUC of the clinical comprehensive diagnosis and conventional test groups was 0.92 (95%CI, 0.89-0.94) and 0.82 (95%CI, 0.78-0.85), respectively. The results of subgroup analysis indicated that the PLR and NLR were 12.67 (95%CI, 6.01-26.70) and 0.05 (95%CI, 0.03-0.10), respectively, in arthrosis infections. The PLR was 24.41 (95%CI, 5.70-104.58) in central system infections and the NLR of immunocompromised patients was 0.08 (95%CI, 0.01-0.62). mNGS demonstrated satisfactory diagnostic performance for infections, especially for bone and joint infections and central system infections.

Numerical simulations are deployed to account for the many factors influencing the spreading dynamics. Yet, the results from numerical simulations are often as complicated as the reality, leaving us with a sense of confusion about how the different factors account for the simulation results. Here, using a multitype branching together with a graph tensor product approach, I derive a single equation for the effective reproductive number of an infectious disease outbreak. Using this equation I deconvolute the impact of crowd management, targeted testing, contact heterogeneity, stratified vaccination, mask use, and smartphone tracing app use. This equation can be used to gain a basic understanding of infectious disease outbreaks and their simulations.",Physical review. E,2021-Mar,Vazquez A,1,863,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33472748,Progress of public health policy regarding global infectious diseases over the past decade in Japan.,"This article aims to examine progress of public health policy regarding global infectious diseases over the past decade in Japan. A narrative review was conducted, overviewing items of the Infectious Disease Committee and the Tuberculosis Committee of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare between 2010 and 2019. The mean value of items discussed in each meeting were 9.7 items. Among these items, these committees have discussed about countermeasures in terms of reduced burden of indigenous infectious diseases such as measles, rubella and pertussis, and increased risk of imported infectious diseases such as Ebola virus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, plague, avian influenza, pandemic influenza and tuberculosis. These changes regarding infectious diseases lead to loss of target population, difficulty of early detection, and market failure in old and new antibiotics and others, which requires challenge to scattered at-risk targets, effort to training and awareness, and creation of novel public health policy for research and development as well as production and supply. Over the past decade, public health policy regarding global infectious diseases have been one of the key targets under the triangle of global infectious disease, and recent experience of Coronavirus disease 2019 will further prioritize it in Japan. However, the principles of public health policy are globally vulnerable in the Post-Corona era, which can lead to the collapse of democratic way. To combat global infectious diseases without going off the road, we need to learn about the past history of public health policy.",Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,2021-Apr,Noda H,1,1621,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38047835,Key Contributions by the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute Towards New and Better Drugs for Tropical Diseases.,"Thanks to its expertise in clinical research, epidemiology, infectious diseases, microbiology, parasitology, public health, translational research and tropical medicine, coupled with deeply rooted partnerships with institutions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) has been a key contributor in many drug research and development consortia involving academia, pharma and product development partnerships. Our know-how of the maintenance of parasites and their life-cycles in the laboratory, plus our strong ties to research centres and disease control programme managers in LMICs with access to field sites and laboratories, have enabled systems for drug efficacy testing in vitro and in vivo, clinical research, and modelling to support the experimental approaches. Thus, Swiss TPH has made fundamental contributions towards the development of new drugs - and the better use of old drugs - for neglected tropical diseases and infectious diseases of poverty, such as Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, food-borne trematodiasis (e.g. clonorchiasis, fascioliasis and opisthorchiasis), human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, malaria, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiasis and tuberculosis.

39127773,Assessing vaccine efficacy for infectious diseases with variable immunity using a mathematical model.,"This study introduces an SIRS compartmental mathematical model encompassing vaccination and variable immunity periods for infectious diseases. I derive a basic reproduction number formula and assess the local and global stability of disease-free and the local stability of the endemic equilibria. I demonstrate that the basic reproduction number in the presence of a vaccine is highly sensitive to the rate of immunity loss, and even a slight reduction in this rate can significantly contribute to disease control. Additionally, I have derived a formula to calculate the critical efficacy period required for a vaccine to effectively manage and control the disease.The analysis conducted for the model suggests that increasing the vaccine's immunity duration (efficacy) decelerates disease dynamics, leading to reduced rates of reinfection and less severe disease outcomes. Furthermore, this delay contributes to a decrease in the basic reproduction number ( <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><msub><mi>R</mi> <mn>0</mn></msub> </math> ), thus facilitating more rapid disease control efforts.",Scientific reports,2024-Aug,Al-Arydah M,1,1107,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Some studies have shown that the incidence of respiratory and intestinal infectious diseases in 2020 decreased significantly compared with previous years. Interrupted time series (ITS) is a time series analysis method that evaluates the impact of intervention measures on outcomes and can control the original regression trend of outcomes before and after the intervention. This study aimed to analyse the impact of COVID-19 on the incidence rate of notifiable communicable diseases using ITS in China. National data on the incidence rate of communicable diseases in 2009-2021 were obtained from the National Health Commission website. Interrupted time series analysis using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models was used to analyse the changes in the incidence rate of infectious diseases before and after the COVID-19 epidemic. There was a significant short-term decline in the incidence rates of respiratory infectious diseases and enteric infectious diseases (step values of -29.828 and - 8.237, respectively), which remained at a low level for a long time after the decline. There was a short-term decline in the incidence rates of blood-borne and sexually transmitted infectious diseases (step = -3.638), which tended to recover to previous levels in the long term (ramp = 0.172). There was no significant change in the incidence rate of natural focus diseases or arboviral diseases before and after the epidemic. The COVID-19 epidemic had strong short-term and long-term effects on respiratory and intestinal infectious diseases and short-term control effects on blood-borne and sexually transmitted infectious diseases.

37600953,The application of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in pathogen diagnosis: a bibliometric analysis based on Web of Science.,"Infectious disease is a large burden on public health globally. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has become popular as a new tool for pathogen diagnosis with numerous advantages compared to conventional methods. Recently, research on mNGS increases yearly. However, no bibliometric analysis has systematically presented the full spectrum of this research field. Therefore, we reviewed all the publications associated with this topic and performed this study to analyze the comprehensive status and future hotspots of mNGS for infectious disease diagnosis. The literature was searched in the Web of Science Core Collection and screened without year or language restrictions, and the characteristics of the studies were also identified. The outcomes included publication years, study types, journals, countries, authorship, institutions, frontiers, and hotspots with trends. Statistical analysis and visualization were conducted using VOSviewer (version 1.6.16) and CiteSpace (version 6.1. R3). In total, 325 studies were included in the analysis after screening. Studies were published between 2009 and 2022 with a significantly increasing number from 1 to 118. Most of the studies were original articles and case reports. <i>Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology</i> and <i>Clinical Infectious Disease</i> were the most commonly cited and co-cited journals. Institutions and researchers from China contributed the most to this field, followed by those from the USA. The hotspots and frontiers of these studies are pneumonia, tuberculosis, and central nervous system infections.

33095583,Utility of Proteomics in Emerging and Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases Caused by RNA Viruses.,"Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to RNA viruses cause major negative consequences for the quality of life, public health, and overall economic development. Most of the RNA viruses causing illnesses in humans are of zoonotic origin. Zoonotic viruses can directly be transferred from animals to humans through adaptation, followed by human-to-human transmission, such as in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and, more recently, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or they can be transferred through insects or vectors, as in the case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and dengue virus (DENV). At the present, there are no vaccines or antiviral compounds against most of these viruses. Because proteins possess a vast array of functions in all known biological systems, proteomics-based strategies can provide important insights into the investigation of disease pathogenesis and the identification of promising antiviral drug targets during an epidemic or pandemic. Mass spectrometry technology has provided the capacity required for the precise identification and the sensitive and high-throughput analysis of proteins on a large scale and has contributed greatly to unravelling key protein-protein interactions, discovering signaling networks, and understanding disease mechanisms. In this Review, we present an account of quantitative proteomics and its application in some prominent recent examples of emerging and re-emerging RNA virus diseases like HIV-1, CCHFV, ZIKV, and DENV, with more detail with respect to coronaviruses (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) as well as the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.",Journal of proteome research,2020-Nov,"Sperk M, van Domselaar R, Rodriguez JE, Mikaeloff F, Sá Vinhas B, Saccon E, Sönnerborg A, Singh K, Gupta S, Végvári Á, Neogi U",11,1761,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We determined the prevalence and incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), viral hepatitis and non-viral STIs in a multicentre prospective observational cohort of multi-partner men who have sex with men (MSM) and other men. Between January 2016 and June 2017, we offered free STI testing to all men with multiple&nbsp; sexual partners (three or more in the previous 12 months), with follow-up examinations every 6 months. We used multiplex polymerase chain-reaction testing (for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium) on pooled swabs (pharynx, urethra/vagina, anus), and antibody tests for HIV and Treponema pallidum at every visit, and for hepatitis B/C at baseline. We screened 779 multi-partner MSM and 92 other men. Previously undiagnosed HIV was found in 0.5% vs 0.0%, respectively and T. pallidum antibodies in 15.3% vs 1.1%. STIs requiring antibiotic treatment comprised: active syphilis 1.7% vs 0.0%; N. gonorrhoeae 10.3% vs 0.0%; C. trachomatis 8.7% vs 1.1%. One in four MSM versus 1 in 100 other multi-partner men had any of these three STIs at baseline. 10.4% vs 1.3% had a history of hepatitis B, 31.9% vs 47.3% had no immunity (HBs-AB &lt;10 IU/l). Ten MSM had HCV antibodies (1.4%), with 8 out of the 10 being MSM with HIV; HCV seroprevalence was 0.3% among HIV-negative MSM. In MSM, incidence of the three bacterial STIs was 25.5 per year over 333 person years of follow-up, HIV incidence was 0.3%. Non-condom-use (in the last 3 months) for anal/vaginal sex was not associated with STIs. Independent risk factors were sex with men (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 16.4) and the number of sexual partners (aOR 2.3 for &gt;20). Among MSM, but not among other multi-partner men, STIs, mostly asymptomatic, are common. Given the high risk of onward transmission, low-cost or free routine screening of multi-partner MSM is a public health priority.",Swiss medical weekly,2020-Dec,"Schmidt AJ, Rasi M, Esson C, Christinet V, Ritzler M, Lung T, Hauser CV, Stöckle M, Jouinot F, Lehner A, Lange K, Konrad T, Vernazza PL",13,2124,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Studies carried out in Bangladesh have primarily focused on diarrhoea and acute respiratory tract infections independently without considering their co-occurrence effect. The present study examines the multimorbid conditions of infectious diseases in under-five Bangladeshi children. It explores multimorbidity determinants and the role of community context, which are often overlooked in previous literature. Utilizing the most recent Demographic and Health Survey of Bangladesh (2017-18), we used mixed-effects random-intercept Poisson regression models to understand the determinants of multimorbidity of infectious diseases in under-five Bangladeshi children considering the community-level characteristics. The present study found that 28% of the children experienced multimorbidity two weeks prior to the survey. Community-level variability across all the statistical models was statistically significant at the 5% level. On average, the incidence rate of multimorbidity was 1.34 times higher among children from high-risk communities than children from low-risk communities. Moreover, children residing in rural areas and other urban areas involved 1.29 [CI: 1.11, 1.51] and 1.28 [CI: 1.11, 1.47] times greater risk of multimorbidity respectively compared to children from city corporations. Additionally, the multimorbidity incidence was 1.16 times [CI: 1.03, 1.30] higher among children from high-altitude communities than children living in low-altitude communities. The significant effect of public handwashing places suggests community-based interventions among individuals to learn hygiene habits among themselves, thus, the severity of coexistence nature of infectious diseases. A higher incidence of coexistence of such infectious diseases in the poor and semi-urban populace further recommends a targeted awareness of a clean environment and primary healthcare programmes.",BMC pediatrics,2022-Mar,"Rashmi R, Paul R",2,1993,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

38150490,Design of the Global Health chemical diversity library v2 for screening against infectious diseases.,"There is a need for novel chemical matter for phenotypic and target-based screens to find starting points for drug discovery programmes in neglected infectious diseases and non-hormonal contraceptives that disproportionately affect Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). In some disease areas multiple screens of corporate and other libraries have been carried out, giving rise to some valuable starting points and leading to preclinical candidates. Whilst in other disease areas, little screening has been carried out. Much screening against pathogens has been conducted phenotypically as there are few robustly validated protein targets. However, many of the active compound series identified share the same molecular targets. To address the need for new chemical material, in this article we describe the design of a new library, designed for screening in drug discovery programmes for neglected infectious diseases. The compounds have been selected from the Enamine REAL (REadily AccessibLe) library, a virtual library which contains approximately 4.5 billion molecules. The molecules theoretically can be synthesized quickly using commercially available intermediates and building blocks. The vast majority of these have not been prepared before, so this is a source of novel compounds. In this paper we describe the design of a diverse library of 30,000 compounds from this collection (graphical abstract).

In recent years, the rapid development of nanotechnology has provided crucial technological support for the prevention, treatment, and detection of inflammation-associated diseases. Various types of nanoparticles (NPs) play significant roles, serving as vaccine vehicles to enhance immunogenicity and as drug carriers to improve targeting and bioavailability. NPs can also directly combat pathogens and inflammation. In addition, nanotechnology has facilitated the development of biosensors for pathogen detection and imaging techniques for inflammatory diseases. This review categorizes and characterizes different types of NPs, summarizes their applications in the prevention, treatment, and detection of infectious and inflammatory diseases. It also discusses the challenges associated with clinical translation in this field and explores the latest developments and prospects. In conclusion, nanotechnology opens up new possibilities for the comprehensive management of infectious and inflammatory diseases.",Signal transduction and targeted therapy,2024-Feb,"Huang Y, Guo X, Wu Y, Chen X, Feng L, Xie N, Shen G",7,1618,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37828249,Malaria & mRNA Vaccines: A Possible Salvation from One of the Most Relevant Infectious Diseases of the Global South.,"Malaria is one of the most dangerous infectious diseases in the world. It occurs in tropical and subtropical regions and affects about 40% of the world´s population. In endemic regions, an estimated 200 million people contract malaria each year. Three-quarters of all global deaths (about 600 per year) are children under 5 years of age. Thus, malaria is one of the most relevant tropical and also childhood diseases in the world. Thanks to various public health measures such as vector control through mosquito nets or the targeted use of insecticides as well as the use of antimalarial prophylaxis drugs, the incidence has already been successfully reduced in recent years. However, to reduce the risk of malaria and to protect children effectively, further measures are necessary. An important part of these measures is an effective vaccination against malaria. However, the history of research shows that the development of an effective malaria vaccine is not an easy undertaking and is associated with some complications. Research into possible vaccines began as early as the 1960s. However, the results achieved were rather sobering and the various vaccines fell short of their expectations. It was not until 2015 that the vaccine RTS,S/AS01 received a positive evaluation from the European Medicines Agency. Since then, the vaccine has been tested in Africa. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, there are new developments in vaccine research that could also benefit malaria research. These include, among others, the so-called mRNA vaccines. Already in the early 1990s, an immune response triggered by an mRNA vaccine was described for the first time. Since then, mRNA vaccines have been researched and discussed for possible prophylaxis. However, it was not until the COVID-19 pandemic that these vaccines experienced a veritable progress. mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were rapidly developed and achieved high efficacy in studies. Based on this success, it is not surprising that companies are also focusing on other diseases and pathogens. Besides viral diseases, such as influenza or AIDS, malaria is high on this list. Many pharmaceutical companies (including the German companies BioNTech and CureVac) have already confirmed that they are researching mRNA vaccines against malaria. However, this is not an easy task. The aim of this article is to describe and discuss possible antigens that could be considered for mRNA vaccination. However, this topic is currently still very speculative.",Acta parasitologica,2023-Dec,Borkens Y,1,2506,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33057040,Systematic analysis of infectious disease outcomes by age shows lowest severity in school-age children.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has ignited interest in age-specific manifestations of infection but surprisingly little is known about relative severity of infectious disease between the extremes of age. In a systematic analysis we identified 142 datasets with information on severity of disease by age for 32 different infectious diseases, 19 viral and 13 bacterial. For almost all infections, school-age children have the least severe disease, and severity starts to rise long before old age. Indeed, for many infections even young adults have more severe disease than children, and dengue was the only infection that was most severe in school-age children. Together with data on vaccine response in children and young adults, the findings suggest peak immune function is reached around 5-14 years of age. Relative immune senescence may begin much earlier than assumed, before accelerating in older age groups. This has major implications for understanding resilience to infection, optimal vaccine scheduling, and appropriate health protection policies across the life course.",Scientific data,2020-Oct,"Glynn JR, Moss PAH",2,1069,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

It is a high-priority region for many public health concerns. Rising population, increase in number of urban poverty, low government spending (in terms of % of GDP) on health, dwindling health indicators are some of the immediate concerns. Apart from this, the region is facing a dual burden of diseases, where the communicable diseases are still responsible for substantial portion of deaths, burden of non-communicable diseases is steadily increasing. These changes are explained by four main stages of epidemiological transition. Movement through these stages has resulted in a dramatic shift in the cause of death from infectious diseases and malnutrition in the first stage to cardio-vascular diseases (CVDs) and cancers in most high-income countries over the last two centuries.

39050854,The causal relationship between gut microbiota and nine infectious diseases: a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis.,"Evidence from observational studies and clinical trials has associated gut microbiota with infectious diseases. However, the causal relationship between gut microbiota and infectious diseases remains unclear. We identified gut microbiota based on phylum, class, order, family, and genus classifications, and obtained infectious disease datasets from the IEU OpenGWAS database. The two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis was then performed to determine whether the gut microbiota were causally associated with different infectious diseases. In addition, we performed reverse MR analysis to test for causality. Herein, we characterized causal relationships between genetic predispositions in the gut microbiota and nine infectious diseases. Eight strong associations were found between genetic predisposition in the gut microbiota and infectious diseases. Specifically, the abundance of class <i>Coriobacteriia</i>, order <i>Coriobacteriales</i>, and family <i>Coriobacteriaceae</i> was found to be positively associated with the risk of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). On the other hand, family <i>Acidaminococcaceae</i>, genus <i>Clostridiumsensustricto1</i>, and class <i>Bacilli</i> were positively associated with the risk of endocarditis, cellulitis, and osteomyelitis, respectively. We also discovered that the abundance of class <i>Lentisphaeria</i> and order <i>Victivallales</i> lowered the risk of sepsis. Through MR analysis, we found that gut microbiota were causally associated with infectious diseases. This finding offers new insights into the microbe-mediated infection mechanisms for further clinical research.",Frontiers in immunology,2024-,"Wang S, Yin F, Sun W, Li R, Guo Z, Wang Y, Zhang Y, Sun C, Sun D",9,1648,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

33525082,Asymptomatic transmission shifts epidemic dynamics.,"Asymptomatic transmission of infectious diseases has been recognized recently in several epidemics or pandemics. There is a great need to incorporate asymptomatic transmissions into traditional modeling of infectious diseases and to study how asymptomatic transmissions shift epidemic dynamics. In this work, we propose a compartmental model with asymptomatic transmissions for waterborne infectious diseases. We conduct a detailed analysis and numerical study with shigellosis data. Two parameters, the proportion $p$ of asymptomatic infected individuals and the proportion $k$ of asymptomatic infectious individuals who can asymptomatically transmit diseases, play major rules in the epidemic dynamics. The basic reproduction number $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ is a decreasing function of parameter $p$ when parameter $k$ is smaller than a critical value while $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ is an increasing function of $p$ when $k$ is greater than the critical value. $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ is an increasing function of $k$ for any value of $p$. When $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ passes through 1 as $p$ or $k$ varies, the dynamics of epidemics is shifted. If asymptomatic transmissions are not counted, $\mathscr{R}_{0}$ will be underestimated while the final size may be overestimated or underestimated. Our study provides a theoretical example for investigating other asymptomatic transmissions and useful information for public health measurements in waterborne infectious diseases.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2020-Nov,"Lv J, Guo S, Cui JA, Tian JP",4,1451,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32374834,Global trends in air travel: implications for connectivity and resilience to infectious disease threats.,"Increased connectivity via air travel can facilitate the geographic spread of infectious diseases. The number of travellers alone does not explain risk; passenger origin and destination will also influence risk of disease introduction and spread. We described trends in international air passenger numbers and connectivity between countries with different capacities to detect and respond to infectious disease threats. We used the Fragile States Index (FSI) as an annual measure of country-level resilience and capacity to respond to infectious disease events. Countries are categorized as: Sustainable, Stable, Warning or Alert, in order of increasing fragility. We included data for 177 sovereign states for the years 2010 to 2019. Annual inbound and outbound international air passengers for each country were obtained for the same time period. We examined trends in FSI score, trends in worldwide air travel and the association between a state's FSI score and air travel. Among countries included in the FSI rankings, the total number of outbound passengers increased from 0.865 billion to 1.58 billion between 2010 and 2019. Increasing fragility was associated with a decrease in travel volumes, with a 2.5% (95% CI: 2.0-3.1%) reduction in passengers per 1-unit increase in FSI score. Overall, travel between countries of different FSI categories either increased or remained stable. The world's connectivity via air travel has increased dramatically over the past decade. There has been notable growth in travel from Warning and Stable countries, which comprise more than three-quarters of international air travel passengers. These countries may have suboptimal capacity to detect and respond to infectious disease threats that emerge within their borders.",Journal of travel medicine,2020-Jul,"Tuite AR, Bhatia D, Moineddin R, Bogoch II, Watts AG, Khan K",6,1764,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38935698,Utilization of expert opinion in infectious diseases clinical guidelines-A meta-epidemiological study.,"Expert opinion is widely used in clinical guidelines. No research has ever been conducted investigating the use of expert opinion in international infectious disease guidelines. This study aimed to create an analytical map by describing the prevalence and utilization of expert opinion in infectious disease guidelines and analyzing the methodological aspects of these guidelines. In this meta-epidemiological study, systematic searches in PubMed and Trip Medical Database were performed to identify clinical guidelines on infectious diseases, published between January 2018 and May 2023 in English, by international organizations. Data extracted included guideline characteristics, expert opinion utilization, and methodological details. Prevalence and rationale of expert opinion use were analyzed descriptively. Methodological differences between groups were analyzed with Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U Test. The analysis covered 66 guidelines with 2296 recommendations, published/endorsed by 136 organizations. Most guidelines (79%) used systematic literature searches, 42% provided search strategies, and 38% presented screening flow diagrams and conducted risk of bias assessments. 48.5% of the guidelines allowed expert opinion, most of which included expert opinion as part of the evidence hierarchy within the grading system. Guidelines allowing expert opinion, compared to those which do not, issued more recommendations per guideline (48.82 vs.19.13, p<0.001), and reported fewer screening flow diagrams (25% vs. 65%, p = 0.002), and less risk of bias assessments (19% vs.78%, p<0.001). Expert opinion is utilized in half of assessed guidelines, often integrated into the evidence hierarchy within the grading system. Its utilization varies considerably in methodology, form, and terminology between guidelines. These findings highlight a pressing need for additional research and guidance, to improve and advance the standardization of infectious disease guidelines.",PloS one,2024-,"Nagavci B, Schwingshackl L, Martin-Loeches I, Lakatos B",4,1978,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Branded drug manufacturers face few barriers to exorbitant pricing of drugs with exclusivity-as in the cases of Sovaldi, Zyvox, and Truvada. Furthermore, albendazole, pyrimethamine, and penicillin demonstrate that generic medications without patent exclusivity are not guaranteed to have durably low costs, especially where manufacturer competition is lacking.

Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) stands as the prime nucleic acid based test that is employed for the detection of infectious diseases. The method ensures sensitivity and specificity. However, RT-PCR is a relatively expensive technique due to the requirement of costly equipment and reagents. Further, it requires skilled personnel and established laboratories that are usually inaccessible in underdeveloped areas. On the other hand, rapid antigen based techniques are cost effective and easily accessible, but are less effective in terms of sensitivity and specificity. CRISPR-Cas systems are advanced diagnostic tools that combine the advantages of both PCR and antigen based detection techniques, and allows the rapid detection with high sensitivity/specificity.

36864415,Public health emergency preparedness for infectious disease emergencies: a scoping review of recent evidence.,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to demonstrate the risks and profound health impacts that result from infectious disease emergencies. Emergency preparedness has been defined as the knowledge, capacity and organizational systems that governments, response and recovery organizations, communities and individuals develop to anticipate, respond to, or recover from emergencies. This scoping review explored recent literature on priority areas and indicators for public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) with a focus on infectious disease emergencies. Using scoping review methodology, a comprehensive search was conducted for indexed and grey literature with a focus on records published from 2017 to 2020 onward, respectively. Records were included if they: (a) described PHEP, (b) focused on an infectious emergency, and (c) were published in an Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development country. An evidence-based all-hazards Resilience Framework for PHEP consisting of 11 elements was used as a reference point to identify additional areas of preparedness that have emerged in recent publications. The findings were analyzed deductively and summarized thematically. The included publications largely aligned with the 11 elements of the all-hazards Resilience Framework for PHEP. In particular, the elements related to collaborative networks, community engagement, risk analysis and communication were frequently observed across the publications included in this review. Ten emergent themes were identified that expand on the Resilience Framework for PHEP specific to infectious diseases. Planning to mitigate inequities was a key finding of this review, it was the most frequently identified emergent theme. Additional emergent themes were: research and evidence-informed decision making, building vaccination capacity, building laboratory and diagnostic system capacity, building infection prevention and control capacity, financial investment in infrastructure, health system capacity, climate and environmental health, public health legislation and phases of preparedness. The themes from this review contribute to the evolving understanding of critical public health emergency preparedness actions. The themes expand on the 11 elements outlined in the Resilience Framework for PHEP, specifically relevant to pandemics and infectious disease emergencies. Further research will be important to validate these findings, and expand understanding of how refinements to PHEP frameworks and indicators can support public health practice.",BMC public health,2023-Mar,"Lee JM, Jansen R, Sanderson KE, Guerra F, Keller-Olaman S, Murti M, O'Sullivan TL, Law MP, Schwartz B, Bourns LE, Khan Y",11,2551,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36285663,Incorporating infectious duration-dependent transmission into Bayesian epidemic models.,"Compartmental models are commonly used to describe the spread of infectious diseases by estimating the probabilities of transitions between important disease states. A significant challenge in fitting Bayesian compartmental models lies in the need to estimate the duration of the infectious period, based on limited data providing only symptom onset date or another proxy for the start of infectiousness. Commonly, the exponential distribution is used to describe the infectious duration, an overly simplistic approach, which is not biologically plausible. More flexible distributions can be used, but parameter identifiability and computational cost can worsen for moderately sized or large epidemics. In this article, we present a novel approach, which considers a curve of transmissibility over a fixed infectious duration. The incorporation of infectious duration-dependent (IDD) transmissibility, which decays to zero during the infectious period, is biologically reasonable for many viral infections and fixing the length of the infectious period eases computational complexity in model fitting. Through simulation, we evaluate different functional forms of IDD transmissibility curves and show that the proposed approach offers improved estimation of the time-varying reproductive number. We illustrate the benefit of our approach through a new analysis of the 1995 outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",Biometrical journal.

There is a notable gap in the literature regarding the understanding of socio-discursive representations and their impact on the stigmatization and pathologization of sexual minorities in the context of communicable diseases. This study aims to discuss the understanding of the sociodiscursive aspects of the health-disease process, particularly in stigmatized infectious diseases affecting the LGBTQIAPN+ community. The focus is on examining how news articles, or the set of analyzed texts (corpus), shape these perceptions. We conducted documentary research with a qualitative and discursive approach using news articles retrieved from Google News<sup>Ⓡ</sup> about diseases affecting the LGBTQIAPN+ population from 2011 to 2022. The analysis was based on critical discourse analysis, processed using MAXQDA and IRAMUTEQ software. The identified representations predominantly align with biomedical ideology, manifesting in a discourse that normalizes and medicalizes (normative-curative discourse), and notable for its pathologizing and stigmatizing nature. Six classes were found: Ethical professional dilemmas facing stigma, infection and contamination of the LGBT+ population, prejudice and discrimination in the form of information, stigma related to sexual behavior/orientation, Vulnerability and stigma related to infectious diseases, and strategies for minimizing health risk/stigma for the LGBT+ public. The most relevant analytical categories were related to infectious diseases and sexual identity. These themes were identified, indicating that media representations reinforce stigma and maintain unequal health practices (verticalization) for the LGBT+ community. Understanding these patterns within a broader historical context is crucial for promoting health education and strategies that challenge internalized prejudice.

The public and environmental health workforce was engaged to consolidate the classified indicators (<i>n</i> = 84), and then sort and rate the consolidated indicators based on their experience with living and working in remote NT communities. Sorting of the indicators resulted in a concept map with nine built environmental domains. Essential services and Facilities for health/safety were the highest ranked domains for both chronic and infectious diseases. Within these domains, adequate housing infrastructure, water supply, drainage system, reliable sewerage and power infrastructure, and access to health services were identified as the most important contributors to the development of these diseases.

32867133,The Prediction of Infectious Diseases: A Bibliometric Analysis.,"The outbreak of infectious diseases has a negative influence on public health and the economy. The prediction of infectious diseases can effectively control large-scale outbreaks and reduce transmission of epidemics in rapid response to serious public health events. Therefore, experts and scholars are increasingly concerned with the prediction of infectious diseases. However, a knowledge mapping analysis of literature regarding the prediction of infectious diseases using rigorous bibliometric tools, which are supposed to offer further knowledge structure and distribution, has been conducted infrequently. Therefore, we implement a bibliometric analysis about the prediction of infectious diseases to objectively analyze the current status and research hotspots, in order to provide a reference for related researchers. We viewed ""infectious disease*"" and ""prediction"" or ""forecasting"" as search theme in the core collection of Web of Science from inception to 1 May 2020. We used two effective bibliometric tools, i.e., CiteSpace (Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and VOSviewer (Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands) to objectively analyze the data of the prediction of infectious disease domain based on related publications, which can be downloaded from the core collection of Web of Science. Then, the leading publications of the prediction of infectious diseases were identified to detect the historical progress based on collaboration analysis, co-citation analysis, and co-occurrence analysis. 1880 documents that met the inclusion criteria were extracted from Web of Science in this study. The number of documents exhibited a growing trend, which can be expressed an increasing number of experts and scholars paying attention to the field year by year. These publications were published in 427 different journals with 11 different document types, and the most frequently studied types were articles 1618 (83%).

39563417,Role of social innovations in health in the prevention and control of infectious diseases: a scoping review.,"The implementation of social innovations for addressing societal challenges, particularly in health, leverages community participation and technology to optimally meet social needs compared to traditional approaches. A key feature of these innovations is their ability to utilize existing capacities for contributing to resolving infectious disease outbreaks, which has attracted significant attention from health organizations. Given the potential of these innovations, this study has investigated social innovations in the prevention and control of infectious diseases as one of the major global challenges in the form of a comprehensive literature review. This review study examined the relevant literature from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2022. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 50 documents were retained and fully examined. The documents were analyzed by applying a thematic analysis, and important content related to the application of social innovations for the prevention and control of pandemic infectious diseases was extracted using a data collection form. Five major themes concerning social innovation in the prevention and control of epidemic diseases were discerned as follows: new products, novel processes and policies, empowerment, innovative practices and behaviors, and community engagement. New products include technological products for control and management of epidemics, preventive products, diagnostic and therapeutic products. Novel processes and policies are related to reorienting and reorganizing care methods, control and monitoring policies, participatory and creative strategies. Empowerment is focused on enhancing the capabilities of health workers, community leaders, and communities. Innovative practices and behaviors involve technology-based participation and support mechanisms. Community engagement is related to awareness, consultation, community mobilization, and participation in production and support. During the outbreak of infectious diseases, governments are faced with many challenges, including health, economic and social challenges.

33418439,Customer relationship management analysis of outpatients in a Chinese infectious disease hospital using drug-proportion recency-frequency-monetary model.,"Identifying the patient types with different economic values can be useful for hospital development. This work uses the theory of customer relationship management (CRM) to analyze the outpatients in the hospital for infectious diseases in Shanghai, China. A total of 2,271,020 data elements of outpatients in the research unit between August 2009 and December 2019 were extracted, analyzed and cleaned to obtain 171,107 valid data elements (1 element per person). The main diseases were viral hepatitis B (VHB) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and the average percentage of drug expenditure was 80.39 %. We innovatively expanded the classic RFM (R: recency, F: frequency, M: monetary) model in CRM to the dRFM (d: percentage of drug expenditure) model. We selected the best clustering algorithm from the K-means, Kohonen and two-step clustering methods to find the optimal model to distinguish the types of patients with different economic values and the best decision-making algorithm from the C5.0, CART classification regression tree, CHAID and QUEST algorithms to verify the model. After performing two rounds of K-means clustering analysis on three models: RFM, RFM + dRFM and dRFM, and 97,855 data elements were retained. The RFM + dRFM model was the optimal model, clustering the patients into 3 types: potential patients (24.2 %) to be retained, with a high drug expenditure and the last visit in more than 19.06 months, high-value patients (24.5 %) to be attracted, with the last visit in about 6.66 months; basal patients (51.3 %) to be kept, with the last visit in about 3.7 months. The model was then verified using the C5.0 decision tree algorithm with an accuracy rate of 99.97 %. This objective CRM analysis of the patients in the hospital for infectious diseases using the dRFM model accurately identified different types of patients, providing an objective and effective basis for hospital management.",International journal of medical informatics,2021-Mar,"Li M, Wang Q, Shen Y, Zhu T",4,1932,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38924448,Current status of diagnostic assays for emerging zoonotic viruses: Nipah and Hendra.,"Nipah and Hendra viruses belong to the Paramyxoviridae family, which pose a significant threat to human health, with sporadic outbreaks causing severe morbidity and mortality. Early symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, and headache, which offer little in terms of differential diagnosis. There are no specific therapeutics and vaccines for these viruses. This review comprehensively covers a spectrum of diagnostic techniques for Nipah and Hendra virus infections, discussed in conjunction with appropriate type of samples during the progression of infection. Serological assays, reverse transcriptase Real-Time PCR assays, and isothermal amplification assays are discussed in detail, along with a listing of few commercially available detection kits. Patents protecting inventions in Nipah and Hendra virus detection are also covered. Despite several outbreaks of Nipah and Hendra infections in the past decade, in-depth research into their pathogenesis, Point-of-Care diagnostics, specific therapies, and human vaccines is lacking. A prompt and accurate diagnosis is pivotal for efficient outbreak management, patient treatment, and the adoption of preventative measures. The emergence of rapid point-of-care tests holds promise in enhancing diagnostic capabilities in real-world settings.

Classifiers were used to recognize patterns in the spatial domain process of the collected data. Doctors reported their diagnoses when any disease presented. A flexible microservice architecture provided access and functionality to the system. combining two different domains, health and technology, is not easy, but the results are encouraging. The classifiers reported good results; the system has been well accepted by medical personnel and is proving to be cost-effective and a good solution to service disadvantaged areas. In this context, this research found the importance of certain clinical variables in the identification of infectious diseases. this work explores how to apply mobile communications, cloud services, and machine learning technology, in order to provide efficient tools for medical staff in nursing homes.

Evaluation of a disease surveillance system is important to ensure its performance over time. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of the core and support functions of the Zanzibar integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) system to determine its capacity for early detection of and response to infectious disease outbreaks. This cross-sectional descriptive study involved 10 districts of Zanzibar and 45 public and private health facilities. A mixed-methods approach was used to collect data. This included document review, observations and interviews with surveillance personnel using a modified World Health Organization generic questionnaire for assessing national disease surveillance systems. The performance of the IDSR system in Zanzibar was suboptimal particularly with respect to early detection of epidemics. Weak laboratory capacity at all levels greatly hampered detection and confirmation of cases and outbreaks. None of the health facilities or laboratories could confirm all priority infectious diseases outlined in the Zanzibar IDSR guidelines. Data reporting was weakest at facility level, while data analysis was inadequate at all levels (facility, district and national). The performance of epidemic preparedness and response was generally unsatisfactory despite availability of rapid response teams and budget lines for epidemics in each district. The support functions (supervision, training, laboratory, communication and coordination, human resources, logistic support) were inadequate particularly at the facility level. The IDSR system in Zanzibar is weak and inadequate for early detection and response to infectious disease epidemics. The performance of both core and support functions are hampered by several factors including inadequate human and material resources as well as lack of motivation for IDSR implementation within the healthcare delivery system. In the face of emerging epidemics, strengthening of the IDSR system, including allocation of adequate resources, should be a priority in order to safeguard human health and economic stability across the archipelago of Zanzibar.",BMC public health,2021-Apr,"Saleh F, Kitau J, Konradsen F, Mboera LEG, Schiøler KL",5,2214,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

36434611,The imported infections among foreign travelers in China: an observational study.,"In the past few decades, globalization has rendered more frequent and intensive population movement between countries, which has changed the original disease spectrum and brought a huge health impact on the global population including China. This study aims to describe the spectrum and epidemiological characteristics of imported infections among foreign travelers travelling to China. The data on imported infections among foreign travelers were obtained from Custom Inbound Screening System (CISS) and the National Notifiable Infectious Disease Reporting System (NNIDRS). All the infections were classified into respiratory, gastrointestinal, vector-borne, blood/sex-transmitted and mucocutaneous diseases, of which case numbers and incidences were calculated and the proportions were compared among subgroups. In total, 17,189 travelers diagnosed with 58 imported infectious diseases were reported from 2014 to 2018, with an overall incidence of 122.59 per million. Respiratory infection (7,351 cases, mainly influenza) and blood/sex-transmitted diseases (6,114 cases mainly Hepatitis B and HIV infection) were the most frequently diagnosed diseases, followed by vector-borne infections (3,128 cases, mainly dengue fever and malaria). The highest case number was from Asia and Europe, while the highest incidence rate was from Africa (296.00 per million). When specific diagnosis was compared, both the highest absolute case number and incidence were observed for influenza. An obvious seasonal pattern was observed for vector-borne diseases, with the annual epidemic spanning from July to November.

In this opinion paper we identify and characterise basic requirements that are hindering the progress of climate change and infectious disease research in Nepal. Our opinion is that immediate attention should be given to strengthening Nepal's public health surveillance system, promoting inter-sectoral collaboration, improving public health capacity, and enhancing community engagement in disease surveillance. Moreover, we advocate for greater technical support of public health researchers, and data sharing among data custodians and epidemiologists/researchers, to generate salient evidence to guide relevant public health policy formulation aimed at addressing the impacts of climate change on human health in Nepal. International studies on climate variability and infectious diseases have clearly demonstrated that climate sensitive diseases, namely vector-borne and food/water-borne diseases, are sensitive to climate variation and climate change. This research has driven the development and implementation of climate-based early warning systems for preventing potential outbreaks of climate-sensitive infectious diseases across many European and African countries. Similarly, we postulate that Nepal would greatly benefit from a climate-based early warning system, which would assist in identification or prediction of conditions suitable for disease emergence and facilitate a timely response to reduce mortality and morbidity during epidemics.",Acta tropica,2020-Apr,"Bhandari D, Bi P, Sherchand JB, Dhimal M, Hanson-Easey S",5,1725,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32673307,Data-driven contact structures: From homogeneous mixing to multilayer networks.,"The modeling of the spreading of communicable diseases has experienced significant advances in the last two decades or so. This has been possible due to the proliferation of data and the development of new methods to gather, mine and analyze it. A key role has also been played by the latest advances in new disciplines like network science. Nonetheless, current models still lack a faithful representation of all possible heterogeneities and features that can be extracted from data. Here, we bridge a current gap in the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases and develop a framework that allows to account simultaneously for both the connectivity of individuals and the age-structure of the population. We compare different scenarios, namely, i) the homogeneous mixing setting, ii) one in which only the social mixing is taken into account, iii) a setting that considers the connectivity of individuals alone, and finally, iv) a multilayer representation in which both the social mixing and the number of contacts are included in the model. We analytically show that the thresholds obtained for these four scenarios are different. In addition, we conduct extensive numerical simulations and conclude that heterogeneities in the contact network are important for a proper determination of the epidemic threshold, whereas the age-structure plays a bigger role beyond the onset of the outbreak. Altogether, when it comes to evaluate interventions such as vaccination, both sources of individual heterogeneity are important and should be concurrently considered. Our results also provide an indication of the errors incurred in situations in which one cannot access all needed information in terms of connectivity and age of the population.",PLoS computational biology,2020-Jul,"Aleta A, Ferraz de Arruda G, Moreno Y",3,1744,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

In addition to the enduring burdens of ailments like malaria and HIV, the emergence of nosocomial outbreaks driven by antibiotic-resistant pathogens underscores the ongoing threats. Furthermore, recent infectious disease crises, exemplified by the Ebola and SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, have intensified the pursuit of more effective and efficient diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. Among the promising options, antibodies have garnered significant attention due to their favorable structural characteristics and versatile applications. Notably, nanobodies (Nbs), the smallest functional single-domain antibodies of heavy-chain only antibodies produced by camelids, exhibit remarkable capabilities in stable antigen binding. They offer unique advantages such as ease of expression and modification and enhanced stability, as well as improved hydrophilicity compared to conventional antibody fragments (antigen-binding fragments (Fab) or single-chain variable fragments (scFv)) that can aggregate due to their low solubility. Nanobodies directly target antigen epitopes or can be engineered into multivalent Nbs and Nb-fusion proteins, expanding their therapeutic potential. This review is dedicated to charting the progress in Nb research, particularly those derived from camelids, and highlighting their diverse applications in treating infectious diseases, spanning both human and animal contexts.",Frontiers in immunology,2024-,"De Greve H, Fioravanti A",2,1470,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

In this article, we take a model for the spread of an infectious disease in a single town and scale it up to simulate a region containing multiple towns. The model is validated by looking at how adding additional towns and commuters influences the outbreak in a single town. We then look at how the centrality of a town within a network influences the outbreak. Our main finding is that the commuters coming into a town have a greater effect on whether an outbreak will spread to a town than the commuters going out.

Stimuli such as heat shock, osmotic stress, oxidative stress, and infections can induce the formation of SGs, which play crucial roles in regulating gene expression to help cells adapt to stress conditions. Various mRNAs and proteins are aggregated into SGs, particularly those associated with the protein translation machinery, which are frequently found in SGs. When induced by infections, SGs modulate immune cell activity, supporting the cellular response against infection. The roles of SGs differ in viral versus microbial infections, and depending on the type of immune cell involved, SGs function differently in response to infection. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the implication of SGs in immunity and cellular organelles in the context of infectious diseases.

The first pilot hub, led from Republic of Korea (South Korea), has been launched in the Asia-Pacific region, a region highly prone to outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. We present findings of mapping research undertaken in support of the hub's development. We analysed five COVID-19 research databases in September 2022 to identify research funders and intermediary funding sources supporting research in infectious diseases in the Asia-Pacific region. This was complemented with an in-depth analysis of the UK Collaborative on Development Research (UKCDR) and GloPID-R COVID-19 Research Project Tracker to assess the alignment of funded projects in the region to the WHO COVID-19 research priorities. We identified 453 funders and funding sources supporting COVID-19 research in the Asia-Pacific Region including public, private and philanthropic organisations and universities. However, these organisations were clustered in few countries in the region. The in-depth analysis of the UKCDR and GloPID-R COVID-19 Research project Tracker found limited research involving Asia-Pacific countries with the 117 funders supporting these projects investing at least US$604m in COVID-19 research in the region. Social Sciences was the dominant theme on which funded projects focused whereas the priority areas with the least number of projects were research on 'animal and environmental health' and 'ethics considerations for research'. Our analyses show the diversity of funding sources for research on infectious diseases in the Asia-Pacific region.

32839329,The duration of travel impacts the spatial dynamics of infectious diseases.,"Humans can impact the spatial transmission dynamics of infectious diseases by introducing pathogens into susceptible environments. The rate at which this occurs depends in part on human-mobility patterns. Increasingly, mobile-phone usage data are used to quantify human mobility and investigate the impact on disease dynamics. Although the number of trips between locations and the duration of those trips could both affect infectious-disease dynamics, there has been limited work to quantify and model the duration of travel in the context of disease transmission. Using mobility data inferred from mobile-phone calling records in Namibia, we calculated both the number of trips between districts and the duration of these trips from 2010 to 2014. We fit hierarchical Bayesian models to these data to describe both the mean trip number and duration. Results indicate that trip duration is positively related to trip distance, but negatively related to the destination population density. The highest volume of trips and shortest trip durations were among high-density districts, whereas trips among low-density districts had lower volume with longer duration. We also analyzed the impact of including trip duration in spatial-transmission models for a range of pathogens and introduction locations. We found that inclusion of trip duration generally delays the rate of introduction, regardless of pathogen, and that the variance and uncertainty around spatial spread increases proportionally with pathogen-generation time. These results enhance our understanding of disease-dispersal dynamics driven by human mobility, which has potential to elucidate optimal spatial and temporal scales for epidemic interventions.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2020-Sep,"Giles JR, Zu Erbach-Schoenberg E, Tatem AJ, Gardner L, Bjørnstad ON, Metcalf CJE, Wesolowski A",7,1716,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36773317,Increasing serum iron levels and their role in the risk of infectious diseases: a Mendelian randomization approach.,"Increased iron stores have been associated with elevated risks of different infectious diseases, suggesting that iron supplementation may increase the risk of infections. However, these associations may be biased by confounding or reverse causation. This is important, since up to 19% of the population takes iron supplementation. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to bypass these biases and estimate the causal effect of iron on infections. As instrumental variables, we used genetic variants associated with iron biomarkers in two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of European ancestry participants. For outcomes, we used GWAS results from the UK Biobank, FinnGen, the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative or 23andMe, for seven infection phenotypes: 'any infections', combined, COVID-19 hospitalization, candidiasis, pneumonia, sepsis, skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) and urinary tract infection (UTI). Most of our analyses showed increasing iron (measured by its biomarkers) was associated with only modest changes in the odds of infectious outcomes, with all 95% odds ratios confidence intervals within the 0.88 to 1.26 range. However, for the three predominantly bacterial infections (sepsis, SSTI, UTI), at least one analysis showed a nominally elevated risk with increased iron stores (P <0.05). Using MR, we did not observe an increase in risk of most infectious diseases with increases in iron stores. However for bacterial infections, higher iron stores may increase odds of infections. Hence, using genetic variation in iron pathways as a proxy for iron supplementation, iron supplements are likely safe on a population level, but we should continue the current practice of conservative iron supplementation during bacterial infections or in those at high risk of developing them.",International journal of epidemiology,2023-Aug,"Butler-Laporte G, Farjoun Y, Chen Y, Hultström M, Liang KYH, Nakanishi T, Su CY, Yoshiji S, Forgetta V, Richards JB",10,1803,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Several methods are available for performing AST including broth microdilution, agar dilution, and disk diffusion. Technological advances such as the development of commercial automated susceptibility testing platforms and the advent of rapid diagnostic tests have improved the rapidity, robustness, and clinical application of AST. Numerous accrediting and regulatory agencies are involved in the process of AST and setting and revising breakpoints, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Challenges to optimizing AST include the emergence of new resistance mechanisms, the development of new antimicrobial agents, and generation of new data requiring updates and revisions to established methods and breakpoints. Together, the challenges in AST methods and their interpretation create important opportunities for well-informed clinicians to improve patient outcomes and provide value to antimicrobial stewardship programs, especially in the setting of rapidly changing and increasing AMR. Addressing AST challenges will involve continued development of new technologies along with collaboration between clinicians and the laboratory to facilitate optimal antimicrobial use, combat the increasing burden of AMR, and inform the development of novel antimicrobials.

38257319,Review on the Applications of Selected Metal-Based Complexes on Infectious Diseases.,"Fatalities caused by infectious diseases (i.e., diseases caused by parasite, bacteria, and viruses) have become reinstated as a major public health threat globally. Factors such as antimicrobial resistance and viral complications are the key contributors to the death numbers. As a result, new compounds with structural diversity classes are critical for controlling the virulence of pathogens that are multi-drug resistant. Derivatization of bio-active organic molecules with organometallic synthons is a promising strategy for modifying the inherent and enhanced properties of biomolecules. Due to their redox chemistry, bioactivity, and structural diversity, organometallic moieties make excellent candidates for lead structures in drug development. Furthermore, organometallic compounds open an array of potential in therapy that existing organic molecules lack, i.e., their ability to fulfill drug availability and resolve the frequent succumbing of organic molecules to drug resistance. Additionally, metal complexes have the potential towards metal-specific modes of action, preventing bacteria from developing resistance mechanisms. This review's main contribution is to provide a thorough account of the biological efficacy (in vitro and in vitro) of metal-based complexes against infectious diseases.

32782357,Constitutive immune mechanisms: mediators of host defence and immune regulation.,"The immune system enables organisms to combat infections and to eliminate endogenous challenges. Immune responses can be evoked through diverse inducible pathways. However, various constitutive mechanisms are also required for immunocompetence. The inducible responses of pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system and antigen-specific receptors of the adaptive immune system are highly effective, but they also have the potential to cause extensive immunopathology and tissue damage, as seen in many infectious and autoinflammatory diseases. By contrast, constitutive innate immune mechanisms, including restriction factors, basal autophagy and proteasomal degradation, tend to limit immune responses, with loss-of-function mutations in these pathways leading to inflammation. Although they function through a broad and heterogeneous set of mechanisms, the constitutive immune responses all function as early barriers to infection and aim to minimize any disruption of homeostasis. Supported by recent human and mouse data, in this Review we compare and contrast the inducible and constitutive mechanisms of immunosurveillance.",Nature reviews.

34662353,Timely surveillance and temporal calibration of disease response against human infectious diseases.,"Disease surveillance and response are critical components of epidemic preparedness. The disease response, in most cases, is a set of reactive measures that follow the outcomes of the disease surveillance. Hence, timely surveillance is a prerequisite for an effective response. We apply epidemiological soundness criteria in combination with the Latent Influence Point Process and time-to-event models to construct a disease spread network. The network implicitly quantifies the fertility (whether a case leads to secondary cases) and reproduction (number of secondary cases per infectious case) of the cases as well as the size and generations (of the infection chain) of the outbreaks. We test our approach by applying it to historic dengue case data from Australia. Using the data, we empirically confirm that high morbidity relates positively with delay in disease response. Moreover, we identify what constitutes timely surveillance by applying various thresholds of disease response delay to the network and report their impact on case fertility, reproduction, number of generations and ultimately, outbreak size. We observe that enforcing a response delay threshold of 5 days leads to a large average reduction across all parameters (occurrence 87%, reproduction 83%, outbreak size 80% and outbreak generations 47%), whereas extending the threshold to 10 days, in comparison, significantly limits the effectiveness of the response actions. Lastly, we identify the components of the disease surveillance system that can be calibrated to achieve the identified thresholds. We identify practically achievable, timely surveillance thresholds (on temporal scale) that lead to an effective response and identify how they can be satisfied. Our approach can be utilized to provide guidelines on spatially and demographically targeted resource allocation for public awareness campaigns as well as to improve diagnostic abilities and turn-around times for the doctors and laboratories involved.",PloS one,2021-,"Najeebullah K, Liebig J, Darbro J, Jurdak R, Paini D",5,1990,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34134644,Vaccine completion and infectious diseases screening in a cohort of adult refugees following resettlement in the U.S.: 2013-2015.,"Refugees are frequently not immune to vaccine-preventable infections. Adherence to consensus guidelines on vaccination and infectious diseases screening among refugees resettling in the U.S. is unknown. We sought to determine rates of vaccine completion and infectious diseases screening in refugees following resettlement. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of refugees resettling in a region in the U.S. using medical data from June 2013-April 2015. We determined the proportion of vaccine-eligible refugees vaccinated with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), hepatitis A/B, tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap), and human papillomavirus (HPV) following resettlement. We also determined the proportion of refugees who completed HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) screening. One hundred and eleven subjects were included, primarily from Iraq (53%), Afghanistan (19%), and Eritrea (11%). Of the 84 subjects who were vaccine-eligible, 78 (93%) initiated and 42 (50%) completed vaccinations within one year of resettlement. Odds of completing vaccination were higher for men (OR: 2.38; 95%CI:1.02-5.71) and for subjects with English proficiency (OR: 3.70; 95%CI:1.04-17.49). Of the 78 subjects (70%) completing HIV screening, two (3%) were diagnosed with HIV. Nearly all subjects completed screening for HCV, and one had active infection. While most refugees initiate vaccinations, only 50% completed vaccinations and 70% completed HIV screening within 1 year of resettlement. There is a need to emphasize vaccine completion and HIV screening in refugee patients following resettlement.",BMC infectious diseases,2021-Jun,"Mohareb AM, Brown B, Ikuta KS, Hyle EP, Annamalai A",5,1590,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38937833,"Burden and trends of infectious disease mortality attributed to air pollution, unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene, and non-optimal temperature globally and in different socio-demographic index regions.","Environmental factors greatly impact infectious disease-related mortality, yet there's a lack of comprehensive global studies on the contemporary burden and trends. This study aims to evaluate the global burden and trends of infectious disease mortality caused by air pollution, unsafe water, poor sanitation, and non-optimal temperature across Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) regions from 1990 to 2019. This observational study utilized data from the Global Burden of Diseases Study to examine mortality rates from infectious diseases attributed to environmental risk factors between 1990 and 2019, including air pollution, unsafe water, sanitation, handwashing facilities (UWSH), and non-optimal temperatures. Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) and estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) were utilized to present infectious disease mortality, and its trajectory influenced by environmental risk factors over the years. Nonlinear regression was conducted to explore the association between the SDI and ASMRs across regions from 1990 to 2019. In 2019, global infectious disease deaths linked to air pollution, UWSH, and non-optimal temperature reached a startling 2,556,992. Disease mortality varied widely across SDI regions, with the highest number of deaths due to air pollution and UWSH in Low SDI regions, and deaths from non-optimal temperature primarily in High SDI regions. Age disparities emerged, with children under five and the elderly most affected. However, an increasing mortality trend was observed among seniors (65-69, 75-79, and over 80) in High SDI regions due to enteric infections linked to UWSH. Globally, a consistent decrease in ASMR was seen from 1990 to 2019 for all diseases connected to these factors, except for respiratory infections linked to non-optimal temperature. Our study underscores the significant impact of air pollution, UWSH, and non-optimal temperatures on global infectious disease mortality, particularly among vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly. It's important to tackle these challenges with targeted interventions aiming to enhance environmental quality, improve water and sanitation systems, and control extreme temperatures. In addition, international cooperation is essential for bridging regional disparities and driving global public health initiatives forward, thereby helping achieve Sustainable Development Goals more effectively.",Global health research and policy,2024-Jun,"Liu Q, Deng J, Yan W, Qin C, Du M, Wang Y, Zhang S, Liu M, Liu J",9,2410,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34656945,Characterization of Keterah orthonairovirus and evaluation of therapeutic candidates against Keterah orthonairovirus infectious disease.,"The species Keterah orthonairovirus is a member of the genus Orthonairovirus. Few studies have focused on this species, and there remains no treatment for Issyk-Kul fever, an infectious disease caused by a Keterah orthonairovirus. This study was performed to characterize this species using two viruses, Issyk-Kul virus (ISKV) and Soft tick bunyavirus (STBV), in cell culture and type I interferon receptor knockout (IFNAR-/-) mice and to evaluate the efficacy of serum transfusion using a mouse model of ISKV infection. The two viruses replicated in many kinds of mammal- and tick-derived cell lines but showed few different characteristics in tropism and antigenicity against anti-viral sera in cell culture. Neither virus caused clinical signs in wild-type mice, but both caused lethal infection in IFNAR-/- mice. ISKV caused more acute death than STBV in IFNAR-/- mice. In both viral infections in IFNAR-/- mice, macroscopic abnormalities were prominent in the liver. Similar levels of viral genome between ISKV- and STBV-infected IFNAR-/- mice were observed in blood, liver, lymphoid tissues and adrenal gland at moribund stages. Hematologic abnormalities in IFNAR-/- mice infected with these viruses, including leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, and biochemical abnormalities indicating liver damage were prominent. In addition, blood levels of many kinds of cytokines and chemokines such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were elevated. ISKV-immunized serum transfusion after infection delayed the time to death of IFNAR-/- mice. Thus, the present study showed that the species Keterah orthonairovirus could proliferate in most mammal-derived cell lines and cause severe liver lesions and death in IFNAR-/- mice and that serum transfusion might be effective in treatment against Issyk-Kul fever.",Ticks and tick-borne diseases,2022-Jan,"Sugimoto S, Suda Y, Nagata N, Fukushi S, Yoshikawa T, Kurosu T, Mizutani T, Saijo M, Shimojima M",9,1923,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

During last two decades experimental data has been accumulated showing the potential of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of infectious diseases. In addition, COVID-19 pandemic has created a novel landscape for opportunistic fungal infections in post-COVID-19 patients resulting from severe immune suppression. We analyze recent results on targeting ""pan-antigens"" shared by fungal pathogens in mouse models and in healthy dogs; on developing RIT of prosthetic joint infections (PJI); examine RIT as potential human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cure strategy and analyze its mechanisms and safety. Literature review was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar and includes relevant articles from 2000 to 2022. Some of the RIT of infection applications can, hopefully, be moved into the clinic earlier than others after preclinical development: (1) RIT of opportunistic fungal infections might contribute to saving lives as current antifungal drugs do not work in severely immunocompromised patients; (2) RIT of patients with PJI. Success of RIT in these patients will allow to expand the application of RIT to other similarly vulnerable patients' populations such as cancer patients with weakened immune system and organ transplant recipients.",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,2023-Apr,"Carvalho JLC, Dadachova E",2,1365,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We describe the burden of site-specific infectious diseases among Chinese adults. From 2004 to 2008, the prospective China Kadoorie Biobank enrolled 512,726 adults aged 30-79 years from 10 diverse areas (5 rural, 5 urban) of China. During the 12 years of follow-up, 101,673 participants were hospitalized for any infectious disease. Descriptive analyses examined standardized incidence, mortality and case fatality of infections. The incidence of any infectious disease was 1856 per 100,000 person-years; respiratory tract infections (1069) were most common. The infectious disease mortality rate was 31.8 per 100,000 person-years (20.3 and 9.4 for respiratory and non-respiratory infections, respectively) and case fatality was 2.2% (2.6% and 1.6% for respiratory and non-respiratory infections, respectively). Infectious disease incidence and mortality rates were higher at older ages and in rural areas. There were no clear sex differences in infectious disease incidence rates, but mortality and case fatality rates were twice as high in men as in women. Infectious diseases were common in Chinese adults. The observed burden of, and disparities in, site-specific infections can inform targeted prevention efforts.

39148009,A novel method to select time-varying multivariate time series models for the surveillance of infectious diseases.,"Describing the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases across different regions is crucial for effective disease surveillance. The multivariate time series (MTS) model has been widely adopted for constructing cross-regional infectious disease transmission networks due to its strengths in interpretability and predictive performance. Nevertheless, the assumption of constant parameters frequently disregards the dynamic shifts in disease transmission rates, thereby compromising the accuracy of early warnings. This study investigated the applicability of time-varying MTS models in multi-regional infectious disease monitoring and explored strategies for model selection. This study focused on two prominent time-varying MTS models: the time-varying parameter-stochastic volatility-vector autoregression (TVP-SV-VAR) model and the time-varying VAR model using the generalized additive framework (tvvarGAM), and intended to explore and verify their applicable conditions for the surveillance of infectious diseases. For the first time, this study proposed the time delay coefficient and spatial sparsity indicators for model selection. These indicators quantify the temporal lags and spatial distribution of infectious disease data, respectively. Simulation study adopted from real-world infectious disease surveillance was carried out to compare model performances under various scenarios of spatio-temporal variation as well as random volatility. Meanwhile, we illustrated how the modelling process could help the surveillance of infectious diseases with an application to the influenza-like case in Sichuan Province, China. When the spatio-temporal variation was small (time delay coefficient: 0.1-0.2, spatial sparsity:0.1-0.3), the TVP-SV-VAR model was superior with smaller fitting residuals and standard errors of parameter estimation than those of the tvvarGAM model. In contrast, the tvvarGAM model was preferable when the spatio-temporal variation increased (time delay coefficient: 0.2-0.3, spatial sparsity: 0.6-0.9). This study emphasized the importance of considering spatio-temporal variations when selecting appropriate models for infectious disease surveillance. By incorporating our novel indicators-the time delay coefficient and spatial sparsity-into the model selection process, the study could enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of infectious disease monitoring efforts. This approach was not only valuable in the context of this study, but also has broader implications for improving time-varying MTS analyses in various applications.",BMC infectious diseases,2024-Aug,"Yu J, Wang H, Chen M, Han X, Deng Q, Yang C, Zhu W, Ma Y, Yin F, Weng Y, Yang C, Zhang T",12,2566,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This narrative review describes the current body of literature on ML for clinical decision support in infectious diseases (ID). We aim to inform clinicians about the use of ML for diagnosis, classification, outcome prediction and antimicrobial management in ID. References for this review were identified through searches of MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, biorXiv, ACM Digital Library, arXiV and IEEE Xplore Digital Library up to July 2019. We found 60 unique ML-clinical decision support systems (ML-CDSS) aiming to assist ID clinicians. Overall, 37 (62%) focused on bacterial infections, 10 (17%) on viral infections, nine (15%) on tuberculosis and four (7%) on any kind of infection. Among them, 20 (33%) addressed the diagnosis of infection, 18 (30%) the prediction, early detection or stratification of sepsis, 13 (22%) the prediction of treatment response, four (7%) the prediction of antibiotic resistance, three (5%) the choice of antibiotic regimen and two (3%) the choice of a combination antiretroviral therapy. The ML-CDSS were developed for intensive care units (n = 24, 40%), ID consultation (n = 15, 25%), medical or surgical wards (n = 13, 20%), emergency department (n = 4, 7%), primary care (n = 3, 5%) and antimicrobial stewardship (n = 1, 2%). Fifty-three ML-CDSS (88%) were developed using data from high-income countries and seven (12%) with data from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The evaluation of ML-CDSS was limited to measures of performance (e.g. sensitivity, specificity) for 57 ML-CDSS (95%) and included data in clinical practice for three (5%). Considering comprehensive patient data from socioeconomically diverse healthcare settings, including primary care and LMICs, may improve the ability of ML-CDSS to suggest decisions adapted to various clinical contexts.

This study aimed to evaluate healthcare-seeking behavior and out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure in a sample of the population in Erbil, Iraq. We conducted this cross-sectional study in Erbil, Kurdistan Region of Iraq, from October to December 2023. A convenience sample of 414 adults completed a self-administered online survey. The following data were collected: recent illness, sociodemographic characteristics, type of healthcare received, and cost of healthcare. The most common health conditions reported were communicable diseases (16.3%), musculoskeletal problems (13.1%), and noncommunicable diseases (12.7%). Approximately 85% of patients with health conditions requiring care sought healthcare; most visited private clinics (46.3%) and private hospitals (18.6%). The median total out-of-pocket healthcare expenditure in US dollars was 117.3 (interquartile range (IQR) = 45.6-410.0). The median total cost was much greater for participants who first visited a private health facility (USD 135.5, IQR = 57.3-405.6) than those who first visited a public facility (USD 76.8, IQR = 16.1-459.7). Participants ≥ 60 years spent significantly more than those < 14 years (USD 332, 95% CI = 211-453, p < 0.001). Evermarried participants spent significantly more than unmarried (USD 97, 95% CI = 1 to 192, p = 0.047). Health expenditures were significantly greater for noncommunicable diseases than infectious diseases (USD 232, 95% CI = 96-368, p = 0.001). After adjusting for covariates, age ≥ 60 years was independently associated with higher spending (USD 305, 95% CI = 153-457, p < 0.001). Most participants sought care from formal health services, preferring the private sector. Seeking care from private facilities incurred significantly higher costs than seeking care from public ones, which suggests potential barriers to accessing healthcare, particularly affordability. The findings underscore the importance of evaluating existing healthcare policies to enhance effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. This study can help policymakers and healthcare providers design effective interventions, allocate resources efficiently, and improve healthcare delivery.","Journal of health, population, and nutrition",2024-Aug,"Shabila NP, Mahmood KA, M-Amin KM, Mahmood KI, Saleh AM",5,2375,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Rapid scoping review. Literature review with fixed search terms, up to 1 April 2020. Central tendency and variation of the parameter estimates for infectious period in (A) asymptomatic and (B) symptomatic cases from (1) virological studies (repeated testing), (2) tracing studies and (3) modelling studies were gathered. Narrative review of viral dynamics. Search strategies developed and the following searched: PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Additionally, the Health Information Quality Authority (Ireland) viral load synthesis was used, which screened literature from PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, NHS evidence, Cochrane, medRxiv and bioRxiv, and HRB open databases. There was substantial variation in the estimates, and how infectious period was inferred. One study provided approximate median infectious period for asymptomatic cases of 6.5-9.5 days. Median presymptomatic infectious period across studies varied over <1-4 days. Estimated mean time from symptom onset to two negative RT-PCR tests was 13.4 days (95% CI 10.9 to 15.8) but was shorter when studies included children or less severe cases. Estimated mean duration from symptom onset to hospital discharge or death (potential maximal infectious period) was 18.1 days (95% CI 15.1 to 21.0); time to discharge was on average 4 days shorter than time to death. Viral dynamic data and model infectious parameters were often shorter than repeated diagnostic data. There are limitations of inferring infectiousness from repeated diagnosis, viral loads and viral replication data alone and also potential patient recall bias relevant to estimating exposure and symptom onset times.

The number of cases of NID (n = 42) between January and September 2019 and 2020 were obtained from the open database from Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. The number of NID cases was 21,895 between January and September 2020, which was lower than the number of cases during the same period in 2019 (n = 24,469), with a decline in incidence from 102.9 to 91.7 per 100,000 people in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Fourteen airborne/droplet, 11 fecal-oral, seven vector-borne, and four direct-contact transmitted NID had an overall reduction of 2700 (-28.1%), 156 (-23.0%), 557 (-54.8%), and 73 (-45.9%) cases, respectively, from 2019 to 2020. Similar trends were observed for the changes in incidence, which were 11.5 (-28.4%), 6.7 (-23.4%), 2.4 (-55.0%), and 0.3 (-46.2%) per 100,000 people for airborne/droplet, fecal-oral, vector-borne, and direct-contact transmitted NID, respectively. In addition, all the 38 imported NID showed a reduction of 632 (-73.5%) cases from 2019 to 2020.

It has also become clear that such inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) frequently present clinically not only with autoimmune diseases, but also frequently have increased susceptibility to infection. The genes associated with monogenic autoimmunity influence diverse functional pathways, and the resulting immune dysregulation also impacts the complex and coordinated immune response to pathogens, for example type I interferon and cytokine signaling, the complement pathway and proper differentiation of the immune response.

38734210,New technologies in therapeutic antibody development: The next frontier for treating infectious diseases.,"Adaptive immunity to viral infections requires time to neutralize and clear viruses to resolve infection. Fast growing and pathogenic viruses are quickly established, are highly transmissible and cause significant disease burden making it difficult to mount effective responses, thereby prolonging infection. Antibody-based passive immunotherapies can provide initial protection during acute infection, assist in mounting an adaptive immune response, or provide protection for those who are immune suppressed or immune deficient. Historically, plasma-derived antibodies have demonstrated some success in treating diseases caused by viral pathogens; nonetheless, limitations in access to product and antibody titer reduce success of this treatment modality. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have proven an effective alternative, as it is possible to manufacture highly potent and specific mAbs against viral targets on an industrial scale. As a result, innovative technologies to discover, engineer and manufacture specific and potent antibodies have become an essential part of the first line of treatment in pathogenic viral infections. However, a mAb targeting a specific epitope will allow escape variants to outgrow, causing new variant strains to become dominant and resistant to treatment with that mAb. Methods to mitigate escape have included combining mAbs into cocktails, creating bi-specific or antibody drug conjugates but these strategies have also been challenged by the potential development of escape mutations. New technologies in developing antibodies made as recombinant polyclonal drugs can integrate the strength of poly-specific antibody responses to prevent mutational escape, while also incorporating antibody engineering to prevent antibody dependent enhancement and direct adaptive immune responses.",Antiviral research,2024-Jul,"Keating SM, Higgins BW",2,1821,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

35675285,Infectious diseases in free-range compared to conventional poultry production.,"Commercial chicken production for the supply of meat and eggs has expanded in the scale and variety of production systems in use to facilitate the supply of a range of cost-effective products in response to consumer demand. In the egg sector, traditional cage systems were required to be replaced in the EU by 2012, and most of this production capacity has been replaced by colony cage systems, which provide more space, perching, and environmental enrichment. In some countries there is significant production of ""cage-free"" or ""barn"" eggs in which the birds remain housed, but have access to litter. In the UK most egg production is now free-range. Meat poultry is produced in ""barn"" systems with various enrichments and some free-range. The rise in free-range production has seen the return of some diseases. Biosecurity is a critical tool for disease control in all production systems, particularly when disease challenge is high or farms are in a high poultry density area. An infectious dose of a pathogen is important in determining outcomes in terms of health and productivity, so biosecurity, hygiene, and good management are important across many diseases. Infections which are notifiable, of zoonotic importance and those which are sporadic or endemic in commercial poultry production are reviewed. General principles of preventative medicine applicable to the control of infectious diseases in different poultry production systems are proposed in areas such as biosecurity, system design and maintenance, range, and vaccination, though good management is always important.",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,2022-Oct,McMullin P,1,1584,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39488038,FGL2: A new target molecule for coagulation and immune regulation in infectious disease.,"Infectious diseases are complex inflammatory-immunologic host responses caused by various pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi. In the process of infectious disease development, immune cells are activated, and a substantial number of inflammatory factors are released within the endothelium, which results in coagulation activation and the formation of intravascular thrombi. Furthermore, infection-induced hypercoagulability amplifies the inflammatory response and immune dysregulation. Emerging evidence suggests that fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) has a crucial role in facilitating procoagulant, pro-inflammatory, and immune-regulatory responses in various infectious diseases. This review illustrates the complex procoagulation and immunoregulatory roles of FGL2, suggesting it could be a target for novel immune interventions in intractable infectious diseases.",International immunopharmacology,2024-Dec,"Wang C, Sun H, Wang R, Ma X, Sun Y",5,891,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38849257,Freshwater sports and infectious diseases: A narrative review.,"Freshwater sports involve a wide range of practices leading to contact with soil and water that can entail exposure to agents of potential infectious diseases. The pathogens can be multiple (bacteria, parasites, viruses, fungi), and be either well-known or more unfamiliar and exotic. We conducted a literature review to describe various infections contracted following exposure to water and mud during freshwater sport activities. Out of the 1011 articles identified, 50 were finally included. Our findings encompassed bacterial infections (leptospirosis and gastrointestinal infections); parasitic infections (schistosomiasis, cercarial dermatitis); viral infections (norovirus and other gastrointestinal viruses; seaweed contamination; and fungal infections. These infections were reported in various countries worldwide among diverse freshwater sport activities, including swimming, surfing, kayaking, as well as extreme sports such as adventure races and mud runs. Water sports in freshwater can expose participants to infectious risks according to geographical location and type of sport. Because regular sport practice is beneficial for health, freshwater sports should not be avoided due to potential exposure to pathogens; that much said, certain precautions should be taken. In addition to adoption of preventive measures, participants should be informed about infectious risks and seek medical advice if symptoms appear after exposure. Current guidelines for assessment of bathing water quality do not suffice to ensure comprehensive evaluation of freshwater quality. Event organizers are called upon to pay close attention to environmental factors and meteorological events, to conduct timely sensitization campaigns, and to enforce appropriate safety measures.",Infectious diseases now,2024-Jun,"Delamare H, Septfons A, Alfandari S, Mailles A",4,1773,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

As a new pathogen detection method, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has a wide detection range and can detect bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, rare pathogens, and even unknown pathogens. The technique of mNGS is unbiased and can rapidly, efficiently, and accurately obtain all nucleic acid information in test samples, analyze pathogens, and guide clinical diagnosis and treatment, thereby playing an important role in complicated infectious diseases.

38372324,Microfluidic systems for infectious disease diagnostics.,"Microorganisms, encompassing both uni- and multicellular entities, exhibit remarkable diversity as omnipresent life forms in nature. They play a pivotal role by supplying essential components for sustaining biological processes across diverse ecosystems, including higher host organisms. The complex interactions within the human gut microbiota are crucial for metabolic functions, immune responses, and biochemical signalling, particularly through the gut-brain axis. Viruses also play important roles in biological processes, for example by increasing genetic diversity through horizontal gene transfer when replicating inside living cells. On the other hand, infection of the human body by microbiological agents may lead to severe physiological disorders and diseases. Infectious diseases pose a significant burden on global healthcare systems, characterized by substantial variations in the epidemiological landscape. Fast spreading antibiotic resistance or uncontrolled outbreaks of communicable diseases are major challenges at present. Furthermore, delivering field-proven point-of-care diagnostic tools to the most severely affected populations in low-resource settings is particularly important and challenging. New paradigms and technological approaches enabling rapid and informed disease management need to be implemented. In this respect, infectious disease diagnostics taking advantage of microfluidic systems combined with integrated biosensor-based pathogen detection offers a host of innovative and promising solutions. In this review, we aim to outline recent activities and progress in the development of microfluidic diagnostic tools. Our literature research mainly covers the last 5 years. We will follow a classification scheme based on the human body systems primarily involved at the clinical level or on specific pathogen transmission modes.

This study more focused on the prevalence of communicable diseases, including COVID-19 that is an emerging pandemic, which affects the global economy. The objective of the study is to examine the impact of population density, lack of sanitation facilities, chemical concentration, fossil fuel combustions, poverty incidence, and healthcare expenditures on communicable diseases including COVID-19. The study covered a large panel of heterogenous countries to assess the relationships between the stated factors by using the robust least square regression, Granger causality test, and innovation accounting matrix. The study used a time series data from 2010 to 2019 for assessing the determinants of communicable diseases, while it is further extended with the current data of 2019-2020 for the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the study show that high population density, lack of primary handwashing facilities, chemicals used in manufacturing value-added fossil fuel combustion, and poverty headcount substantially increase communicable diseases. In contrast, population diffusion, low carbon concentration in air, renewable fuels, and healthcare expenditures decrease infectious diseases in a panel of 78 countries. The causal inferences found the bidirectional relationship between communicable diseases and primary handwashing facility, and carbon emissions and poverty headcount, whereas the unidirectional relationship is running from lack of sanitation to infectious diseases, economic growth to carbon emissions, and communicable diseases to fossil fuel combustion across countries. Communicable diseases increase healthcare expenditures and decrease the country's economic growth which is a vital concern of the global economy to confront the outbreak of novel coronavirus through increasing the healthcare budget in national bills and stabilize financial activities at a worldwide scale.",BioMed research international,2020-,"Anser MK, Islam T, Khan MA, Zaman K, Nassani AA, Askar SE, Abro MMQ, Kabbani A",8,2099,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

In addition to causing arctic ice melting and extreme weather events, climatologic factors are linked strongly to the transmission of many infectious diseases. Changes in the prevalence of infectious diseases not only reflect the impacts of temperature, humidity, and other weather-related phenomena on pathogens, vectors, and animal hosts but are also part of a complex of social and environmental factors that will be affected by climate change, including land use, migration, and vector control. Vector- and waterborne diseases and coccidioidomycosis are all likely to be affected by a warming planet; there is also potential for climate-driven impacts on emerging infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance.

31785089,Network analysis of pig movements in Argentina: Identification of key farms in the spread of infectious diseases and their biosecurity levels.,"This study uses network analysis to evaluate how swine movements in Argentina could contribute to disease spread. Movement data for the 2014-2017 period were obtained from Argentina's online livestock traceability registry and categorized as follows: animals of high genetic value sent to other farms, animals to or from markets, animals sent to finisher operations and slaughterhouse. A network analysis was carried out considering the first three movement types. First, descriptive, centrality and cohesion measures were calculated for each movement type and year. Next, to determine whether networks had a small-world topology, these were compared with the results from random Erdös-Rényi network simulations. Then, the basic reproductive number (R<sub>0</sub> ) of the genetic network, the group of farms with higher potential for disease spread standing at the top of the production chain, was calculated to identify farms acting as super-spreaders. Finally, their external biosecurity scores were evaluated. The genetic network in Argentina presented a scale-free and small-world topology. Thus, we estimate that disease spread would be fast, preferably to highly connected nodes and with little chances of being contained. Throughout the study, 31 farms were identified as super-spreaders in the genetic network for all years, while other 55 were super-spreaders at least once, from an average of 1,613 farms per year. Interestingly, removal of less than 5% of higher degree and betweenness farms resulted in a >90% reduction of R<sub>0</sub> indicating that few farms have a key role in disease spread. When biosecurity scores of the most relevant super-spreaders were examined, it was evident that many were at risk of introducing and disseminating new pathogens across the whole of Argentina's pig production network. These results highlight the usefulness of establishing targeted surveillance and intervention programmes, emphasizing the need for better biosecurity scores in Argentinean swine production units, especially in super-spreader farms.",Transboundary and emerging diseases,2020-May,"Alarcón LV, Cipriotti PA, Monterubbianessi M, Perfumo C, Mateu E, Allepuz A",6,2059,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
39560601,Diagnostic electron microscopy in human infectious diseases - Methods and applications.,"Diagnostic electron microscopy (EM) is indispensable in all cases of infectious diseases which deserve or profit from the detection of the entire pathogen (i.e. the infectious unit). The focus of its application has shifted during the last decades from routine diagnostics to diagnostics of special cases, emergencies and the investigation of disease pathogenesis. While the focus of application has changed, the methods remain more or less the same. However, since the number of cases for diagnostic EM has declined as the number of laboratories that are able to perform such investigations, the preservation of the present knowledge is important. The aim of this article is to provide a review of the methods and strategies which are useful for diagnostic EM related to infectious diseases in our days. It also addresses weaknesses as well as useful variants or extensions of established methods. The main techniques, negative staining and thin section EM, are described in detail with links to suitable protocols and more recent improvements, such as thin section EM of small volume suspensions. Sample collection, transport and conservation/inactivation are discussed. Strategies of sample examination and requirements for a proper recognition of structures are outlined. Finally, some examples for the actual application of diagnostic EM related to infectious diseases are presented.

33918325,Recent Advances of Field-Effect Transistor Technology for Infectious Diseases.,"Field-effect transistor (FET) biosensors have been intensively researched toward label-free biomolecule sensing for different disease screening applications. High sensitivity, incredible miniaturization capability, promising extremely low minimum limit of detection (LoD) at the molecular level, integration with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology and last but not least label-free operation were amongst the predominant motives for highlighting these sensors in the biosensor community. Although there are various diseases targeted by FET sensors for detection, infectious diseases are still the most demanding sector that needs higher precision in detection and integration for the realization of the diagnosis at the point of care (PoC). The COVID-19 pandemic, nevertheless, was an example of the escalated situation in terms of worldwide desperate need for fast, specific and reliable home test PoC devices for the timely screening of huge numbers of people to restrict the disease from further spread. This need spawned a wave of innovative approaches for early detection of COVID-19 antibodies in human swab or blood amongst which the FET biosensing gained much more attention due to their extraordinary LoD down to femtomolar (fM) with the comparatively faster response time. As the FET sensors are promising novel PoC devices with application in early diagnosis of various diseases and especially infectious diseases, in this research, we have reviewed the recent progress on developing FET sensors for infectious diseases diagnosis accompanied with a thorough discussion on the structure of Chem/BioFET sensors and the readout circuitry for output signal processing.

It will strengthen the immunity and reduce the risks of infections. In this paper, a new delayed epidemic model with interim-immune and mixed vaccination strategy is studied. The diseasefree periodic solution is obtained by twice stroboscopic mapping and the corresponding dynamical behavior is analyzed. We determine a threshold parameter <i>R</i><sub>1</sub>, the disease-free periodic solution is proved to be global attractive if <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> < 1. We also establish a threshold parameter <i>R</i><sub>2</sub> for the permanence of the model, i.e., if <i>R</i><sub>2</sub> > 1, the infectious disease will exist persistently. Then, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results intuitively. In particular, a practical application for newtype TB vaccine under mixed vaccination strategy is presented, based on the proposed theory and the data reported by NBSC. The mixed vaccination strategy can achieve the End TB goal formulated by WHO in limited time. Our study will help public health agency to design mixed control strategy which can reduce the burden of infectious diseases.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2020-May,"Liu SY, Shen MW, Bi YJ",3,1224,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32920842,A marginal moment matching approach for fitting endemic-epidemic models to underreported disease surveillance counts.,"Count data are often subject to underreporting, especially in infectious disease surveillance. We propose an approximate maximum likelihood method to fit count time series models from the endemic-epidemic class to underreported data. The approach is based on marginal moment matching where underreported processes are approximated through completely observed processes from the same class. Moreover, the form of the bias when underreporting is ignored or taken into account via multiplication factors is analyzed. Notably, we show that this leads to a downward bias in model-based estimates of the effective reproductive number. A marginal moment matching approach can also be used to account for reporting intervals which are longer than the mean serial interval of a disease. The good performance of the proposed methodology is demonstrated in simulation studies. An extension to time-varying parameters and reporting probabilities is discussed and applied in a case study on weekly rotavirus gastroenteritis counts in Berlin, Germany.",Biometrics,2021-Dec,"Bracher J, Held L",2,1037,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

In particular, the use of treatments against infectious diseases creates variation in quality among hosts, which can have both epidemiological and evolutionary consequences. We present a general theoretical model to highlight the consequences of different imperfect treatments on pathogen prevalence and evolution. These treatments differ in their action on host and pathogen traits. In contrast with previous studies, we assume that treatment coverage can vary in time, as in seasonal or pulsed treatment strategies. We show that periodic treatment strategies can limit both disease spread and virulence evolution, depending on the type of treatment. We also introduce a new method to analytically calculate the selection gradient in periodic environments, which allows our predictions to be interpreted using the concept of reproductive value, and can be applied more generally to analyse eco-evolutionary dynamics in class-structured populations and fluctuating environments.",Proceedings.

It is unclear if trainees have opportunities to practice during training. We created a simulation curriculum to develop and evaluate this skill among infectious disease (ID) trainees. We created six simulation questions about organ suitability for transplant based on infection risk. During trainees' TID rotations, faculty texted or paged the simulation cases posing as the transplant coordinator. Trainees had 15 min to ask questions before deciding the suitability of the organ and explained their clinical reasoning in a survey. Trainees completed a post-simulation survey to evaluate its effectiveness. ID trainees, including residents and fellows on rotation, from seven centers participated. Eighty-seven percent (13/15) of trainees felt the simulation was effective in teaching them this concept, and 80% (12/15) felt prepared for clinical practice. The proportion of correct responses was generally high among the six different cases (43%-100%); correct responses increased for some cases in the post-activity survey. Of the 100 clinical reasoning decisions made during the activity, 19% were discordant, where the trainee correctly identified suitable organs for incorrect reasons. Our simulation was effective in teaching when to accept or reject an organ for transplant and was a valuable educational tool.

Data retrieved from the Peruvian government's deaths certificates registry included all non-residents who died between January 2017 and December 2021. We analysed the national incidence and causes of death among international travellers in Peru. Causes of death were classified into non-communicable diseases (NCD), communicable diseases and injuries. We classified fatalities according to the existence of preventive measures that could be provided during the travel medicine consultation to decrease the risk. We obtained records from 1514 deaths among international travellers (973 males, 64%). The incidence increased from 0.2 deaths per 10 000 travellers in 2017 to 9.9 in 2021. NCDs were the most common causes of death (n = 560, 37%), followed by communicable diseases (n = 487, 32%), and injuries (n = 321, 21%). Causes of death were unknown in 9.7% of the records. The leading causes of death in these categories were cancer, cardiovascular disease, COVID-19 and trauma. We found similar sex distribution of NCDs in travellers aged >50 years and higher rates of communicable diseases among males across all ages. Injury-associated deaths were significantly higher among males aged 18-29 years (P < 0.001) compared with other sex-age groups. We estimated that for 57.7% of deaths risk could have been decreased through pre-travel advice. Rates of deaths among travellers to Peru increased over time. Most deaths were due to NCDs, followed by communicable diseases and injuries. Pre-travel medical optimization and effective advice focused on age-sex and destination specific risks could reduce risk among travellers. Increased awareness among travel medicine practitioners and improvement of emergency medical response systems in Peru could decrease mortality.",Journal of travel medicine,2024-Jan,"Allel K, Cabada MM, Lau C, Mills D, Franklin RC, Zhu Y, Furuya-Kanamori L",7,2069,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The World Health Organization further clarifies these standards with a set of criteria that has the acronym ASSURED (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipment-free and Deliverable to end-users). The advancement of the digital age has led to a revision of the ASSURED criteria to REASSURED: Real-time connectivity, Ease of specimen collection, Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipment-free or simple, and Deliverable to end-users. Many diagnostic tests have been developed that aim to satisfy the REASSURED criteria; however, most of them only detect a single target. With the progression of syndromic infections, coinfections and the current antimicrobial resistance challenges, the need for multiplexed diagnostics is now more important than ever.

35593400,A Review of the Ring Trial Design for Evaluating Ring Interventions for Infectious Diseases.,"In trials of infectious disease interventions, rare outcomes and unpredictable spatiotemporal variation can introduce bias, reduce statistical power, and prevent conclusive inferences. Spillover effects can complicate inference if individual randomization is used to gain efficiency. Ring trials are a type of cluster-randomized trial that may increase efficiency and minimize bias, particularly in emergency and elimination settings with strong clustering of infection. They can be used to evaluate ring interventions, which are delivered to individuals in proximity to or contact with index cases. We conducted a systematic review of ring trials, compare them with other trial designs for evaluating ring interventions, and describe strengths and weaknesses of each design. Of 849 articles and 322 protocols screened, we identified 26 ring trials, 15 cluster-randomized trials, 5 trials that randomized households or individuals within rings, and 1 individually randomized trial. The most common interventions were postexposure prophylaxis (n = 23) and focal mass drug administration and screening and treatment (n = 7). Ring trials require robust surveillance systems and contact tracing for directly transmitted diseases. For rare diseases with strong spatiotemporal clustering, they may have higher efficiency and internal validity than cluster-randomized designs, in part because they ensure that no clusters are excluded from analysis due to zero cluster incidence. Though more research is needed to compare them with other types of trials, ring trials hold promise as a design that can increase trial speed and efficiency while reducing bias.",Epidemiologic reviews,2022-Dec,"Butzin-Dozier Z, Athni TS, Benjamin-Chung J",3,1650,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Rather than view these in isolation, there are important lessons pertaining to how best to contend with future outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. Those lessons span definition (i.e., what constitutes a pandemic), through deficiencies in surveillance, data collection and reporting, the execution of research in a rapidly changing environment, the nuances of study design and hierarchy of clinical evidence, triage according to clinical need as supply chains become overwhelmed, and the challenges surrounding forecasting of outbreaks.

38472283,General protocol for predicting outbreaks of infectious diseases in social networks.,"Epidemic spreading on social networks with quenched connections is strongly influenced by dynamic correlations between connected nodes, posing theoretical challenges in predicting outbreaks of infectious diseases. The quenched connections introduce dynamic correlations, indicating that the infection of one node increases the likelihood of infection among its neighboring nodes. These dynamic correlations pose significant difficulties in developing comprehensive theories for threshold determination. Determining the precise epidemic threshold is pivotal for diseases control. In this study, we propose a general protocol for accurately determining epidemic thresholds by introducing a new set of fundamental conditions, where the number of connections between individuals of each type remains constant in the stationary state, and by devising a rescaling method for infection rates. Our general protocol is applicable to diverse epidemic models, regardless of the number of stages and transmission modes. To validate our protocol's effectiveness, we apply it to two widely recognized standard models, the susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible model and the contact process model, both of which have eluded precise threshold determination using existing sophisticated theories. Our results offer essential tools to enhance disease control strategies and preparedness in an ever-evolving landscape of infectious diseases.",Scientific reports,2024-Mar,"Kwon S, Park JM",2,1427,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34534214,All-cause and cause-specific mortality during and following incarceration in Brazil: A retrospective cohort study.,"Mortality during and after incarceration is poorly understood in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The need to address this knowledge gap is especially urgent in South America, which has the fastest growing prison population in the world. In Brazil, insufficient data have precluded our understanding of all-cause and cause-specific mortality during and after incarceration. We linked incarceration and mortality databases for the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul to obtain a retrospective cohort of 114,751 individuals with recent incarceration. Between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2018, we identified 3,127 deaths of individuals with recent incarceration (705 in detention and 2,422 following release). We analyzed age-standardized, all-cause, and cause-specific mortality rates among individuals detained in different facility types and following release, compared to non-incarcerated residents. We additionally modeled mortality rates over time during and after incarceration for all causes of death, violence, or suicide. Deaths in custody were 2.2 times the number reported by the national prison administration (n = 317). Incarcerated men and boys experienced elevated mortality, compared with the non-incarcerated population, due to increased risk of death from violence, suicide, and communicable diseases, with the highest standardized incidence rate ratio (IRR) in semi-open prisons (2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0 to 2.8), police stations (3.1; 95% CI: 2.5 to 3.9), and youth detention (8.1; 95% CI: 5.9 to 10.8). Incarcerated women experienced increased mortality from suicide (IRR = 6.0, 95% CI: 1.2 to 17.7) and communicable diseases (IRR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.1 to 5.0). Following release from prison, mortality was markedly elevated for men (IRR = 3.0; 95% CI: 2.8 to 3.1) and women (IRR = 2.4; 95% CI: 2.1 to 2.9). The risk of violent death and suicide was highest immediately post-release and declined over time; however, all-cause mortality remained elevated 8 years post-release. The limitations of this study include inability to establish causality, uncertain reliability of data during incarceration, and underestimation of mortality rates due to imperfect database linkage. Incarcerated individuals in Brazil experienced increased mortality from violence, suicide, and communicable diseases. Mortality was heightened following release for all leading causes of death, with particularly high risk of early violent death and elevated all-cause mortality up to 8 years post-release. These disparities may have been underrecognized in Brazil due to underreporting and insufficient data.",PLoS medicine,2021-Sep,"Liu YE, Lemos EF, Gonçalves CCM, de Oliveira RD, Santos ADS, do Prado Morais AO, Croda MG, de Lourdes Delgado Alves M, Croda J, Walter KS, Andrews JR",11,2628,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32087310,Infectious diseases and antimicrobial prescribing: Online spaced education for junior doctors.,"Inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing may harm patients and drive antimicrobial resistance. Junior doctors' knowledge of infectious diseases and antimicrobial prescribing is inadequate. Online spaced case-based learning can improve knowledge. To develop infectious diseases and antimicrobial prescribing course content for online spaced education and assess its effectiveness and feasibility for junior doctors. Infectious diseases and antimicrobial course content was developed for an online spaced education platform (Qstream Inc., Burlington, MA). Junior doctors (postgraduate years 1-3) at two tertiary teaching hospitals in Sydney participated in the study. Course content was provided with Qstream at one hospital and at the other hospital via two face-to-face (FTF) tutorials from August to October 2017. Knowledge and self-confidence were compared before and after training within and between both cohorts. Participation in the course was higher in the Qstream cohort with 48/127 (37.8%) completing the course compared with 44/110 (40%) attending one or both FTF sessions, of whom 22/110 (20%) attended both. Improvement in mean knowledge score from 69.7% to 81.5% in the Qstream cohort was significantly greater than the FTF cohort's minimal improvement from 67.6% to 67.9% (95% CI 2.79-20.33; P=0.01). In the Qstream cohort mean confidence rating (0-10) improvement from 5.14 to 6.55 was greater than the FTF group improvement from 5.37 to 5.85 (95% CI 0.132-1.171; P=0.02).

This study reports a putative new Anaplasma species in gopher tortoises in Florida. Two Florida gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) presented at the University of Florida Veterinary Hospital with anemia and intracytoplasmic vacuoles filled with bacteria within erythrocytes. The bacteria within these parasitophorous vacuoles were morphologically similar to Anaplasma marginale. We inoculated ISE6 cells with blood from one tortoise and isolated bacterial colonies consistent with A. marginale. Molecular characterization targeting Anaplasmataceae 16S rRNA sequences indicated that the clinical isolate, named here provisionally as ""Candidatus Anaplasma testudinis"", grouped within the genus Anaplasma on a separate clade, most closely related to the A. marginale, Anaplasma ovis and Anaplasma centrale group. We next screened archived red blood cells from 38 wild gopher tortoises with documented clinical anemia. Fourteen of the 38 wild tortoises, representing 5 of 11 geographical locations were PCR-positive for Anaplasmataceae spp. Sequencing analysis revealed 16S rRNA sequence identical to ""Ca. A. testudinis"". The clinical presentation of significant anemia associated with ""Ca. A. testudinis"" in a threatened species could have conservation implications.

This study aimed to investigate the trends in infectious and parasitic disease (IPD) hospital admissions (HA) in England and Wales between 1999 and 2019. This is an ecological study using publicly available data taken from the Hospital Episode Statistics database in England and the Patient Episode Database for Wales. Hospital admission data were collected for the period between April 1999 to March 2019. IPDHA were identified using the tenth version of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases system, diagnostic codes (A00-B99). The trend in hospital admissions was assessed using a Poisson model. The overall annual number for IPD hospital admissions for various causes increased by 412.9%, from 151,336 in 1999 to 776,215 in 2019, representing an increase in hospital admission rate of 349.9% from 290.25 (95% CI 288.79-291.71) in 1999 to 1305.88 (95% CI 1303.00-1308.77) in 2019 per 100,000 persons: trend test, p < 0.01. The most common causes of infectious and parasitic disease hospital admissions were intestinal infectious diseases, other bacterial diseases, and other viral diseases, which accounted for 33.6, 27.5, and 23.8%, respectively.

Based on the UK Biobank, the prospective cohort study included a total of 396,080 participants without diabetes at baseline. We determined the types and sites of infectious diseases and incident T2D using the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision codes (ICD-10). Time-varying Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the association. Infection burden was defined as the number of infection episodes over time and the number of co-occurring infections. Genetic risk score (GRS) for T2D consisted of 424 single nucleotide polymorphisms. During a median of 9.04 [IQR, 8.3-9.7] years of follow-up, hospital-treated infectious diseases were associated with a greater risk of T2D (adjusted HR [aHR] 1.54 [95 % CI 1.46-1.61]), with risk difference per 10,000 individuals equal to 154.1 [95 % CI 140.7-168.2]. The heightened risk persisted after 5 years following the index infection. Bacterial infection with sepsis had the strongest risk of T2D (aHR 2.95 [95 % CI 2.53-3.44]) among different infection types. For site-specific analysis, bloodstream infections posed the greatest risk (3.01 [95 % CI 2.60-3.48]). A dose-response association was observed between infection burden and T2D risk within each GRS tertile (p-trend <0.001). High genetic risk and infection synergistically increased the T2D risk. Infectious diseases were associated with an increased risk of subsequent T2D. The risk showed specificity according to types, sites, severity of infection and the period since infection occurred.

Diagnostic testing for infection can be challenging due to resource limitations, time constraints, or shortcomings in the accuracy of existing diagnostics. Rapid, simple diagnostics are highly desirable. There is increasing interest in the development of diagnostics that use exhaled breath analysis as a convenient and safe diagnostic method, as breath sampling is noninvasive, secure, and easy to perform. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in exhaled breath reflect the fingerprint of the underlying metabolic and biophysical processes during disease. In this review, we overview the major biomarkers present in exhaled breath in infectious diseases. We outline the promising recent advances in breath-based diagnosis of respiratory infections, including those caused by influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Aspergillus fumigatus. In addition, we review the current landscape of diagnosis of 2 other globally important infections: Helicobacter pylori gastrointestinal infection and malaria. Characteristic and reproducible breath VOCs are associated with several infectious diseases, suggesting breath analysis as a promising strategy for diagnostic development.

33863279,Online respondent-driven detection for enhanced contact tracing of close-contact infectious diseases: benefits and barriers for public health practice.,"Online respondent-driven detection (RDD) is a novel method of case finding that can enhance contact tracing (CT). However, the advantages and challenges of RDD for CT have not yet been investigated from the perspective of public health professionals (PHPs). Therefore, it remains unclear if, and under what circumstances, PHPs are willing to apply RDD for CT. Between March and April 2019, we conducted semi-structured interviews with Dutch PHPs responsible for CT in practice. Questions were derived from the 'diffusion of innovations' theory. Between May and June 2019, we distributed an online questionnaire among 260 Dutch PHPs to quantify the main qualitative findings. Using different hypothetical scenarios, we assessed anticipated advantages and challenges of RDD, and PHPs' intention to apply RDD for CT. Twelve interviews were held, and 70 PHPs completed the online questionnaire. A majority of questionnaire respondents (71%) had a positive intention towards using RDD for CT. Anticipated advantages of RDD were 'accommodating easy and autonomous participation in CT of index cases and contact persons', and 'reaching contact persons more efficiently'. Anticipated challenges were 'limited opportunities for PHPs to support, motivate, and coordinate the execution of CT', 'not being able to adequately convey measures to index cases and contact persons', and 'anticipated unrest among index cases and contact persons'. Circumstances under which PHPs anticipated RDD applicable for CT included index cases and contact persons being reluctant to share information directly with PHPs, digitally skilled and literate persons being involved, and large scale CT. Circumstances under which PHPs anticipated RDD less applicable for CT included severe consequences of missing information or contact persons for individual or public health, involvement of complex or impactful measures for index cases and contact persons, and a disease being perceived as severe or sensitive by index cases and their contact persons. PHPs generally perceived RDD as a potentially beneficial method for public health practice, that may help overcome challenges present in traditional CT, and could be used during outbreaks of infectious diseases that spread via close contact.

33152622,Emergence of zoonoses such as COVID-19 reveals the need for health sciences to embrace an explicit eco-social conceptual framework of health and disease.,"An accurate understanding of why zoonoses such as SARS-CoV-2 are emerging at an increased rate, is vital to prevent future pandemics from the approximately 700,000 viruses with zoonotic potential. Certain authors have argued that the consumption of wildlife, or human contact with bats was responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Others argue that a range of anthropogenic environmental degradations have played a vital role in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and other zoonoses. In this opinion piece, I argue that these divergent viewpoints stem, in part, from different foundational conceptual frameworks - biomedical individualist and eco-social frameworks, respectively. Based on the fact that the eco-social framework provides a more complete account of the different types of causal factors underpinning the emergence of zoonoses, I propose that the COVID-19 pandemic provides an additional reason for the health sciences to ground its theory of health and disease in an eco-social conceptual framework.",Epidemics,2020-Dec,Kenyon C,1,1011,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38537494,Disease X epidemic control using a stochastic model and a deterministic approximation: Performance comparison with and without parameter uncertainties.,"The spread of infectious diseases can be modeled using deterministic or stochastic models. A deterministic approximation of a stochastic model can be appropriate under some conditions, but is unable to capture the discrete nature of populations. We look into the choice of a model from the perspective of decision making. We consider an emerging disease (Disease X) in a closed population modeled by a stochastic SIR model or its deterministic approximation. The objective of the decision maker is to minimize the cumulative number of symptomatic infected-days over the course of the epidemic by picking a vaccination policy. We consider four decision making scenarios: based on the stochastic model or the deterministic model, and with or without parameter uncertainty. We also consider different sample sizes for uncertain parameter draws and stochastic model runs. We estimate the average performance of decision making in each scenario and for each sample size. The model used for decision making has an influence on the picked policies. The best achievable performance is obtained with the stochastic model, knowing parameter values, and for a large sample size. For small sample sizes, the deterministic model can outperform the stochastic model due to stochastic effects. Resolving uncertainties may bring more benefit than switching to the stochastic model in our example. This article illustrates the interplay between the choice of a type of model, parameter uncertainties, and sample sizes. It points to issues to be considered when optimizing a stochastic model.",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,2024-Jun,"Flaig J, Houy N",2,1574,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32109112,Predicting the Speed of Epidemics Spreading in Networks.,"Global transport and communication networks enable information, ideas, and infectious diseases to now spread at speeds far beyond what has historically been possible. To effectively monitor, design, or intervene in such epidemic-like processes, there is a need to predict the speed of a particular contagion in a particular network, and to distinguish between nodes that are more likely to become infected sooner or later during an outbreak. Here, we study these quantities using a message-passing approach to derive simple and effective predictions that are validated against epidemic simulations on a variety of real-world networks with good agreement. In addition to individualized predictions for different nodes, we find an overall sudden transition from low density to almost full network saturation as the contagion progresses in time. Our theory is developed and explained in the setting of simple contagions on treelike networks, but we are also able to show how the method extends remarkably well to complex contagions and highly clustered networks.",Physical review letters,2020-Feb,"Moore S, Rogers T",2,1059,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37650399,Current status of infectious diseases among migrants and non-citizens in Malaysia.,"The mass movement of migrants to Malaysia for employment is one of the factors contributing to the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases in this country. Despite mandatory health screening for migrants seeking employment, prevalence records of infectious diseases amongst migrant populations in Malaysia are still within negligible proportions. Therefore, the present review highlights the incidence, mortality and overall status of infectious diseases amongst migrants' populations in Malaysia, which maybe be useful for impeding exacerbation of inequalities among them and improving our national health system thru robust and effective emergency responses in controlling the prevalent diseases found among these populations and maybe, Malaysian citizens too. Peer-reviewed articles from January 2016 to December 2020 were searched through online platform including SCOPUS, PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Non-peer-reviewed reports and publications from ministry and government websites including data from related agencies were also scoured from in order to ensure that there are no cases being overlooked, as most published articles did not have migrants as the research subjects. A total of 29 studies had been selected in the final analysis. Migrants in Malaysia were at higher risk for tuberculosis, malaria, lymphatic filariasis, cholera, leprosy and leptospirosis. Lymphatic filariasis was still endemic among this population while thousand cases of TB and cholera had been reported among them due to cramp living conditions and poor sanitation in their settlements respectively. While malaria had gradually decreased and become sporadic, the influx of migrant workers had led to the rising of imported malaria cases. Low cases of leprosy had been recorded in Malaysia but a significant proportion of it was contributed by migrant workers. As for leptospirosis, studies found that there are prominent cases among migrant workers, which particularly highest within workers with lower educational attainment. Infectious diseases are still prevalent among migrants in Malaysia due to various interplay factors including their working sectors, country of origin, immunization status, type of settlement, impoverished living conditions, and language and cultural barriers that impeding access to health facilities.",Tropical biomedicine,2023-Jun,"Mohd Putera NWS, Azman AS, Mohd Zain SN, Yahaya H, Lewis JW, Sahimin N",6,2341,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

To assure the microbial safety of transplantation, both national guidelines and the current, regional, and local epidemiology of infectious diseases must be considered. In the present paper the strategies adopted by the Italian National Center for Transplantation (CNT) since 2003 and their evolution to guarantee the safety of organ transplantation are reported. Starting in 2012 mandatory reporting to the CNT of all adverse reactions was started. The number and type of DDI reported to the CNT are currently being analyzed. The infectious diseases second opinion has written and updated the guidelines on the safety of organs for transplantation and supported the Italian transplant network for the use of organs from donors with suspected or documented potentially transmissible infections. A transplant safety network was developed in Italy in 2003 and has been updated according to the evolving knowledge and the changing epidemiology.

34215513,Regional Rodent-Borne Infectious Diseases in North America: What Wilderness Medicine Providers Need to Know.,"Rodents can transmit infectious diseases directly to humans and other animals via bites and exposure to infectious salivary aerosols and excreta. Arthropods infected while blood-feeding on rodents can also transmit rodent-borne pathogens indirectly to humans and animals. Environmental events, such as wet winters, cooler summers, heavy rains, and flooding, have precipitated regional rodent-borne infectious disease outbreaks; these outbreaks are now increasing with climate change. The objectives of this review are to inform wilderness medicine providers about the environmental conditions that can precipitate rodent-borne infectious disease outbreaks; to describe the regional geographic distributions of rodent-borne infectious diseases in North America; and to recommend prophylactic treatments and effective prevention and control strategies for rodent-borne infectious diseases. To meet these objectives, Internet search engines were queried with keywords to identify scientific articles on outbreaks of the most common regional rodent-borne infectious diseases in North America. Wilderness medicine providers should maintain high levels of suspicion for regional rodent-borne diseases in patients who develop febrile illnesses after exposure to contaminated freshwater after heavy rains or floods and after swimming, rafting, or paddling in endemic areas. Public health education strategies should encourage limiting human contact with rodents; avoiding contact with or safely disposing of rodent excreta; avoiding contact with contaminated floodwaters, especially contact with open wounds; securely containing outdoor food stores; and modifying wilderness cabins and campsites to deter rodent colonization.",Wilderness & environmental medicine,2021-Sep,Diaz JH,1,1717,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

This research is a part of the Mediterranean Convention of Human Rights project, which is an organizational work on human rights issues that was established in cooperation with civil society and the national authorities of the Mediterranean Region. Previously published data were collected by retrieving published literature from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science using ""climate change"", ""the Mediterranean region"", ""infections in Mediterranean Region"", ""infectious diseases"", ""biodiversity"", and ""the Mediterranean Sea"" as keywords. The collected data were then evaluated and reviewed. The recommendations and guidelines were analysed by the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). The Mediterranean region presents a typical example witnessing a dramatic change in climate events and their adverse impact on biodiversity, ecosystems and public health are multiple. This negative impact is in part due to the geographical particularities, and sociocultural and geopolitical conflicts that are progressively worsening the burden of climate change. While most of these changes cannot be totally avoided, many of the health risks related to climate change could be monitored. This can be done by establishing health systems with policies to reduce and prevent the risks of infectious diseases and to recover and support the affected areas, which may identify priority and management of high-risk events.",Journal of infection in developing countries,2023-Nov,"Dal T, Ramli I, Garaizar J",3,1611,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

People who inject drugs (PWID) and develop serious infections also face disparities in antibiotic management, particularly with regards to use of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT). We highlight literature on OPAT in PWID challenging the notion that PWID cannot be managed with OPAT. Given that OPAT use amongst PWID and non-PWID yields similar outcomes, we argue that a bias against OPAT use in PWID is unwarranted and may reflect stigma rather than data. We further note the proven value of comprehensive OUD treatment on endocarditis treatment outcomes, which also addresses the potential safety concerns of OPAT in PWID, and propose a treatment model in which Addiction and Infectious Disease specialists collaborate to integrate opioid use disorder treatment into injection drug use-associated infective endocarditis care.",Journal of addiction medicine,,"Cortes-Penfield N, Cawcutt K, Alexander BT, Karre VMM, Balasanova AA",5,1020,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35879909,Is Alzheimer's disease an infectious neurological disease? A review of the literature.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia around the globe. Its pathogenesis is characterized primarily by the extracellular deposition of amyloid β peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Despite the significant investments in neurological research, the exact molecular mechanism of AD pathogenesis is still not fully elucidated. Several studies converge on a hypothesis that pathogenic microbes might play a role in AD progression. Although this hypothesis has been considered relatively weak for decades, it has recently received considerable attention due to increasing evidence on the association between microorganisms and AD. There is a lack of experimental and scientific arguments conveying that these microorganisms engender cognitive and neuropathological deficits and modifications specific to AD, challenging the theory that it could be an infectious neurological disease. This review focuses on recent advances in the infection hypothesis and provides an overview of new findings portraying the significance of pathogenic microbes in AD and the challenges confronting the validity of the hypothesis. Data were collected from medical journals published on PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, and Embase bibliographical databases with a predefined search strategy. All articles considering neurological disorders, especially AD associated with infectious diseases, were included. This work focused on providing an overview of new findings around the relationship between microorganisms and AD, challenges facing the validity of the theory, and recommendations on how the scientific community can best develop alternative approaches to address the pathophysiology of AD. While many studies reinforce the suspicion of an infectious etiology of AD, it is important to note that it is yet not validated how microorganisms' presence in the brain can develop AD due to the limited available evidence. Certainly, ground-breaking work is mandatory in this field of research, and these reports so far warrant a thorough investigation into how a chronic infection may remain silent while progressing its neuroinflammation. Amid this uncertainty arises the hope that many researchers will take on this challenge and join this endeavor to benefit AD patients worldwide.",Brain and behavior,2022-Aug,"Uwishema O, Mahmoud A, Sun J, Correia IFS, Bejjani N, Alwan M, Nicholas A, Oluyemisi A, Dost B",9,2296,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) aims to support and strengthen this capacity in European Union/ European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries as part of its 2021-27 strategy which includes explicit attention to social and behavioural aspects of disease prevention. To achieve its strategic goals, it is important that ECDC improves its knowledge of prevention strategies, actors and activities in EU/EEA countries. In this Perspective, we summarise three challenges to implementing the prevention framework proposed by ECDC: (i) defining, recognising and identifying with 'prevention', (ii) integrating new understandings into established ways of thinking, and (iii) the need for more attention to prevention in governance. These challenges are derived from the findings of a project which conducted a preliminary mapping of prevention actors, networks and activities in four EU countries to support the development of a community of practice within the new ECDC prevention framework.

As technology advanced, so did mapping techniques. In the late 20th century, geographic information systems (GIS) revolutionized disease mapping by enabling researchers to overlay diverse datasets to visualise and analyse complex spatial patterns (Bergquist & Manda 2019; Hashtarkhani et al., 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic showed that disease mapping is particularly valuable for optimising prevention and control strategies of infectious diseases by prioritising geographical targeting interventions and containment strategies (Mohammadi et al., 2021). Today, with the aid of highresolution satellite imagery, geo-referenced electronic data collection systems, real-time data feeds, and sophisticated modelling algorithms, disease mapping has become a feasible and accessible tool for public health officials in tracking, managing, and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases at global, regional and local scales (Hay et al., 2013).

33059357,Insights from ancient DNA analysis of Egyptian human mummies: clues to disease and kinship.,"The molecular Egyptology field started in the mid-eighties with the first publication on the ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis of an Egyptian mummy. Egypt has been a major interest for historians, archeologists, laymen as well as scientists. The aDNA research on Egyptian biological remains has been fueled by their abundance and relatively well-preserved states through artificial mummification and by the advanced analytical techniques. Early doubts of aDNA integrity within the Egyptian mummies and data authenticity were later abated with studies proving successfully authenticated aDNA retrieval. The current review tries to recapitulate the published studies presenting paleogenomic evidence of disease diagnosis and kinship establishment for the Egyptian human remains. Regarding disease diagnosis, the prevailing literature was on paleogenomic evidence of infectious diseases in the human remains. A series of reports presented evidence for the presence of tuberculosis and/or malaria. In addition, there were solitary reports of the presence of leprosy, diphtheria, bacteremia, toxoplasmosis, schistosomiasis and leishmaniasis. On the contrary, paleogenomic evidence of the presence of rare diseases was quite scarce and mentioned only in two articles. On the other hand, kinship analysis of Egyptian human remains, including that of Tutankhamen, was done using both mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear DNA markers, to establish family relationships in four studies. It is clear that the field of molecular Egyptology is still a largely unexplored territory. Nevertheless, the paleogenomic investigation of Egyptian remains could make significant contributions to biomedical sciences (e.g. elucidation of coevolution of human host-microbe interrelationship) as well as to evidence-based archeology.",Human molecular genetics,2021-Apr,"Gad YZ, Hassan NA, Mousa DM, Fouad FA, El-Sayed SG, Abdelazeem MA, Mahdy SM, Othman HY, Ibrahim DW, Khairat R, Ismail S",11,1805,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32713682,Preventing infectious diseases for healthy ageing: The VITAL public-private partnership project.,"Prevention of infectious diseases through immunisation of the growing ageing adult population is essential to improve healthy ageing. However, many licenced and recommended vaccines for this age group show signs of waning of the protective effect due to declining immune responses (immuno-senescence) and decreasing vaccine uptake. Today's major challenge is to improve vaccine effectiveness and uptake and to deploy efficient vaccination strategies for this age group. The Vaccines and InfecTious diseases in the Ageing popuLation (VITAL) project, with partners from 17 academic & research groups and public institutes as well as seven industry collaborators, aims to address this challenge. The ambition is to provide evidence-based knowledge to local decision makers. Using a holistic and multidisciplinary approach and novel analytical methods, VITAL will provide tools that allow the development of targeted immunisation programs for ageing adults in European countries. The project is based on four pillars focussing on the assessment of the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases in ageing adults, the dissection of the mechanisms underlying immuno-senescence, the analysis of the clinical and economic public health impact of vaccination strategies and the development of educational resources for healthcare professionals. By the end of the project, a clear, detailed, and integrated program should be available for implementing a consistent, affordable, and sustainable vaccination strategy for ageing adults with regular evaluations of its impact over time.",Vaccine,2020-Aug,"Van Baarle D, Bollaerts K, Del Giudice G, Lockhart S, Luxemburger C, Postma MJ, Timen A, Standaert B",8,1568,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35341254,Global stability mathematical analysis for virus transmission model with latent age structure.,"Mathematical model is a very important method for the control and prevention of disease transmissing. Based on the communication characteristics of diseases, it is necesssery to add fast and slow process into the model of infectious diseases, which more effectively shows the transmission mechanism of infectious diseases. This paper proposes an age structure epidemic model with fast and slow progression. We analyze the model's dynamic properties by using the stability theory of differential equation under the assumption of constant population size. The very important threshold R<sub>0</sub> was calculated. If R<sub>0</sub><1, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, whereas if R<sub>0</sub>>1, the Lyapunov function is used to show that endemic equilibrium is globally stable. Through more in-depth analysis for basic reproduction number, we obtain the greater the rate of slow progression of an infectious disease, the fewer the threshold results. In addition, we also provided some numerical simulations to prove our result. Vaccines do not provide lifelong immunity, but can reduce the mortality of those infected. By vaccinating, the rate of patients entering slow progression increases and the threshold is correspondingly reduced. Therefore, vaccination can effectively control the transmission of Coronavirus. The theoretical incidence predicted by mathematical model can provide evidence for prevention and controlling the spread of the epidemic.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2022-Jan,"Ren S, Li L",2,1485,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34610978,Protecting privacy in mandatory reporting of infectious diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives from a developing country.,"Mandatory reporting of infectious diseases (MRID) is an essential practice to prevent disease outbreaks. Disease notification is a mandatory procedure for most infectious diseases, even during non-pandemic periods in healthcare. The main rationale behind MRID is the protection of public health. The information and data provided by infectious disease reports are used for many purposes, such as preventing the spread and potential negative impact of infectious diseases, assessing the national and global situation regarding reported diseases, conducting scientific research and planning health policy. In this context, the relevant information benefits public health, health systems and scientific work. Additionally, the follow up and treatment of individuals with infectious diseases is a necessity in certain cases to protect those who cohabit with them. However, these benefits cannot be accepted as unrestricted justifications for MRID, since it is evident that reporting should be conducted within ethical and legal boundaries. MRID should only be devised and implemented with due regard to balancing potential benefits between all individuals, as well as between the individual and the rest of society. Disease notification systems that are not designed with a balancing and harm-reductionist approach may lead to stigmatisation and discrimination. This study aims to investigate the legal framework and ethical issues regarding the reporting of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in Turkey-which is a primary example of a developing country.",Journal of medical ethics,2022-Dec,"Sert G, Mega E, Karaca Dedeoğlu A",3,1552,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

While the geographical boundaries of C. immitis in WA have not been well characterized, human infections have resulted from exposure in the south-central region of the state. Since 2010, only one dog has been identified as a probable locally acquired animal case, despite pilot canine serological surveys from south-central WA revealing a 9.8% seroprevalence. On the suspicion that clinical animal cases may be underdiagnosed and/or underreported, we assessed WA veterinarians' knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding coccidioidomycosis. All veterinarians with active licenses in WA were invited to complete a self-administered, web-based survey from November 2018 to January 2019. Four hundred and twenty-five of 2,211 (19.2%) veterinarians returned the survey and were eligible for inclusion in the final analysis. Nearly, all respondents (98.8%) had heard of coccidioidomycosis, but only 31.5% and 25.6% knew that locally acquired animal and human cases, respectively, had been reported in WA. Only half (52.6%) of participants knew that the disease was reportable. Fewer than 20% of respondents reported confidence that their knowledge of coccidioidomycosis was up to date, and 76.9% ""never"" or ""rarely"" considered the risk of disease in their patients. A statistically significant predictor of a high knowledge score (≥70%), however, included practicing in endemic counties where the Washington State Department of Health had previously delivered outreach and education services. While the results suggest some success with these activities, it is clear that information on the emergence of coccidioidomycosis is not adequately reaching veterinary practitioners in WA. The data support that more frequent CE opportunities, and dissemination of public health communications through veterinary-specific modalities, would help fill the knowledge gap. In turn, improved diagnosis and reporting of animal cases would assist in our overall understanding the epidemiology of coccidioidomycosis in WA.",Zoonoses and public health,2020-Feb,"James AE, McCall JR, Petersen KR, Wohrle RD, Oltean HN",5,2081,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
38861711,Prospective Spatiotemporal Cluster Detection Using SaTScan: Tutorial for Designing and Fine-Tuning a System to Detect Reportable Communicable Disease Outbreaks.,"Staff at public health departments have few training materials to learn how to design and fine-tune systems to quickly detect acute, localized, community-acquired outbreaks of infectious diseases. Since 2014, the Bureau of Communicable Disease at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has analyzed reportable communicable diseases daily using SaTScan. SaTScan is a free software that analyzes data using scan statistics, which can detect increasing disease activity without a priori specification of temporal period, geographic location, or size. The Bureau of Communicable Disease's systems have quickly detected outbreaks of salmonellosis, legionellosis, shigellosis, and COVID-19. This tutorial details system design considerations, including geographic and temporal data aggregation, study period length, inclusion criteria, whether to account for population size, network location file setup to account for natural boundaries, probability model (eg, space-time permutation), day-of-week effects, minimum and maximum spatial and temporal cluster sizes, secondary cluster reporting criteria, signaling criteria, and distinguishing new clusters versus ongoing clusters with additional events. We illustrate how to support health equity by minimizing analytic exclusions of patients with reportable diseases (eg, persons experiencing homelessness who are unsheltered) and accounting for purely spatial patterns, such as adjusting nonparametrically for areas with lower access to care and testing for reportable diseases. We describe how to fine-tune the system when the detected clusters are too large to be of interest or when signals of clusters are delayed, missed, too numerous, or false. We demonstrate low-code techniques for automating analyses and interpreting results through built-in features on the user interface (eg, patient line lists, temporal graphs, and dynamic maps), which became newly available with the July 2022 release of SaTScan version 10.1. This tutorial is the first comprehensive resource for health department staff to design and maintain a reportable communicable disease outbreak detection system using SaTScan to catalyze field investigations as well as develop intuition for interpreting results and fine-tuning the system. While our practical experience is limited to monitoring certain reportable diseases in a dense, urban area, we believe that most recommendations are generalizable to other jurisdictions in the United States and internationally.

However, historically, infectious diseases have long been known to affect certain communities to a greater extent than others. The mechanisms behind these differences are multifactorial, and lie less in biological susceptibility and instead more on socioeconomic factors and other social determinants of health. This article highlights health disparities in common infections such as respiratory syncytial virus, tuberculosis, HIV, syphilis, and influenza and will use lessons learned from previous pathogens and infectious disease disparities in vulnerable populations to provide context to the COVID-19 pandemic.",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,2022-Dec,"Kronman MP, Snowden JN",2,724,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36081357,Host-directed immunotherapy to fight infectious diseases.,"This review provides readers with examples of refractory infections due to inborn errors of immunity, highlighting how they may be successfully treated by deducing and targeting the underlying immunodeficiency. The use of host-directed immunotherapy to treat infectious disease in inborn errors of immunity is currently limited but growing. Different strategies include depleting the cellular reservoir for pathogens with restricted cell-tropism; augmenting the diminished effector response; and restoring molecular equipoise. The immunotherapies illustrated are existing drugs that have been re-purposed and rationally used, depending on the molecular or cellular impact of the mutation. As more biologic response modifiers and molecular targeted therapies are developed for other indications, they open the avenues for their use in inborn errors of immunity. Conversely, as more molecular pathways underlying defective immune responses and refractory infections are elucidated, they lend themselves to tractability with these emerging therapies. Infections that fail appropriate antimicrobial therapy are a harbinger of underlying inborn errors of immunity. Dissecting the mechanism by which the immune system fails provides opportunities to target the host response and make it succeed.",Current opinion in pediatrics,2022-Dec,"Langelier MJ, Vinh DC",2,1289,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36840828,Choosing Wisely internationally - helpful recommendations for antimicrobial stewardship!,"Antimicrobial resistance poses a major threat to human health globally and antibiotic overuse is a main driver of resistance. Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) was developed to improve the rationale use of antibiotics. The Choosing Wisely campaign was initiated to ameliorate medical practice through avoidance of unnecessary diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Our objective was to give an overview on the Choosing Wisely recommendations related to AMS practices from a selection of different countries in order to define future needs. We evaluated the seven countries already analyzed for Choosing Wisely recommendations related to topics of infectious medicine before. Finally, we included five of the former countries (Australia/New Zealand, Canada, Italy, Switzerland, and USA) and Germany with easily accessible recommendations and selected those related to six categories of AMS as following: diagnostics, indication, choice of antiinfective drugs, dosing, application and duration of therapy. In total, 213 recommendations could be extracted related to AMS for the six countries and were matched to the chosen categories. Interestingly, no recommendations were found for the category ""dosing."" Topics related to indication and diagnostics were most frequently found with 85 and 78 recommendations, respectively. Perioperative prophylaxis was a frequently addressed issue - both related to application, indication and duration. Avoiding antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and upper respiratory tract infections were central topics of all countries. AMS is an important strategy to fight increasing resistance and is frequently addressed by Choosing Wisely recommendations of different countries. Similar issues are considered important in the selected countries.",Infection,2023-Jun,"Jung N, Tometten L, Draenert R",3,1784,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Retrospective review. A combination of literature review and personal recollections are used. Although the broad term molecular diagnostics may encompass techniques to identify pathogens via protein or metabolomic signatures, this review concentrates on detection of pathogen nucleic acid as an indicator of infection. The introduction of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 1985 opened a new era in analysis of nucleic acids. This technique was soon applied to the detection of potential pathogen DNA and RNA, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites in infectious eye disease. Advances in PCR have allowed class-specific diagnostics (ie, pan-bacterial and pan-fungal), quantitation of pathogen DNA, and multiplexed testing. The Human Genome Project in the early 2000s greatly accelerated development of DNA sequencers, ushering in the era of ""Next Generation Sequencing"" and permitting pathogen-agnostic methods for the detection of potential infectious agents. Most recently, new technologies such as nanopore sequencing have reduced both cost and equipment requirements for whole-genome sequencing; when coupled with real-time sequence analysis methods, these methods offer the promise of true, real-time, point-of-service ocular infectious disease diagnostics. Molecular methods for pathogen detection have greatly advanced the diagnosis of ocular infectious disease. Further methodologic advances will have a direct impact on the management of these conditions.",American journal of ophthalmology,2022-Mar,Van Gelder RN,1,1573,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
34494873,Natural-Product-Based Solutions for Tropical Infectious Diseases.,"About half of the world's population and 80% of the world's biodiversity can be found in the tropics. Many diseases are specific to the tropics, with at least 41 diseases caused by endemic bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. Such diseases are of increasing concern, as the geographic range of tropical diseases is expanding due to climate change, urbanization, change in agricultural practices, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity. While traditional medicines have been used for centuries in the treatment of tropical diseases, the active natural compounds within these medicines remain largely unknown. In this review, we describe infectious diseases specific to the tropics, including their causative pathogens, modes of transmission, recent major outbreaks, and geographic locations. We further review current treatments for these tropical diseases, carefully consider the biodiscovery potential of the tropical biome, and discuss a range of technologies being used for drug development from natural resources. We provide a list of natural products with antimicrobial activity, detailing the source organisms and their effectiveness as treatment. We discuss how technological advancements, such as next-generation sequencing, are driving high-throughput natural product screening pipelines to identify compounds with therapeutic properties.

31610301,Smartphones as mobile microbiological laboratories.,"Point-of-care (POC) tests provide an alternative to traditional laboratory-based diagnostics due to reduced turnaround times, portability and no need for highly trained laboratory staff. Smartphones can be integrated into POC platforms because of their multifunctionality, enabled by high-quality digital cameras, computer processors, touchscreen interface and wireless data transfer. It is predicted that by 2020 about 80% of the world population will use smartphones. This review summarizes the current state of the art regarding smartphones as part of a mobile microbiological laboratory. Selected peer-reviewed publications on smartphone-based microbiological testing published between January 2015 and August 2019. Smartphones can be used as instrumental interfaces, dongles, microscopes or test result readers (brightfield, colorimetric and fluorescent measurements), or combined with amplification methods such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) tests in portable POC test platforms. Smartphone-based tests offer opportunities for microbiological diagnostics in remote areas and both resource-limited and resource-rich settings. Wireless connectivity may facilitate epidemiological studies and creation of spatiotemporal disease prevalence maps. However, the current analytical performance of many smartphone-based POC tests must be improved and carefully validated in clinical settings by comparison with current diagnostic standards. Recent developments in smartphone-based POC tests for infectious diseases are promising, as evidenced by results from many proof-of-concept studies.

39044662,A Digital Approach to Improve Infection Screening Among Solid Organ Transplant Candidates.,"Pretransplant infection screening (IS) of potential organ recipients is essential to optimal outcome of solid organ transplantation (SOT). A pre-post study was performed during 2020-2023 to investigate the impact of the STREAM (Solid organ TRansplant stEwArdship and Multidisciplinary approach) intervention to improve IS in SOT. The intervention, performed in 2022, included the implementation of IS through educational meetings, local guidelines, and the availability of a digital screening tool. The objective of the study was the assessment of IS completion, including a list of 17 laboratory tests and the investigation of vaccination status. The reduction of unnecessary tests was also analyzed. The test of proportions and a multilevel multivariate Poisson regression model were used to compare IS completion before and after STREAM. infectious diseases (ID) consultation and urgent evaluation were investigated as predictors of IS completion. A total of 171 patients were enrolled, including liver (44%), heart (32%), and kidney (24%) transplant candidates. Mean age was 56 ± 11 years, and most patients (77%) were males. Ninety-five (56%) patients were included before the intervention and 76 (44%) after STREAM. IS completion increased after STREAM (IRR 1.41, p < 0.001) with significant improvement recorded for seven (39%) IS items. Unnecessary tests decreased by 43% after the intervention. ID consultation (IRR 1.13, p = 0.02) and urgent evaluation (p = 0.68, p < 0.001) were predictors of IS improvement. STREAM was successful in improving IS completion.

34969106,The Role of Metagenomics and Next-Generation Sequencing in Infectious Disease Diagnosis.,"Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for pathogen detection is becoming increasingly available as a method to identify pathogens in cases of suspected infection. mNGS analyzes the nucleic acid content of patient samples with high-throughput sequencing technologies to detect and characterize microorganism DNA and/or RNA. This unbiased approach to organism detection enables diagnosis of a broad spectrum of infection types and can identify more potential pathogens than any single conventional test. This can lead to improved ability to diagnose patients, although there remains concern regarding contamination and detection of nonclinically significant organisms. We describe the laboratory approach to mNGS testing and highlight multiple considerations that affect diagnostic performance. We also summarize recent literature investigating the diagnostic performance of mNGS assays for a variety of infection types and recommend further studies to evaluate the improvement in clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of mNGS testing. The majority of studies demonstrate that mNGS has sensitivity similar to specific PCR assays and will identify more potential pathogens than conventional methods. While many of these additional organism detections correlate with the expected pathogen spectrum based on patient presentations, there are relatively few formal studies demonstrating whether these are true-positive infections and benefits to clinical outcomes. Reduced specificity due to contamination and clinically nonsignificant organism detections remains a major concern, emphasizing the importance of careful interpretation of the organism pathogenicity and potential association with the clinical syndrome. Further research is needed to determine the possible improvement in clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of mNGS testing.",Clinical chemistry,2021-Dec,"Miller S, Chiu C",2,1847,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36999909,A Broad Spectrum of Possibilities: Spectrum Scores as a Unifying Metric of Antibiotic Utilization.,"Days of therapy (DOT) currently serve as the standard antimicrobial utilization metric. However, by assigning the same weight to each agent rather than accounting for differences in spectrum of activity, DOT ignore key differences between agents that are fundamental to infectious diseases and critical to antimicrobial stewardship. Spectrum scoring assigns numeric values to individual antibiotic agents to quantify their spectrum of activity, allowing for the normalization of antibiotic utilization data. When used in conjunction with traditional metrics, spectrum scores may offer further clarity to antibiotic utilization; however, issues related to development, application, and standardization of spectrum scores remain. Despite these challenges, the potential applications of spectrum scores are vast. Here, we summarize existing data and explore the future of spectrum scoring, including application to both data analysis and routine patient care, use in inpatient and outpatient settings, integration within the electronic medical record, and opportunities for future research.",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2023-Jul,"Ilges D, Tande AJ, Stevens RW",3,1087,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35482218,Role of Climate Change in Changing Hepatic Health Maps.,"Climate change (CC) is currently responsible for global weather extremes. These weather extremes could contribute to changes in the pattern of health problems. The purpose of this review is to discuss the role of CC on remapping of hepatic diseases and the mechanisms of re-mapping. CC was found to have a major influence on the distribution and severity of hepatic diseases, such as outbreaks of vector-borne, water or food-borne, parasitic diseases, re-emerging of disappeared diseases, or emerging of new forms of infectious agents. Migration of infected people from endemic areas due to the CC disasters results in rapid dissemination of infectious diseases that leads to outbreaks or endemicity of diseases in new areas. CC could cause increasing chemical emissions, or change in its biodegradability, or restriction in its dispersion, such as PM, PAHs, heavy metals, mycotoxins, and aquatic toxins. Increase in the concentrations of these chemicals may have significant impacts in changing the health map of hepatic toxicity and liver cancer. The current review confirms the role of CC in changing the pattern of several liver health problems and remapping of these problems in several regions of the world. This review could be of high importance to the health decision-makers as an early alarm and prediction of hepatic health problems with the projected CC.",Current environmental health reports,2022-Jun,"Saad-Hussein A, Ramadan HK, Bareedy A, Elwakil R",4,1366,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We propose a Filippov epidemic model with nonlinear incidence to describe media's influence in the epidemic transmission process. Our proposed model extends existing models by introducing a threshold strategy to describe the effects of media coverage once the number of infected individuals exceeds a threshold. Meanwhile, we perform the stability of the equilibriua, boundary equilibrium bifurcation, and global dynamics. The system shows complex dynamical behaviors and eventually stabilizes at the equilibrium points of the subsystem or pseudo equilibrium. In addition, numerical simulation results show that choosing appropriate thresholds and control intensity can stop infectious disease outbreaks, and media coverage can reduce the burden of disease outbreaks and shorten the duration of disease eruptions.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2022-Jan,"Dong C, Xiang C, Qin W, Yang Y",4,1135,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

37349214,A mathematic equation derived from host-pathogen interactions elucidates the significance of integrating modern medicine with traditional Chinese medicine to treat infectious diseases.,"The prognosis of infectious diseases is determined by host-pathogen interactions. Control of pathogens has been the central dogma of treating infectious diseases in modern medicine, but the pathogen-directed medicine is facing significant challenges, including a lack of effective antimicrobials for newly emerging pathogens, pathogen drug resistance, and drug side effects. Here, a mathematic equation (termed equation of host-pathogen interactions, HPI-Equation) is developed to dissect the key variables of host-pathogen interactions. It shows that control of pathogens does not necessarily lead to host recovery. Instead, a combination of promoting a host's power of self-healing and balancing immune responses provides the best benefit for host. Moreover, the HPI-Equation elucidates the scientific basis of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a host-based medicine that treats infectious diseases by promoting self-healing power and balancing immune responses. The importance of self-healing power elucidated in the HPI-Equation is confirmed by recent studies that the tolerance mechanism, which is discovered in plants and animals and conceptually similar to self-healing power, improves host survival without directly attacking pathogens. In summary, the HPI-Equation describes host-pathogen interactions with mathematical logic and precision; it translates the ancient wisdoms of TCM into apprehensible modern sciences and opens a new venue for integrating TCM and modern medicine for a future medicine.

39231290,Epidemic spreading on mixing group with face-to-face interaction.,"The mixing groups gathered in the enclosed space form a complex contact network due to face-to-face interaction, which affects the status and role of different groups in social communication. The intricacies of epidemic spreading in mixing groups are intrinsically complicated. Multiple interactions and transmission add to the difficulties of understanding and forecasting the spread of infectious diseases in mixing groups. Despite the critical relevance of face-to-face interactions in real-world situations, there is a significant lack of comprehensive study addressing the unique issues of mixed groups, particularly those with complex face-to-face interactions. We introduce a novel model employing an agent-based approach to elucidate the nuances of face-to-face interactions within mixing groups. In this paper, we apply a susceptible-infected-susceptible process to mixing groups and integrate a temporal network within a specified time window to distinguish between individual movement patterns and epidemic spreading dynamics. Our findings highlight the significant impact of both the relative size of mixing groups and the groups' mixing patterns on the trajectory of disease spread within the mixing groups. When group sizes differ significantly, high inter-group contact preference limits disease spread. However, if the minority reduces their intra-group preferences while the majority maintains high inter-group contact, disease spread increases. In balanced group sizes, high intra-group contact preferences can limit transmission, but asymmetrically reducing any group's intra-group preference can lead to increased spread.","Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2024-Sep,"Gu W, Li W, Gao F, Su S, Zhang Z, Liu X, Wang W",7,1641,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

Testing capacity for epidemic-prone diseases is essential to enable rapid and accurate identification of causative agents, and for action to prevent disease spread. Moreover, testing is pivotal in monitoring disease transmission, evaluating public health interventions and informing targeted resource allocation during outbreaks. An online, self-assessment survey was conducted in African Union Member States to identify major challenges in testing for epidemic-prone diseases. The survey assessed current capacity for diagnosing priority epidemic-prone diseases at different laboratory levels. It explored challenges in establishing and maintaining testing capacity to improve outbreak response and mitigate public health impact. Survey data analysed diagnostic capacity for priority infectious diseases, diagnostic technologies in use, existing surveillance programmes and challenges limiting diagnostic capacity, by country. The survey result from 15 Member States who responded to the survey, showed high variability in testing capacity and technologies across countries and diverse factors limiting testing capacity for certain priority diseases like dengue and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. At the same time diagnostic capacity is better for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), polio, and measles due to previous investments. Unfortunately, many countries are not utilizing multiplex testing, despite its potential to improve diagnostic access. The challenges of limited laboratory capacity for testing future outbreaks are indeed significant. Recent disease outbreaks in Africa have underscored the urgent need to strengthen diagnostic capacity and introduce cost-effective technologies. Small sample sizes and differing disease prioritisation within each country limited the analysis.

It also varied according to the size of confirmed patients in the non-pharmaceutical intervention. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the contribution of frontline nurses to the policy and law revision on infectious diseases and suggest health and nursing policies for emerging infectious diseases in the future. This case evaluation study analyzed the significant policy decisions that nurses' roles brought on changes in the infectious disease response system in the Republic of Korea and applying the health system model and those capacities on resilience under emerging infectious diseases. Objective data that contributed directly to the revision of infectious disease-related Acts and policies in 2020 were collected and analyzed through literature search and information disclosure claims from the first to third waves of Coronavirus disease 2019 in one city. With the rapid outbreak of COVID-19 confirmed cases at the end of February 2020, a pan-government support group was formed and dispatched to D City. In addition, central quarantine officials worked with local quarantine officials to share real-time situations and find out on-site difficulties and support requests.

Each node follows its dynamic, which describes an epidemic spreading among individuals in an area, and the node also interacts with other nodes, which indicates the spreading among different areas. By giving mathematical proof, we deduce that our model has a stable solution despite the network structure. We propose the peak infected ratio (PIR) as a property of infectious diseases in a certain area, which is not independent of the network structure. We find that increasing the population mobility or the disease infectiousness both cause higher peak infected population all over different by simulation. Furthermore, we apply our model to real-world data on COVID-19 and after properly adjusting the parameters of our model, the distribution of the peak infection ratio in different areas can be well fitted.","Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",2022-Oct,"Li Q, Chen H, Li Y, Feng M, Kurths J",5,1247,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
33991293,Agent-based evolving network modeling: a new simulation method for modeling low prevalence infectious diseases.,"Agent-based network modeling (ABNM) simulates each person at the individual-level as agents of the simulation, and uses network generation algorithms to generate the network of contacts between individuals. ABNM are suitable for simulating individual-level dynamics of infectious diseases, especially for diseases such as HIV that spread through close contacts within intricate contact networks. However, as ABNM simulates a scaled-version of the full population, consisting of all infected and susceptible persons, they are computationally infeasible for studying certain questions in low prevalence diseases such as HIV. We present a new simulation technique, agent-based evolving network modeling (ABENM), which includes a new network generation algorithm, Evolving Contact Network Algorithm (ECNA), for generating scale-free networks. ABENM simulates only infected persons and their immediate contacts at the individual-level as agents of the simulation, and uses the ECNA for generating the contact structures between these individuals. All other susceptible persons are modeled using a compartmental modeling structure. Thus, ABENM has a hybrid agent-based and compartmental modeling structure. The ECNA uses concepts from graph theory for generating scale-free networks. Multiple social networks, including sexual partnership networks and needle sharing networks among injecting drug-users, are known to follow a scale-free network structure. Numerical results comparing ABENM with ABNM estimations for disease trajectories of hypothetical diseases transmitted on scale-free contact networks are promising for application to low prevalence diseases.",Health care management science,2021-Sep,"Eden M, Castonguay R, Munkhbat B, Balasubramanian H, Gopalappa C",5,1656,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37289931,The microbiological diagnostic performance of metagenomic next-generation sequencing in patients with infectious diseases.,"Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) can be used to detect pathogens in clinical infectious diseases through the sequencing analysis of microbial and host nucleic acids in clinical samples. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of mNGS in patients with infections. In this study, 641 patients with infectious diseases were enrolled. These patients simultaneously underwent pathogen detection by both mNGS and microbial culture. Through statistical analysis, we judged the diagnostic performance of mNGS and microbial culture on different pathogens. Among 641 patients, 276 cases of bacteria and 95 cases of fungi were detected by mNGS, whereas 108 cases of bacteria and 41 cases of fungi were detected by traditional cultures. Among all mixed infections, combined bacterial and viral infections were the highest (51%, 87/169), followed by combined bacterial with fungal infections (16.57%, 28/169) and mixed bacterial, fungal, and viral infections (13.61%, 23/169). Among all sample types, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples had the highest positive rate (87.8%, 144/164), followed by sputum (85.4%, 76/89) and blood samples (61.2%, 158/258). For the culture method, sputum samples had the highest positive rate (47.2%, 42/89), followed by BALF (37.2%, 61/164). The positive rate of mNGS was 69.89% (448/641), which was significantly higher than that of traditional cultures (22.31% [143/641]) (P < .05). Our results show that mNGS is an effective tool for the rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases. Compared with traditional detection methods, mNGS also showed obvious advantages in mixed infections and infections with uncommon pathogens.",Laboratory medicine,2024-Mar,"Yuan L, Zhu Q, Chen Q, Lai LM, Liu P, Liu Y",6,1675,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
36649706,Pathogen exposure misclassification can bias association signals in GWAS of infectious diseases when using population-based common control subjects.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been performed to identify host genetic factors for a range of phenotypes, including for infectious diseases. The use of population-based common control subjects from biobanks and extensive consortia is a valuable resource to increase sample sizes in the identification of associated loci with minimal additional expense. Non-differential misclassification of the outcome has been reported when the control subjects are not well characterized, which often attenuates the true effect size. However, for infectious diseases the comparison of affected subjects to population-based common control subjects regardless of pathogen exposure can also result in selection bias. Through simulated comparisons of pathogen-exposed cases and population-based common control subjects, we demonstrate that not accounting for pathogen exposure can result in biased effect estimates and spurious genome-wide significant signals. Further, the observed association can be distorted depending upon strength of the association between a locus and pathogen exposure and the prevalence of pathogen exposure. We also used a real data example from the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genetic consortium comparing HCV spontaneous clearance to persistent infection with both well-characterized control subjects and population-based common control subjects from the UK Biobank. We find biased effect estimates for known HCV clearance-associated loci and potentially spurious HCV clearance associations. These findings suggest that the choice of control subjects is especially important for infectious diseases or outcomes that are conditional upon environmental exposures.",American journal of human genetics,2023-Feb,"Duchen D, Vergara C, Thio CL, Kundu P, Chatterjee N, Thomas DL, Wojcik GL, Duggal P",8,1681,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

It is usually difficult to achieve both high accuracy and short error distance when we try to solve the problem. This study attempts to introduce the graph convolutional network for the problem of source identification in a given network with different infection rates. First, we put forward a label propagation framework, which can locate the infection source based on both infected and uninfected nodes. Then, a novel Source Identification Graph Convolutional Network (SIGN) framework is proposed inspired by label propagation. Third, we modify the classical cross-entropy loss function and presented neighborhood loss to optimize the average error distance. Finally, extensive experiments are performed on eight datasets with different topologies and varying infection sizes to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. We compare the proposed method with four mainstream approaches, and our method shows strong performances especially under the large infection size.",Journal of biomedical informatics,2021-Apr,"Li L, Zhou J, Jiang Y, Huang B",4,1124,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

39363687,Innate lymphoid cells and infectious diseases.,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are the main resident lymphocytes that mostly reside in tissues owing to the lack of adaptive antigen receptors. These cells are involved in early anti-infective immunity, antitumour immunity, regulation of tissue inflammation, and maintenance of homeostasis in the internal environment of tissues and have been referred to as the ""first armies stationed in the human body"". ILCs are widely distributed in the lungs, colon, lymph nodes, oral mucosa and even embryonic tissues. Due to the advantage of their distribution location, they are often among the first cells to come into contact with pathogens.Relevant studies have demonstrated that ILCs play an early role in the defence against a variety of pathogenic microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi and helminths, before they intervene in the adaptive immune system. ILCs can initiate a rapid, nonspecific response against pathogens prior to the initiation of an adaptive immune response and can generate a protective immune response against specific pathogens, secreting different effectors to play a role.There is growing evidence that ILCs play an important role in host control of infectious diseases. In this paper, we summarize and discuss the current known infectious diseases in which ILCs are involved and ILC contribution to the defence against infectious diseases. Further insights into the mechanisms of ILCs action in different infectious diseases will be useful in facilitating the development of therapeutic strategies for early control of infections.",Innate immunity,2024-Aug,"Yuan T, Zhou Q, Tian Y, Ou Y, Long Y, Tan Y",6,1561,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32341374,Algorithmic discovery of dynamic models from infectious disease data.,"Theoretical models are typically developed through a deductive process where a researcher formulates a system of dynamic equations from hypothesized mechanisms. Recent advances in algorithmic methods can discover dynamic models inductively-directly from data. Most previous research has tested these methods by rediscovering models from synthetic data generated by the already known model. Here we apply Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to discover mechanistic equations for disease dynamics from case notification data for measles, chickenpox, and rubella. The discovered models provide a good qualitative fit to the observed dynamics for all three diseases, However, the SINDy chickenpox model appears to overfit the empirical data, and recovering qualitatively correct rubella dynamics requires using power spectral density in the goodness-of-fit criterion. When SINDy uses a library of second-order functions, the discovered models tend to include mass action incidence and a seasonally varying transmission rate-a common feature of existing epidemiological models for childhood infectious diseases. We also find that the SINDy measles model is capable of out-of-sample prediction of a dynamical regime shift in measles case notification data. These results demonstrate the potential for algorithmic model discovery to enrich scientific understanding by providing a complementary approach to developing theoretical models.",Scientific reports,2020-Apr,"Horrocks J, Bauch CT",2,1445,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

We analyze the well-posedness of the model, investigate the existence and uniqueness of the nontrivial steady state corresponding to an endemic state, and study the local and global stability of this nontrivial steady state. Moreover, we discuss the asymptotic properties of the principal eigenvalue and nontrivial steady state with respect to the nonlocal diffusion rate. The analysis is carried out by using the theory of semigroups and the method of monotone and positive operators.

Although the method has been used for several decades to track other infectious diseases, there has not been a comprehensive review outlining all of the pathogens that have been surveilled through wastewater. Herein we identify the infectious diseases that have been previously studied via wastewater surveillance prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Infectious diseases and pathogens were identified in 100 studies of wastewater surveillance across 38 countries, as were themes of how wastewater surveillance and other measures of disease transmission were linked. Twenty-five separate pathogen families were identified in the included studies, with the majority of studies examining pathogens from the family Picornaviridae, including polio and nonpolio enteroviruses. Most studies of wastewater surveillance did not link what was found in the wastewater to other measures of disease transmission. Among those studies that did, the value reported varied by study. Wastewater surveillance should be considered as a potential public health tool for many infectious diseases. Wastewater surveillance studies can be improved by incorporating other measures of disease transmission at the population-level including disease incidence and hospitalizations.",American journal of epidemiology,2023-Feb,"Kilaru P, Hill D, Anderson K, Collins MB, Green H, Kmush BL, Larsen DA",7,1471,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

36979622,Multiplex Detection of Infectious Diseases on Microfluidic Platforms.,"Infectious diseases contribute significantly to the global disease burden. Sensitive and accurate screening methods are some of the most effective means of identifying sources of infection and controlling infectivity. Conventional detecting strategies such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), DNA sequencing, and mass spectrometry typically require bulky equipment and well-trained personnel. Therefore, mass screening of a large population using conventional strategies during pandemic periods often requires additional manpower, resources, and time, which cannot be guaranteed in resource-limited settings. Recently, emerging microfluidic technologies have shown the potential to replace conventional methods in performing point-of-care detection because they are automated, miniaturized, and integrated. By exploiting the spatial separation of detection sites, microfluidic platforms can enable the multiplex detection of infectious diseases to reduce the possibility of misdiagnosis and incomplete diagnosis of infectious diseases with similar symptoms. This review presents the recent advances in microfluidic platforms used for multiplex detection of infectious diseases, including microfluidic immunosensors and microfluidic nucleic acid sensors. As representative microfluidic platforms, lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) platforms, polymer-based chips, paper-based devices, and droplet-based devices will be discussed in detail. In addition, the current challenges, commercialization, and prospects are proposed to promote the application of microfluidic platforms in infectious disease detection.",Biosensors,2023-Mar,"Chen F, Hu Q, Li H, Xie Y, Xiu L, Zhang Y, Guo X, Yin K",8,1618,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

35162917,Predicting Infectious Diseases: A Bibliometric Review on Africa.,"Africa has a long history of novel and re-emerging infectious disease outbreaks. This reality has attracted the attention of researchers interested in the general research theme of predicting infectious diseases. However, a knowledge mapping analysis of literature to reveal the research trends, gaps, and hotspots in predicting Africa's infectious diseases using bibliometric tools has not been conducted. A bibliometric analysis of 247 published papers on predicting infectious diseases in Africa, published in the Web of Science core collection databases, is presented in this study. The results indicate that the severe outbreaks of infectious diseases in Africa have increased scientific publications during the past decade. The results also reveal that African researchers are highly underrepresented in these publications and that the United States of America (USA) is the most productive and collaborative country. The relevant hotspots in this research field include malaria, models, classification, associations, COVID-19, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, weather-based prediction using meteorological factors is an emerging theme, and very few studies have used the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) technologies. Therefore, there is a need to explore 4IR predicting tools such as machine learning and consider integrated approaches that are pivotal to developing robust prediction systems for infectious diseases, especially in Africa.

33303514,Achieving flexible competence: bridging the investment dichotomy between infectious diseases and cancer.,"Today's global health challenges in underserved communities include the growing burden of cancer and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs); infectious diseases (IDs) with epidemic and pandemic potential such as COVID-19; and health effects from catastrophic 'all hazards' disasters including natural, industrial or terrorist incidents. Healthcare disparities in low-income and middle-income countries and in some rural areas in developed countries make it a challenge to mitigate these health, socioeconomic and political consequences on our globalised society. As with IDs, cancer requires rapid intervention and its effective medical management and prevention encompasses the other major NCDs. Furthermore, the technology and clinical capability for cancer care enables management of NCDs and IDs. Global health initiatives that call for action to address IDs and cancer often focus on each problem separately, or consider cancer care only a downstream investment to primary care, missing opportunities to leverage investments that could support broader capacity-building. From our experience in health disparities, disaster preparedness, government policy and healthcare systems we have initiated an approach we call <i>flex-competence</i> which emphasises a systems approach from the outset of program building that integrates investment among IDs, cancer, NCDs and disaster preparedness to improve overall healthcare for the local community.

39176406,Possible counter-intuitive impact of local vaccine mandates for vaccine-preventable infectious diseases.,"We modeled the impact of local vaccine mandates on the spread of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, which in the absence of vaccines will mainly affect children. Examples of such diseases are measles, rubella, mumps, and pertussis. To model the spread of the pathogen, we used a stochastic SIR (susceptible, infectious, recovered) model with two levels of mixing in a closed population, often referred to as the household model. In this model, individuals make local contacts within a specific small subgroup of the population (e.g., within a household or a school class), while they also make global contacts with random people in the population at a much lower rate than the rate of local contacts. We considered what would happen if schools were given freedom to impose vaccine mandates on all of their pupils, except for the pupils that were exempt from vaccination because of medical reasons. We investigated first how such a mandate affected the probability of an outbreak of a disease. Furthermore, we focused on the probability that a pupil that was medically exempt from vaccination, would get infected during an outbreak. We showed that if the population vaccine coverage was close to the herd-immunity level, then both probabilities may increase if local vaccine mandates were implemented. This was caused by unvaccinated pupils possibly being moved to schools without mandates.",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,2024-Jul,"Donà M, Trapman P",2,1395,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

37392149,Estimating contact network properties by integrating multiple data sources associated with infectious diseases.,"To effectively mitigate the spread of communicable diseases, it is necessary to understand the interactions that enable disease transmission among individuals in a population; we refer to the set of these interactions as a contact network. The structure of the contact network can have profound effects on both the spread of infectious diseases and the effectiveness of control programs. Therefore, understanding the contact network permits more efficient use of resources. Measuring the structure of the network, however, is a challenging problem. We present a Bayesian approach to integrate multiple data sources associated with the transmission of infectious diseases to more precisely and accurately estimate important properties of the contact network. An important aspect of the approach is the use of the congruence class models for networks. We conduct simulation studies modeling pathogens resembling SARS-CoV-2 and HIV to assess the method; subsequently, we apply our approach to HIV data from the University of California San Diego Primary Infection Resource Consortium. Based on simulation studies, we demonstrate that the integration of epidemiological and viral genetic data with risk behavior survey data can lead to large decreases in mean squared error (MSE) in contact network estimates compared to estimates based strictly on risk behavior information. This decrease in MSE is present even in settings where the risk behavior surveys contain measurement error. Through these simulations, we also highlight certain settings where the approach does not improve MSE.",Statistics in medicine,2023-Sep,"Goyal R, Carnegie N, Slipher S, Turk P, Little SJ, De Gruttola V",6,1582,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

32594132,Presence of Antibodies Against Haemophilus influenzae Serotype a in Alaska Before and After the Emergence of Invasive Infections.,"Haemophilus influenzae bacteria can cause asymptomatic carriage and invasive disease. Haemophilus influenzae serotype a (Hia) is an emerging cause of invasive disease in Alaska, with greatest burden occurring among rural Alaska Native (AN) children. The first case of invasive Hia (iHia) in Alaska was reported in 2002; however, it is unclear how long the pathogen has been in Alaska. We quantified immunoglobulin G antibodies against Hia (anti-Hia) in 839 banked serum samples from Alaska residents, comparing antibody concentrations in samples drawn in the decades before (1980s and 1990s) and after (2000s) the emergence of iHia. We also assessed serum antibody concentration by age group, region of residence, and race. The anti-Hia was >0.1 µg/mL in 88.1% (348 of 395) and 91.0% (404 of 444) of samples from the decades prior and after the emergence of Hia, respectively (P = .17). No significant differences in antibody levels were detected between people from rural and urban regions (1.55 vs 2.08 µg/mL, P = .91 for age ≥5) or between AN and non-AN people (2.50 vs 2.60 µg/mL, P = .26). Our results are consistent with widespread Hia exposure in Alaska predating the first iHia case.

This qualitative analysis sought to understand the pre-market barriers and facilitators to scale-up infectious diseases POC testing in primary care settings at the national level. Key informant interviews were undertaken with people (n = 30) working in high- level positions relevant to infectious diseases POC testing in Australia. Participants were recruited from federal and state health departments, industry, and nongovernment national peak bodies. The Unitaid scalability framework informed this analysis to understand barriers and enablers to creating access conditions and establishing country readiness for market access of POC tests. Participants identified regulatory frameworks as significant barriers to market access. National strategies and advocacy were viewed as potential enablers to establishing country readiness. It was recommended that the national system for universal health care should fund infectious disease POC tests to ensure financial sustainability, though the existing pathology infrastructure was regarded as a likely inhibitor. Current regulatory frameworks inhibit market access for infectious disease POC testing devices for use in the primary care setting. National advocacy is urgently needed to gain government support and align national policies with regulatory frameworks.",BMC infectious diseases,2024-Nov,"Lafferty L, Applegate TL, Lewis S, Drysdale K, Monaghan R, Kelly-Hanku A, Guy R, Treloar C",8,1420,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

An intake of placebo, 200 mg, or 600 mg of LF were administered to healthy adults in Kyushu University of Health and Welfare for 12 weeks in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled parallel-group comparative trial. The primary endpoints were the prevalence and duration of infectious diseases and changes in immune parameters. Three hundred and ten subjects were randomized (placebo, n = 104; 200 mg, n = 103; 600 mg, n = 103). Twenty subjects were lost to the follow-up, leaving 290 for a full analysis set (n = 99; n = 95; n = 96). The duration (day) of total infectious diseases was shorter in the 200 mg group (2.0, p = 0.045) and 600 mg group (2.0, p = 0.010) than in the placebo group (3.0). The duration of summer colds was shorter in the 600 mg group (2.0, p = 0.036) than in the placebo group (3.0). No significant differences were observed in the prevalence of infectious diseases or changes in immune parameters. In exploratory investigations, changes in the neutrophil phagocytic capacity, cortisol concentrations, and T score of ""Vigor/Activity"" in the Profile of Mood States 2 were greater in the 600 mg group than in the placebo group, when analysis was done on the lower half groups at the baseline. Adverse events were similar in each group and none had a causal relationship with the intake of the test foods.

39178134,The Role of High-Level Isolation Units in Response to High-Consequence and Emerging Infectious Diseases: Experience of the German STAKOB Network.,"This case study describes the experience of the German Permanent Working Group of Competence and Treatment Centers for High Consequence Infectious Diseases, known as STAKOB (<i>Ständiger Arbeitskreis der Kompetenz- und Behandlungszentren für Krankheiten durch hochpathogene Erreger</i>). STAKOB brings together public health authorities (competence centers) and high-level isolation units (treatment centers) to collaborate on the clinical management of high-consequence infectious diseases (HCIDs) and emerging infectious diseases. The network is coordinated by the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's federal public health institute. The main tasks of STAKOB are to strengthen HCID clinical and public health management and increase expert knowledge on HCID and non-HCID emerging infectious diseases in Germany. STAKOB enables the exchange of knowledge and experiences; development of guidelines on infection prevention and control measures, clinical management, and therapy; and support for the World Health Organization and other outbreak responses internationally. The past years have shown how important the STAKOB network is for Germany-not only in providing critical care for HCID cases but also increasing capacity to support public health and clinical management of emerging infectious disease cases. However, maintaining several high-level isolation units in Germany requires a high commitment of financial, material, and human resources. Due to the rarity of HCID and emerging infectious disease events, maintaining the appropriate level of preparedness and ensuring sufficient investments is an ongoing struggle. Nevertheless, it is essential to have a network ready to react to HCID and non-HCID emerging infectious diseases in times of a changing biosecurity and infectious landscape.",Health security,2024-Sep,"Niebank M, Brockmann SO, Feldt T, Jensen BO, Jurke A, Mikolajewska A, Rothfuss K, Schauer J, Schmiedel S, Stegemann M, Tinnemann P, Uhrig A, Wolf T",13,1796,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

The earthquake damaged infrastructure supporting water, sanitation, and hygiene, and health-care facilities. The disruptions to epidemiological surveillance and ongoing disease control measures resulting from the earthquake will accelerate and expand ongoing and new outbreaks of many communicable diseases including measles, cholera, tuberculosis, and leishmaniasis. Investing in existing early warning and response network activities in the area is essential. Antimicrobial resistance, which had already been an increasing concern in Syria before the earthquake, will also be exacerbated given the high number of traumatic injuries and breakdown of antimicrobial stewardship, and the collapse of infection prevention and control measures. Tackling communicable diseases in this setting requires multisectoral collaboration at the human-animal-environment nexus given the effect of the earthquakes on all these sectors. Without this collaboration, communicable disease outbreaks will further strain the already overburdened health system and cause further harm to the population.",The Lancet.

Asia is the world's most populous, rapidly evolving and diverse continent, and it is already experiencing the effects of climate change. Climate change intersects with population, sociodemographic and geographical factors, amplifying the public health impact of infectious diseases and potentially widening existing disparities. In this narrative review, we outline the evidence of the impact of climate change on infectious diseases of importance in Asia, including vector-borne diseases, food- and water-borne diseases, antimicrobial resistance and other infectious diseases.

36971007,Severe Infection and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease: A Multicohort Study.,"The excess risk of cardiovascular disease associated with a wide array of infectious diseases is unknown. We quantified the short- and long-term risk of major cardiovascular events in people with severe infection and estimated the population-attributable fraction. We analyzed data from 331 683 UK Biobank participants without cardiovascular disease at baseline (2006-2010) and replicated our main findings in an independent population from 3 prospective cohort studies comprising 271 329 community-dwelling participants from Finland (baseline 1986-2005). Cardiovascular risk factors were measured at baseline. We diagnosed infectious diseases (the exposure) and incident major cardiovascular events after infections, defined as myocardial infarction, cardiac death, or fatal or nonfatal stroke (the outcome) from linkage of participants to hospital and death registers. We computed adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for infectious diseases as short- and long-term risk factors for incident major cardiovascular events. We also calculated population-attributable fractions for long-term risk. In the UK Biobank (mean follow-up, 11.6 years), 54 434 participants were hospitalized for an infection, and 11 649 had an incident major cardiovascular event at follow-up. Relative to participants with no record of infectious disease, those who were hospitalized experienced increased risk of major cardiovascular events, largely irrespective of the type of infection. This association was strongest during the first month after infection (HR, 7.87 [95% CI, 6.36-9.73]), but remained elevated during the entire follow-up (HR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.40-1.54]). The findings were similar in the replication cohort (HR, 7.64 [95% CI, 5.82-10.03] during the first month; HR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.34-1.48] during mean follow-up of 19.2 years). After controlling for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, the population-attributable fraction for severe infections and major cardiovascular events was 4.4% in the UK Biobank and 6.1% in the replication cohort. Infections severe enough to require hospital treatment were associated with increased risks for major cardiovascular disease events immediately after hospitalization. A small excess risk was also observed in the long-term, but residual confounding cannot be excluded.",Circulation,2023-May,"Sipilä PN, Lindbohm JV, Batty GD, Heikkilä N, Vahtera J, Suominen S, Väänänen A, Koskinen A, Nyberg ST, Meri S, Pentti J, Warren-Gash C, Hayward AC, Kivimäki M",14,2311,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32700561,Assessment of serum ferritin as a biomarker in COVID-19: bystander or participant? Insights by comparison with other infectious and non-infectious diseases.,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has an impact on all aspects of patient care. Serum ferritin generally represents a biomarker of choice when iron deficiency is suspected. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase-protein exhibiting elevated serum concentration in various inflammatory diseases. Here we focus on the role of serum ferritin for diagnostic and clinical management of patients with COVID-19 in comparison with other infectious and non-infectious diseases. We examined scientific articles listed in PubMed reporting on ferritin in various infectious and non-infectious diseases. We then compared these results with nine current COVID-19 ferritin reports published in 2020. Several non-infectious, as well as non-COVID-19 infectious diseases, are characterised by a partly dramatic elevation of serum ferritin levels. All COVID-19 studies published between February and May 2020, which documented laboratory serum ferritin, indicate ferritin as a biomarker of COVID-19 severity in hospitalised patients. Serum ferritin may be considered both a prognostic and stratifying biomarker that can also contribute to therapeutic decision-making concerning patients with COVID-19. It should be emphasised, however, that most scientific reports refer to cohorts in the Asian region. Further validation in other cohorts is urgently required.","Biomarkers : biochemical indicators of exposure, response, and susceptibility to chemicals",2020-Dec,"Kappert K, Jahić A, Tauber R",3,1379,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
37561743,A data-driven Markov process for infectious disease transmission.,"The 2019 coronavirus pandemic exudes public health and socio-economic burden globally, raising an unprecedented concern for infectious diseases. Thus, describing the infectious disease transmission process to design effective intervention measures and restrict its spread is a critical scientific issue. We propose a level-dependent Markov model with infinite state space to characterize viral disorders like COVID-19. The levels and states in this model represent the stages of outbreak development and the possible number of infectious disease patients. The transfer of states between levels reflects the explosive transmission process of infectious disease. A simulation method with heterogeneous infection is proposed to solve the model rapidly. After that, simulation experiments were conducted using MATLAB according to the reported data on COVID-19 published by Johns Hopkins. Comparing the simulation results with the actual situation shows that our proposed model can well capture the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases with and without imposed interventions and evaluate the effectiveness of intervention strategies. Further, the influence of model parameters on transmission dynamics is analyzed, which helps to develop reasonable intervention strategies. The proposed approach extends the theoretical study of mathematical modeling of infectious diseases and contributes to developing models that can describe an infinite number of infected persons.",PloS one,2023-,"Wang C, Mustafa S",2,1471,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35020724,Incidence of common infectious diseases in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic.,"Recent reports indicate that respiratory infectious diseases were suppressed during the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 led to behavioral changes aimed to control droplet transmission or contact transmission. In this study, we examined the incidence of common infectious diseases in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 data were extracted from the national data based on the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases (NESID). Common infectious diseases were selected from notifiable infectious diseases under the NESID. The epidemic activity of the diseases during 2015-2020 was evaluated based on the Infectious Disease Weekly Reports published by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. Each disease was then categorized according to the route of transmission. Many Japanese people had adopted hygienic activities, such as wearing masks and hand washing, even before the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the correlation between the time-series of disease counts of common infectious diseases and COVID-19 over time using cross-correlation analysis. The weekly number of cases of measles, rotavirus, and several infections transmitted by droplet spread, was negatively correlated with the weekly number of cases of COVID-19 for up to 20 weeks in the past. According to the difference-in-differences analysis, the activity of influenza and rubella was significantly lower starting from the second week in 2020 than that in 2015-2019. Only legionellosis was more frequent throughout the year than in 2015-2019. Lower activity was also observed in some contact transmitted, airborne-transmitted, and fecal-oral transmitted diseases. However, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, exanthema subitum, showed the same trend as that over the previous 5 years. In conclusion, our study shows that public health interventions for the COVID-19 pandemic may have effectively prevented the transmission of most droplet-transmitted diseases and those transmitted through other routes.",PloS one,2022-,"Hibiya K, Iwata H, Kinjo T, Shinzato A, Tateyama M, Ueda S, Fujita J",7,2037,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32807876,Advances in nanomaterial vaccine strategies to address infectious diseases impacting global health.,"Despite the overwhelming success of vaccines in preventing infectious diseases, there remain numerous globally devastating diseases without fully protective vaccines, particularly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria and tuberculosis. Nanotechnology approaches are being developed both to design new vaccines against these diseases as well as to facilitate their global implementation. The reasons why a given pathogen may present difficulties for vaccine design are unique and tied to the co-evolutionary history of the pathogen and humans, but there are common challenges that nanotechnology is beginning to help address. In each case, a successful vaccine will need to raise immune responses that differ from the immune responses raised by normal infection. Nanomaterials, with their defined compositions, commonly modular construction, and length scales allowing the engagement of key immune pathways, collectively facilitate the iterative design process necessary to identify such protective immune responses and achieve them reliably. Nanomaterials also provide strategies for engineering the trafficking and delivery of vaccine components to key immune cells and lymphoid tissues, and they can be highly multivalent, improving their engagement with the immune system. This Review will discuss these aspects along with recent nanomaterial advances towards vaccines against infectious disease, with a particular emphasis on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.",Nature nanotechnology,2021-Apr,"Fries CN, Curvino EJ, Chen JL, Permar SR, Fouda GG, Collier JH",6,1471,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
32544167,Coupling the circadian rhythms of population movement and the immune system in infectious disease modeling.,"The dynamics of infectious diseases propagating in populations depends both on human interaction patterns, the contagion process and the pathogenesis within hosts. The immune system follows a circadian rhythm and, consequently, the chance of getting infected varies with the time of day an individual is exposed to the pathogen. The movement and interaction of people also follow 24-hour cycles, which couples these two phenomena. We use a stochastic metapopulation model informed by hourly mobility data for two medium-sized Chinese cities. By this setup, we investigate how the epidemic risk depends on the difference of the clocks governing the population movement and the immune systems. In most of the scenarios we test, we observe circadian rhythms would constrain the pace and extent of disease emergence. The three measures (strength, outward transmission and introduction speeds) are highly correlated with each other. For example of the Yushu City, outward transmission speed and introduction speed are correlated with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.83, and the speeds correlate to strength with coefficients of -0.85 and -0.75, respectively (all have p < 0.05), in simulations with no circadian effect and R0 = 1.5. The relation between the circadian rhythms of the immune system and daily routines in human mobility can affect the pace and extent of infectious disease spreading. Shifting commuting times could mitigate the emergence of outbreaks.",PloS one,2020-,"Du Z, Holme P",2,1469,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41
35470930,Strategies for managing marine disease.,"The incidence of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) has increased in wildlife populations in recent years and is expected to continue to increase with global environmental change. Marine diseases are relatively understudied compared with terrestrial diseases but warrant parallel attention as they can disrupt ecosystems, cause economic loss, and threaten human livelihoods. Although there are many existing tools to combat the direct and indirect consequences of EIDs, these management strategies are often insufficient or ineffective in marine habitats compared with their terrestrial counterparts, often due to fundamental differences between marine and terrestrial systems. Here, we first illustrate how the marine environment and marine organism life histories present challenges and opportunities for wildlife disease management. We then assess the application of common disease management strategies to marine versus terrestrial systems to identify those that may be most effective for marine disease outbreak prevention, response, and recovery. Finally, we recommend multiple actions that will enable more successful management of marine wildlife disease emergencies in the future. These include prioritizing marine disease research and understanding its links to climate change, improving marine ecosystem health, forming better monitoring and response networks, developing marine veterinary medicine programs, and enacting policy that addresses marine and other wildlife diseases. Overall, we encourage a more proactive rather than reactive approach to marine wildlife disease management and emphasize that multidisciplinary collaborations are crucial to managing marine wildlife health.",Ecological applications : a publication of the Ecological Society of America,2022-Oct,"Glidden CK, Field LC, Bachhuber S, Hennessey SM, Cates R, Cohen L, Crockett E, Degnin M, Feezell MK, Fulton-Bennett HK, Pires D, Poirson BN, Randell ZH, White E, Gravem SA",15,1698,infectious_diseases,2025-11-02 18:32:41

37837983,Overcoming publication and dissemination bias in infectious diseases clinical trials.,"Non-timely reporting, selective reporting, or non-reporting of clinical trial results are prevalent and serious issues. WHO mandates that summary results be available in registries within 12 months of study completion and published in full text within 24 months. However, only a limited number of clinical trials in infectious diseases, including those done during the COVID-19 pandemic, have their results posted on ClinicalTrials.gov. An analysis of 50 trials of eight antiviral drugs tested against COVID-19 with a completion date of at least 2 years ago revealed that only 18% had their results published in the registry, with 40% not publishing any results. Non-timely and non-reporting practices undermine patient participation and are ethically unacceptable. Strategies should include obligatory reporting of summary results within 12 months in clinical trial registries, with progress towards peer-reviewed publication within 24 months indicated. Timely publication of research papers should be encouraged through an automated flagging mechanism in clinical trial registries that draws attention to the status of results reporting, such as a green tick for trials that have reported summary results within 12 months and a red tick in case of failure to do so. We propose the inclusion of mandatory clinical trial reporting standards in the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines, which should prohibit sponsor contract clauses that restrict reporting (referred to as gag clauses) and require timely reporting of results as part of the ethics committees' clearance process for clinical trial protocols.",The Lancet.
